40|$|Aims: To {{characterize}} {{the interaction of}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and S. minor with strains of the mycoparasite and commercial biocontrol agent Coniothyrium minitans using novel perfusion <b>chamber</b> <b>gasket</b> co-culture. Methods and Results: Sclerotinia were cultured in perfusion chamber gaskets and then flooded with Coniothyrium conidia. After germination, Coniothyrium failed to show any form of directed growth, making contact with Sclerotinia hyphae in a random manner. In turn, some Coniothyrium hyphae coiled round Sclerotinia counterparts and although no intracellular growth was observed, Coniothyrium proliferated, while the hyphae of Sclerotinia became vacuolated and lost the cytoplasm. When co-cultures of Sclerotinia with Coniothyrium were flooded with FITC-lectins, small difference in fluorescence between the fungi was found with FITC-Con A suggesting that cell walls of both the species exposed mannose. In contrast, Coniothyrium fluoresced poorly in comparison with Sclerotinia when FITC-wheat germ agglutinin was used, indicating a marked paucity of N-acetylglucosamine exposure by cell walls of Coniothyrium, hence reduced exposure to chitinolytic enzyme action. Conclusions, Significance and Impact of the Study: The approach employed supported direct sequential microscopic observation of Coniothyrium and Sclerotinia {{as well as the}} utilization of representative fluorescent moieties to characterize relative carbohydrate cell wall exposure. ...|$|E
40|$|The push-in {{chamber and}} <b>chambers</b> with {{alternative}} <b>gaskets</b> were tested under fi eld conditions {{in order to}} estimate the rates of under- or overestimation of the CO 2 effl uxes measured with chambers placed directly on a soil surface (without collars). Th e experiment was conducted on a spring barley fi eld which was harvested just before the measuring campaign. Th e following were tested: 1) a pushed-in chamber with a sharp metal blade installed {{on the edge of}} the chamber walls which was inserted to a depth of 1 – 2 cm to the soil, 2) a chamber with a 10 cm wide and 3 cm high rubber gasket, and 3) a chamber with a 10 cm wide and 2 cm high neoprene gasket. Th e results indicated that the application of the pushed-in chamber led to overestimation of the fl uxes by 55 %, while application of <b>chambers</b> with alternative <b>gaskets</b> led to underestimation of the fl uxes by 30 – 40 % due to the leakage of the gas from the chamber headspace through holes beneath the gaskets. Our experiment confi rmed that soil frames should be applied in fi eld conditions to assure the tightness of the chambers. Other tested solutions increase the biases of the chamber measurements and increase the uncertainties of the estimated CO 2 effl uxes...|$|R
50|$|Outgassing {{can also}} be reduced simply by {{desiccation}} prior to vacuum pumping.High vacuum systems generally require metal <b>chambers</b> with metal <b>gasket</b> seals such as Klein flanges or ISO flanges, rather than the rubber gaskets more common in low vacuum chamber seals. The system must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing. All materials, solid or liquid, have a small vapour pressure, and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure. As a result, many materials that work well in low vacuums, such as epoxy, will {{become a source of}} outgassing at higher vacuums.With these standard precautions, vacuums of 1 mPa are easily achieved with an assortment of molecular pumps. With careful design and operation, 1 µPa is possible.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} current and prospective applications of Ni 3 Al based intermetallic alloys—modern engineering materials with special properties that are potentially useful for both structural and functional purposes. The bulk components manufactured from these materials are intended mainly for forging dies, furnace assembly, turbocharger components, valves, and piston head of internal combustion engines. The Ni 3 Al based alloys produced by a directional solidification are also considered as a material for the fabrication of jet engine turbine blades. Moreover, development of composite materials with Ni 3 Al based alloys as a matrix hardened by, e. g., TiC, ZrO 2, WC, SiC and graphene, is also reported. Due to special physical and chemical properties; {{it is expected that}} these materials in the form of thin foils and strips should make a significant contribution to the production of high tech devices, e. g., Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or Microtechnology-based Energy and Chemical Systems (MECS); as well as heat exchangers; microreactors; micro-actuators; components of combustion <b>chambers</b> and <b>gasket</b> of rocket and jet engines as well components of high specific strength systems. Additionally, their catalytic properties may find an application in catalytic converters, air purification systems from chemical and biological toxic agents or in a hydrogen “production” by a decomposition of hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of leaf gas-exchange {{characteristics}} using stan¬dard clamp-on leaf chambers {{are prone}} to errors because of diffusion leaks. While some consideration {{has been given to}} CO 2 diffusion leaks, potential water vapour diffusion leaks through <b>chamber</b> <b>gaskets</b> have been neglected. We esti¬mated diffusion leaks of two clamp-on Li-Cor LI- 6400 (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) leaf chambers with polymer foam gaskets and enclosing either 2 or 6 cm 2 leaf area, and conducted a sensitivity analysis of the diffusion leak effects on Farquhar et al. photosynthesis model parameters – the maximum carboxylase activity of ribulose 1 • 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Vcmax), capacity for photosynthetic electron transport (Jmax) and non¬photorespiratory respiration rate in light (Rd). In addition, net assimilation rate (An) versus intercellular CO 2 (Ci) responses were measured in leaves of Mediterranean ever¬green species Quercus ilex L. enclosing the whole leaf chamber in a polyvinyl ﬂuoride bag ﬂushed with the exhaust air of leaf chamber, thereby effectively reducing the CO 2 and water vapour gradients between ambient air and leaf chamber. For the empty chambers, average diffusion leak for CO 2, KCO 2, (molar ﬂow rate corresponding to unit CO 2 mole fraction difference) was ca. 0. 40 mmol s- 1. KCO 2 increased ca. 50 % if a dead leaf was clamped between the leaf chamber. Average diffusion leak for H 2 O was ca. 5 -to 10 -fold larger than the diffusion leak for CO 2. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the consequence of a CO 2 dif¬fusion leak was apparent enhancement of An at high CO 2 mole fraction and reduction at lower CO 2 mole fraction, and overall compression of Ci range. As the result of these modiﬁcations, Farquhar et al. model parameters were over¬estimated. The degree of overestimation increased in the order of Vcmax < Jmax < Rd, and was larger for smaller cham¬bers and for leaves with lower photosynthetic capacity, leading to overestimation of all three parameters by 70 – 290 % for 2 cm 2, and by 10 – 60 % for 6 cm 2 chamber. Sig¬niﬁcant diffusion corrections (5 – 36 %) were even required for leaves with high photosynthetic capacity measured in largest chamber. Water vapour diffusion leaks further enhanced the overestimation of model parameters. For small chambers and low photosynthetic capacities, apparent Ci was simulated to decrease with increasing An because of simultaneous CO 2 and H 2 O diffusion leaks. Measurements in low photosynthetic capacity Quercus ilex leaves enclosed in 2 cm 2 leaf chamber exhibited negative apparent Ci values at highest An. For the same leaves measured with the entire leaf chamber enclosed in the polyvinyl ﬂuoride bag, Ci and An increased monotonically. While the measurements without the bag could be corrected for diffusion leaks, the required correction in An and transpiration rates was 100 – 500 %, and there was large uncertainty in Farquhar et al. model parameters derived from ‘corrected’ An/Ci response curves because of uncertainties in true diffusion leaks. These data demonstrate that both CO 2 and water vapour diffusion leaks need consideration in measurements with clamp-on leaf cuvettes. As plants in natural environments are often characterized by low photosynthetic capacities, cuvette designs need to be improved for reliable measure¬ments in such species. JRC.
