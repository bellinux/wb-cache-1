40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of informal kinship care in addressing the emotional needs and mental health, along with relationships, of school-age <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind in rural China. Rural–urban migration in China has caused many rural <b>children</b> to be <b>left</b> behind in their local communities. Based on semi-structured interview data, this article explores Confucianism’s impact on Chinese kin caregivers’ understandings of children’s needs and their childrearing practices to address these needs. Through the lens of attachment theory, this study identified a close affective bond between <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind and their kin caregivers. This relationship is underpinned by kin caregivers’ high commitment and love for children, and the Confucian concept of ‘benevolence’. It not only provides <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind {{with a sense of}} belonging, it also alleviates their trauma/grief due to separation from their parent...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, China has {{undergone}} {{one of the}} largest rural-to-urban migrations in human history, with many <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind because of parental migration. We present a meta-analytic review of empirical studies on Chinese children's rural-to-urban migration and on rural <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind because of parental migration. We examine how these events relate to children's emotional, social, and academic developmental outcomes. We include publications in English and in Chinese to uncover and quantify a part of the research literature that has been inaccessible to most Western scholars in the field of child and family studies. Overall, both migrant <b>children</b> and <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind by migrant parents in China show significantly less favorable functioning across domains than other Chinese children. It appears that, similar to processes found {{in other parts of the}} world, the experience of economic and acculturation stress as well as disrupted parent-child relations constitute a risk for nonoptimal child functioning in the Chinese context. Further, we found evidence for publication bias against studies showing less favorable development for migrant <b>children</b> and <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind. We discuss the results in terms of challenges to Chinese society and to future empirical research on Chinese family life...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the psychological and}} behavioral status and their influencing factors of <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind in rural areas in China, 604 students were chosen from primary fifth grade, junior second grade and senior first grade in high schools in local villages and towns of Chongqing and Guizhou to complete some investegations. The results showed that <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind actually had some internalizing problems including depression, state-trait anxiety, social anxiety, low self-esteem and some social problems in campus; however, they had no delinquency or aggression behaviors. Low parents’ educational level, low life standards, no-good parent-child relationship, the long years parent spent outside, the long time parent spent outside every year, the young age of child when his parent left him, the low contact frequency between parent and child when parent went out for work, all can be the influencing factors made child behave some psychological or behavioral problems. <b>Children</b> <b>left</b> behind need some appropriate psychological intervention, to improve parent-child relationship, to help release internalizing problems and amend interpersonal relationship at school. Several advices {{may be useful to}} improve psychological and behavioral problems of <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind, which are for parents who work outside home not to work long to 10 years, or stay out for work more than 10 months per year, or <b>left</b> <b>child</b> to work when he is younger than two years old, or contact child more than one month after the last contact when work outside home, and you’d better contact child once a day. All of these could be helpful for <b>children</b> <b>left</b> behind to overcome some psychological or behavioral problems. 本论文为了研究我国农村留守儿童的心理行为现状及其影响因素，在重庆、贵州两地的八所乡镇中小学选取了小学五年级、初中二年级、高中一年级共 604 名留守儿童与非留守儿童，进行心理行为及相关因素的调查。结果发现农村留守儿童存在一定程度的包括抑郁、状态－特质焦虑、社交焦虑、低自尊在内的内化问题和校园人际关系问题，但没有发现有违纪与攻击行为问题。父母受教育程度低、家庭生活水平低、亲子关系不良、父母外出打工年数长、每年外出打工时间长、外出打工时儿童的年龄小、在外打工时与儿童联系的频率低可能是使留守儿童产生心理行为问题的影响因素。留守儿童需要进行有针对性的心理干预，改善其亲子关系，促进其内化问题与校园人际关系的改善。建议父母外出打工年数不要超过 10 年、每年外出打工时间不要长于 10 个月、在儿童的年龄小于 2 岁时不要外出打工，在外打工时与儿童联系的频率不要超过 1 个月一次，最好每天一次，可能有效缓解留守儿童可能出现的心理行为问题...|$|R
