40|$|Background. A serious life {{event is}} likely to shape {{attributions}} relating <b>to</b> <b>symptoms</b> experienced afterwards. While they may {{play an important role}} in prognosis and seeking care, such perceptions have hardly been studied among survivors of a disaster. Objective. To investigate the association between self-reported health problems that have been attributed to an extreme life event and the <b>symptoms</b> presented <b>to</b> GPs. Methods. A two-wave longitudinal survey (2 – 3 weeks and 18 months) among survivors of a fireworks disaster was combined with a continuous morbidity surveillance in general practice. <b>Symptoms</b> attributed <b>to</b> the disaster reported in an open-ended question in the two waves were analysed using descriptive statistics. Differences in presented symptoms over time were analysed using logistic multilevel analysis. Results. More than half of the respondents reported health problems, which were, in their opinion, related to the disaster. Psychological problems were most frequently reported in association with the disaster, and in contrast <b>to</b> physical attributed <b>symptoms,</b> presentation of these problems in general practice decreased over time. In the total sample, musculoskeletal symptoms were less frequently presented in the longer term. Survivors who attributed <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> the disaster at both waves or after 18 months only most often presented such <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> the GP. Conclusion. Survivors attributed psychological problems and physical <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> the disaster at short-term and midterm post-disaster. Most of these survivors presented such <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> the GP. Attribution of <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> an extreme life event such as a disaster may therefore require special attention from the GP. (aut. ref...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Not {{only the}} {{occurrence}} of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has increased with time, {{but it has also}} {{emerged as one of the}} most life threatening conditions, when not treated timely. Timely treatment of ACS largely depends upon early symptom recognition, which includes patients 2 ̆ 7 ability <b>to</b> attribute their <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> the cardiac origin and their ability <b>to</b> perceive their <b>symptoms</b> as very urgent to be treated. Attribution to the heart and perception of urgency becomes even more difficult to achieve in case of atypical presentation of ACS. The objective of this study was <b>to</b> compare ACS <b>symptom</b> attribution and perception of urgency between genders. Methodology: This comparative, cross-sectional study was conducted on 249 ACS patients at the Aga Khan University Hospital and at the Karachi Institute of Heart Diseases, between February and April, 2011. Data was collected through the modified ‘Response <b>to</b> <b>Symptoms</b> Questionnaire’, and it was analyzed using comparative analyses. Results: Chest pain and palpitations were the most frequently attributed <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> a cardiac problem; whereas, epigastric pain was the <b>symptom</b> least attributed <b>to</b> cardiac problem, by both men and women. The comparative analysis showed that a similar proportion of men and women attributed the <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> a cardiac problem; no significant difference was found between the genders in attribution of any of the <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> a cardiac problem. Significant difference was found between men and women in terms of perceived urgency for the treatment of dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, sweating, palpitations, and ghabrahat (fidgetiness). More men than women perceived these <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> be very urgent for treatment. Conclusion: Overall, few men and women were able <b>to</b> attribute their <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> the cardiac origin, especially atypical symptoms were the least attributed to the cardiac problem; however, significantly more men than women perceived their ACS <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> be very urgent for treatment.

40|$|Abstract:Background: Premenstrual {{syndrome}} (PMS) is a {{group of}} physical and psychological symptoms experienced by some females of reproductive age during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle (Day 14 to Day 1 of the next menstruation cycle). PMS is characterised by breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, headaches, food cravings and swelling of the extremities, irritability, depression, anxiety, social withdrawal and memory changes. These symptoms may interfere with females’ daily activities, increase absenteeism from work and affect relationships. The aetiology appears to be multifactorial, including behaviour, diet, genetics, physical activity and excessive alcohol consumption. Conventional pharmacological drugs used <b>to</b> treat/alleviate <b>symptoms</b> may have side-effects and may interact negatively with other medications. Given the difficulty of finding the right homoeopathic remedy for a given individual and condition, this study proposes using the Grant Bentley Method (GBM) of Homoeopathic Facial Analysis (HFA) to choose remedies for women suffering from PMS. The GBM relies on homoeopathic case-taking, photographs of facial features and repertorisation to determine a person’s dominant miasmatic group to help select specific homoeopathic remedies. Prior research indicates that using individualised homoeopathic treatment in PMS is effective, but no prior studies have considered homoeopathic treatment using the GBM of HFA on women with PMS. Aim: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of individualised homoeopathic treatment, using the GBM of HFA on females experiencing PMS by means of case studies and a daily self-grading PMS <b>symptom</b> grading <b>chart.</b> Methodology: A 12 -week case study was done on ten females (aged 18 to 40 years) who met the study’s inclusion and exclusion criteria. Volunteers recruited via posters on the Doornfontein Campus of the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, were screened for inclusion. Participation information was explained, and volunteers signed a consent form and a medical photograph consent form. Participants’ individual homoeopathic case histories were recorded, and nine photographs (not published) were taken of each participant’s facial features from different angles to determine their dominant miasmatic group according to the GBM. During the first consultation (and if necessary in a follow-up consultation), appropriate physical examinations were done. Findings were recorded. Participants were given a monthly self-grading PMS <b>symptom</b> <b>chart</b> <b>to</b> grade <b>symptoms</b> daily throughout the study. During the first month, there was no treatment, in order to establish a baseline of symptoms. At follow [...] ...|$|R

Associations between medical symptoms and UNGD have been minimally explored. The objective of this descriptive study is to explore whether shale region Pennsylvania residents perceive UNGD as a health concern and whether they attribute health <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> UNGD exposures. A questionnaire was administered to adult volunteers with medical complaints in a primary-care medical office in a county where UNGD was present. Participants were asked whether {{they were concerned about}} health effects from UNGD, and whether they attributed current <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> UNGD or to some other environmental exposure. There were 72 respondents; 22 % perceived UNGD as a health concern and 13 % attributed medical <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> UNGD exposures. Overall, 42 % attributed one or more of their medical <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> environmental causes, of which UNGD was the most frequent. A medical record review conducted on six participants who attributed their medical <b>symptoms</b> <b>to</b> UNGD revealed that only one of these records documented both the symptoms in question and the attribution to UNGD. The results of this pilot study suggest that there is substantial concern about adverse health effects of UNGD among Pennsylvania Marcellus Shale residents, and that these concerns may not be adequately represented in medical records. Further efforts to determine the relationship between UNGD and health are recommended in order to address community concerns...|$|R
