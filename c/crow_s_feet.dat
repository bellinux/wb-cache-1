Approaches were flown using a head-down synthetic vision display to evaluate four tunnel ("minimal", "box", "dynamic pathway", "dynamic crow s feet") and three guidance ("ball", "tadpole", "follow-me aircraft") concepts and compare their efficacy to a baseline condition (i. e., no tunnel, ball guidance). The {{results showed that}} the tunnel concepts significantly improved pilot performance and situation awareness and lowered workload compared to the baseline condition. The dynamic <b>crow</b> <b>s</b> <b>feet</b> tunnel and follow-me aircraft guidance concepts were found to be the best candidates for future synthetic vision head-down displays.

40|$|NASA Langley Research Center has {{actively}} pursued {{the development and}} the use of pictorial or three-dimensional perspective displays of tunnel-, pathway- or highway-in-the-sky concepts for presenting flight path information to pilots in all aircraft categories (e. g., transports, General Aviation, rotorcraft) since the late 1970 s. Prominent among these efforts has been the development of the <b>crow</b> <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> tunnel concept. The crow's foot tunnel concept emerged as the consensus pathway concept from a series of interactive workshops that brought together government and industry display designers, test pilots, and airline pilots to iteratively design, debate, and fly various pathway concepts. Over years of use in many simulation and flight test activities at NASA and elsewhere, modifications have refined and adapted the tunnel concept for different applications and aircraft categories (i. e., conventional transports, High Speed Civil Transport, General Aviation). A description of those refinements follows the definition of the original tunnel concept...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of Metsuke on judo {{throwing}} techniques. Metsuke is a term in Budo, which means how to pay attention to the opponent. Two kinds of Metsuke were employed in the experiments. One of the Metsuke was to pay attention to the whole of the opponent putting the center of the view to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 s chest, and the other was to pay close attention to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> Speed and sense of the throwing techniques were analyzed between the two Metsuke.

Five-point rating scales evaluated sense of the throwing techniques, which was strength and uncomfortable feeling. Participants were skillful judo players who participated in the national collegiate judo championships. The results demonstrated that two kinds of Metsuke influenced the sense and did not influence the speed of the throwing techniques in skillful judo players. Participants felt stronger and smoother throwing when they used Metsuke paying attention to the whole of the opponent than to the opponent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> The findings imply that Metsuke instruction influences skill improvement of throwing techniques...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a gait rehabilitation system with a locomotion interface (LI) for training patients to climb stairs. The LI consists of two 2 -DOF manipulators equipped with footpads. These can move the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>feet</b> while his or her body remains stationary. The footpads follow the prerecorded motion of the feet of healthy individuals. For gait training, the patient progresses sequentially through successively more advanced modes. In this study, two modes, the enforced climbing of stairs and interactive climbing of stairs, were developed. In the interactive mode, foot pressure sensors are used to realize interactive walking. Comparisons were made between the modes for healthy individuals and a patient. The effectiveness of the system was examined using electromyography (EMG) and foot pressure data...|$|R

Galvanized and cold-formed steel tube specimens with L/D ratio of 2 to 12 were tested. It was observed that for specimens with L/D ratio of 2 and 4, the compressive failure occurred due to local elephant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> buckling. However, the compressive failure mode changed to global buckling for specimens with L/D ratio ≥ 6.

40|$|The ankle foot {{orthotic}} (AFO) {{has been around}} for centuries. They were created to augment functionality of an ankle damaged due to injury or disease. A common reason a patient might be prescribed an AFO is a condition called foot drop. Foot drop can be caused by many conditions, but the most common reason is a stroke. Foot drop can be characterized by the inability to raise and/or lower a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot.</b> This incapacitation of the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> leads to unnatural gaits and joint fatigue, as well as increasing the patient 2 ̆ 7 s likelihood of tripping and becoming seriously injured. Hard plastic AFOs that hold a patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>foot</b> in a neutral position are the current standard for combating foot drop. These AFOs come in many different shapes and sizes, which emphasizes the wide variety in functionality of someone with foot drop. Unfortunately, the restrictive nature of the AFO can cause unnatural movements in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s foot; these unnatural tendencies are more exaggerated when walking down stairs and ramps, as the natural gait is to land toe first, the opposite of what the brace allows the patient to do. The purpose of this project is to create a sensor system for an AFO to help identify varying terrain. In the future this information can then be made to control an active AFO. Each terrain type will be first measured by a pair of simple infrared range finder, attached on the lower leg, one range finder looks ahead of the user and the other looks straight down at the ground. Models for the ground conditions can be established by representing each with Fourier series created using RANdom Sample Consensus (RANSAC). RANSAC coefficients will be scaled off the rate of data coming in and gait speed. Each model has a period term so the data can easily be scaled to match the pattern of walking regardless of pace. Gait speed will be measured using the downward facing ankle-mounted rangefinder, but with a threshold to determine when the foot is in contact with the ground. Once this initial set-up is completed, the system can take in data live and provide a prediction of the type of ground the patient is walking over, using pattern recognition techniques. The hope for this project is that if the system can accurately predict the change in ground type from, for example, level walking to walking down a ramp, an AFO could then be made to adjust itself, giving the patient a more natural gait, even when encountering adverse conditions. A byproduct of constantly using a patient 2 ̆ 7 s own gait to measure ground type is the ability to track a patient 2 ̆ 7 s changing gait over time, giving therapists a valuable new tool for tracking progress in a patient...|$|R

40|$|Leg-hold traps are an {{important}} tool in selectively capturing coyotes (Canis latrans) causing agricultural depredations. Because animals captured in leg-hold traps may incur injury and trauma {{to their feet and}} legs, there has been growing opposition to use of such traps. Each year, state or federal legislation is proposed to restrict the use of traps and considerable research effort has been devoted to the examination of trap improvements or alternatives. A variety of trap modifications have been suggested to reduce foot injuries and make the technique more generally acceptable, including use of padded jaws (Linhart et al. 1986, Olsen et al. 1986, Linhart et al. 1988) or attachment of tranquilizer tabs to traps (Balser 1965, Linhart et al. 1981).
