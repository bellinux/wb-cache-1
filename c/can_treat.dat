5|$|Advancements in {{computer}} modeling have allowed scientists to identify compounds that <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> prion-caused diseases, {{such as one}} compound found to bind a cavity in the PrPC and stabilize the conformation, {{reducing the amount of}} harmful PrPSc.|$|E
5|$|Linear {{particle}} accelerators generate electron beams {{for treatment of}} superficial tumors in radiation therapy. Electron therapy <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5cm for electron energies in the range 5â€“20MeV. An electron beam {{can be used to}} supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X-rays.|$|E

50|$|Treatment of {{hyperglycemia}} requires {{elimination of}} the underlying cause, such as diabetes. Acute hyperglycemia <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> by direct administration of insulin in most cases. Severe hyperglycemia <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> with oral hypoglycemic therapy and lifestyle modification.|$|R
50|$|Small lesions <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> {{with light}} electrocautery. Larger lesions <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> with electrodesiccation and curettage, shave excision, or cryosurgery. When {{correctly}} performed, removal of seborrheic keratoses will not cause much visible scarring except in persons with dark skin tones.|$|R
25|$|Scientists have {{engineered}} artificial nanoparticles {{made from}} lipids that <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> bacterial infections without antibiotics while simultaneously preventing antibiotic resistance.|$|E
25|$|Urolithins, such as urolithin A, are {{microflora}} human metabolites {{of dietary}} ellagic acid derivatives {{that are under}} study as anti-cancer agents. Claims that ellagic acid <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> or prevent cancer in humans have not been proven.|$|E
25|$|Cefalexin <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> {{a number}} of {{bacterial}} infections including: otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. It {{may be used to}} prevent bacterial endocarditis. It can also be used for the prevention of recurrent urinary-tract infections.|$|E

5000|$|In fact, if you {{consider}} any cofibration , then we have that [...] is homeomorphic to its image under [...] This implies that any cofibration <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> as an inclusion map, and therefore it <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> as having the homotopy extension property.|$|R

25|$|A Japanese company {{develops}} a reusable skin patch which <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> chronic {{high blood pressure}} by constantly releasing bisoprolol into the bloodstream.

25|$|In March {{researchers}} {{announced the}} successful use of gene therapy to treat two adult patients for X-linked chronic granulomatous disease, a disease which affects myeloid cells and damages the immune system. The {{study is the}} first to show that gene therapy <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> the myeloid system.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{should not}} be used to treat uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. Oral antibiotics are not a sufficient response to bacteria that cause this condition and have significant side effects including increased risk of opportunistic infection. In contrast, topical antibiotic eardrops <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> this condition.|$|E
50|$|Important {{clinical}} infections {{caused by}} Enterococcus include urinary tract infections, bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis, diverticulitis, and meningitis. Sensitive strains of these bacteria <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> with ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin. Urinary tract infections <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> specifically with nitrofurantoin, {{even in cases}} of vancomycin resistance.|$|R

25|$|The axiomatic {{approach}} Arrow adopted <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> all conceivable rules (that {{are based}} on preferences) within one unified framework. In that sense, the approach is qualitatively different from the earlier one in voting theory, in which rules were investigated one by one. One can therefore say that the contemporary paradigm of social choice theory started from this theorem.|$|E
25|$|A study {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} having AEDs immediately present during Chicago's Heart Start program over a two-year period. Of 22 individuals 18 were in a cardiac arrhythmia which AEDs <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> (Vfib or Vtach). Of these 18, 11 survived. Of these 11 patients, 6 were treated by bystanders with absolutely no previous training in AED use.|$|E
25|$|Cefalexin, also spelled cephalexin, is an {{antibiotic}} that <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> {{a number of}} bacterial infections. It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting {{the growth of the}} bacterial cell wall. Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins. It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin, but can be taken by mouth.|$|E

25|$|Water is {{provided}} by the city's Department of Public Utilities, {{and is one of the}} largest water producers in Virginia, with a modern plant that <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> up to 132 million gallons of water a day from the James River. The facility also provides water to the surrounding area through wholesale contracts with Henrico, Chesterfield, and Hanover counties. Overall, this results in a facility that provides water for approximately 500,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics by mouth {{should not}} be used to treat {{uncomplicated}} acute otitis externa. Antibiotics by mouth are not a sufficient response to bacteria which cause this condition and have significant side effects including increased risk of opportunistic infection. In contrast, topical products <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> this condition. Oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics can be used in case of severe soft tissue swelling extending into the face and neck and may hasten recovery.|$|E
25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a noninvasive {{procedure that}} blocks of {{blood flow to}} fibroids and thus <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> them. Long term outcomes with respect to how happy people are with the procedure are {{similar to that of}} surgery. There is tentative evidence that traditional surgery may result in better fertility. One review found that UAE doubles the future risk of miscarriage. UAE also appears to require more repeat procedures than if surgery was done initially. A person will usually recover from the procedure within a few days.|$|E

25|$|Cefalexin <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> certain {{bacterial}} infections, {{including those}} of the middle ear, bone and joint, skin, and urinary tract. It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia, strep throat, and to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Cefalexin is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus, or Pseudomonas. Like other antibiotics, cefalexin cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu, common cold or acute bronchitis. Cefalexin can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin. However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies.|$|E
25|$|Onsite {{sanitation}} (or on-site sanitation) {{is defined}} as a sanitation system in which excreta and wastewater are collected, stored or treated at the same location (or on the same plot) where they are generated. Examples are pit latrines and septic tanks. On-site sanitation systems are often connected to fecal sludge management systems where the fecal sludge that is generated onsite is treated as an offsite location. A related term is a decentralized wastewater system which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an onsite sewage facility <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> the wastewater generated locally.|$|E
25|$|SS {{can damage}} vital organs {{of the body}} with {{symptoms}} that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission as with other autoimmune diseases. Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, while others have symptoms of severe disease. Many patients <b>can</b> <b>treat</b> problems symptomatically. Others are forced to cope with blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen parotid glands, dysphonia (vocal disorders including hoarseness), and difficulty in swallowing and eating. Debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life. Some patients can develop renal (kidney) involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to proteinuria (excess protein in urine), urinary concentrating defect, and distal renal tubular acidosis.|$|E

Muscle pain and fever in mild cases <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> with over-the-counter pain relievers, and diarrhea and gastroenteritis <b>can</b> be <b>treated</b> with over-the-counter medications if needed.|$|R
