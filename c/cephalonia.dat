5|$|Nevertheless, raisin exports {{were the}} most {{important}} export of the islands during the Venetian rule. By the early 18th century Zante, <b>Cephalonia,</b> and part of Ithaca had become a major centre of the currant trade. Because of the fierce competition in the raisin trade between Venice and the United Kingdom, Venice prohibited the free export of raisins from the islands. Another measure was the , a heavy export tax for foreign ships.|$|E
5|$|Repulse {{departed}} England on 5 April 1902 {{for service}} with the Mediterranean Fleet, {{and arrived at}} Malta two weeks later. In the Mediterranean, she took part in combined exercises of the Mediterranean Fleet, Channel Fleet, and the Cruiser Squadron off <b>Cephalonia</b> and Morea between 29 September and 6 October 1902. Completing her Mediterranean service, she departed Malta on 29 November 1903, arriving at Plymouth on 10 December 1903. She then paid off at Chatham Dockyard on 5 February 1904 for an extensive refit.|$|E
5|$|Jews {{were also}} a native {{religious}} group to the Islands during the Venetian period. They were even fewer in number than the Catholics; in 1797 the number of Jews in Corfu {{appears to have been}} only two thousand. Jewish presence in Corfu can be traced since the times of the Principality of Taranto. In <b>Cephalonia,</b> there is evidence of Jewish habitation in the old capital, the Castle of St. George, since the early 17th century. When the capital of the island was transferred to Argostoli the Jews resettled there.|$|E
5|$|Venetians, being Catholics, {{retained}} the privileges {{enjoyed by the}} Latin bishopric of the islands under the Count Palatine dynasties. The Catholics were not numerous, and during the Venetian period, they were mainly concentrated in Corfu and <b>Cephalonia.</b> Most of them were descendants of Italian settlers {{but there were some}} conversions by Greeks to Catholicism. According to the law, Greek Orthodox priests and monks had to accept the Catholics as their superiors, though the Venetians placed the interests of the Republic ahead of those of the Papacy. Mixed marriages between Catholic and Orthodox Christians were allowed. These two were the main factors in the decline of Roman Catholicism in the Islands.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the capture}} of Thessalonica, the Ottomans went on to extend their rule over western Greece. A {{few months after the}} fall of the city, Ioannina {{surrendered}} to Hamza Bey and Carlo II Tocco accepted Ottoman suzerainty over the southern remnant of the Despotate of Epirus around Arta, while Venice moved to place Tocco's island possessions of Zante, <b>Cephalonia,</b> and Leucas under her protection. As a result, for the next half-century, until the end of the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1479, the main arena of confrontation between Venice and the Ottomans was to be Albania, an area of vital importance to both powers, as from there the Ottomans could threaten Italy herself. Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until October 1912, when it was captured by the Kingdom of Greece during the First Balkan War.|$|E
5|$|Lefkada, {{part of the}} Despotate of Epirus {{since the}} latter's {{foundation}} in 1205, was incorporated by Leonardo I Tocco into the County of <b>Cephalonia</b> in 1362. The Despotate of Epirus {{was one of the}} three Byzantine Empires in exile created after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Following the fate of the other central Ionian Islands, it was captured by the Turks in 1479 and then by the Venetians in 1502. However, Venetian rule did not last, as Lefkada was given back to the Ottoman Empire one year later. Turkish rule over Lefkada lasted for over 200 years, from 1479 to 1684, when Francesco Morosini attacked and subdued the island during the Morean War. Lefkada, however, did not become officially Venetian until 1718, with the signature of the Treaty of Passarowitz.|$|E
5|$|The last {{recorded}} Byzantine naval victory {{occurred in}} 1427 {{in a battle}} off the Echinades Islands, when the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (1425–1448) defeated the superior fleet of Carlo I Tocco, Count of <b>Cephalonia</b> and Despot of Epirus, forcing him to relinquish all his holdings in the Morea to the Byzantines. The last appearance of the Byzantine navy was in the final Ottoman siege of 1453, when a mixed fleet of Byzantine, Genoese and Venetian ships (varying numbers are provided by the sources, ranging from 10 to 39 vessels) defended Constantinople against the Ottoman fleet. During the siege, on 20 April 1453, the last naval engagement in Byzantine history took place, when three Genoese galleys escorting a Byzantine transport fought {{their way through the}} huge Ottoman blockade fleet and into the Golden Horn.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of her refit in July, she {{transferred to the}} Mediterranean Fleet, once again becoming Fisher's flagship. A strong proponent of the design of Renown, Fisher also found her highly desirable for the hosting of the social events required of a flagship in peacetime. Captain Hugh Tyrwhitt was appointed in command on 19 March 1900. Renown also underwent a special refit at Malta from February to May 1900 to meet Fisher's requirements for her. This included {{the transfer of the}} main deck 12-pounders to the superstructure. The ship recommissioned on 19 November 1900, and served as flagship until Fisher ended his tour as Commander-in-Chief on 4 June 1902, after which she continued to serve in the Mediterranean Fleet as a private ship under a new captain, Arthur Murray Farquhar. Renown participated in combined manoeuvres off <b>Cephalonia</b> and Morea between 29 September and 6 October 1902.|$|E
5|$|The main Mediterranean fleets of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire were {{deployed}} in the Ionian Sea. At the Treaty of Campo Formio, France had been awarded the Ionian Islands and the four fortresses of Butrinto, Parga, Preveza and Vonizza on the Albanian and Greek coasts. In early October 1798, following the declaration of war between France and the Ottomans, a large Turkish army had advanced across the Balkans and rapidly forced the fortresses to surrender. At the same time, the Ionian Islands were attacked by a joint Russian and Turkish expeditionary force, which included ten Russian ships of the line, numerous smaller Russian vessels and approximately 30 assorted Turkish ships. On board were 8,000 Turkish soldiers, which rapidly invaded and seized the islands of Paxi, Santa Maura, Theaki, <b>Cephalonia,</b> Zante and Cerigo, capturing 1,500 French prisoners by 10 October. Only the large fortified island of Corfu held out, and there the defenders were forced back into the main town. Although the town was besieged, operations were slow and the blockade was only loosely enforced, allowing Généreux to successfully break out and reach Ancona. By {{the end of the}} year little had changed, the French garrison remaining besieged in Corfu.|$|E
5|$|The town's decline {{began in}} the early 15th century, {{following}} the worsening fortunes of the Principality itself. At that time, Achaea, under Prince Centurione II Zaccaria (ruled 1404–30), found itself endangered by the attacks of the Byzantines of the Despotate of the Morea {{on the one hand and}} the expansionist designs of the Tocco family of <b>Cephalonia</b> and Zakynthos on the other. In late 1407, Centurione's own brother-in-law Leonardo II Tocco seized Glarentza and reaped an enormous booty, as recorded in the Chronicle of the Tocco. It took several years of conflicts and diplomatic manoeuvrings before a Venetian-mediated deal restored the city to Centurione in July 1414. In 1417, the Byzantines under the Despot Theodore II Palaiologos and his brother John VIII Palaiologos, launched another attack on the remains of the Principality. The brothers made swift progress, forcing Prince Centurione to retire to Glarentza, which was unsuccessfully attacked by the Byzantines. A truce was concluded in 1418, but in the same year, an Italian adventurer, Olivier Franco, seized the town, which in 1421 he sold to Carlo I Tocco, Leonardo's elder brother.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographical}} {{references in}} the Odyssey to Ithaca {{and its neighbors}} seem confused and {{have given rise to}} much scholarly argument, beginning in ancient times. Odysseus's Ithaca is usually identified with the island traditionally called Thiaki and now officially renamed Ithake, but some scholars have argued that Odysseus's Ithaca is actually Leucas, and others identify it with the whole or part of <b>Cephalonia.</b> Lately, Robert Bittlestone, in his book Odysseus Unbound, has identified the Paliki peninsula on <b>Cephalonia</b> with Homeric Ithaca.|$|E
25|$|On 8 September, Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies. This began a race to disarm and intern the Italian garrisons of the Balkans before the Allies {{could take advantage of}} it. Lanz was tasked with overcoming the Italian forces in Epirus and the Ionian Islands. In two cases, in <b>Cephalonia</b> and Corfu, the Italians offered resistance. Lanz himself was initially in favour of negotiating the Italian surrender, but in the end followed his orders and stormed these islands. In <b>Cephalonia,</b> the battle raged for a week before the Italians surrendered. After their surrender, and according to a directive from Hitler himself, more than 5,000 Italians were executed by the Germans. Lanz was present in <b>Cephalonia</b> both during the battle and the subsequent massacre. In Corfu, resistance lasted only for a day, but all 280 Italian officers on the island were shot and their bodies were disposed of in the sea, on Lanz's orders.|$|E
25|$|Between 2 and 12 October of {{the same}} year Belle Poule was {{involved}} in the invasions of the Ionian Islands of Cerigo, <b>Cephalonia,</b> and Zante, and would share in the booty captured there.|$|E

25|$|Further south, the Republic of Venice had {{launched}} its own {{attack on the}} Ottoman Empire, seeking revenge for successive conquests of its overseas empire by the Turks, most recently (1669) the loss of Crete. Venetian troops, {{under the command of}} the able general Francesco Morosini (who became Doge of Venice in 1688), were able early in the conflict to seize the island of <b>Cephalonia</b> (Santa Maura) in 1684, the Peloponnese (Morea) peninsula (1685–1687) and parts of Continental Greece, although attempts to conquer Chalkis (Negroponte), recover Crete and hold on to Chios failed. In the Treaty of Karlowitz, Venice gained recognition of its control over <b>Cephalonia</b> and the Morea, and restored the situation in the Aegean to its pre-war status quo, leaving only the island of Tinos in Venetian hands.|$|E
25|$|Gandin {{repeatedly}} requested {{help from}} the Ministry of War in Brindisi, {{but he did not}} get any reply. He {{even went so far as}} sending a Red Cross emissary to the Ministry, but the mission broke down off the coast of Apulia and when it arrived three days later at the Italian High Command in Brindisi, it was already too late. In addition, 300 planes loyal to Badoglio were located at Lecce, near the southernmost point of Italy, well within range of <b>Cephalonia,</b> and were ready to intervene. But the Allies would not let them go because they feared they could have defected to the German side. Furthermore, two Italian torpedo boats, already on their way to <b>Cephalonia,</b> were ordered back to port by the Allies for the same reasons.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the second}} {{constitution}} of the republic (1803), Greek was the primary official language, {{in contrast to the}} situation in the Septinsular Republic. Italian was still in use, though, mainly for official purposes since the Venetian Republic. The only island in which Italian (Venetian) had a wider spread was <b>Cephalonia,</b> where a great number of people had adopted Venetian Italian as their first language.|$|E
25|$|In 1502/03, the new {{peace treaty}} left Venice {{with nothing but}} <b>Cephalonia,</b> Monemvasia and Nauplia, with their {{appurtenances}} in the Morea. And against the sack of Megara, it had to endure the temporary capture of the castle of Aegina by Kemal Reis and the abduction of 2000 inhabitants. This treaty was renewed in 1513 and 1521. All supplies of grain from Nauplia and Monemvasia had to be imported from Turkish possessions, while corsairs rendered dangerous all traffic by sea.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, {{there were}} almost one {{thousand}} people in Corfu who considered {{themselves to be}} ethnic Maltese. In <b>Cephalonia</b> the number was 225. There were another hundred Maltese spread among the other lesser islands of the Ionian Group. Maltese emigration to these islands practically ceased when they were returned to Greece in 1864. Because of the union with Greece, a number of Maltese families abandoned Corfu and settled in Cardiff, Wales, where their descendants still live.|$|E
25|$|On 13 February 1814, {{the island}} of Paxos, in the Adriatic, {{surrendered}} to Apollo and a detachment of 160 troops. The troops moved so rapidly through the island that the enemy {{did not have time}} to organize resistance. As a result, the British force, which included inter alia men from the 2nd Greek Light Infantry from <b>Cephalonia,</b> from the Royal Corsican Rangers, the 35th Regiment of Foot, and marines and seamen from the Apollo, captured 122 enemy troops as well as a small, well-designed fort of three guns.|$|E
25|$|Robert {{undertook}} {{his first}} Balkan expedition in May 1081, leaving Brindisi with about 16,000 troops. By February 1082 he captured Corfu and Durazzo, defeating the Emperor Alexius I at the Battle of Dyrrhachium the previous October. Robert's son Mark Bohemond temporarily controlled Thessaly, unsuccessfully trying {{to retain the}} 1081–82 conquests in Robert's absence. The duke returned in 1084 to restore them, occupying Corfu and Kephalonia before his death from a fever on 15 July 1085. The village of Fiskardo on <b>Cephalonia</b> is named after Robert. Bohemond did not continue pursuing Greek conquests, returning to Italy to dispute Robert's succession with his half-brother Roger Borsa.|$|E
25|$|Kalligas {{was born}} in Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire in 1814, to Panagis Anninos-Kalligas, a wealthy {{merchant}} from <b>Cephalonia,</b> and Sofia Mavrokordatou from Chios. With {{the outbreak of the}} Greek Revolution in 1821, his father took the family to Trieste to avoid anti-Greek massacres. Pavlos Kalligas was sent to the Flanginian School in Venice and completed high school in the Heyer College in Geneva, before returning to Trieste to help in his father's commercial business. After the elder Kalligas' death in 1832, however, Pavlos abandoned commerce and turned to law, studying in the universities of Munich, Berlin and Heidelberg. In the latter he achieved his doctorate in Law under Eduard Gans and Friedrich Carl von Savigny.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the fall}} of Greece in April–May 1941, the country had been divided in {{occupation}} zones, with the Italians getting {{the bulk of the}} mainland and most islands. The Acqui Division had been the Italian garrison of <b>Cephalonia</b> since May 1943, and consisted of 11,500 soldiers and 525 officers. It was composed of two infantry regiments (the 17th and the 317th), the 33rd artillery regiment, the 27th Blackshirt Legion, the 19th Blackshirt Battalion and support units. Furthermore, its 18th Regiment was detached to garrison duties in Corfu. Acqui also had naval coastal batteries, torpedo boats and two aircraft. From 18 June 1943, it was commanded by the 52-year-old General Antonio Gandin, a decorated veteran of the Russian Front where he earned the German Iron Cross.|$|E
25|$|Already {{since his}} father's time, the county palatine was a vassal of the Principality of Achaea, and through it, after the Treaty of Viterbo, of the Kingdom of Naples. In this {{capacity}} he also held {{the post of}} Captain-General of Corfu and Butrint on the Albanian shore in 1286–90. In 1291/92, he participated with 100 knights in a campaign to aid the ruler of Epirus, Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, against the Byzantines who were besieging Ioannina, along with 400–500 cavalry from Achaea under Nicholas III of Saint Omer. In exchange, Nikephoros sent his daughter, Maria, as a hostage to <b>Cephalonia.</b> After the Byzantines were repelled, she was wed to Richard's son and heir, John I Orsini. This aroused the indignation of Nikephoros, {{who had not been}} consulted, and who was not mollified until 1295, when the young couple came to live at his court.|$|E
25|$|In 1292, he was wed to Maria, the {{daughter}} of Despot Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, ruler of Epirus. Maria had been sent as a hostage to <b>Cephalonia</b> to ensure Nikephoros' loyalty to the Latin princes when Richard and forces from the Principality of Achaea campaigned in Epirus to help raise the Byzantine siege of Ioannina. After the Byzantines were repelled, Richard, without consulting Nikephoros, arranged for John's marriage to Maria. This aroused the indignation of Nikephoros, who was not mollified until 1295, when the young couple came to live at his court. There John won his father-in-law's affection, {{to the extent that}} he granted him possession of the island of Leucas—Richard had promised to, but probably never did, cede the nearby island of Ithaca to the couple as well. John and Maria remained at the Epirote court until the murder of Richard in 1303 or 1304.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, the Peloponnese {{peninsula}} was divided between three powers: the Latin Principality of Achaea {{in the north}} and west, the Byzantine Greek Despotate of the Morea in the south and east, and Argos and Nauplia, Coron and Modon and some attendant forts, held by the Republic of Venice. The Byzantines were actively trying to conquer the ailing principality, all the while the menace of the ever-expanding Ottoman Empire threatened all of them. Carlo I Tocco, the ruler of the County palatine of <b>Cephalonia</b> and Zakynthos, of Lefkada and of the Despotate of Epirus, took advantage of the Byzantine-Achaean struggles to extend his domains into the Peloponnese: in 1407–1408 his brother Leonardo seized and plundered the fortress of Glarentza, in the northwestern Peloponnese, and in 1421 Carlo bought permanent possession of it from Oliverio Franco, who had seized it from the Achaean prince Centurione II Zaccaria three years earlier.|$|E
25|$|The Venetians then crossed {{onto the}} {{mainland}} region of Acarnania. The offshore island of Petalas was occupied on 10 August by Count Niccolo di Strassoldo and Angelo Delladecima. Reinforced with volunteers, mostly from <b>Cephalonia,</b> the Venetians then captured {{the towns of}} Aitoliko and Missolonghi. Greek leaders from across Epirus, from Himarra and Souli and the armatoloi captains of Acarnania and Agrafa, had contacted the Venetians with proposals for a common cause; with the Venetian advance, a general rising occurred {{in the area of}} Valtos and Xiromero. Muslim villages were attacked, looted, and torched, and Ottoman rule collapsed across western Continental Greece. By {{the end of the month}} the Ottomans only held on to the coastal fortresses of Preveza and Vonitsa. The Venetian fleet launched several raids along the coast of Epirus up to Igoumenitsa and even on the north-western coast of the Peloponnese, near Patras, before launching a concerted effort to capture the castle of Preveza on 21 September. The castle surrendered after eight days, and Vonitsa was captured by Delladecima's men a few days later. At the end of autumn, Morosini appointed Delladecima as military governor of the region stretching from the Gulf of Ambracia to the river Acheloos. Already in this early part of the war, the Venetians began suffering great casualties on account of disease; Count Strasoldo was one of them. These early successes were important for the Venetians because they secured their communications with Venice, denied to the Ottomans the possibility of moving troops through the area, and provided a springboard for possible future conquests on the Greek mainland.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April he {{was given}} his orders, which {{initially}} included the usual tasks of patrolling the Adriatic. However, events elsewhere soon changed his mission. On 26 April, he received new instructions {{to proceed with the}} annexation of the County Palatine of <b>Cephalonia</b> and Zakynthos, whose cession from the ruling Tocco family was being negotiated. Soon after he arrived at Corfu, however, the Republic reversed course, fearing a lasting military commitment against the Ottoman Turks, and decided to simply establish a Venetian protectorate over the Tocco domains, rather than annex them. Indeed, the Tocco representative, Giacomo Rosso, repeatedly asked for the aid of Cappello's fleet against the Turks, but was rebuffed, in part because Cappello was engaged in the brief conflict that had broken out between Venice and the King of Naples, Alfonso of Aragon, in July. Cappello's actions during the war are not well known; {{at the start of the}} conflict, when the new Captain general of the Sea, Alvise Loredan, was still in Venice, he conducted raids against the Neapolitan shores, but in August he was ordered to keep watch over the entry of the Straits of Otranto and prohibit any Aragonese vessels from operating in the area. He was then ordered to join with Loredan in conducting an attack on Messina. In September and November he was sent to escort the returning Flanders trade convoy. Although the Senate decided to extend his mission in early December, by mid-December he had returned with his ships to Venice and demobilized them.|$|E
500|$|The Turkish rule in {{the three}} islands of <b>Cephalonia,</b> Zante and Ithaca was short-lived. In 1481, {{two years after the}} {{beginning}} of the Turkish rule, Antonio Tocco invaded and briefly occupied <b>Cephalonia</b> and Zante but he was soon driven out by the Venetians. Zante was officially recovered by the Venetians in 1485. Then, <b>Cephalonia,</b> after sixteen years of Turkish occupation (1484–1500), became part of the [...] on 24 December 1500, with the Siege of the Castle of St. George. Finally, Ithaca, following the fate of <b>Cephalonia,</b> was conquered by Venice in 1503.|$|E
500|$|There {{were ten}} fortresses {{throughout}} the islands, with {{one on each}} island serving as its capital. On Corfu, however, there were three fortresses; two {{in the town of}} Corfu and the Angelokastro. On <b>Cephalonia</b> there were two, the castle of St. George or the Fortress of <b>Cephalonia</b> (...) and the Fortress of Asso (...) in the northern part.|$|E
500|$|The Islands were {{referred}} to, both individually and collectively, by various names. After Venice captured <b>Cephalonia</b> on 24 December 1500, {{the administration of}} the defense of all the islands was delegated to an official seated in Corfu. This official was being referred to as [...] "the General [...] of the Three Islands" [...] (...) and resided at the fortress of Angelokastro from 1387 {{to the end of the}} 16th century. The Three Islands refer to Corfu, Zante and <b>Cephalonia.</b> The Venetian equivalent for [...] "Ionian Islands" [...] is , the Italian being [...] and the Greek [...] in Modern Greek and [...] in [...]|$|E
500|$|The Ionian economy {{during the}} Venetian period was {{largely based on}} {{exporting}} local products. The most important of the agricultural products of Corfu was olive oil. On the islands of <b>Cephalonia</b> and Zante the main exports were raisins, olive oil and wine. One {{of the most significant}} exports was [...] olive oil. Groves of olive trees were planted throughout the islands during the Venetian period as olive oil was important to Venice's economy. Although the production of it was successful, the Republic only allowed exportation to Venice. Statistics for the years 1766–70 indicate 1,905,917 olive trees on Corfu, 113,161 on Zante, 38,516 on <b>Cephalonia,</b> 44,146 on Lefkada and 31,884 on Cythera.|$|E
500|$|During the Roman Empire, the Ionian Islands were {{variously}} part of {{the provinces}} of Achaea and Epirus vetus. These would form, {{with the exception of}} Cythera, the Byzantine theme of Cephallenia in the late 8th century. From the late 11th century, the Ionian Islands became a battleground in the Byzantine–Norman Wars. The island of Corfu was held by the Normans in 1081–1085 and 1147–1149, while the Venetians unsuccessfully besieged it in 1122–1123. The island of <b>Cephalonia</b> was also unsuccessfully besieged in 1085, but was plundered in 1099 by the Pisans and in 1126 by the Venetians. [...] Finally, Corfu {{and the rest of the}} theme, except for Lefkada, were captured by the Normans under William II of Sicily in 1185. Although Corfu was recovered by the Byzantines by 1191, the other islands henceforth remained lost to Byzantium, and formed a County palatine of <b>Cephalonia</b> and Zakynthos under William's Greek admiral Margaritus of Brindisi.|$|E

The view from this location and the scale and quality of its construction prove, according to A. Bon, that Chlemoutsi was not built as a citadel for Glarentza, but that it fulfilled an independent military role, that of securing control over the wider region.|$|E
