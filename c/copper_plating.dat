5|$|Copper {{is used in}} roofing, currency, and for {{photographic}} technology {{known as}} the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues {{to be used in}} construction of various types. <b>Copper</b> <b>plating</b> and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production.|$|E

25|$|Techniques {{of using}} pitch and <b>copper</b> <b>plating</b> as {{anti-fouling}} techniques {{were attributed to}} ancient seafaring nations such as the Phoenicians and Carthaginians (1500- 300BC). Wax, tar and asphaltum have been used since early times. An Aramaic record dating from 412 B.C. tells of a ship's bottom being coated {{with a mixture of}} arsenic, oil and sulphur. In Deipnosophistae, Athenaeus described the anti-fouling efforts taken {{in the construction of the}} great ship of Hieron of Syracuse (died 467 BC).|$|E
30|$|The Y-shaped CNFs were {{synthesized}} by ethanol {{catalytic combustion}} (ECC). The process of ECC {{is described as}} follows: <b>copper</b> <b>plates</b> were employed as substrates, nickel nitrate, nickel chloride, and iron nitrate as catalyst precursors, and ethanol as both carbon source and fuel to provide energy for CNF growth. <b>Copper</b> <b>plates</b> were ultrasonically washed in acetone for several minutes. Catalyst precursors were dissolved in absolute ethanol to form saturated precursor solutions. Then some drops of catalyst precursor solution were dripped to cleaned surface of <b>copper</b> <b>plates.</b> After dried naturally, the coated <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> was inserted into ethanol flames. The substrates stayed in ethanol flames for about 10 min. At last, wool-like deposits {{were found on the}} surface of <b>copper</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
25|$|When a <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> was {{situated}} on a MRSA-infected {{floor in the}} dermatology ward around a bed of a MRSA-infected patient, the bacterial count of S. aureus, including MRSA and the other Staphylococcus on the floor covered with a <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> was significantly less than on a floor unprotected by copper alloys. These results suggested that the <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> helped {{to prevent the spread}} of MRSA contamination in the hospital.|$|R

500|$|The {{original}} red {{and white}} marble from the floors was saved and reinstalled {{on top of the}} new concrete slab flooring. New marble was used on the fourth floor. Other changes included the addition of central air conditioning, insulation of the roof and exterior walls, and the replacement of the old single-pane windows. Public restrooms were added on the east side on each floor. During construction, the usable floor space in the building was reduced from [...] to [...] Restoration of the interior included work on the wrought-iron frame of the stairwell, uncovering the <b>copper</b> <b>plating</b> that decorated the walls in the stairwell, and work on the wrought-iron frame of the elevator shafts. Additionally, nearly 40% of the building's structural steel was replaced, the plumbing was replaced, HVAC systems were added, concrete slabs replaced the concrete slurry floors, new electrical systems were installed, shear concrete walls were added, as were new security, fire, and life safety systems.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships of}} the Camäleon class were {{frequently}} [...] during peacetime, as tight Prussian naval budgets in the 1860s prevented an active fleet policy. This was {{in large part}} due to liberal opposition to an expansion and modernization program for the Prussian Army under Albrecht von Roon, the Prussian Ministry of War; the Prussian Landtag refused to pass a budget authorizing the expenses requested by Roon, leading to a constitutional crisis where the army and navy operated without legal budgets. The navy was thus unable to spare funding to operate smaller vessels like the Camäleon class. Indeed, the lack of funds delayed completion of Meteor and Drache considerably. During periods of inactivity, the ships were moved ashore, their <b>copper</b> <b>plating</b> was removed, and ventilation holes were cut into the hulls to prevent deterioration of the wood. The first four ships were laid up after completion, with budgetary shortages preventing Cyclop from even conducting sea trials.|$|E

5000|$|The Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>plate</b> (Irda Tamarapatra) {{is another}} source on the Kamboja-Pala dynasty and was {{discovered}} in 1931. It is written in Sanskrit and has 49 lines of text in ancient Bengali script. The Vamsa or the tribal identity of the rulers mentioned in the Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>Plate</b> is specifically stated to be Kamboja-Vamsha-Tilaka (i.e. Ornament of the Kamboja family or Glory of the Kamboja tribe). Like the Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions, the Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>plate</b> is also thought {{to belong to the}} second half of tenth century (Dr N. G. Majumdar, Dr R. C. Majumdar). Hence the academic community believes that the Kambojanvaya Gaudapati of Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions and the Kambojavamshatilaka Paramasaugata Maharajadhiraja parameshvara paramabhattaraka Rajyapala of Kamboja-Pala dynasty of Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>Plate</b> Inscriptions refers to the same Kamboja family. But whereas the Dinajpur Pillar inscriptions refer just to one Kamboja ruler with the appellation of [...] "Kambojanvaya Gaudapati", the Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>plate,</b> mentions generation after generation of the Kamboja-Pala kings of Bengal i.e. Rajyapala, Narayanapala and Nayapala etc. The Kamboja-Pala kings of the Irda <b>Copper</b> <b>plate</b> had ruled north-west Bengal in the tenth or eleventh century.|$|R

40|$|A {{group of}} nine Indus Valley <b>copper</b> <b>plates</b> (c. 2600 – 2000 BC), {{discovered}} from private collections in Pakistan, {{appear to be}} of an important type not previously described. The plates are significantly larger and more robust than those comprising the corpus of known <b>copper</b> <b>plates</b> or tablets, and most significantly differ in being inscribed with mirrored characters. One of the plates bears 34 characters, which is the longest known single Indus script inscription. Examination of the plates with x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrophotometry indicates metal compositions, including arsenical copper, consistent with Indus Valley technology. Microscopy of the metal surface and internal structure reveals detail such as pitting, microcrystalline structure, and corrosion, consistent with ancient cast copper artifacts. Given the relative fineness of the engraving, it is hypothesised that the <b>copper</b> <b>plates</b> were not used as seals, but have characteristics consistent with use in <b>copper</b> <b>plate</b> printing. As such, {{it is possible that}} these <b>copper</b> <b>plates</b> are by far the earliest known printing devices, being at least 4000 years old...|$|R
