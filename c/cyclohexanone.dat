25|$|The optical {{rotation}} {{of a given}} enantiomer of ketamine can vary between its salts and free base form. The free base form of (S)‑ketamine exhibits dextrorotation and is therefore labelled (S)‑(+)‑ketamine. However, its hydrochloride salt shows levorotation and is thus labelled (S)‑(−)‑ketamine hydrochloride. The difference originates from the conformation of the <b>cyclohexanone</b> ring. In both the free base and the hydrochloride, the <b>cyclohexanone</b> ring adopts a chair conformation, but {{the orientation of the}} substituents varies. In the free base, the o-chlorophenyl group adopts an equatorial position and the methylamino group adopts an axial position. In the hydrochloride salt, the positions are reversed, with the o-chlorophenyl group axial and the methylamino group equatorial. Not all salts of ketamine show different {{optical rotation}} to the free base: (S)-ketamine (R,R)-tartrate is levorotatory, like (S)‑ketamine.|$|E

Partial hydrogenation of phenol gives <b>cyclohexanone,</b> a precursor to nylon. Nonionic detergents are produced by alkylation of phenol to give the alkylphenols, e.g., nonylphenol, which are then subjected to ethoxylation.|$|E
