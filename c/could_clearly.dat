5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.|$|E
5|$|That morning, Azmy's paratroopers moved {{south to}} their objectives, {{reaching}} them with relative ease. The 89th Battalion occupied all five strong points between Jebel Mariam and the pumping station. The commander {{made the mistake}} of separating his forces equally among all five strong points, rather than concentrating his forces at the southernmost strong points. However, from the rampart at the pumping station, the paratroopers <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> see the Israeli pontoon bridge at Deversoir, and corrected artillery fire being directed against the bridge. Second Army's artillery forces continued to fire almost unceasingly until the following day, sometimes scoring hits on the bridge. Egyptian artillery fire against the bridges would inflict heavy casualties on the Israelis {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in {{an attempt}} to {{expedite}} its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh. Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake. Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers. Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons. He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors. The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed {{the fact that they had}} just crossed. Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall.|$|E

25|$|Anglo–Saxon {{building}} {{forms were}} very much part of this general building tradition. Timber was 'the natural building medium of the age': the very Anglo–Saxon word for 'building' is 'timbe'. Unlike in the Carolingian world, late Anglo–Saxon royal halls continued to be of timber {{in the manner of}} Yeavering centuries before, even though the king <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> have mustered the resources to build in stone. Their preference must have been a conscious choice, perhaps an expression of 'deeply–embedded Germanic identity' {{on the part of the}} Anglo–Saxon royalty.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a new search {{expedition}} was mounted, {{founded by}} German Everest researcher Jochen Hemmleb, {{and led by}} Eric Simonson. Simonson had seen some very old oxygen bottles near the First Step during his first summit climb in 1991. One of these bottles was again found in 1999 and was one belonging to Mallory and Irvine, thus proving the two climbed at least as high as shortly below the First Step. Their location also suggests a climbing speed of approximately 275nbsp&vert-ft/hr, good time for the altitude and an indication the oxygen systems were working perfectly. The expedition also tried to reproduce Odell's position when he had seen Mallory and Irvine. The mountaineer Andy Politz later reported that they <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> identify {{each of the three}} steps without any problems.|$|E
25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters {{in front of}} the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day.... When it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E

25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E
500|$|Hopson (1975) {{supported}} {{the division of}} Hadrosauridae into two subfamilies, Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae, and was first to suspect what modern analyses find. Hopson found that Hadrosaurinae <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> be divided into groups, the [...] "kritosaurs", the [...] "edmontosaurs", and the [...] "saurolophines", including Prosaurolophus, Saurolophus, Tsintaosaurus and Lophorhothon, and intermediate between the [...] "kritosaurs" [...] and [...] "saurolophines". Brett-Surman (1975) also followed Sternberg with sinking Saurolophinae into Hadrosaurinae, and like Hopson, he recognized three groups within the subfamily. Like Hopson, one group was called the Edmontosaurus lineage, the second the Kritosaurus group, and the third uniting Prosaurolophus and Saurolophus. Over a decade later in 1989, Brett-Surman scientifically named the groups of hadrosaurines, the first becoming Edmontosaurini, the second Kritosaurini, and the third Saurolophini.|$|E
500|$|Yang's {{relationship}} with Burke was positively received; {{it was considered}} as [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} relationships on the show". Similarly, The Orange County Register wrote that their romance became [...] "one of the most touching and funny attractions of Grey's Anatomy." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN was critical of their wedding planning in the third season, saying: [...] "The will-they's and won't-they's fly and fall like hobbled pigeons until the season finale when the show solves both its personal and professional problems in the most obvious and least compelling of ways." [...] UGO.com placed their break-up on its list of the most horrible TV breakups. In 2009, Monfette said of Yang's {{relationship with}} Owen: [...] " [...] interactions with Cristina were perfectly balanced for optimum drama, never together and never apart for so long that the back-and-forth became frustrating. Viewers <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> see a softening of the typically hard-edged Cristina, a pleasant change for what had become something of a one-note character." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} great. He wrote that it felt [...] "more like a normal episode of the series" [...] compared to the premiere's [...] "introduction type" [...] tone. He also praised the prison experiment subplot, writing that it [...] "introduced a who's who of recognizable guest stars, all of whom <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> rerun on a show that loves to build a large cast of periphery characters." [...] Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a positive review, writing [...] "Anytime Veronica goes undercover as her polar opposite is just a good time, you know? [...] And {{as much as the}} Stanford Experiment thing was low-stakes and standalone, I enjoyed its unpredictable twists and reveals. Perfect early season plotline." [...] Alan Sepinwall wrote that the prison experiment plotline never getting [...] "out of hand [...] made it feel like a wasted opportunity" [...] while writing that [...] "Enrico Colantoni really sold Keith's despair at the resolution" [...] of his plotline.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} {{opened in}} London on 14 July 1307. The first {{three of the}} nine witnesses to Cragh's hanging to be heard were Lady Mary de Briouze, William Codineston, and the younger William de Briouze; his father had died in 1291. The commissioners were naturally curious {{about the details of}} the execution, because if Cragh had not actually been killed then there <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> have been no miracle. William de Briouze was in no doubt that the hanging had been properly conducted, and pointed out it was customary that [...] "if any subterfuge or trickery were discovered... then the executioner himself would be hanged in turn". He added that any deception could be ruled out because of the hatred that he and his father had for Cragh, whom he described as [...] "the worst of malefactors". The same point was made by William of Codineston: [...] "the lord de Briouze and his justices, officials, and servants hated William Cragh very much and rejoiced greatly at his hanging and death".|$|E
500|$|To improve {{confidence}} in the approach, the project made a prototype {{in the form of}} a counter-illuminated plywood silhouette of a Liberator at life size, suspended from towers [...] at a point where it could be seen from a point a little above sea level [...] away across Oyster Bay, Long Island, so that it was seen mainly over water as a sea search aircraft would be from a submarine's conning tower. It was fitted with sealed beam lamps made by General Electric. The lamps had reflectors to give them a narrow beam of 3 degrees horizontally, 6 degrees vertically, to minimise power consumption for the required brightness. The lamps' brightness was controllable with a variable resistor. During a test in the winter of 1943, selecting a day when the visibility was above 2 miles and the wind not so strong as to destroy the prototype, the observers <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> see the [...] thick cables used to hold up the model, but the silhouette itself was [...] "completely invisible" [...] with the lamps correctly adjusted.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} tandem atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry method (HPLC-APCI-MS) has been developed for the characterization of astragalosides in the extracts of the roots of Astragalus spp. The [M - H](-) ions of astragalosides <b>could</b> be <b>clearly</b> observed in selected ion monitoring mode and APCI-MS-MS was used to further identify the structures of the astragalosides. Twelve astragalosides in the extracts of Radix Astragali obtained from Shandong in China were separated and identified.

500|$|The sex scene {{remained}} controversial {{for some}} years after the film's release. The BBC cut it altogether when Don't Look Now premiered on UK television, causing a flood of complaints from viewers. The intimacy of the scene led to rumours that Christie and Sutherland had unsimulated sex which have persisted for years, and that outtakes from the scene were doing the rounds in screening rooms. Michael Deeley, who oversaw the film's UK distribution, claimed on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that Warren Beatty had flown to London and demanded that the sex scene—featuring then girlfriend Julie Christie—be cut from the film. The rumours were seemingly confirmed in 2011 by former Variety editor Peter Bart, who was a Paramount executive at the time. In his book, [...] Infamous Players: A Tale of Movies, the Mob, (and Sex), Bart says he was on set {{on the day the}} scene was filmed and <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> see Sutherland's penis [...] "moving in and out of" [...] Christie. Bart also reiterated Warren Beatty's discontent, noting that Beatty had contacted him to complain about what he perceived to be Roeg's exploitation of Christie, and insisting that he be allowed to help edit the film. Sutherland subsequently issued a statement through his publicist stating that the claims were not true, and that Bart did not witness the scene being filmed. Peter Katz, the film's producer, corroborated Sutherland's account that the sex was entirely simulated.|$|E
500|$|On 27 April Meldrum was {{promoted}} to brigadier-general and given command of the New Zealand brigade, although he was temporarily replaced as commanding officer by Major Charles Dick. On 30 April the Wellington regiment returned to the front, manning a line of observation posts in the Weli Sheikh Nuran defence system. They were {{at the right of}} the British line, which stretched along the Wadi Ghuzze to the Mediterranean Sea, south of Gaza. As well as manning the trenches, they carried out mounted patrols into no man's land. On 8 June it was their turn to return to the rear rest area at Marakeb, and Lieutenant-Colonel James Whyte assumed command of the regiment. On 8 July the 9th Squadron captured a Turkish outpost [...] to the west of Beersheba, from which they <b>could</b> <b>clearly</b> see the village's defences. Ten days later the regiment assaulted what they believed was a strong Turkish position at Khalassa, but discovered the defenders had withdrawn before their approach. On 19 July a Turkish force attacked across the Wadi Imleih towards Karm. The regiment moved forward to occupy a line of observation posts the next day, but again discovered that the Turks had withdrawn. Over the next weeks the regiment carried out numerous patrols around Beersheba, checking on the Turkish defences and dispositions. On 18 August they were sent to Marakeb to rest. Four weeks later, on 18 September, they returned to the front line at Fukhari.|$|E
500|$|The serial later {{played out}} another chance for Ivan and Paul to be together. While interviewed by Claire Brand from Inside Soap, Bose said that Paul visits Ivan {{to give him}} back a CD he left over his house and [...] "both of them realise that they don't have {{anything}} left {{to say to each}} other." [...] Bose opined that Ivan and Paul were [...] "doomed from the start" [...] because he needed Ivan to commit. Rodney thinks that he can reunite Paul and Ivan and sets the pair up. He explained that the two had [...] "just about got over their awkwardness with one another" [...] and Rodney tells the whole pub that it is obvious that Paul and Ivan love each other and need to reconcile. The whole situation is [...] "embarrassing for both of them" [...] and Ivan is furious with Rodney's intervention. After some [...] "soul searching", Ivan calms down and [...] "stuns" [...] Paul when he asks him to get back with him. Paul rejects Ivan's advances, Bose said that Paul normally likes [...] "the big love affair" [...] but this time gives him his [...] "marching orders". Ivan is left heartbroken once again and decides to take some time away from the village. Bose stated that his character goes to see him off and there is a [...] "terrible silent moment" [...] between the two.
