Until about a year before his death Edwin continued to create art work, though due to age and health, he was then creating [...] "computer paintings" [...] in his studio. The computer paintings came about primarily out of frustration and his deep desire to create. Though his heart would no longer allow him to lift heavy blocks of clay, his mind was still active. On an impulse {{he went to a}} computer store, purchased a computer, a <b>color</b> <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printer,</b> and a graphical sketch pad - from this he began to create what he would call [...] "computer paintings."

500|$|In {{reproducing}} a mass-produced illustration in a painterly style, Lichtenstein simplifies {{by reducing}} the composition to primary colors, which serves to accentuates its mass appeal and largely gives it the [...] "pop" [...] look. Typically, Ben-Day dots enable an artist to produce {{a variety of colors}} by using dots of a few colors to give the illusion of a broader pallet. By mixing dots of different <b>colors,</b> like an <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printer,</b> just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using {{only a limited number of}} primary hues. Lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this, achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues. Instead, for each color that he wanted to include in a work, he used that color paint.|$|R
40|$|In the {{printing}} industry, {{one of the}} most common methods for reproducing halftone images using bilevel printing devices is clustered-dot ordered dithering. The images produced using this method are quite faithful to the original and are visually pleasing. Nevertheless, only rational angles are attainable with clustered-dot dithering, due to the discrete nature of the grids. This phenomenon can become detrimental in the case of four-color printing, when different screen angles and maybe even different screen frequencies are used for separate color planes, thus producing a so-called Moiré phenomenon. Another important drawback, the so-called banding or contouring effect, is related to the limited area of basic screen elements used in traditional dithering. In order to deal with these problems, we have developed, within the scope of our research, several new techniques for digital halftoning: (1) pseudo-random halftone screening, (2) a new method for generating clustered-dot halftone images having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size (CombiScreen), (3) rotated clustered-dot dithering, based on discrete one-to-one rotation, and (4) rotated dispersed-dot dither. A new method of pseudo-random halftone screening is described. It starts by obtaining the quasi-random distribution of tile centers according to some well-defined spectral characteristics. We then obtain the desired tesselation of the output device space by applying the Voronoi polygonization process. Then, an analytic black-dot curve is calculated according to the resampled input signal level and the area of each given tile. This analytic curve is scan-converted to obtain the blackened pixels. In the second approach, we associate threshold values to all pixels inside every tile according to some specially tailored analytic spot function. Then, the standard threshold comparison process is applied. Unlike known error-diffusion techniques, the pseudo-random halftone screening technique can be applied to a high resolution printing process. The characteristic screen element size can be properly chosen so as to ensure the best trade-off between {{the printing}} process constraints and the most precise printing. The described halftone algorithm seems to be appropriate for high-resolution color and black&white devices (above 1000 dpi). A new method (CombiScreen) is proposed for generating clustered-dot halftone images on raster printing devices having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size. The dither tiles generated by this method may contain several screen elements having any rational orientation and size. Threshold values are distributed among the cells of the dither tile so as to produce a large range of gray values, while at the same time preserving the clustered-dot behavior of individual screen elements. When rendering images at smoothly increasing intensity levels, this new method generates few contouring effects and other visible artifacts. The method works equally well for quadratic, rectangular, parallelogram and hexagonally shaped screen elements. Resulting dither tiles are generally either of parallelogram or of hexagonal shape. Since CombiScreen enables the screen dot frequency or orientation to be chosen independently of the number of gray levels, it has proven to be specially effective when printing at resolutions between 150 to 600 dpi with <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printers</b> and at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi with xerographic printers. A new operator of discrete one-to-one rotation is described. It offers means previously unknown in the art for generating rotated screens which approximate irrational angles with high-precision, producing much less disturbing interferences and artifacts than other methods. Therefore, a carefully prepared dither tile incorporating screen elements with the desired period, initial orientation, and dither threshold values defining their screen dot shape growth behavior can be rotated by discrete one-to-one rotation and keep the desired screen element period, the number of cells per screen element and the threshold values associated with each screen element cell, thereby preserving the screen dot shape growth behavior of the original dither tile. Several different discrete one-to-one rotation variants are described: a small angle rotation technique valid for a subset of rational rotation angles, a rigid band technique and a technique based on discrete shearing transformations. The high-quality of the so rotated dither tile is due to the fact that discrete one-to-one rotation preserves the exact number of elementary cells per screen element and their exact dither threshold values. The described method provides a new range of solutions for obtaining high-quality digital angled halftone screens. High-quality solutions can be found for generating three digital angled halftone screens, each 30 ° apart from each other, as known from traditional photographic colour screening techniques. Further solutions minimizing Moiré effects may be obtained by halftone screens whose first order frequency component vectors sum up to zero. This new method has turned out to be particularly effective when printing with <b>color</b> <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printers</b> at resolutions between 150 and 800 dpi as well as with xerographic printers at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi. Rotated dispersed-dot dither is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither, texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms. This technique has successfully been applied to in-phase color reproduction on ink-jet printers as well as to black and white reproduction on laser printers...|$|R

Les techniques de reproduction d'images noir et blanc ou couleur utilisées dans la plupart des imprimantes de bureau permettent de reproduire plus ou moins fidèlement des images, en mode tout-ou-rien. Cependant, ces techniques conventionnelles sont loin d'être parfaites: les unes souffrent d'un diapason dynamique trop limité, ce qui engendre un effet de bande ou d'autres structures visuellement gênantes; les autres produisent des effets de Moiré intolérables. Ce travail de thèse a été précédé par une analyse des problèmes liés à la nature répétitive des trames lors de la superposition de couches colorées et à la nature discrète des grilles de sortie des dispositifs de visualisation modernes. Cette analyse nous a permis d'identifier et de formuler un certain nombre de conditions à respecter, afin d'assurer une qualité de reproduction acceptable. Après avoir étudié l'état de l'art, nous avons décidé de mener notre recherche dans les directions suivantes: (1) méthode de reproduction d'images par trame pseudo-aléatoire regroupée, (2) technique combinée de génération de points de trame (CombiScreen), (3) méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective d'une trame à points dispersés, et (4) méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective d'une trame à points groupés. La méthode de reproduction d'images par trame pseudo-aléatoire regroupée, se prête bien à la reproduction couleur à haute résolution. Les épreuves en quadrichromie que nous avons pu faire, montrent une qualité acceptable dans la fidélité de rendu de nuances des teintes; elles donnent une bonne impression générale; il n'y pas d'effet de Moiré, ni d'autres artefacts visuels forts, sur les images obtenues. Par rapport à la plupart des implémentations commerciales existantes, notre méthode offre un contrôle accru sur la forme et la dispersion des éléments de trame. La méthode combinée de génération de points de trame (CombiScreen), permettant de minimiser l'effet de bandes, est utilisable dans la plupart des applications graphiques pour la reproduction d'images couleur ou noir et blanc. Cette technique permet d'obtenir des gradations de niveaux d'intensité extrêmement lisses, presque sans textures gênantes. Par ailleurs, elle permet d'utiliser des trames de base de différentes tailles, y compris de toutes petites trames, ce qui représente un avantage considérable. Les trames obtenues par la méthode CombiScreen peuvent également servir de base de départ pour d'autres méthodes de tramage, et, notamment, pour la méthode de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective. Un nouvel opérateur de rotation discrète bijective développé dans le cadre de cette recherche, permet d'appliquer des transformations proches des rotations, sur les ensembles discrets, et, notamment, sur les matrices de seuillage utilisées dans les algorithmes de reproduction. Trois types différents de rotations discrètes bijectives sont décrits en détail: la rotation discrète bijective par bandes rigides, la rotation discrète bijective de type a, b, b+ 1, et la rotation discrète bijective par cisaillements discrets successifs XYX. Grâce à cet opérateur, et en l'appliquant au plan des valeurs de seuil, on obtient plusieurs variantes de technique de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective, à points groupés ou dispersés. Les trames obtenues par ces techniques peuvent être appelées semi-régulières, car, tout en héritant d'un élément régulier des trames non-tournés, elles présentent une périodicité sur des périodes beaucoup plus grandes que celles de la trame de base. Les erreurs de dicrétisation, inhérentes à la rotation discrète bijective, perturbent la régularité initiale, sans la détruire complètement. La méthode de tramage régulier par matrice de seuillage dispersée tournée offre une qualité d'image améliorée. Les petits détails sont bien rendus et l'aspect visuel est assez plaisant. En outre, la courbe de reproduction obtenue par cette technique est nettement supérieure à celle de la méthode de Bayer, pour s'approcher des courbes de reproduction qui caractérisent les méthodes de reproduction par trame à points regroupés. Différentes méthodes de reproduction en demi-ton par rotation discrète bijective de la trame à points groupés permettent de satisfaire les critères de qualité de trames formulés au début de notre recherche, tels que l'élimination de l'effet de bande et la minimisation de l'effet de Moiré dans la reproduction en quadrichromie. Certains échantillons, produits avec cette méthode, atteignent une qualité visuelle considérable, proche de celle obtenue à résolution élevée...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} nozzles {{and their}} impact on droplet formation and droplet flight in a continuous <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printer.</b> Methods are suggested to characterise droplet formation and droplet flight stability (D. F. S.). A study about the influence of droplet flight stability on the quality of print out is presented. A method to assess the charging process for the continuous <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> is described. The development and characterisation of silicon nozzles, with single and multiple orifices, for continuous <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printers</b> is presented. The continuous <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printer</b> based on the Hertz’ principle produces images of photographic quality by electrostatic deflection of undesired droplets from a continuous flow of droplets. The droplets that form the print must all have the same size and equal inter droplet distances to assure high, reproducible print quality. To attain equally sized droplets at constant inter droplet distances the nozzle is mechanically stimulated at a frequency close to its natural droplet formation frequency. An optical measurement setup is suggested to assess information about the droplet flight stability. Nozzle units are characterised concerning how the choice of stimulation frequency and its amplitude influences droplet flight stability. It was found that the nozzles often had an individual behaviour regarding at which stimulation frequencies the nozzle had its highest droplet flight stability. Nozzles were after characterisation used in a printer to study how the measured droplet flight stability influenced the positioning of droplets on paper during print out. It was found that if the droplet flight stability was high (D. F. S. < 15 °) no misplaced droplets that would degrade print quality could be detected in the print. During printing is it essential that the stimulation signal and the charging pulses are correctly synchronised to either fully charge droplets or to leave them uncharged. The charging of droplets was measured while the phase angle between stimulation and charging was varied. This variation showed for which phase angles that the droplets are fully charged. A method is presented to assess the electrical properties of droplet formation. The nozzles used in continuous <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printers</b> are traditionally made by glass. The assembling of nozzles introduces great variations in droplet flight stability for different stimulation frequencies. For a given stimulation frequency two glass nozzles might produce droplets at quite different droplet flight stabilities. A method to produce pyramid shaped, truncated silicon nozzles without the drawback of varying droplet flight stability is presented. The nozzles were manufactured during four consecutive etchings. The printing of one A 4 page with a continuous <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printer</b> is time consuming, since the printer can print approximately 0. 5 pages per minute. To increase printing speed a silicon nozzle array with multiple nozzles per colour is developed and characterised. The nozzles were manufactured during three etchings.

The nozzle opening is a nozzle opening of an electrically actuated <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printer,</b> and has an approximate diameter, which is greater than 20 times of an approximate diameter of the particles of the solution. The step of ejecting comprises applying a signal shape, which is designed such that the droplet cloud is ejected instead of a single drop. A percentage of the particles in the solution is less than 10 %. The particles have an approximate diameter of greater than 100 - 1500 nm. The step of ejecting is performed: such that the droplet cloud comprises individual drops per single ejection process; so that the droplets of the droplet cloud have a diameter, which is smaller than one fifth of {{the diameter of the}} nozzle opening; and such that the droplets of the droplet cloud are dimensioned so that a liquid fraction evaporates in essence during the flight of the droplets so that each of the droplets of the three dimensional structure is formed to the substrate during the flight of the nozzle opening. The three-dimensional structure is a ball unit composed of the particles. The solution is an aqueous solution or the particles are polystyrene microspheres and/or silica microspheres. The <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printer</b> is used in a single drop mode, and is a piezoelectric or thermal <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printer.</b> A distance between the substrate and the nozzle opening is 0. 7 - 4 mm. An independent claim is included for a device of generating an aggregated three-dimensional structure on a substrate...|$|R
