50|$|The {{difference}} of two squares {{can also be}} used in the rationalising of irrational denominators. This is a method for removing surds from expressions (or at least moving them), applying to division by some <b>combinations</b> involving <b>square</b> roots.|$|R
50|$|The {{bulk of his}} {{compositions}} are for chamber ensembles {{and often}} involve unusual instrumental <b>combinations.</b> Free <b>Square</b> Jazz, for instance, is for recorder, electric guitar, double bass and drum kit and Line and Length is scored for soprano saxophone, oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet & bassoon.|$|R
50|$|A <b>combination</b> <b>square</b> {{is a tool}} {{used for}} {{multiple}} purposes in woodworking, stonemasonry and metalworking. It is composed of a ruled blade and one or more interchangeable heads that may be affixed to it. The most common head is the standard or square head {{which is used to}} lay out or check right and 45° angles. Invented in 1883 by Laroy S. Starrett, the <b>combination</b> <b>square</b> continues to be a commonplace tool in home workshops, construction jobsites and metalworking.|$|E

50|$|The name Odd Jobs denotes {{that the}} tool does {{many kinds of}} sundry tool roles. Its closest cousin among common, modern tools, is the <b>combination</b> <b>square,</b> which shares with the Odd Job the {{functions}} of scribing, squaring, level/plumb, and the sliding and locking precision steel ruler. However, the Odd Jobs still has some unique functions in its total package, including the compass, and compensated gauging.|$|E
40|$|Least <b>squares</b> <b>combinations</b> (Granger & Ramanathan, 1984) are an {{important}} development in the forecast combination literature. However, ordinary least squares methods often perform poorly in real application due to the variability of coefficient/weight estimations. In this work, on one hand, we propose sequential subset selections to reduce the variability during combinations. On the other hand, we propose a novel method to simultaneously stabilize and shrink the coefficient/weights estimates. The proposed methods {{can be applied to}} various combination methods to improve prediction as long as their weights are determined based on ordinary least <b>squares.</b> forecast <b>combinations,</b> least <b>squares,</b> sequential selection, stabilization, shrinkage...|$|R

50|$|A Speed Square (rafter square, rafter angle square, {{triangle}} square) is a triangular-shaped, carpenters' {{marking out}} tool manufactured and sold by Swanson Tool Co., Inc. The Speed Square combines {{some of the}} most common functions of the <b>combination</b> <b>square,</b> try square, and framing square into one. It is used to make basic measurements and mark lines on dimensional lumber, and may be used as a saw guide for making short 45 and 90 degree cuts.|$|E
5000|$|L. S. Starrett Company (...) is an American {{manufacturer}} of tools and instruments used by machinists and tool and die makers. The company was founded when businessman and inventor Laroy Sunderland Starrett (1836-1922) bought the Athol Machine Company in 1905. The company patented {{such items as}} the sliding <b>combination</b> <b>square,</b> bench vises, and a shoe hook fastener. They make precision steel rules and tapes, calipers, micrometers, and dial indicators, among many other things.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} Starrett {{has been one}} of {{continuous}} expansion through the patenting of products and takeovers of other manufacturers. In 1878 Laroy S. Starrett invented and patented the first <b>combination</b> <b>square,</b> and in 1880 he founded the L.S. Starrett Company in Athol, MA in order to produce it and other precision tools. In 1882, Starrett traveled to London and Paris to appoint sales representatives, thereby starting up the international marketing of his products. [...] In 1887, Starrett acquired further patents.|$|E

40|$|Consider the N × N matrix A, whose ijth element Ai,j, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N, {{is defined}} by Ai,j = (− 1) ⌈j/i⌉+ 1. (1) The ith row of A {{represents}} a ± 1 -valued “square wave ” function of j with halfperiod i. Thus xA, where x is a (row) N-vector, gives {{a picture of the}} waveform that is a linear <b>combination</b> of <b>square</b> waves with weights in x. Similarly yA− 1 finds weights so that a given waveform y is a weighted linear <b>combination</b> of these <b>square</b> waves. This matrix has a surprisingly simple inverse. More generally, we can invert any matrix in which the first row is arbitrary, except that it cannot begin with 0, and the ith row repeats each term in the first row i times until it reaches the end of the row, thus spreading out the function with larger periods. The matrix A will thus have entries j Ai,j = f. (2...|$|R
5000|$|Terry - Terry begins {{measuring}} for his base, but {{is frustrated}} when he constantly mismeasures. Frustrated by his jigsaw, Terry proceeds {{to use his}} crosscut saw to do his cutting. Harvey then uses his <b>combination</b> <b>square</b> to ensure that his base (and Terry's cuts) are truly square. However, he attaches the top cross piece without checking whether his sloped pieces are at the correct angle of 60 degrees. After adjustments, Terry believes [...] "close enough" [...] is good enough, while Harvey disagrees. Harvey eventually wins out, and Terry goes adjusting. He is eventually finished at 63 minutes, with all angles correct.|$|E
50|$|Ruth - Ruth {{begins by}} making measurements, {{although}} the marking on her wood is a barely visible dot {{rather than a}} whole line across her lumber. Thus, when she begins cutting, her pieces are not square. When she begins to use a <b>combination</b> <b>square</b> for marking a line across her lumber, Ruth's nominator Michelle contends {{that she is not}} using it correctly. Ruth also chooses to ignore measuring the angles. When she declares herself finished, Andrew contends that her frame is not square and her angle is incorrect {{due to the lack of}} measurement, which she addresses by using shims. She finishes in 68 minutes, but the frame is not correct.|$|E

The facade oriented towards the cathedral is the most ornate, with a conical roof over the operating theatre, but that towards the south west with its cloister is also an important part {{of the building}}.

50|$|Except for wide, curved {{horizontal}} and vertical brackets, the porch is classically detailed. This {{is one of the}} tallest and largest historic houses in Provo, and its two-story carriage may be the single largest building of its type. The heavy landscaping somewhat obscures the building's massiveness. The single-family dwelling has four major projections, each gabled, extending from the rusticated stone lintels, ornamental porch and bargeboards, polychrome color scheme, and <b>combination</b> of <b>square</b> and slanted bay wings. In good condition and relatively unaltered, the house is architecturally significant, as is the monitor-form carriage house, the lower level bays of which has been filled with windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{circular}} patio {{has also}} two levels. The lower {{consists of a}} Doric colonnade of conglomerate stone, with an orthodox classical entablature formed of triglyphs and metopes. The upper floor is formed by a stylized Ionic colonnade whose entablature has no decoration. This organisation of the patio shows a deep knowledge of Roman architecture, and would be framed in pure Renaissance style but for its curved shape, which surprises the visitor entering from the main façades. The interior spaces and the staircases are also governed by the <b>combination</b> of <b>square</b> and circle. Similar aesthetic devices would be developed in the following decades under the classification of Mannerism.|$|R
