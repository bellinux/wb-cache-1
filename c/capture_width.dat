40|$|This paper {{extends the}} theory on <b>capture</b> <b>width,</b> a {{commonly}} used performance indicator for a {{wave energy converter}} (WEC). The <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> of a linear WEC is shown to depend on two properties: the spectral power fraction (a property introduced in this paper), which depends entirely on the sea state, and the monochromatic <b>capture</b> <b>width,</b> which {{is determined by the}} geometry of the WEC and the chosen power take off (PTO) coefficients. Each of these properties is examined in detail. <b>Capture</b> <b>width</b> is shown to be a measure of how well these two properties coincide. A study of the effects of PTO control on the <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> suggests that geometry control, a form of control that has not been the focus of much academic research, despite its use in the wave energy industry, deserves more attention. The distinction between geometry control and PTO control is outlined. While <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> is a valuable design tool, its limitations must be recognised. The assumptions made in the formulation of <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> are listed, and its limitations as a tool for estimating annual power capture of a WEC are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objectives] This paper proposes an {{optimized}} {{design for}} wave-power navigational lighting buoys of seadromes. [Methods] Based {{on the theory}} of three-dimensional potential flow, the buoyant motion response of a buoy is calculated. A type of array of wave-power navigational lighting buoys located in an offshore seadrome is proposed,and a procedure for the design optimization of its component buoys is presented. Matching the best Power Take-Off(PTO) damping, the diameter to draft ratio and array distance with the best energy <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> ratio are acquired, and the energy capture for the short-term forecast of the buoy array is accomplished. On this basis, combined with the actual sea conditions, energy capture for the long-term forecast of an individual buoy is accomplished. The influence of the buoy diameter, buoy draft and array distance on the energy <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> ratio is discussed. [Results] The {{results show that the}} energy <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> ratio is at its greatest when the diameter to draft ratio is between 2. 4 - 2. 6; the smaller the distance between array buoys, the greater the energy <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> of each buoy. [Conclusions] The results can provide a reference and suggestions for the optimization of the design of wave energy generation for arrays buoy...|$|E

40|$|A new L(2) {{approach}} for {{the calculation of}} the threshold molecular <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> needed for the determination of DR cross sections was developed.

40|$|We {{consider}} a finite array of floating flap gates oscillating wave surge converter (OWSC) in water of constant depth. The diffraction and radiation potentials are solved {{in terms of}} elliptical coordinates and Mathieu functions. Generated power and <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> ratio of a single gate excited by incoming waves are given {{in terms of the}} radiated wave amplitude in the far field. Similar to the case of axially symmetric absorbers, the maximum power extracted is shown to be directly proportional to the incident wave characteristics: energy flux, angle of incidence and wavelength. Accordingly, the <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> ratio is directly proportional to the wavelength, thus giving a design estimate of the maximum efficiency of the system. We then compare the array and the single gate in terms of energy production.

In the first stage, the excitation forces, added mass and radiation damping of M 4 are calculated. In the second stage, the motion equations are solved considering both hydrodynamic interactions and mechanical connections between the floating bodies of M 4. Viscous effects have been included in the numerical study, and the power take-off system (PTO) is simplified as a linear rotational damper.

40|$|The Sea Horse {{scale model}} was {{tested in the}} University of Plymouth’s wave flume. An {{extensive}} period of testing was carried out to give a large set of results, from which trends could be identified. By using multiple methods, including heave measurements, pressure changes and wave absorption monitoring, the results of all were compared. The most reliable method {{was found to be}} videoing the pump movement and calculating the amount of water it displaced and from this the power it was producing. This result was examined in more detail as an efficiency measurement of <b>capture</b> <b>width.</b> Waves of periods 1 to 6 seconds and amplitudes of 0. 14 and 0. 1 metres were used. Simple linear damping was applied in the form of closing a valve on the output pipe, adding a resistive force to the pump movement. 220 tests were carried out over three weeks, and the data set examined for how much absorption of wave power had occurred. Results from testing showed that efficiencies were highest at the lower amplitude. The trend suggests that peak efficiency with damping is potentially much higher than the 0. 83 m the results indicate. For the 0. 14 m amplitude, the efficiencies were lower and peaked at 0. 32 m <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> for 25 % damping, where the valve was a quarter closed, and 0. 37 m for 50 % where the valve was half closed. The theoretical maximum efficiency of 0. 3 m <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> was exceeded so often that this suggests that the device performs exceptionally well. Because of this all the current parameters such as size and geometry are recommended to be kept as they are as the device development continues for future testing in irregular waves.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I use the ”optical theorem for wave power ” to {{calculate}} the <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> for arrays of wave energy converters. The optical theorem (in analogy with the optical theorem in atomic physics [1]) relates the <b>capture</b> <b>width</b> (CW) for a wave energy converter (WEC) to the polar diagram f (θ) of the total wave generated by the device due to its unmoving presence in the sea together with its motions and the forces it exerts, CW = λ |ℜ f (0) | 2 R pi −pi | f (θ) | 2 dθ (1) Here f (θ) gives the complex amplitude of the wave generated by the device {{as a function of}} the angle θ relative to the propagation direction of the incident waves, (the forward direction). Equation (1) has been derived independently by many authors and reviewed recently by Farley [2] with references to previous work. In [2] it is established that the relevant angular distribution f (θ) is for the total wave generated by the device and the forward amplitude f (0) is required in the numerator of (1) rather than the backward amplitude f (pi).

A wide variety of wave energy conversion technologies are currently being developed. A new wave energy converter (WEC) - CECO, aims at converting in electricity both the kinetic and the potential wave energy, and is composed of a central element and two lateral movable modules (LMM), which move, upward and downward, under the action of incident waves, Figure 1. The proof of concept of this patented WEC was carried out at the Hydraulics Laboratory of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, on a geometrical scale of 1 : 20. The paper presents some results of those tests and analyses the CECO response for different wave conditions and modes of operation (power take-off damping level and WEC inclination). Two different techniques were used to evaluate the power absorbed. The analysis is based on the measured motion, velocity and acceleration time series, the mean absorbed power and corresponding relative <b>capture</b> <b>widths.</b> The potential of this new concept was confirmed, as relative <b>capture</b> <b>widths</b> of up to 30 % were obtained.
