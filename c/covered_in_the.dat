40|$|Based on MODIS data, we {{analyzed}} the spatial distribution and the intra- and inter-annual variations of <b>the</b> snow <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qilian Mountains. <b>In</b> addition to discussing regional climate, {{we discussed the}} reasons for the snow cover pattern variations. The spatial distribution of <b>the</b> snow <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qilian Mountains is uneven, and <b>the</b> snow <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west is significantly greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east. <b>The</b> difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intra-annual variations of the snow cover at different altitudes is large, and the general seasonal cycle exhibits two maxima and one minimum. The snow <b>cover</b> and precipitation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Qilian Mountains were consistently increasing from 2000 to 2005, but they generally decreased from 2008 to 2013. The influences of temperature, wind speeds and precipitations on snow cover variation at different altitudes vary greatly, with the snow cover being more sensitive to precipitation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter, while temperature and precipitation are the major factors that affect <b>the</b> snow <b>cover</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring...|$|R

5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided {{with the rise of}} the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tabloid press.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over a patch of mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets {{observed}} that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than {{at the start of the}} race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows like The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces. The View appearance was partly intended to help soften her public image, and it was widely <b>covered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press.|$|E

Nevertheless, Canadians and expatriate Britons, who had access to the foreign reports, were largely scandalised by the coverage.|$|E
