But in Greek ethimology, that Sanctification {{is the notion of}} expiation, purification of the people and the exemption from the influence of demons. The most recently this concept is certainly not strictly Christian, but has roots in ancient worship. In most parts of Greece sanctification for the first time (in those days) the eve of Epiphany called [...] "small sanctification" [...] or [...] "Protagiasi" [...] or [...] "Enlightenment". By protagiasi the priest turns all the houses and the Cross and one strand royal [...] "sanctifies" [...] or [...] "brighten" [...] (sprinkling) rooms of houses. The protagiasi is the effective means by which permitted in wild flight goblins except the lighting of a large outdoor fire.

Then, a dive of <b>Cross</b> <b>Sea</b> or nearby river or lake or the need to tank (as in Athens). Diving the Cross, according to popular belief gives the water cleansing and sanitizing capabilities. The inhabitants of many areas after diving run on sea beaches or along rivers or lakes and wash their agricultural tools and even icons. In common folk belief even the icons {{with the passage of time}} lose their original strength and value to the gain but again the holy water. It is this process not only exactly true survival of ancient beliefs. The ancient example Athenians had the ceremony (procedure) of known [...] "Wash" [...] as it was called at that carried [...] "in procession" [...] on the Faliro coast of the statue of Athena. There, they washed with salt water to cleanse from Fmoc and renewed the sacred powers of the statue. At Delphi the Theophania was an annual festival celebrating the return of Apollo from his winter quarters in Hyperborea.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental investigation on the statistical {{properties of the}} surface elevation in a special case of <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> conditions. The special case considered {{is the case of}} two irregular wave trains propagating in opposite directions, with the same characteristic frequency and wave number. The modulational instability of two crossing Stokes waves according to two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations describing the problem is investigated. Experiments are performed in the Hydrodynamic Laboratory at the University of Oslo, Blindern. The stability analysis shows that the unstable domain of the perturbation is reduced {{in the case of a}} <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> compared to a non-crossing sea, at the same time as the growth rates are reduced. Such behaviour is usually interpreted as an indication that the occurrence of extreme events is reduced. Experimental results show that the kurtosis, a measure of the probability of the occurrence of extreme events, is generally lower for <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> than non-crossing sea. Results of both the stability analysis and the experiments were in contradiction to the wide-spread mindset that <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> is more dangerous than non-crossing sea. The work presented in this thesis has demonstrated the need of further investigation, in order to fully understand the occurrence of freak waves in <b>crossing</b> <b>sea</b> with counterpropagating wave systems...|$|R

The spot where the sun set, though known by means of the compass, could not be traced by the eye; and again night closed on the wild, wintry scene, as if the little caravel was abandoned by hope as well as by day. To add to the apprehensions of the people, a high <b>cross</b> <b>sea</b> was running; and, as ever happens with vessels so small, in such circumstances, tons' weight of water were constantly falling inboard, threatening destruction to the gratings and their frail coverings of tarred cloth.|$|E

6000|$|The {{wind was}} now blowing strongly, {{but if it}} did not rise the boat would assuredly make the land. Archie took the helm, having learned {{somewhat}} of the steering on previous excursions, and the three fishermen tugged at the oars. It was a <b>cross</b> <b>sea,</b> for although the wind now blew nearly in their teeth, it had until the last half hour been from the west, and the waves were rolling in from the Atlantic. The boat, however, made fair progress, and Archie began to think that the doubts of the fishermen as to their making the shore were in no wise justified, when suddenly a gust, far stronger than those they had hitherto met, struck the boat. [...] "Keep her head straight!" [...] the fisherman shouted. [...] "Don't let the wind take it one side or the other. Stick to it, boys; row your hardest; it is on us now and in earnest, I fear." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was about}} {{six in the morning}} when the blow came on with a white squall, and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had {{increased}} very much, and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas I had then ever beheld. Every thing had been made as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another. Just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping listlessly against the mast. In two minutes more, in spite of every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay. The blow from the southwest, however, luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we {{had the good fortune to}} right the vessel without the loss of a spar. A heavy <b>cross</b> <b>sea</b> gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the gale. Captain Guy considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous.|$|E
60|$|I {{stayed at}} Oeassa four days, when, not finding any insects {{and very few}} new birds, I {{returned}} to Coupang to await the next mail steamer. On the way I had a narrow escape of being swamped. The deep coffin-like boat was filled up with my baggage, and with vegetables, cocoa-nut and other fruit for Coupang market, and when we had got some way across into a rather rough sea, we found that a quantity of water was coming in which we had no means of baling out. This caused us to sink deeper in the water, and then we shipped seas over our sides, and the rowers, who had before declared it was nothing, now became alarmed and turned the boat round {{to get back to}} the coast of Semao, which was not far off. By clearing away some of the baggage a little of the water could be baled out, but hardly so fast as it came in, and when we neared the coast we found nothing but vertical walls of rock against which the sea was violently beating. We coasted along some distance until we found a little cove, into which we ran the boat, hauled it on shore, and emptying it found a large hole in the bottom, which had been temporarily stopped up with a plug of cocoa-nut which had come out. Had we been a quarter of a mile further off before we discovered the leak, we should certainly have been obliged to throw most of our baggage overboard, and might easily have lost our lives. After we had put all straight and secure we again started, and when we were halfway across got into such a strong current and high <b>cross</b> <b>sea</b> that we were very nearly being swamped a second time, which made me vow never to trust myself again in such small and miserable vessels.|$|E
60|$|We {{now made}} sail to the northward, hoping soon {{to get a}} more southerly wind. Towards noon the sea was much smoother, and with a S.S.E. wind we were laying in the {{direction}} of Salwatty, which I hoped to reach, as I could there easily get a boat to take provisions and stores to my companion in Mysol. This wind did not, however, last long, but died away into a calm; and a light west wind springing up, with a dark bank of clouds, again gave us hopes of reaching Mysol. We were soon, however, again disappointed. The E.S.E. wind began to blow again with violence, and continued all night in irregular gusts, and with a short <b>cross</b> <b>sea</b> tossed us about unmercifully, and so continually took our sails aback, that we were at length forced to run before it with our jib only, to escape being swamped by our heavy mainsail. After another miserable and anxious night, we found that we had drifted westward of the island of Poppa, and the wind being again a little southerly, we made all sail in order to reach it. This we did not succeed in doing, passing to the north-west, when the wind again blew hard from the E.S.E., and our last hope of finding a refuge till better weather was frustrated. This was a very serious matter to me, as I could not tell how Charles Allen might act, if, after waiting in vain for me, he should return to Wahai, and find that I had left there long before, and had not since been heard of. Such an event as our missing an island forty miles long would hardly occur to him, and he would conclude either that our boat had foundered, or that my crew had murdered me and run away with her. However, as it was physically impossible now for me to reach him, the only thing to be done was {{to make the best of}} my way to Waigiou, and trust to our meeting some traders, who might convey to him the news of my safety.|$|E
