5|$|Emily Wilding Davison (11 October 1872– 8 June 1913) was a suffragette {{who fought}} for votes {{for women in the}} United Kingdom in the early twentieth century. A member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her <b>cause,</b> <b>she</b> was arrested on nine occasions, went on hunger strike seven times and was force fed on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by King George V's horse Anmer at the 1913 Epsom Derby when she walked onto the track during the race.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III {{did not like the}} idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the <b>cause</b> (<b>she</b> was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to be a combination of those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{became a}} member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2011. She has lent her support to several {{charitable}} organizations, such as the World Food Programme, Feeding America, and the Thirst Project. Along with Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, her co-stars of The Hunger Games (2012), Lawrence partnered with the United Nations to publicize poverty and hunger. She organized an early screening of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) to benefit Saint Mary's Center, a disabilities organization in Louisville, and raised more than $40,000 for the <b>cause.</b> <b>She</b> partnered with the charity broadcast network Chideo to raise funds for the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games by screening her film Serena (2014). She also collaborated with Omaze to host a fundraising contest for the games as part of the premiere of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014).|$|E

5|$|Anderson's {{return to}} Germany {{generated}} press interest, and drew more {{members of the}} German aristocracy to her <b>cause.</b> <b>She</b> again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers. In 1932, the British tabloid News of the World published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested {{the distribution of the}} Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations' legal bills against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{presented}} {{herself as}} continuing the English tradition of centralised royal government, {{and attempted to}} maintain a government in England parallel to Stephen's, including a royal household and a chancellor. Matilda gathered revenues from the royal estates in the counties under her control, particularly in her core territories where the sheriffs were loyal to her <b>cause.</b> <b>She</b> appointed earls to rival those created by Stephen. She was unable to operate a system of royal law courts, however, and her administrative resources were extremely limited, although some of her clerks {{went on to become}} bishops in Normandy. Matilda issued two types of coins in her name during her time in England, which were used in the west of England and Wales. The first were initially minted in Oxford during her stay there, and the design was then adopted by her mints at Bristol, Cardiff and Wareham after her victory at the Battle of Lincoln. A second design was minted at Bristol and Cardiff during the 1140s.|$|E

25|$|In August 1642, {{when the}} Civil War finally began, Henrietta Maria was in Europe at the Hague, {{raising money for}} the Royalist cause. Henrietta Maria focused on raising money on the {{security}} of the royal jewels, and in attempting to persuade the Prince of Orange and the King of Denmark to support Charles' <b>cause.</b> <b>She</b> was not well during this period, suffering from toothache, headaches, a cold and coughs. Henrietta Maria's negotiations were difficult; the larger pieces of jewellery were both too expensive to be sold easily, and politically risky– many buyers were deterred in case a future English Parliament attempted to reclaim them, arguing they had been illegally sold by Henrietta Maria. Henrietta Maria was finally partially successful in her negotiations, particularly for the smaller pieces, but she was portrayed in the English press as selling off the crown jewels to foreigners to buy guns for a religious conflict, adding to her unpopularity at home. She urged Charles, then in York, to take firm action and secure the strategic port of Hull at the earliest opportunity, angrily responding to his delays in taking action.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{makes her}} debut and only appearance in 2010's Heavy Rain, developed by French studio Quantic Dream. She is introduced in her apartment, {{being unable to}} sleep. After taking a shower and trying to sleep once more, she notices the apartment has been broken into. The two invaders then attack, though ultimately are revealed to be a nightmare caused by Madison's poor sleeping. Madison then goes to a motel {{to try to help}} her sleep, where she meets other protagonist Ethan Mars, who has been injured after attempting the Origami Killer's first trial in order to find his son (who has been abducted by the killer). Though she doesn't know the <b>cause,</b> <b>she</b> helps him to his room and treats his wounds. Later in the game, she tends to Ethan's wounds again after he tries to complete another trial. After this, Madison helps Ethan to avoid the police who now believe him to be the Origami Killer, though whether she is successful depends on the player's actions. After they return to the motel, or after Ethan arrives having escaped the police station after being freed by another of the protagonists, FBI agent Norman Jayden, she learns why Ethan is now on the run, and that he is completing trials to find letters of the address where his son is being held.|$|E
25|$|If a woman {{found her}} husband with another woman, she was {{entitled}} to a payment of six score pence (i.e. half a pound) {{the first time and}} a pound the second time; on the third occasion she {{was entitled to}} divorce him. If the husband had a concubine, the wife was allowed to strike her without having to pay any compensation, even if it resulted in the concubine's death. A woman could only be beaten by her husband for three things: for giving away something which she was not entitled to give away, for being found with another man, or for wishing a blemish on her husband's beard. If he beat her for any other <b>cause,</b> <b>she</b> was entitled to the payment of sarhad. If the husband found her with another man and beat her, he was not entitled to any further compensation. According to the law, women were not allowed to inherit land. However, there were exceptions, even at an early date. A poem dated to {{the first half of the}} 11th century is an elegy for Aeddon, a landowner on Anglesey. The poet says that after his death his estate was inherited by four women who had originally been brought to Aeddon's court as captives after a raid and had found favour with him. The rule for the division of moveable property when one of a married couple died was the same for both sexes. The property was divided into two equal halves, with the surviving partner keeping one half and the dying partner being free to give bequests from the other half.|$|E

500|$|Millett {{wrote her}} autobiographical books Flying (1974) and Sita (1977) about coming out as gay, partly an {{important}} consciousness-raising activity. She realized beginning an open dialogue {{is important to}} break down the isolation and alienation that hiding in privacy can <b>cause.</b> <b>She</b> wrote in Flying what Alice Henry calls in her off our backs review of Sita an [...] "excruciating public and political 'coming out'" [...] and its effect on her personal, political, and artistic lives. While she discussed some of her love affairs in Flying, in Sita she provides insight into a lesbian love affair and her fears of being alone or inadequate. Henry writes, [...] "Kate's transparent vulnerability and attempts to get to the root of herself and grasp her lover are typical of many women who love women." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Socialist Fellowship, Bessie moved {{steadily}} {{towards the}} centre and right of her party, distancing herself from colleagues {{with whom she}} had earlier found common <b>cause.</b> <b>She</b> did not support Aneurin Bevan when he resigned from the government in April 1951 over the introduction of National Health Service charges, and later asserted that, by making dissidence fashionable, Bevan had [...] "weakened the [...] National Executive {{to the point where it}} could no longer deal effectively with infiltrating Trotskyists and Communists". In 1955 her opposition to the Bevanite faction was such that she supported efforts by Hugh Gaitskell and Herbert Morrison to have Bevan expelled from the party. She regularly attacked the Labour left at party conferences, and in 1952 was involved in scuffles with other delegates after the unexpected success of Bevanite candidates in the NEC elections.|$|E

In April 2014, Minogue had launched a new campaign entitled One Note Against Cancer, which is a charity organisation to help cancer research.|$|E

[...] Some stories say that Mary's mother died with she was very young and her father, Peter Smith, died when she was ten. [...] Other {{evidence}} points to her father being incarcerated at the time. [...] Whatever the <b>cause,</b> <b>she</b> was considered an orphan. [...] Mary's uncle, [...] a John Rittenhouse, came to Union County and took the young orphan to his home in Greenfield where he [...] "dressed her in black" [...] and [...] "bound her out to earn her board and keep". [...] Mary Alice was taken in by Captain Reuben Riley as a [...] "bound" [...] servant to help his wife Elizabeth Riley with the housework and her four children; John, James, Elva May and Alex. As was customary at that time, she worked alongside the family to earn her board. In the evening hours, she often told stories to the younger children, including Riley. The family called her a [...] "Guest" [...] not a servant and treated her like she was part of their family. [...] Smith did not learn she was the inspiration for the character until the 1910s when she visited with Riley.|$|E

2500|$|Táhirih is {{considered}} one of the foremost women of the Bábí religion and an important figure in its development. [...] As a charismatic individual, she was able to transcend the restrictions normally placed on women in traditional society where she lived, and thus attracted attention to the <b>Cause.</b> <b>She</b> wrote copiously on Bábí matters, and of that volume about a dozen significant works and a dozen personal letters have survived. They are outlined (including the contents of some further treatises that have been lost) by Denis MacEoin in 'The Sources for Early Babi Doctrines and History' 107–116. [...] Around 50 poems are attributed to her, and are regarded highly in Persian culture.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{supporters}} however, {{claim that}} though she certainly {{has a record}} of being critical of the state of Israel given a sympathy for the Palestinian <b>cause</b> <b>she</b> developed while working as an international human rights lawyer, the idea of Morvai being an anti-Semite is [...] "simply ridiculous," [...] given {{that at the time of}} her alleged remarks she was married to a Hungarian of Jewish origin, with whom she has three children, but from whom she is now separated. In addition, Morvai is an independent public intellectual and has never become an official member of Jobbik. She was put on the electoral list of Jobbik for the European Parliament as an internationally recognized lawyer and human rights activist. Therefore, in some aspects, she has always enjoyed freedom from the party's official line.|$|E
