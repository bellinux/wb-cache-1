50|$|Charles Burrell started {{building}} ploughing engines from {{as early as}} 1860 in the very infancy of steam ploughing. These engines were built under license from John Fowler & Co who had patented the system of steam cultivation with two engines several years earlier. These early engines were very similar to Kitson and Hewitson design of ploughing engine {{with the exception of}} the drive to the rear wheels which was via chain. In addition Burrell produced, again under licence from Fowlers, a range of implements for <b>cable</b> <b>ploughing</b> including balance ploughs, turn-about cultivators and a patent small cultivator for use on light land with a single engine. Despite these early exploits and the company having extensive interests in producing engines for agricultural purposes Burrell paid scant attention to the construction of ploughing engines. All told the company produced 142 ploughing engines between 1860 and 1914 when the final pair of engines were completed for a customer in Germany. Early engines were often chain driven but later engines were gear driven speciality order engines for overseas customers.|$|E
40|$|As {{the use of}} {{offshore}} renewable energy sources such as wind and wave energy systems expands, they represent an increasing portion of the energy mix. Subsea cables connecting these resources are subject to many hazards, making cable burial using <b>cable</b> <b>ploughing</b> an important tool in preventing unplanned outages and downtime. This represents a significant installation cost for offshore renewables {{and there is a}} need to improve the accuracy of tow force, plough speed predictions and final burial depth of the cable. These are currently made using semiempirical models as the large soil displacements involved cause instabilities in the finite element analysis. This paper provides an overview of work to develop new material point method numerical software to allow <b>cable</b> <b>ploughing</b> to be analysed and optimised. The focus of this paper is the physical modelling carried out to provide validation of the software, which includes both 1 g and centrifuge testing, as well as considering interim ways to improve the existing semi-empirical models...|$|E

40|$|With the ever-growing {{demand for}} {{offshore}} wind energy, {{the number of}} submarine cables required to export the energy from wind farms to shore has also increased in recent times. These cables can be damaged when exposed on the sea bed, and thus need proper protection. Burial of these cables by use of a <b>cable</b> trench <b>plough</b> is one key technique to achieving such protection. A submarine <b>cable</b> trench <b>plough</b> {{can be used in}} various soil types, from hard boulder clay to loose sand. Because providing adequate protection is a critical factor in cable installation and the current calculation methods and theory use...|$|R
50|$|The current {{was carried}} by a {{flexible}} <b>cable</b> from the <b>plough</b> through the platform to the car's controller and motor(s). The running rails {{are not part}} of the electrical circuit. In the United States, the cars were sometimes popularly but incorrectly called trolleys but did not typically draw power through a trolley pole from an overhead wire as (strictly defined) trolley cars do.|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} the mobile steam engine allowed steam power {{to be applied to}} {{ploughing}} from about 1850. In Europe, soil conditions were often too soft to support the weight of heavy traction engines. Instead, counterbalanced, wheeled ploughs, known as balance ploughs, were drawn by cables across the fields by pairs of ploughing engines on opposite field edges, or by a single engine drawing directly towards it at one end and drawing away from it via a pulley at the other end. The balance plough had two sets of ploughs facing each other, arranged so when one was in the ground, the other set was lifted into the air. When pulled in one direction, the trailing ploughs were lowered onto the ground by the tension on the <b>cable.</b> When the <b>plough</b> reached the edge of the field, the other engine pulled the opposite <b>cable,</b> and the <b>plough</b> tilted (balanced), putting the other set of shares into the ground, and the plough worked back across the field.|$|R
