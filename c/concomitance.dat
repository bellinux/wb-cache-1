5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar of why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an azimuth of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the <b>concomitance</b> of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E

40|$|Hungarian {{represents}} a particularly fruitful ground for exploring voicing assimilation. Although this topic {{has been extensively}} analysed, a contradiction can be observed between most phonological descriptions and acoustic-phonetics-based studies of voicing assimilation. Theoretical works suggest that this process in Hungarian speech is a purely regressive, obligatory and categorical phenomenon, but in practice divergent realisations can be observed. In the present paper three case studies of voicing assimilation are performed. CCC clusters, CC clusters interrupted by pause and partially voiced realisations were analysed. The results showed {{that in the first}} two cases the speech planning process and the degree of self-monitoring were the most influential factors, while the various <b>concomitances</b> of voicing and devoicing arising due to aerodynamic and articulatory reasons resulted in partially voiced realisations. The variability of the data confirms the hypothesis that Hungarian voicing assimilation is a gradient and sometimes only partly regressive process.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} microvascular injury quantitatively in {{the small}} bowel with respect to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and related mechanisms. METHODS: In 10 male SD rats, normothermic CPB was established and continued with a flow rate of 100 - 150 mL/kg per minute for 60 min, while another 10 sham-operated animals served as controls. An approximate 10 -cm loop of the terminal ileum was exteriorized for observation by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy. The small bowel microcirculatory network including arterioles, capillaries, and collecting venules was observed prior to CPB, CPB 30 min, CPB 60 min, post-CPB 60 min and post-CPB 120 min. The intestinal capillary perfusion, microvascular permeability and leukocyte adherence were also measured. RESULTS: The systemic hemodynamics remained stable throughout the experiment in both groups. In CPB animals, significant arteriolar vasoconstriction, blood velocity reduction and functional capillary density diminution were found. As <b>concomitances,</b> exaggerated albumin extravasation and increased leukocyte accumulation were also noted. These changes were more pronounced {{and there were no}} signs of restitution {{at the end of the}} observation period. CONCLUSION: CPB induces significant microcirculatory injury of the small bowel in rats.

The conclusion obtained by this new application of the method is, that cæteris paribus the deposition of dew is also in some proportion to the power of radiating heat; and that the quality of doing this abundantly (or some cause on which that quality depends) is another of the causes which promote the deposition of dew on the substance.|$|E
60|$|The {{argument}} in {{the case may be}} put thus. Have specially religious races been proportionally truth-telling ones? If not, has there been any other cause at work in the development of mankind tending to increase veracity? The answer to the first question has all the simplicity of a plain negative. No such pleasing <b>concomitance</b> of characteristics is observable to-day, or has been presented in the past. Permitting, however, the dead past to bury its shortcomings in oblivion, let us look at the world as we find it. We observe, then, that the religious spirit is quite as strong in Asia as it is in Europe; if anything, that at the present time it is rather stronger. The average Brahman, Mahometan, or Buddhist is quite as devout as the ordinary Roman Catholic or Presbyterian. If he is somewhat less given to propagandism, he is not a whit less regardful of his own salvation. Yet throughout the Orient truth is a thing unknown, lies of courtesy being de rigueur and lies of convenience de raison; while with us, fortunately, mendacity is generally discredited. But we need not travel so far for proof. The same is evident in less antipodal relations. Have the least religious nations of Europe been any less truthful than the most bigoted? Was fanatic Spain remarkable for veracity? Was Loyola a gentleman whose assertions carried conviction other than to the stake? Were the eminently mundane burghers whom he persecuted noted for a pious superiority to fact? Or, to narrow the field still further, and scan the circle of one's own acquaintance, are the most believing individuals among them worthy of the most belief? Assuredly not.|$|E
6000|$|What {{essentially}} most operated, I make out, however, {{was that}} {{force of a}} renewed sense of William's major activity which always made the presumption of any degree of importance or success fall, with a sort of ecstasy of resignation, from my own so minor. Whatever he might happen to be doing made him so interesting about it, and indeed, with the quickest <b>concomitance,</b> about everything else, that what I probably most did, all the while, was but to pick up, and to the effect not a bit of starving but quite of filling myself, the crumbs of his feast and the echoes of his life. His life, all this Geneva period, had been more of a feast than mine, and I recall the sense of this that I had got on the occasion of my accompanying him, by his invitation, toward the end of our stay, to a students' celebration or carouse, which was held at such a distance from the town, at a village or small bourg, up in the Vaud back-country, that we had, after a considerable journey by boat and in heterogeneous and primitive conveyances, tightly packed, to spend two nights there. The Genevese section of the Société de Zoffingue, the great Swiss students' organisation for brotherhood and beer, as it might summarily be defined, of which my brother had become a member, was to meet there certain other sections, now vague to me, but predominantly from the German-speaking Cantons, and, holding a Commerce, to toast their reunion in brimming bowls. It had been thought the impression might amuse, might even interest me--for it was not denied that there were directions, after all, in which I could perhaps take notice; and this was doubtless what after a fashion happened, though I felt out in the cold (and all the more that the cold at the moment happened to be cruel), as the only participant in view not crowned with the charming white cap of the society, becoming to most young heads, and still less girt with the parti-coloured ribbon or complementary scarf, which set off even the shabby--for shabbiness considerably figured. I participated vaguely but not too excludedly; I suffered from cold, from hunger and from scant sleeping-space; I found the Bernese and the Bâlois strange representatives of the joy of life, some of them the finest gothic grotesques--but the time none the less very long; all of which, however, was in the day's work if I might live, by the imagination, in William's so adaptive skin. To see that he was adaptive, was initiated, and to what a happy and fruitful effect, that, I recollect, was my measure of content; which was filled again to overflowing, as I have hinted, on my finding him so launched at the Academy after our stretch of virtual separation, and just fancying, with a freedom of fancy, even if with a great reserve of expression, how much he might be living and learning, enjoying and feeling, amid work that was the right work for him and comrades, consecrated comrades, that at the worst weren't the wrong. What was not indeed, I always asked myself, the right work for him, or the right thing of any kind, that he took up or looked at or played with?--failing, as I did more than ever at the time I speak of, of the least glimpse of his being below an occasion. Whatever he played with or worked at entered at once into his intelligence, his talk, his humour, as with the action of colouring-matter dropped into water or that of the turning-on of a light within a window. Occasions waited on him, had always done so, to my view; and there he was, that springtime, on a level with them all: the effect of which recognition had much, had more than aught else, to say to the charming silver haze just then wrapped about everything of which I was conscious. He had formed two or three young friendships that were to continue and to which even the correspondence of his later years testifies; with which it may {{have had something to do}} that the Swiss jeunesse of the day was, thanks to the political temperature then prevailing, in a highly inflamed and exalted state, and particularly sensitive to foreign sympathy, however platonic, with the national fever. It was the hour at which the French Emperor was to be paid by Victor Emmanuel the price of the liberation of Lombardy; the cession of Nice and Savoie were in the air--with the consequence, in the Genevese breast, of the new immediate neighbourhood thus constituted for its territory. Small Savoie was to be replaced, close against it, by enormous and triumphant France, whose power to absorb great mouthfuls was being so strikingly exhibited. Hence came much hurrying to and fro, much springing to arms, in the way of exercise, and much flocking to the standard--"demonstrations," [...] in other words, of the liveliest; one of which I recall as a huge tented banquet, largely of the white caps, where I was present under my brother's wing, and, out of a sea of agitated and vociferous young heads, sprang passionate protests and toasts and vows and declaimed verses, a storm of local patriotism, though a flurry happily short-lived.|$|E

The purpose of the study is to validate an assumption that the enhanced quasi-trapped electron fluxes can be an important source of the ionization in the topside ionosphere in the range between the low and middle latitudes and to estimate energy deposition.

To achieve this, the medical records of all patients in Iceland who had received the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10 th Revision, diagnosis code E 27, were evaluated for true primary adrenal insufficiency. Additionally, these records were evaluated for concomitant diseases, as well as the mode of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. The study covered the whole population of Iceland over 18 years of age. It was thus a nationwide study. The records were retrieved from large hospitals and clinics and every practicing specialist in endocrinology. Primary adrenal insufficiency was found in 53 individuals, 26 women and 27 men, yielding a prevalence of 22. 1 per 100, 000 population. Hypothyroidism was by far the most common concomitant disease.

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom regarding European converts to Islam {{is based on}} the premise that the majority lack the necessary religious knowledge and being thus unable to discern between the various interpretations of Islam, they constitute easy prey for radicals. Moreover, the myth of “convert’s zeal” contributes to the belief that being ready to prove their dedication to the new faith and community, converts are ready and willing do to everything, including the most atrocious acts of political violence. This thesis focuses on the question that asks: Under what conditions do converts to Islam coming from indigenous European societies radicalise? In other words, which factors determine both their non-violent (ideological) and violent (with subsequent engagement in terrorism) radicalisation? Consequently, the research aims to examine what the radicalisation mechanisms are that may lead to such an activity, to determine possible regularities and to analyse viable implications pertaining to countering them. The research aims to establish the conditions under which conversion leads to radicalisation and terrorist violence; analyse recrudescent <b>concomitances</b> of causal mechanisms of this phenomenon; explore possible pathways existing between conversion, radicalisation and terrorist violence; identify key variables pertaining to causal pathways and processes; provide hypotheses regarding the radicalisation pathways, and establish a typology that can serve as a basis for further studies. In this way the thesis contributes to the existing body of knowledge on the processes of radicalisation, establishing a base for further studies and enabling others to follow with more nuanced and elaborate theories in order to provide contingent recommendations for policy makers. By dispelling many stereotypes concerning European New Muslims this thesis offers a new, contextual approach to the researched question thus inviting the reader to reconsider the concepts of “convert”, “radicalisation” and “potential”- crucial for analysing the widely expressed assumptions that European converts to Islam are a homogenous “risk group” and a security threat...|$|R
40|$|What are laws, {{and do they}} {{necessarily}} have any basis in morality? The present work argues that laws are governmental assurances of protections of rights and that concepts of law and legal obligation must therefore be understood in moral terms. There are, of course, many immoral laws. But once certain basic truths {{are taken into account}} – in particular, that moral principles have a “dimension of weight”, to use an expression of Ronald Dworkin’s, and also that principled relations are not always expressed by perfect statistical <b>concomitances</b> – the existence of iniquitous laws poses no significant threat to a moralistic analysis of law. Special attention is paid to the debate between Ronald Dworkin and H. L. A. Hart. Dworkin’s over-all position is argued to be correct, but issue is taken with his argument for that position. Hart’s analysis is found to be vitiated by an impoverished conception of morality and also of the nature of government. Our analysis of law enables us to answer three questions that, at this juncture of history, are of special importance: Are there international laws? If not, could such laws exist? And if they could exist, would their existence necessarily be desirable? The answers to these questions are, respectively: “no”, “yes”, and “no. ” Our analysis of law enables us to hold onto the presumption that so-called legal interpretation is a principled endeavor, and that some legal interpretations are truer to existing laws than others. At the same time, it accommodates the obvious fact that the sense in which a physicist interprets meter-readings, or in which a physician interprets a patient’s symptoms, is different from the sense in which judges interpret the law. So our analysis of law enables us to avoid the extreme views that have thus far dominated debates concerning the nature of legal interpretation. On the one hand, it becomes possible to avoid the cynical view (held by the so-called “legal realists”) that legal interpretation is mere legislation and that no legal interpretation is more correct than any other. On the other hand, it becomes possible to avoid Blackstone’s view (rightly descried by Austin as a “childish fiction”) that judges merely discover, and do not create, the law...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{incidence}} of vascular disorders and to estimate their contribution to the severity and prognosis of Behcet's disease (BD). Subjects and methods. Ninety-five patients with evident BD, followed up at Research Institute of Rheumatology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, in the January 2006 to October 2009, were examined. Their mean age was 29, 7 years; malefemale ratio was 3, 7. The onset of the disease was chiefly {{at the age of}} 21 - 30 years in 36, 8 % of the patients. Vascular pathology was evaluated by the following techniques: vascular duplex scanning; brain magnetic resonance imaging in the mode of venosinusography, contrast-enhancement chest computed tomography, chest and abdominal angiography. The data were statistically processed by the programs Statistica 6. 0 (Statsoft, USA) and EpiInfo 5. 0 recommended by the WHO. Parametric and non-parametric statistical methods were used. Results. Vascular diseases were diagnosed in 26, 3 % of the patients. The venous bed was mainly involved (88 %), the proportion of patients with arterial pathology was 12 %. Vascular death occurred in 2 men aged 20 and 18 years due to pulmonary artery rupture aneurysm and brain sagittal sinus thrombosis. Assessment of an association of vascular disorders with other clinical manifestations of BD revealed their correlation with erythema nodosum and epididymitis. The risk for vascular events in erythema nodosum was 5 times greater (OR= 5, 03; 95 % CI 1, 54 - 17, 41), the risk was higher in men than that in women (OR= 7, 11; 95 % CI 1, 83 - 30, 02 versus OR= 2, 15; 95 % CI 0, 16 - 61, 38). The male vascular risk is associated with epididymitis (OR= 6, 71; 95 % CI 1, 25 - 39, 89). In erythema nodosum concurrent with epididymitis, the relative vascular risk was increased up to 21; 95 % CI 2, 15 - 503, 94. Conclusion. Vascular disorders in BD were diagnosed in one fourth of the patients, mainly in young male patients. Severe thromboses with the development of chronic venous insignificance, Budd-Chiari syndrome, pulmonary and iliac artery aneurysms, and arterial thromboses were observed in male patients only. Vascular events were associated with erythema nodosum and epididymitis; in these <b>concomitances,</b> the vascular risk was substantially increased. Vascular death rates were 2, 2 %...|$|R
40|$|En aquest article s’ofereix un perfil del pensament de Rousseau a partir de la seva relació amb la filosofia estoica i la seva dependència respecte de les idees de Montaigne, alhora que es remarca —atenint-se a la Professió de fe del vicari savoià— la dimensió religiosa i espiritual de la seva cosmovisió. Sobre la base d’aquests supòsits es revisa l’impacte de les idees de Rousseau en el Romanticisme del segle xix, sense perdre de vista les crítiques que la seva pedagogia va merèixer dels ideòlegs del Noucentisme (Eugeni d’Ors, Joaquim Xirau). Finalment, es conclou que la presència de la pedagogia de Rousseau en el Moviment de Renovació Pedagògica, viscut durant les primeres dècades del segle xx a Catalunya, constitueix més un horitzó que no pas una realitat bastida sistemàticament i sòlidament. This {{paper offers}} an {{overview}} of Rousseau’s thought, using as its starting point its relation with stoic philosophy and dependence on Montaigne’s ideas, {{while at the same}} time highlighting —in the light of the Profession of faith of a Savoyard vicar, one of his most salient texts, as Rousseau himself said— the religious and spiritual dimension of his world view. It should not be forgotten that Rousseau not only turned away from the philosophy of the Enlightenment but also from those who maintained materialistic and atheistic theses, advocating instead a natural religion. Given these factors, it is not surprising that pedagogic naturalism found fertile ground in Catalonia during the first years of the 20 th century, as its adaptation facilitated the development of a spiritual philosophy that matched the views of many schoolteachers who conceived Nature as a living thing. Thus, its religious undertones and quest for a natural life, without losing sight of the demand for austerity, held considerable appeal for the Catalan pedagogic renewal movement. Indeed, the Romantic tradition acted as a bridge that, through authors such as Alexander von Humboldt, enabled Rousseau’s ideas to germinate in Catalonia. However, with the advent of Noucentism in Catalonia in the early 20 th century, authors such as Eugenio d’Ors published harsh criticisms of Rousseau’s romanticism. Other thinkers, such as Joaquín Xirau –who wrote within the historical context of the Spanish Republic— also moved away from Rousseau’s ideas about education. However, it is possible to postulate that Rousseau’s ideas triumphed indirectly through Goethe —the Romantic genius who came to be viewed as the champion of Neoclassicism— and Dewey, considering the <b>concomitances</b> between naturalism and pragmatism.

The thesis contains an initial assessment {{of the importance of}} research in this area (Chapter 1), followed by a review of the literature, focusing in particular on the theories and explanations of student attrition that have been advanced by other authors (Chapter 2), and on appropriate research methodologies and data collection techniques (Chapter 3). The investigation then progresses through a succession of different empirical and data-analytic phases. Because of his function within the organisation, the author had uniquely good access to the student records system maintained centrally by the University. This made it practical to sift through this information {{in such a way as}} to determine first the simple <b>concomitances</b> of retention (Chapter 4), and then to use it in a more sophisticated manner to develop logistic regression models of retention (Chapters 5 and 8). The challenge was then to decide which new, additional data should be gathered in order to improve upon these quantitative models. The solutions were found partly by recourse to some focus group work with students and staff (Chapter 6). This resulted in two questionnaires being developed to discover students’ attitudes believed to be relevant to retention (Chapter 6). The first survey instrument was administered to all first-year students as part of the matriculation process. The other was completed on-line in the course of the session as an adjunct to the IT Induction Programme for all first-year students. Chapter 10 contains the first outcomes of the attempt to improve the logistic regression models described in Chapter 5 by the introduction of attitudinal constructs, first on their own, and then in combination with the original background and prior academic characteristics in order to model summer retention. The amount of data available in this study is considerable and, consequently, some large-sample structural equation techniques were then used to develop some new, more comprehensive models of retention (Chapter 11). These are more informative, demonstrating how trade-offs can occur between different variables in an overall model of retention, and identifying particular areas where practical policy interventions are likely to be successful in ameliorating student attrition. It is demonstrated that summer retention is affected in roughly equal measure by academic and non-academic factors. On the academic side, it is shown that extra effort and additional academic help and feedback can benefit those students having relatively low entry point scores, for example. Social integration, at least in moderation, is beneficial, and it is positively influenced by living in university accommodation. However, various extraneous problems harm retention through the mediating variables of social integration and commitment. The models have a temporal dimension, and it is argued that students’ attitudes whilst on course owe their origins to those detected at the time of matriculation and, ultimately, back to levels of family support.

According to this school vyapti can only be known through perception of perceptible things alone and therefore, perception is the only means of valid knowledge.

Sobre la base d'aquests supòsits es revisa l'impacte de les idees de Rousseau en el Romanticisme del segle xix, sense perdre de vista les crítiques que la seva pedagogia va merèixer dels ideòlegs del Noucentisme (Eugeni d'Ors, Joaquim Xirau). Finalment, es conclou que la presència de la pedagogia de Rousseau en el Moviment de Renovació Pedagògica, viscut durant les primeres dècades del segle xx a Catalunya, constitueix més un horitzó que no pas una realitat bastida sistemàticament i sòlidament. En este artículo se ofrece un perfil del pensamiento de Rousseau a partir de su relación con la filosofía estoica y su dependencia respecto de las ideas de Montaigne, a la vez que se remarca a la vista de la Profesión de fe del vicario saboyano la dimensión religiosa y espiritual de su cosmovisión. Sobre la base de estos supuestos se revisa el impacto de las ideas de Rousseau en el romanticismo del siglo xix, sin perder vista las críticas que mereció su pedagogía por parte de los ideólogos del Novecentismo (Eugenio dOrs, Joaquín Xirau).

This {{paper offers}} an {{overview}} of Rousseaus thought, using as its starting point its relation with stoic philosophy and dependence on Montaignes ideas, {{while at the same}} time highlighting in the light of the Profession of faith of a Savoyard vicar, one of his most salient texts, as Rousseau himself said the religious and spiritual dimension of his world view. It should not be forgotten that Rousseau not only turned away from the philosophy of the Enlightenment but also from those who maintained materialistic and atheistic theses, advocating instead a natural religion. Given these factors, it is not surprising that pedagogic naturalism found fertile ground in Catalonia during the first years of the 20 th century, as its adaptation facilitated the development of a spiritual philosophy that matched the views of many schoolteachers who conceived Nature as a living thing. Thus, its religious undertones and quest for a natural life, without losing sight of the demand for austerity, held considerable appeal for the Catalan pedagogic renewal movement. Indeed, the Romantic tradition acted as a bridge that, through authors such as Alexander von Humboldt, enabled Rousseaus ideas to germinate in Catalonia. However, with the advent of Noucentism in Catalonia in the early 20 th century, authors such as Eugenio dOrs published harsh criticisms of Rousseaus romanticism. Other thinkers, such as Joaquín Xirau who wrote within the historical context of the Spanish Republic also moved away from Rousseaus ideas about education. However, it is possible to postulate that Rousseaus ideas triumphed indirectly through Goethe the Romantic genius who came to be viewed as the champion of Neoclassicism and Dewey, considering the <b>concomitances</b> between naturalism and pragmatism. The paper concludes that the presence of Rousseaus pedagogics in the pedagogic renewal movement during the early decades of the 20 th century in Catalonia is more a horizon that was aspired towards than a systematically and solidly built reality...|$|R
