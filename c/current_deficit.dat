There are two different views about the emergence of the <b>current</b> account <b>deficit.</b> According to the first view, the <b>current</b> account <b>deficit</b> is due to the increase in demand created by economic growth after the 2001 crisis.

Conventional wisdom has it that <b>current</b> account <b>deficits</b> in excess of 5 percent of GDP provide a warning signal to policy-makers and financial markets. However, {{there are reasons to}} think that this simple rule of thumb is not too informative. For example, many countries have had <b>current</b> account <b>deficits</b> in excess of 5 percent of GDP for prolonged periods, and have suffered no external crises, and some countries with <b>current</b> account <b>deficits</b> of less than 5 percent of GDP (Indonesia, for instance) have experienced serious problems.

The primary {{objective of the}} study was to determine whether Zimbabweâ€™s <b>current</b> account <b>deficit</b> is sustainable or not.

When a country runs persistent <b>current</b> account <b>deficits,</b> questions are raised on the ability of a country to generate future current account surpluses to meet its external debt obligations created by past <b>current</b> account <b>deficits.</b> The study applied the intertemporal balance model developed by Liu and Tanner, (1996) to assess sustainability of the <b>current</b> account <b>deficit.</b> The analysis involved testing the stationarity of current account to GDP ratio. Unit root tests were initially conducted by applying the ADF test. However, given its inability to discriminate clearly between non-stationary and stationary series with a higher degree of autocorrelation and sensitivity to breaks, the study also used second generation stationarity tests, notably the Dickey-Fuller Generalized Least Square (DF GLS), the semi-parametric Phillips-Perron test and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. In addition, cointegration a test was conducted which also give way to the Error Correction Model (ECM). The study concluded the analysis with Granger Causality Tests on the current and current and capital account balance and the respective sub-components. The results of the unit root tests amply demonstrated that the <b>current</b> account <b>deficits</b> violated the IBC implying that Zimbabweâ€™s <b>current</b> account <b>deficit</b> were unsustainable.

By taking a qualitative approach, the theory building research seeks further to understand branding {{from the perspective}} of the SME winery, and in doing so, go some way in addressing the <b>current</b> <b>deficit</b> in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - Bhat and Reddy's conceptualisation of brand functionality and symbolism is used as a branding framework to underlie the research. A multiple case study design was adopted as a research method to provide case data on eight SME wineries. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with the owner/manager of each winery, direct observation and document analysis. Findings - The findings are presented in the form a model of SME winery branding, which, in addition to distinguishing two approaches to branding, highlights the functional and symbolic values inherent in the brand. The findings endorse the notion that brands can simultaneously have both functional and symbolic appeal. More radically, the emergent model suggests interdependence between the functional and symbolic properties of branding. Practical implications - Practically, the findings highlight the importance of developing the symbolic values associated with the brand, which represent a more sustainable competitive advantage.
