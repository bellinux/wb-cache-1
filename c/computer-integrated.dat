25|$|C4-i Implementation System (abbreviation for Command, Control, Communications, <b>Computer-Integrated)</b> unit {{is based}} at Police Control Centre in all police contingents in Malaysia. This unit is {{assigned}} to patrol {{the city and the}} suburbs. This unit was first established in Bukit Aman and Kuala Lumpur is the first contingent to implement this system. This unit is equipped with the CCTV system which is installed {{in different parts of the}} city and monitored by the Contingent Control Centre and each patrol car is also equipped with C4-i's system connected to a laptop. The C-4i also plays a role in forming Rakan Cops in 2006 to foster closer ties with the civilian community. Since then, the crime rates in major towns have decreased and brought about good reviews on the C4-i's and Rakan Cops implementation.|$|E

5000|$|Enterprise {{integration}} {{has been}} discussed {{since the early days}} of computers in industry and especially in the manufacturing industry with <b>computer-integrated</b> manufacturing (CIM) as the acronym for operations integration.

50|$|<b>Computer-integrated</b> {{manufacturing}} (CIM) is {{the manufacturing}} approach of using computers {{to control the}} entire production process. This integration allows individual processes to exchange information {{with each other and}} initiate actions. Although manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone by the integration of computers, the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes.
