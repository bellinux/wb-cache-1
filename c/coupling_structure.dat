40|$|AbstractThe tunable filter with a {{constant}} bandwidth in its operating range is still needed. To meet this demand, a novel hybrid <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> between cavities using in tunable coaxial-cavity filters {{is presented in}} this paper. The <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> is constituted of rectangular window between cavities and metal rod across the cavities. Comparing to the traditional <b>coupling</b> <b>structure,</b> the combination of rectangular window and metal rod can introduce an almost constant bandwidth to the tunable filters in the operating range. In this paper, a 3 rd tunable coaxial-cavity bandpass filter operating from 110 MHz to 176 MHz with absolute bandwidth of 1 MHz is designed and simulated using EM simulation software HFSS. The simulated {{results indicated that the}} absolute bandwidth is 1. 2 MHz in the low frequency and 1. 1 MHz in the high frequency, a 1 % difference exists...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{is presented}} as a versatile technology {{that can be used for}} the definition of arrays of multimode waveguides and <b>coupling</b> <b>structures</b> in a stacked two layer optical structure, integrated on a printed circuit board (PCB). The optical material, Truemode Backplane (TM) Polymer, is fully compatible with standard PCB manufacturing and shows excellent ablation properties.

The stacking of individual optical layers containing waveguides, that guide the light in the plane of the optical layer, and <b>coupling</b> <b>structures,</b> that provide out-of-plane coupling and coupling between different optical layers, is very interesting since it allows us to increase the integration density and routing possibilities and limit the number of passive components that imply a certain loss.

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{observations}} {{of this paper is}} that the <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> and symmetries in this system are not sufficient to guarantee robustness of the heteroclinic behaviour observed in [11], but robustness can be demonstrated if we consider constraints in the system. For this case it is natural to investigate the invariance of a set of affine subspaces of the system’s phase space related to the type of synaptic coupling considered. More generally, we discuss cases of heteroclinic attractors that are robust, based purely on the <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> and the assumption that the cells are identical.|$|E
30|$|Generally speaking, the <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> of CSs is not constant. For example, in biomathematics, the {{dispersal}} rate of {{some species}} among different groups changes over time. When {{a natural disaster}} occurs, such as earthquakes and flood, some species will migrate to a safe place, then the dispersal rate of them will improve significantly. In epidemiology, the transmission rate of infectious diseases is also time-varying. For instance, population migration across regions increases greatly during the high season, and then the transmission rate of infectious diseases will be higher. However, when some regions discontinue with each other due to some reasons, the transmission rate of infectious diseases will be lower. All these facts can illustrate that time-varying <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> should not be neglected. Thus, we should take this time-varying coupled behavior into account, which can help us investigate the persistence of species and control infectious diseases. Consequently, {{it is essential for}} us to investigate the coupled systems with time-varying <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> (CSTCS). Unfortunately, as far as we know, few papers mentioned in the existing literature consider CSTCS.|$|E
40|$|Inferring the <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> {{of complex}} systems from time series data in general {{by means of}} {{statistical}} and information-theoretic techniques is a challenging problem in applied science. The reliability of statistical inferences requires the construction of suitable information-theoretic measures that take into account both direct and indirect influences, manifest {{in the form of}} information flows, between the components within the system. In this work, we present an application of the optimal causation entropy (oCSE) principle to identify the <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> of a synthetic biological system, the repressilator. Specifically, when the system reaches an equilibrium state, we use a stochastic perturbation approach to extract time series data that approximate a linear stochastic process. Then, we present and jointly apply the aggregative discovery and progressive removal algorithms based on the oCSE principle to infer the <b>coupling</b> <b>structure</b> of the system from the measured data. Finally, we show that the success rate of our coupling inferences not only improves with the amount of available data, but it also increases with a higher frequency of sampling and is especially immune to false positives...|$|E
