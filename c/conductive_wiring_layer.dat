40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} the electric potential distribution among two electric <b>conductive</b> <b>wires</b> {{connected to a}} potential source with different potential sizes. The research object was two electric <b>conductive</b> <b>wires</b> given with different potentials and arranged parallel like a parallel chip capacitor. The lengths of <b>conductive</b> <b>wires</b> and the distances among the <b>conductive</b> <b>wires</b> were made constantly which were 20 units of length and 20 units of distance. The variables used were initial and boundary requirements as independent variables, the lengths and distances of the wires as control variables, {{and the distribution of}} electric potential as the related variable. The numerical method used in this research was Relaxation method including the Gauss-Seidel Relaxation and Over Relaxation or SOR which was a form of Finite Difference Equation. Then, the result was compared with its analytic by using variable separation from Lap lace Elliptic Equation known. Relaxation method was a good method to determine the distribution of the electric potential among two electric <b>conductive</b> <b>wires.</b> The value of electric potential distribution obtained from the relaxation method showed that among the two electric <b>conductive</b> <b>wires</b> given with electric potentials also contained potentials ranging from the two potentials in the <b>conductive</b> <b>wires.</b> The difference of the result of electric potential distribution among the two electric <b>conductive</b> <b>wires</b> between the analytical method and relaxation method was 0. 1832 % for Gauss-Seidel relaxation method and 0. 1842 % for Over Relaxation method.

30|$|As {{described}} above, {{the basic}} geometry {{is similar to}} that of BepiColombo/MMO PWI/WPT-S. Each wire boom is composed of a 15 -m-long <b>conductive</b> <b>wire</b> and a 60 -mm-diameter sphere on its top. The <b>conductive</b> <b>wire</b> is made of stainless steel (SUS 316 L, diameter: 0.18  mm) and covered by a polyimide insulator (diameter: 0.43  mm) except a 0.7 -m-long top-side area, which is coated by Aerodag (a graphite paint). The sphere is an Al alloy (7075 -T 7351) shell with thickness of less than 1  mm attached to the tip of the <b>conductive</b> <b>wire.</b> In this configuration, the conductive top part, i.e., the 60 -mm-diameter sphere and the 0.7 -m-long <b>conductive</b> <b>wire</b> (its cross section: less than 5 % of the sphere’s), become the probe for contact with ambient plasma. Such surfaces are preferred to have uniform conductivity, photoelectron emissivity, and secondary photoelectron yield. The sphere surface, which has a much larger area than that of the <b>conductive</b> <b>wire</b> part, is coated with TiAlN with a Ti:Al ratio of 2 : 1 and thickness of ~  1  μm, as the spherical probe of MMO PWI WPT-S. As the prelaunch test, the nonuniformity of the photoelectron emissivity under the illumination of a deuterium lamp was evaluated using a vacuum chamber with the help of Prof. Kobayashi (Saitama University). In this study, the photoelectron emission from the vacuum ultraviolet light is observed using an electron emission microscope (EEM) (Suharyanto et al. 2006). The sputtered TiAlN and TiN surface exhibits a nonuniformity of 1.2 %, whereas the reference surface, which is a baked carbon coating (baked Aerodag) used in the Geotail PANT spheres, exhibits a nonuniformity of 2.0 %. The evaluation of the performance and degradation of TiAlN in space is one of the objectives for Arase’s WPT, as the pretest of BepiColombo’s WPT. The conductive part of the wire’s top-side area limits the influence of the surface potential of the insulated part on the top sphere. The remaining surface area, covered with polyimide, limits the coupling of the long <b>conductive</b> <b>wire</b> to ambient plasma. Inside of the deployment unit, the wire is covered with a copper-meshed shield (diameter: 0.61  mm).|$|R

To understand the mechanical issues of reliability, mechanical failure and compatibility of these electronic textiles, research {{has to be}} performed that focusses on the interplay of the textile with the electronic components and the <b>conductive</b> <b>wires</b> that feed the components. The {{aim of this study}} is to characterize the mechanical behaviour of the textile in combination with the interwoven <b>conductive</b> <b>wires.</b> Furthermore, a lattice model, based on the mesoscale structure of the textile, is proposed to describe this material behaviour. Tensile tests are performed in three directions to obtain the mechanical response of the examined electronic textile. In combination with these tests, tensile tests one single yarns and single conductivewires are performed to obtain their individual mechanical response. The measured responses are mutually compared to gain insight in the influence of the textile's structure on the mechanical response. Moreover, X-ray imaging is performed to examine the failure behaviour of the <b>conductive</b> <b>wires</b> within the textile. A systematic approach is proposed to identify the parameters of the model from the experimental results.
