5|$|Sulfur {{and carbon}} were known in antiquity. The {{earliest}} known use of charcoal dates to around 3750 BCE. The Egyptians and Sumerians employed {{it for the}} reduction of copper, zinc, and tin ores {{in the manufacture of}} bronze. Diamonds were probably known from as early as 2500 BCE. The first true <b>chemical</b> <b>analyses</b> were made in the 18th century; Lavoisier recognized carbon as an element in 1789. Sulfur usage dates from before 2500 BCE; it was recognized as an element by Antoine Lavoisier in 1777.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{is closely}} {{monitored}} by the Osservatorio Vesuvio in Naples with extensive networks of seismic and gravimetric stations, {{a combination of a}} GPS-based geodetic array and satellite-based synthetic aperture radar to measure ground movement and by local surveys and <b>chemical</b> <b>analyses</b> of gases emitted from fumaroles. All of this is intended to track magma rising underneath the volcano. No magma has been detected within 10km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1774, the species has {{been transferred to}} various Boletaceae genera in its taxonomic history, although it retained the original name given to it by German botanist Jacob Christian Schaeffer until a transfer to genus Suillellus in 2014. Several varieties, a subspecies, and a form have been described by European mycologists. Suillellus luridus is mycorrhizal, forming a symbiotic association with deciduous trees such as oak, birch and beech, and {{has been found to}} have a growth-enhancing effect on conifers in experiments. The fruit bodies are highly attractive to, and often infested by, insects, and several species of fly have been recorded feeding on them. <b>Chemical</b> <b>analyses</b> have revealed some aspects of the mushroom's components, including its volatile flavour compounds, its fatty acid and amino acid compositions, and the identities of the carotenoid compounds responsible for its colour.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} to format national food consumption data at raw agricultural commodity (RAC) level. In this way, the data is both formatted in a harmonised way given the comparability of RACs between countries, and suitable to assess the dietary exposure to <b>chemicals</b> <b>analysed</b> in RACs at a European level. In this approach, consumption data needs to be converted to edible part of RAC (e-RAC) level using a RAC conversion database. To subsequently use this data in exposure assessments, both e-RACs and RACs <b>analysed</b> in <b>chemical</b> control programmes should be classified via a uniform system. Furthermore, chemical concentrations in RACs {{may need to be}} converted to e-RAC level using processing factors. To illustrate the use of this approach, we describe how the Dutch RAC conversion database was used to convert consumption data of four national consumption surveys to e-RAC level, {{and the use of the}} FAO/WHO Codex Classification system of Foods and Animal Feeds to harmonise the classification. We demonstrate that this approach works well for pesticides and glycoalkaloids, and is an essential step forward in the harmonisation of risk assessment procedures within Europe when addressing <b>chemicals</b> <b>analysed</b> in RACs by all national food control systems...|$|R

40|$|P>Background Sitting in new chairs or sofas has {{elicited}} dermatitis {{in numerous}} patients in Finland {{and in the}} U. K. since autumn 2006. The cause of the dermatitis {{seemed to be an}} allergen in the furniture materials. Objectives To determine the cause of the dermatitis in patients with furniture-related dermatitis. Methods Altogether 42 patients with furniture-related dermatitis were studied. First, 14 Finnish patients were patch tested with the standardized series and with the chair textile material. A thin-layer chromatogram (TLC) strip and an extract made from the same textile material were tested in seven Finnish patients. The test positive spot of the TLC and the content of a sachet found inside a sofa in the U. K. were analysed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. All <b>chemicals</b> <b>analysed</b> were patch tested in 37 patients. Results A positive patch test reaction to the chair textile and to its extract was seen in all patients tested, one-third of whom had concurrent reactions to acrylates. Positive reactions to the same spot of the TLC strip were seen in five of seven patients and dimethyl fumarate was analysed from the spot {{as well as from the}} sachet contents. Dimethyl fumarate (0 center dot 01 %) elicited positive reactions in all the patients. The other <b>chemicals</b> <b>analysed</b> did not elicit positive reactions, but one patient in the U. K. had a positive reaction to tributyl phosphate. Conclusions Sensitization to dimethyl fumarate was seen in all the patients with furniture-related dermatitis. Concurrent sensitization or cross-reactions were common among the sensitized patients...|$|R

25|$|The {{scarcity}} of archaeological evidence for Roman glass-making facilities {{has resulted in}} the use of chemical compositions as evidence for production models, as the division of production indicates that any variation is related to differences in raw glass making.

Despite the publication of major analyses, comparisons of <b>chemical</b> <b>analyses</b> produced by different analytical methods have only recently been attempted, and although there is some variation in Roman glass compositions, meaningful compositional groups have been difficult to establish for this period.|$|E

25|$|In April 2015, {{nearly five}} years after the bottles were first found, {{researchers}} led by Philippe Jeandet, a professor of food biochemistry, released the findings of their <b>chemical</b> <b>analyses</b> of the Champagne, and particularly noted the fact that, although the chemical composition of the 170-year-old Champagne was very similar to the composition of modern-day Champagne, there was much more sugar in this Champagne than in modern-day Champagne, and it was also less alcoholic than modern-day Champagne. The high sugar level was characteristic of people's tastes at the time, and Jeandet explained that it was common for people in the 19th century, such as Russians, to add sugar to their wine at dinner. It also contained higher concentrations of minerals such as iron, copper, and table salt than modern-day Champagne does.|$|E
