5000|$|A feedlot or feed yard {{is a type}} {{of animal}} feeding {{operation}} (AFO) which is used in intensive animal farming for finishing livestock, notably beef cattle, but also swine, horses, sheep, turkeys, chickens or ducks, prior to slaughter. Large beef feedlots are called concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) in the United States and intensive livestock operations (ILOs) or <b>confined</b> <b>feeding</b> operations (CFO) in Canada. They may contain thousands of animals in an array of pens.|$|E
50|$|The dairy {{and poultry}} {{sectors of the}} {{livestock}} economy grew most rapidly in the 1980s. Dairy cows numbered just under 500,000 in 1978 but tripled to around 1.5 million in 1985. Consumers with rising incomes demanded more fresh and powdered milk for infants and elderly people. A large part of this increased demand was met by individual farmers who were permitted to purchase and own their animals. The government supported increased milk output by importing breeding animals and constructing large dairies and processing facilities. Most poultry was still grown in farmyard flocks, but reforms encouraged individuals and groups of households to invest in <b>confined</b> <b>feeding</b> operations. Egg output, especially, increased rapidly in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The {{definition}} of an AFO was developed by EPA as a regulatory definition to delineate <b>confined</b> <b>feeding</b> of beef cattle, dairy cattle, horses, swine, sheep, poultry, or other livestock from pasture-based systems (grazing systems were {{not meant to be}} regulated by EPA) for enforcement of the clean water act. The AFO classification is meant to apply to all sizes of operations and {{is the first step in}} defining an operation as a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations are facilities that require federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) water quality permits, irrespective of size. While state regulations differ from state to state, changes in 2003 to the NPDES permit program forced most state programs to adopt the AFO and CAFO designations, and thus the regulatory {{definition of}} an AFO is common across the United States.|$|E

5000|$|In various jurisdictions, {{intensive}} {{animal production}} of some kinds {{is subject to}} regulation for environmental protection. In the United States, a CAFO (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation) that discharges or proposes to discharge waste requires a permit and implementation of a plan for management of manure nutrients, contaminants, wastewater, etc., as applicable, to meet requirements pursuant to the federal Clean Water Act. [...] Some data on regulatory compliance and enforcement are available. In 2000, the US Environmental Protection Agency published 5-year and 1-year data on environmental performance of 32 industries, with data for the livestock industry being derived mostly from inspections of CAFOs. The data pertain to inspections and enforcement mostly under the Clean Water Act, but also under the Clean Air Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Of the 32 industries, livestock production was among the top seven for environmental performance over the 5-year period, {{and was one of}} the top two in the final year of that period, where good environmental performance is indicated by a low ratio of enforcement orders to inspections. The five-year and final-year ratios of enforcement/inspections for the livestock industry were 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. Also in the final year, the livestock industry was one of the two leaders among the 32 industries in terms of having the lowest percentage of facilities with violations. [...] In Canada, intensive livestock operations are subject to provincial regulation, with definitions of regulated entities varying among provinces. Examples include Intensive Livestock Operations (Saskatchewan), <b>Confined</b> <b>Feeding</b> Operations (Alberta), Feedlots (British Columbia), High-density Permanent Outdoor Confinement Areas (Ontario) and Feedlots or Parcs d'Engraissement (Manitoba). In Canada, intensive animal production, like other agricultural sectors, is also subject to various other federal and provincial requirements.|$|E

40|$|Characterization of karst {{aquifers}} {{in order}} to reduce the impacts of human activities on these vital groundwater resources poses a significant challenge for scientists, land managers and policy makers. Methods and criteria for improvement of karst management have been suggested by the scientific community {{in order to}} assure the preservation of karst groundwater resources. However, these methods are rarely integrated into national groundwater protection policies. A case-based study of a swine <b>confined</b> animal <b>feeding</b> operation sited on mantled karst terrain in the southern Ozark Highlands in the State of Arkansas, United States of America helped illustrate why karst-specific evaluation methods should be implemented in national legislation.

40|$|Dairy {{farm size}} has {{increased}} in the United States, while the profit margin has decreased. An alternative to <b>confined</b> <b>feeding</b> dairy farming is management intensive grazing (MIG), a grass-based system relying on rotational grazing {{for most of the}} herd’s dietary requirements.

The em-pirical application concentrates on how ranchers in Hawaii choose between alter-native methods of growing out their mar-ket animals. As on the mainland, market beef in Hawaii, other than breeding herd culls, is produced in two ways: steers and heifers are fattened either on the range or in <b>confined</b> <b>feeding</b> systems. Each method involves quite different uses of resources and produces a different product, and as such, can be considered a different tech-nology. The technology chosen by a firm which continuously faces a set of possible tech-nologies has typically been approached in one of three general ways.
