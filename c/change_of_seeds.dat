To achieve this goal in dormant weed species, functional relationships should be established between environmental factors regulating dormancy and dormancy <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> populations. In the present work, we used a simple model and an optimisation procedure to quantify the effect of temperature on Polygonum aviculare seed dormancy release and induction, based on germination data. Dormancy release rate was inversely related to temperature, showing a decreasing logistic trend that results in no dormancy release for seeds exposed to 20 and 25 degrees C. In contrast, dormancy induction rates in absolute values were positively associated with temperature, showing a logistic trend in which dormancy induction was almost zero at low temperatures and maximal at 25 degrees C. Derived model parameters were used to simulate dormancy <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> P. aviculare <b>seeds</b> stored under controlled and field conditions.

40|$|Background The Janzen-Connell {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} seed and seedling enemies {{play a major}} role in maintaining high levels of tree diversity in tropical forests. However, human disturbance may alter guilds <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predators including their body size distribution. These changes have the potential to affect seedling survival in logged forest and may alter forest composition and diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings We manipulated seed density in plots beneath con- and heterospecific adult trees within a logged forest and excluded vertebrate predators of different body sizes using cages. We show that small and large-bodied predators differed in their effect on con- and heterospecific seedling mortality. In combination small and large-bodied predators dramatically decreased both con- and heterospecific seedling survival. In contrast, when larger-bodied predators were excluded small-bodied predators reduced conspecific seed survival leaving seeds coming from the distant tree of a different species. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that seed survival is affected differently by vertebrate predators according to their body size. Therefore, changes in the body size structure <b>of</b> the <b>seed</b> predator community in logged forests may <b>change</b> patterns <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> mortality and potentially affect recruitment and community composition. ...|$|R

The trails were laid in 1977 – 1978 according to wide-scale All-Union program of 1972 year (Prokazin 1972) in the Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Leningrad regions and the Republic of Bashkortostan. The results of the most recent inventory of provenance trials as well as analyses of preservation and growth of spruce progenies with different geographical origin are presented. One of the main factors affecting spruce progeny survival was north-south distance between seed collection locality and test locality. At {{the time of the study}} (2010 – 2012), in the Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions, spruce progeny preservation was higher in the case of mother stands distant to the north. On the contrary, in the Leningrad region and the Republic of Bashkortostan, preservation of northern climatypes' progenies was lower during the whole period of plantations' growth. With the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> collection locality towards west-east direction, a correlation between progeny preservation and geographical origin factors was non-existent (Vologda, Arkhangelsk regions) or weak (Leningrad region, Republic of Bashkortostan).

40|$|Question: How does seed {{dispersal}} reduce fen isolation {{and contribute to}} biodiversity? Location: European and North American fens. Methods: This paper reviews the literature on {{seed dispersal}} to fens. Results: Landscape fragmentation may reduce dispersal opportunities thereby isolating fens and reducing genetic exchange. Species in fragmented wetlands may have lower reproductive success, {{which can lead to}} biodiversity loss. While fens may have always been relatively isolated from each other, they have become increasingly fragmented in modem times within agricultural and urban landscapes in both Europe and North America. Dispersal by water, animals and wind has been hampered by changes related to development in landscapes surrounding fens. Because the <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> certain species are long-lived in the seed bank, frequent episodes of dispersal are not always necessary to maintain the biodiversity of fens. However, of particular concern to restoration is that some dominant species, such as the tussock sedge Carex stricta, may not disperse readily between fens. Conclusions: Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal can be used to maintain and restore the biodiversity of fens in fragmented landscapes. Given that development has fragmented landscapes and that this situation is not likely to <b>change,</b> the dispersal <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> might be enhanced by moving hay or cattle from fens to damaged sites, or by reestablishing lost hydrological connections...|$|R
40|$|Histone H 1 has {{sometimes}} been reported to undergo quantitative and/or qualitative <b>changes</b> during germination <b>of</b> <b>seeds,</b> but the overall picture on this topic is far from clear. A re-examination of this problem seemed therefore of interest. The H 1 content from root tips of ungerminated pea embryos (with nuclei in a completely quiescent state) have been {{compared with that of}} seedlings germinated for 48 and 96 h (with nuclei actively involved in transcription and replication). As well as conventional analysis by gel electrophoresis, which seemed to indicate a striking selective decrease of H 1 content as germination proceeded, a completely different approach was used: biparametric analysis with flow cytometry, utilizing the indirect immunofluorescence of nuclei previously treated with a monospecific polyclonal antibody raised against pea H 1. This proved to be a powerful approach and the results ruled out the possibility of a true depletion of H 1 during germination events. Data from SDS electrophoresis of whole nuclear proteins and Northern blot analysis of the H 1 b cDNA during maturation and germination <b>of</b> pea <b>seeds</b> supported this conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Madagascar {{has a high}} {{diversity}} of endemic palm species and the Masoala Peninsula is a hotspot for their diversity. Several species are critically endangered and their populations known to be in decline due {{to a combination of}} land clearance, destructive harvesting for heart of palm and potentially unsustainable commercial seed collection. The critically endangered Voanioala gerardii and the endangered Lemurophoenix halleuxii are two palm species from monospecific genera endemic to Madagascar that overlap in their distribution within this region. This project undertook field surveys of all known populations of these two species to document their population sizes and locations. We modelled their area of potentially suitable habitat within the region and undertook genetic analysis to investigate genetic diversity and relatedness among populations of each species. The study found overlapping but contrasting patterns of potential habitat. It also found contrasting levels and patterns of genetic diversity between the two species that were not consistent with the modelled habitat distributions. We found that Voanioala gerardii populations are critically small but contain unexpectedly high levels of genetic diversity, which may indicate as yet undiscovered populations remaining. An active program to <b>change</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> collection and to involve local villagers and land managers in the conservation of these species would be required to prevent their extinction...|$|R
