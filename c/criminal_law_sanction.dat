The approach applied in this research is conceptual approach, because of its relation with criminal sanction philosophy which could {{be the basis of}} criminal law. The research was performed by using literary study. The legal matters is qualitatively analyzed. Using that method, the conclusions obtained are school of criminal law which developed in its era had influenced the Indonesian criminal legal scholar in formulating and connecting the theoretical framework and the criminal sanction philosophy inside the currently discussed reformation of criminal law either legislation or formal criminal law and material criminal law. School and philosophy of <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>sanction</b> has the role of reflection of Indonesian criminal law reformation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author deals with {{an issue of}} the {{criminal}} law protection {{of the right to}} life of two categories of persons whose life, in the opinion of some scholars, is not worth living. A common feature to all such persons is that they are not 'dying' patients; however their prospects of living are very poor while the quality of their lives is very low. The author points out that a question, whether a certain act that caused a person's death, is the act of a murder, depends on whether such person - an object of criminal act had the right to life at the moment such act was undertaken. That person possessed such right [to life], provided that the form of his life was valued as a life at that moment. The principle task that the author put before himself is to answer a question whether different forms of life described in this paper possessed the value of the life, and depending on the answer, whether such forms of life enjoy the criminal law protection. Almost the entire paper is dedicated to the critique of authors whose intention is to emerge with a unifying criteria regarding which life is 'worth' living and which is 'not worth' living. The author's position is that such criteria are not suitable {{when it comes to the}} criminal law protection of life. It is the conclusion of the author that criminal law should offer equal protection to each human life, regardless of its quality and despite of its ability to exist independently and the prognosis of survival in the future. Therefore, there is no life that, in general, would be excluded from the protection offered by the criminal law. This does not mean that in certain cases some actions that have resulted in a death of a gravely indisposed person may be excluded from the scope of the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>sanction.</b> However, we may not embrace general criteria on which kind of human life is 'worth' living and which is 'not worth living' but rather each case must be examined independently by applying the above stated principle supported by the author in this paper...|$|E
40|$|At EU-level, {{the use of}} {{substantive}} <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> {{as a response to}} illegal migration is materialised by both the EU legislator and the Member States individually. EU involvement in criminalizing illegal migration takes place in a twofold manner: directly, through harmonization of national legislations, and indirectly, through the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). An example of the latter is the case law of the CJEU regarding <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> for breaching an entry ban. In 2008 the EU adopted the Return Directive. This directive aims at establishing common standards and procedures to be applied in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals. To actually effectuate their return, the Return Directive provides for several instruments, inter alia, entry bans. In this article, we will analyse six judgments of the CJEU in the light of crimmigration law and make a distinction between the Member Statesʼ power to classify a breach of an entry ban as an offence and to lay down <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> in national legislation, and their power to impose such sanctions.

40|$|Recent {{proposals}} to reform Scottish criminal procedure {{are motivated by}} considerations of efficiency and accurate fact-finding, {{and there is little}} attempt to offer a normative account. This paper describes these proposals and contends that their emphasis on finding ‘the truth’ is misplaced on two distinct bases: (1) it equates erroneous acquittals to wrongful convictions, thus fails to uphold a fundamental tenet of criminal procedure, namely the particular importance of protecting the innocent against wrongful conviction; and (2) it fails to recognise the importance of non-instrumental process values which {{are at the heart of}} the adversarial criminal trial.  The paper suggests that it is only by adhering to these process values that the state maintains – and demonstrates that it maintains – its moral authority to condemn and punish offenders.

40|$|The {{substantive}} law which regulates {{the exercise of}} directors' powers is not self implementing. Action {{must be taken to}} enforce its observance. The legal system must therefore provide a reliable mechanism for enforcing the law which seeks to protect the interests of companies and, vicariously, the investing community. Unless that is done, the applicable rules are bound to deteriorate into voluntary obligations which the controllers of companies may or may not observe according to their whims. This article argues that dual (public and private) is required in order to achieve optimum enforcement of the law governing directors' fiduciary duties. Further, it advocates enhanced use of public (<b>criminal)</b> <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> as a means of promoting greater deterrence of wrongful director conduct. By reason of their stigmatic effects, these sanctions have great potential to deter undesirable conduct. Some of the impediments to the effective use of public <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> in this area are examined.

40|$|Social {{deviance}} {{characteristic of}} minors and adolescents in particular expresses types of social behaviors {{that lead to}} a deep concern {{on the part of}} society. These behaviors can be the result of failure in primary socialization, the absence of an affective climate in disorganized families, and are often determined by the impossibility of school, as a socializing entity, to compensate for the educational errors of the family of origin as well as the negative influence of peer groups. The failure of socialization can even lead to juvenile delinquency, behaviors that stray from the legal norm and fall under <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> so that a part of these minors end up under the supervision of probation services or worse, in the prison system.

While sexual assault in general is criminalized in these countries, sexual assault perpetrated by a spouse is entirely legal. The human rights violations inhere in acts of violence against women are now well recognized. Yet somehow marital rape is a particular form of gendered violence that has escaped both <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> and human rights approbation in a great number of the world’s nations. This silence in the law creates legal impunity for men who sexually assault or rape the women who are their wives or intimate partners, thereby legitimizing this particular form of violence against women. This is a human rights problem that cries out for redress, both legally and socially. An examination of international law and human rights norms demonstrates that state failures to criminalize sexual assault in marriage breach the due diligence standard and fail to comply with international human rights norms. The fact that there remain significant gaps in laws around the world ensuring legal impunity for men who sexually violate their intimate partners, indicates the scale of the human rights law work still to be done in this area...|$|R
40|$|Calabresi and Melamed {{delivered}} a powerful theory to explain {{under what conditions}} it is economically efficient to transfer a property right by voluntary and alternatively by involuntary transactions. In the first instance, the property right should be protected by a property rule or an injunction {{as well as by}} <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> in order to prevent involuntary transactions altogether. In the second instance, it should be protected only by a liability rule that provides compensation for involuntary transactions. Their theory is normative {{in the sense that they}} defend involuntary transactions under one set of conditions and voluntary transactions under another. However, their analysis is also analytical insofar as it predicts an evolutionary pressure on legal norms to encourage voluntary or involuntary transactions if the conditions, which they identified, are met. This article describes two diametrically opposed legal changes in Germany. In nuisance law, the development was from voluntary to involuntary transactions, while in privacy law it was from involuntary to voluntary transactions. We try to make it clear that these developments were triggered by the underlying causes that Calabresi and Melamed identified in their seminal paper on property rules vs. liability rules...|$|R

This article describes this capa-bility as ‘diversity awareness’.

While sympathetic to the ‘normative power Europe’ literature, the article’s critical constructivist approach notes reservations against the Universalist bias of that literature and proposes an approach that is more conducive to empirical research instead.

40|$|In {{determining}} {{the boundaries of}} what constitutes criminal conduct, each society or nation must look to the fabric of its own moral or cultural heritage to demarcate these limits. Every culture has its own notions of what constitutes right and wrong, of what is good and evil. Each society therefore must, and does, predicate its <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> and <b>sanctions</b> upon characteristics inherent to its own cultural norms. However, what {{is considered to be}} normal, acceptable conduct for one society is not necessarily acceptable for another. Social values foster norms, or standards of conduct, which are reflected within the criminal codes of these diverse nations. Conflicts between the <b>criminal</b> <b>laws</b> of different countries are to be expected in a world as culturally diverse as this. But what happens when such a conflict of cultural traditions is manifested within the legal system of one single nation? May conduct which is normal and acceptable in one culture be justified or excused when it violates the criminal code of the nation in which it is performed? The laws of a nation are not intended to be instructive of moral truth for mankind as a whole, but they must serve that function for the society they govern. (Lyman 1986) ...|$|R
40|$|For centuries, the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> {{has been}} {{struggling}} with the question {{what to do with}} mentally disordered offenders. When a mentally disordered offender commits a crime, society faces a dilemma. On the one hand, infringing the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> and the potential dangerousness of the offender prompt a <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> response. On the other hand, society feels the moral intuition that the offender might not be responsible. This dilemma results in a dual <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> approach: a legal excuse due to mental disorder and/or a safety measure such as the internment. The conditions for the excuse and the internment, both referred to as legal insanity, are legally constructed concepts without clear content. This results in all sorts of judgment and interpretative issues. The legal insanity judgment therefore leaves room for random judgments and legal uncertainty, but the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> hides this by involving psychiatric experts who have to make the judgments scientific and therefore more objective. However, psychiatrists {{do not know how to}} handle the legal criteria either. The legal sanity judgment can therefore function as an empty box that can be filled by the opinions and relevant factors of the parties. Since the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> serves symbolic functions, it is logical that they give interpretations that correspond with their emotions and desired outcome when the legal criteria are unclear. The research analyses the existing laws on the legal excuse due to mental disorder and the internment through the framework of the human rights on the one hand and the current functions and purposes of <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> and <b>sanctions</b> on the other hand. It wants to expose issues that the law maker has not tackled by the recent Internment Act of 2014. Moreover, it contains normative proposals for an optimal regime to handle mentally disordered offenders that has to serve both legal certainty and safety.

40|$|This {{article is}} a survey of {{behavioural}} analysis of <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b> Behavioural analysis of <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> exploits social science methodologies (behavioural economics, psychology and even sociology) to explore the effects of <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> norms and enforcement policy on criminals, judges, juries, lawyers and other decision-makers, to determine the optimal type and size of criminal sanctions, to identify the optimal design of the enforcement system and the rules of evidence. Unlike traditional economic analysis, the behavioural perspective is eclectic rather than unitary; it is composed of various psychological and sociological findings including cognitive biases and their effects, prospect theory, the effects of social norms, findings concerning the ways preferences and beliefs are being shaped and even studies concerning happiness. Behavioural theorists call for the understanding and at times exploitation of various cognitive misperceptions, biases and heuristics to increase the deterrent effect of <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> prohibitions and <b>sanctions</b> and/or increase their effectiveness.

This essay {{set out to}} investigate the relationship between labour <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> and the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> punishments for wrongful acts for government employees. This relationship is also set in the perspective of how acts or statements of xenophobia are handled within the Swedish police-force. Further, the essay aims to examine the principle of {{ne bis in idem}} in relation to labour <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> and <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> punishment for wrongful acts, and if these two should be considered in line with this principle. Regarding the relationship between labour <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> and <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> punishment for government employees, the determination for which system to use in any given situation is not fully stipulated. One key aspect is whether the act is carried out in exercise of public authority. By examining cases regarding xenophobia within the Swedish police-force one conclusion that the author has come to is that xenophobia more often is considered an insult (regulated in BrB 5 : 3) rather than wrongful acts in the line of duty. However, acts or statements of xenophobia are considered wrong and far away from the expected behavior of members of the Swedish police-force. By making an analogy with Swedish tax law an argument can be made that the relationship between labour <b>law</b> <b>sanctions</b> and <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> punishment for wrongful acts is worth examining, and might not fully be in line with the principle of ne bis in idem. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the ways}} our legal system has avoided confronting this ugly reality is through a {{commitment}} to legal formalism. Legal formalism allows us to ignore the social determinants that my AUSA friend saw every day as he prosecuted federal drug cases. As my colleague Professor Michael Seidman has suggested, legal formalism, which has been effectively critiqued and displaced by legal realism in many other areas of law, continues to exercise considerable influence over {{the way we think}} about <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b> This formalist approach, in my view, has strongly affected the way we approach the drug problem. One consequence is that we continue to pursue an increasingly futile war on drugs and refuse to see the issue in its broader, realist dimension. A little realism on the subject of drugs, I suggest, would go a long way. There is much to be said for formalism in the <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b> Formalism, with its commitment to fair procedures, clear rules, and restricted discretion, is a necessary part of any fair system of <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b> The <b>sanctions</b> involved in the criminal system are too severe to permit them to be allocated in an open ended discretionary or regulatory manner. The <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to formalism is thus not a fault, but a strength. Discretionary regulatory schemes too often invite subjective judgments susceptible to abuse, prejudice, and favoritism. Formalist rules, by contrast, are built on the promise of treating likes alike. Precisely for this reason, however, we ought to reconsider whether the criminal approach makes sense when there is substantial evidence that the commitment to equality has been seriously compromised.

As will be seen however, a wide judicial discretion is available for almost every factor {{to be taken into account}} in the sentencing process, and in the choice of sanctions. In Australia, decisions of which penalty to impose, and the quantum of that penalty, are virtually always a matter for the individual sentencer in their exercise of judicial discretion. This differs from the situation in other countries, in particular many jurisdictions in the United States. This book takes a principled approach to sentencing, by exploring key themes and issues which will resonate across and between jurisdictions, and by analysing examples from the various jurisdictions where appropriate. Each Australian jurisdiction now has sentencing principles enshrined in legislation, mainly discrete, but some incorporated within general criminal legislation. The book explains the legislation in the various jurisdictions...|$|R

International society is horizontal in nature and all states are considered equal. There is no higher authority to enact legislation to which all states must conform and no form of international criminal tribunal to resolve those cases which arise. In the absence of the appropriate legal machinery, international <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> is dependent upon enabling provisions in municipal <b>law</b> and national <b>criminal</b> courts. But the reliance of the international legal system on national laws and courts presents certain problems. Municipal law is restricted in its application by notions of state jurisdiction, the extradition of fugitives and by the limitations of inter-state cooperation. Therefore, the implementation and enforcement of international <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> is far from simple. Recent events surrounding the aerial incident over Lockerbie suggest that the United Nations Security Council is increasingly willing to enforce international <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> directly. Economic <b>sanctions</b> have been imposed against the state of Libya for its refusal to surrender the individuals alleged to have committed the bombing. In another development, the Security Council has established an ad hoc tribunal to hear criminal charges against individuals accused of serious violations of international humanitarian law arising out of events in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. However, such action by the Security Council is only warranted where the circumstances can be considered to constitute a threat to international peace and security. Thus, attention has shifted to recent international efforts to create a permanent international criminal court. The International Law Commission has established a working group to draw up a statute for a permanent international criminal court and its initial proposals have been favourably received by states. While none of these developments are final or decisive, they represent an ongoing process designed to secure more effective implementation of international <b>criminal</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of writing authentic credit contract as strong and legal evidence is legal guarantee for {{the parties involved}} in the contract. In drawing up a deed, a Notary has to adjust {{the evidence of the}} person(s) appearing to the other evidence. The research used legal normative method by analyzing legal provisions and conducting interviews with informants as the source persons. The position of a notarial deed as the law for those who make it is that a Notary was liable for any evidence before him in drawing up the deeds which were gathered in the minute of the deed. When the fraud is made by the Notary himself so that someone is harmed and it violates public interest, he is liable either for civil <b>law</b> or for <b>criminal</b> <b>law.</b> Administrative <b>sanction</b> will be imposed on a Notary who is careless in receiving and examining the evidence from debtors. The sanctions are in the forms of oral notice, written notice, honorable discharge, and dishonorable discharge. Legal protection for a Notary is regulated normatively in the prevailing laws and regulation. In drawing up a deed, a Notary should pay attention to the UUJN. He {{does not need to be}} in a hurry in drawing up a deed and giving facility to the persons appearing with the reasons of providing services and trust. He and his staf as witnesses should remind to one another if he forgets to attach the identities of the persons appearing in the minutes of the deed...|$|R
