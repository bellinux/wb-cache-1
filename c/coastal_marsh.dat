25|$|Much of the state's lands {{were formed}} from {{sediment}} washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of <b>coastal</b> <b>marsh</b> and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets. There are also {{many species of}} tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four {{that have not yet}} received recognition.|$|E
25|$|Dachs is German for badger, a {{term used}} for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by {{crossbreeding}} long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term Bracke {{was used in}} German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a <b>coastal</b> <b>marsh</b> periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.|$|E

40|$|Lesser Snow Geese Chen caerulescens caerulescens (hereafter Snow Geese) use two {{wintering}} habitats {{in southwest}} Louisiana. Snow Geese in <b>coastal</b> <b>marshes</b> generally have larger bodies and proportionally thicker bills, longer skulls and longer culmen lengths than do those in adjacent rice-prairies. An {{important question is}} whether or not these morphs are sub-populations that segregate during winter. Using a mark-resightings analysis of observations of neck-collared birds, annual apparent survival (Φ) and movement probabilities (Ψ) of Snow Geese were compared between habitats during winters 2001 / 02 – 2003 / 04. The analysis tested the hypothesis of Alisauskas (1998), based on his data collected in winter 1983 / 84, that larger bill size would increase Φ and decrease Ψ in <b>coastal</b> <b>marshes.</b> Specific predictions were that: 1) larger-billed Snow Geese would be relatively more likely to move from rice-prairies to <b>coastal</b> <b>marshes,</b> or have higher Φ within coastal marshes; and 2) smaller-billed Snow Geese would be relatively more likely to move from <b>coastal</b> <b>marshes</b> to rice-prairies, or have lower Φ within <b>coastal</b> <b>marshes.</b> Estimated annual Φ (± s. e.) was 0. 601 ± 0. 082...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ditching}} on the hydrological regime and ecosystem services of ditched coastal marshes—as {{well as the}} effects of hydrologic restoration of these systems—have yet to be extensively studied. The goals of this project were (1) to determine differences between ecohydrological processes in Ditched and Unditched <b>coastal</b> <b>marshes,</b> (2) {{to determine the effects}} of ditch plugging restoration projects on Atlantic Coast and Chesapeake Bay marsh hydrology, and (3) to evaluate Hurricane Sandy storm surge in the <b>coastal</b> <b>marshes.</b> Two separate pairs of Ditched and Unditched marshes were used in this study. The paired sites were adjacent, with similar topography, vegetation, and tidal patterns. Data collection included hydrological properties such as ditch density, tidal stage, water table fluctuations; as well as soil properties. Soil properties were similar in Ditched and Unditched marshes, while ditched marshes had lower water table elevations than Unditched marshes. Ditch plugging restoration partially restored the hydrological regime. A comparison of Chesapeake and Atlantic <b>coastal</b> <b>marshes</b> during Hurricane Sandy indicated similar storm surge elevations, but shorter durations of inundation at the Chesapeake Bay marshes when compared with the Atlantic marshes...|$|R

50|$|Hurricanes {{draw their}} {{strength}} from the sea, so they quickly weaken {{and begin to}} dissipate when they make landfall. Hurricanes moving over fragmenting marshes toward the New Orleans area can retain more strength, and their winds and large waves pack more speed and destructive power. Scientists working for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources measured some of these effects during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Andrew's surge height dropped from 9.3 ft at Cocodrie to 3.3 ft at the Houma Navigation Canal 23 mi to the north. For every mile of the marsh-and-water landscape it traversed, it lost 3.1 inches of height, sparing some homes farther north from more flooding. Currently Louisiana has 30% of the total <b>coastal</b> <b>marsh</b> and accounts for 90% of the <b>coastal</b> <b>marsh</b> loss in the lower 48 states. The engineering of the river has basically brought the Gulf of Mexico much closer to New Orleans, making it more vulnerable to hurricanes.|$|E
