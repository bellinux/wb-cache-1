The distribution of the price is given and there exists a <b>futures</b> <b>market</b> (see, for example, Broll et al. 2013). The terms at which the farmer can hedge the revenue risk through trade in futures contracts negatively depends {{on the degree of}} market transparency. Higher market transparency then affects the farmer’s production decision in two opposing ways. Firstly, price uncertainty declines and ex ante expected utility increases, resulting in higher production levels. Secondly, additional information <b>on</b> <b>future</b> <b>market</b> conditions may interfere with the operation of risk-sharing markets and thereby decrease ex ante expected utility and production levels.|$|R

This research also differs from previous work in its comparison and analysis of the holdings of large commercial and noncommercial traders, and demonstrates that changes in noncommercial positions in energy <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> are closely related to price changes in those markets. The paper concludes that noncommercial traders are likely to switch between markets and add to “hot money” flows, and that noncommercial traders follow price trends in energy markets rather than set them. ...|$|R

40|$|Traders in {{agricultural}} commodity markets view volatility differently {{depending on their}} objectives. Producers generally dislike uncertainty and often trade <b>on</b> <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> to mitigate the risk associated with potential changes in prices. If <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> themselves become excessively risky, however, due to high volatility in the prices of futures contracts, producers may begin to question the use of <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> to mitigate risk. Unlike producers, nonproducers— traders with no direct involvement in producing or using the underlying commodity—seek to profit from uncertainty by predicting which direction prices are headed. Volatile futures prices, therefore, present nonproducers with a profit opportunity.
