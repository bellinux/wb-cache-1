40|$|A typical 3 D color {{digitization}} {{system is}} composed of 3 D sensors to obtain 3 D information, and <b>color</b> <b>sensors</b> to obtain <b>color</b> information. <b>Sensor</b> calibration {{plays a key role}} in determining the correctness and accuracy of the 3 D color digitization data. In order to carry out the calibration quickly and accurately, this paper introduces an automated calibration process which utilizes 3 D dynamic precision fiducials, with which calibration dot pairs are extracted automatically, and as the corresponding data are processed via a calibration algorithm. This automated was experimentally verified to be fast and effective. Both the 3 D information and color information are extracted such that the 3 D <b>sensors</b> and the <b>color</b> <b>sensors</b> are calibrated with one automated calibration process. We believe it is the first such calibration process for a 3 D color digitization system. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

The color sorting based on the surface colors of tomatoes was attemped by using an opto-electronic system consisting of the <b>color</b> <b>sensors.</b> The sample tomatoes of each ripeness rate were prepared and tested by the color sorting system. As the ripeness rate of tomatoes develops from unripe to ripe, the surface colors change from green to pink or red.

40|$|In Chapter 5, we saw how <b>color</b> <b>sensors</b> {{convert a}} light {{radiation}} into an electrical signal {{to build a}} digital image. It describes the two currently most widespread sensor technologies (CCD and CMOS) {{as well as the}} emerging technologies offered by some manufacturers. These <b>color</b> <b>sensors</b> are nowadays ubiquitous in the objects of everyday life, but the acquisition devices equipped with three sensors are overwhelmingly confined to the professional sectors and to very specific applications. Owing to the complexity of their manufacture, these devices are costly and largely unaffordable by the public. A whole range of so-called “hi-tech” products such as digital cameras, mobile phones, and computers are thus equipped with a single sensor to form a color image, and so are many professional devices such as quality control cameras and video surveillance cameras. One reason for this is the dramatic advances in the operation aiming to obtain a color image from the sensor data...|$|R
40|$|<b>Color</b> <b>sensors</b> {{based on}} {{vertically}} integrated thin-film structures of amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) and its alloys were realized to overcome color moire or color aliasing effects. The complete color information of the <b>color</b> aliasing free <b>sensors</b> is detected {{at the same}} spatial position without the application of additional optical filters. The color separation is realized in {{the depth of the}} structure due to the strong wavelength dependent absorption of a-Si : H alloys in the visible range. The sensors consist of three stacked p-i-n diodes. The spectral sensitivity of the sensors can be controlled by the optical and electronic properties of the materials on one hand and the design of the devices on the other hand. In order to investigate the optical wave propagation within the device and to optimize the color separation we have developed an optical model, which takes the optical properties of the individual layers and the device design into account. The optical model has been combined with a colorimetric model, which facilitates the benchmarking of the <b>color</b> <b>sensors</b> and the reduction of the color error of the sensors. Finally, an improved device design will be presented...|$|R
