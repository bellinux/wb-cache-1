40|$|Abstract. The rate of {{chromosome}} aberrations {{has been}} studied in higher aquatic plants: common reed, sagittaria, flowering rush and manna. The main water bodies were Glubokoye and Dalekoye- 1 Lakes (left-bank flood lands of the Pripyat River), Azbuchin Lake and Yanovsky Crawl (right-bank flood lands of the Pripyat River), Cooling Pond of the Chernobyl NPP as well as Pripyat and Uzh Rivers. In decreasing sequence due to the absorbed dose rate for hydrobionts the first were water bodies of the left-bank flood lands of the Pripyat River, the second ones from right-bank flood lands. The highest chromosome aberrations rate in root meristems was registered in plants from lakes within the left-bank flood lands of the Pripyat River, the lowest one – in plants from the Pripyat and Uzh Rivers. The chromosome aberration rate in closed and slow-running water bodies within the right-bank flood lands of the Pripyat River was in 3 – 4 times higher than spontaneous mutagenesis level. It seems that spectrum of the main types of <b>chromosome</b> <b>damages</b> in plants of right-bank flood lands determines by chemical mutagens. The type of <b>chromosome</b> <b>damages</b> distribution in plants of the left-bank flood lands points to practically equivalent effects of radiation and chemical factors. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} hyperthermia (HT) on the frequency of chromosomal aberrations induced by a low dose of neutron or Y-rays in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were exposed to HT (41. 5 degrees C for 30 and 60 min, 43 degrees C for 15 and 30 min), 10 cGy neutron or Y-rays, HT + neutron/Y, and neutron/Y + HT. After standard cell culture, harvesting, fixation and staining, the chromosomal damages were scored in metaphase plates. Results: HT alone at 41. 5 degrees C did not induce chromatid or chromosome aberrations, however, the frequency of damages was significantly higher at 43 C (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, the chromosomal damages was significantly different when cells were irradiated with neutron or Y-rays alone (P< 0. 01). HT 1 hr post neutron/Y irradiation significantly induced higher <b>chromosome</b> <b>damages</b> in comparison to HT 1 hr before irradiation (P< 0. 05). The chromosomal damages were remarkably higher when cells were irradiated with neutron then heated at 43 C for 30 min. Conclusion: Since increasing frequency of <b>chromosome</b> <b>damages</b> increases probability of cell death, application of HT after neutron irradiation (instead of X- or gamma- rays) might {{be considered as a}} procedure for cells killing in radiotherapy.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that an extract of a {{sediment}} sample collected in a fishing area of Sado Estuary, impacted by the urban and industrial pollution from the city of Setúbal, was able to induce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in a human cell line (HepG 2) and in local aquatic species, probably due to the presence of PAHs and metals. However, the assessment of the potential hazard of those contaminants to humans, through extrapolation of the in vitro data, is difficult and thereby in vivo studies are crucial to better reflect human exposure and effects. This study aims to assess the in vivo DNA and <b>chromosome</b> <b>damaging</b> potential of a contaminated sediment sample from a local fishing area of the Sado Estuary. Groups of mice (n= 6) were exposed, through drinking water, to two concentrations of a sediment extract (1 and 2 g SEQ/ml), as well as to solvent control, for a 28 day period. The DNA and <b>chromosome</b> <b>damaging</b> effects were monitored at 7 day intervals by the comet assay (coupled with DNA repair endonucleases FPG and ENDO III) and the micronucleus assays, performed in blood leukocytes and immature erythrocytes, respectively. After sacrifice, DNA lesions, oxidative damage and histopathological biomarkers (apoptosis and inflammation) were analysed in liver, spleen and kidney cells. Preliminary results showed that at days 7, 14 and 21, mice exposure to the highest extract dose caused a significant induction on the frequency of micronuclei comparatively to the unexposed group (p < 0. 001), while exposure to the lowest dose raised the micronucleus frequency only at day 14 (p = 0. 003). No induction of DNA damage or oxidative DNA damage was observed in blood cells, at the 2 first timepoints. The results of DNA damage and micronucleus quantification at the 28 days timepoint, together with data from histopathological biomarkers, will be integrated and discussed in view of the contaminants present in the sediment sample under study. Overall, the results obtained in the present in vivo study are expected to reflect the potential hazard to human health associated to the contamination of estuary water and sediments and to contribute to risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDNA {{replication}} {{and repair}} are two fundamental processes required in life proliferation and cellular defense and some common proteins {{are involved in}} both processes. The filamen-tous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 is capable of forming heterocysts for N 2 fixation {{in the absence of}} a combined-nitrogen source. This developmental process is intimately linked to cell cycle control. In this study, we investigated the localization of the DNA double-strand break repair protein RecN during key cellular events, such as <b>chromosome</b> <b>damaging,</b> cell division, and heterocyst differentiation. Treatment by a drug causing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced reorganization of the RecN focus preferentially towards the mid-cell position. RecN-GFP was absent in most mature heterocysts.

40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} DNA-protein complexes at {{the ends}} of eukaryotic chromosomes. They protect the chromosome extremities by preventing potential <b>chromosome</b> <b>damages</b> such as loss of terminal sequences during chromosome replication and by preventing chromosome fusions and degradation. The telomeres of most organisms contain short terminal GC-rich repeats due to the activity of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein DNA polymerase. Telomeres have gained an exceptional widespread interest in human biology because of their involvement in aging and carcinogenic processes. Despite the fact that the telomere concept was elaborated in Dros phila melanogaster, this organism lacks telomerase and its telomeres are dramatically different from those in other organisms.

For all of these endpoints, RBE peaks at around 100 to 200 keV/μm before it decreases at very high-LET. However, the quality of <b>chromosome</b> <b>damage</b> is different when heavy ions are compared to sparsely ionizing radiation. Large differences in gene expression are observed between x-rays and HZE ions, thus reflecting differences in damages response pathways. Qualitative differences in the type of gene mutations have also been reported.

Because of this high mass and strong absorption, if alpha-emitting radionuclides do enter the body (upon being inhaled, ingested, or injected, as {{with the use of}} Thorotrast for high-quality X-ray images prior to the 1950s), alpha radiation is the most destructive form of ionizing radiation. It is the most strongly ionizing, and with large enough doses can cause any or all of the symptoms of radiation poisoning. It is estimated that <b>chromosome</b> <b>damage</b> from alpha particles is anywhere from 10 to 1000 times greater than that caused by an equivalent amount of gamma or beta radiation, with the average being set at 20 times.

Different experimental protocols were utilized to investigate SCE induction. Induced exchange levels varied considerably between resting (Go) lymphocytes and replicating lymphocytes, and between replicating lymphocytes that had incorporated BrdUrd prior to chemical or physical challenge and those lymphocytes that had not. It appeared that incorporation of BrdUrd into chromosomal DNA increased lymphocyte sensitivity to damage by most agents.

40|$|Abstract: The {{formation}} of clastogenic factors (CF) and their damaging effects are mediated by superoxide, since superoxide dismutase is regularly protective. CF are produced via superoxide and stimulate {{the production of}} superoxide by monocytes and neutrophils. This results in a selfsustaining and longlasting process of clastogenesis, which may exceed the DNA repair system and ultimately lead to cancer (Emerit, 1994). An increased cancer risk is indeed observed in conditions accompanied by CF formation. These include irradiated persons, patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, HIV-infected persons and the chromosomal breakage syndromes ataxia telangiectasia, Bloom’s syndrome and Fanconi’s anemia. Biochemical analysis has identified lipid peroxidation products, arachidonic acid metabolites, nucleotides of inosine and cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor alpha, as the clastogenic and also superoxide stimulating components of CF. Due to their <b>chromosome</b> <b>damaging</b> effects, these oxidants can be detected with classical cytogenetic techniques. Their synergistic action renders the CF-test particularly sensitive {{for the detection of}} a pro-oxidant state. Correlations were observed between CF and other biomarkers of oxidative stress such as decreases in total plasma thiols or increases in TBARS or chemiluminescence. Correlations between CF and disease activity, between CF and radiation exposure, suggest the study of CF for monitoring these conditions. CF may also be useful as biochemical markers and intermediate endpoints for the evaluation of promising antioxidant drugs. CF formation represents a link between chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Prophylactic use of superoxide scavengers as anticarcinogens is therefore suggested...|$|R
