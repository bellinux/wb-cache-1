5000|$|Greatly {{simplified}} single-revolution clutches {{were developed}} in the 20th century, requiring much smaller operating forces and in some variations, allowing for a fixed fraction of a revolution per operation. [...] Fast action friction clutches replaced dog clutches in some applications, eliminating the problem of impact loading on the dogs every time the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pulling {{away from}} rest is easily {{achievable}} without pedal assistance {{owing to the}} relatively high torque the motor delivers {{but this is not}} recommended practice as the frail clutch will fail rapidly with this sort of treatment. Pedal assisted starts are therefore much recommended. In fact, engine starting can be done by pedalling away from rest with the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> using the decompressor.|$|E
5000|$|The default {{state of}} the clutch is engaged - that is the {{connection}} between engine and gearbox is always [...] "on" [...] unless the driver presses the pedal and disengages it. If the engine is running with the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> and the transmission in neutral, the engine spins the input shaft of the transmission but power is not transmitted to the wheels.|$|E

5000|$|The {{underside}} of each link features a small metal finger called a [...] "drive link" [...] (also DL) which locates the chain on the bar, helps to carry lubricating oil around the bar, and engages with the engine's drive sprocket {{inside the body}} of the saw.

50|$|Excessively revving {{the engine}} while using clutch control, or keeping the <b>clutch</b> {{partially}} <b>engaged</b> while accelerating with the gas pedal, can cause unnecessary {{damage to the}} clutch.|$|R
50|$|When {{the engine}} starts, the car pauses for 11 s - if {{equipped}} with a manual gearbox, 6 s in neutral (with <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged)</b> and 5 s in the 1st gear (with clutch disengaged) - then slowly accelerates to 15 km/h in 4 s, cruises at constant speed for 8 s, brakes to a full stop in 5 s (manual: last 3 s with clutch disengaged), then stops for 21 s (manual: 16 s in neutral, then 5 s in the 1st gear).|$|E
50|$|A manual transmission, {{also known}} as a manual gearbox, stick shift, n-speed manual (where n is its number of forward gear ratios), standard, MT, or in colloquial U.S. English, a stick (for {{vehicles}} with hand-lever shifters), is a type of transmission used in motor vehicle applications. It uses a driver-operated <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> and disengaged by a foot pedal (automobile) or hand lever (motorcycle), for regulating torque transfer from the engine to the transmission; and a gear selector operated by hand (automobile) or by foot (motorcycle).|$|E
50|$|At 117 s, the car slowly accelerates to 50 km/h in 26 s (manual: 5 s, 9 s and 8 s in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears, with {{additional}} 2 × 2 s for gear changes), cruises for 12 s, decelerates to 35 km/h in 8 s, cruises for another 13 s, brakes {{to a full}} stop in 12 s (manual: 2 s change to the 2nd gear, 7 s in the 2nd gear, last 3 s with clutch disengaged), then pauses for 7 s (manual: in neutral with <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hohenzollern {{supplied}} a [...] {{diesel-mechanical locomotive}} to the Russian State Railways in the 1920s. This had a constant-mesh gearbox {{with an individual}} electromagnetic <b>clutch</b> to <b>engage</b> each gear.|$|R
50|$|A form of {{differential}} action {{was obtained by}} building each front drive sprocket with a two-way <b>clutch.</b> These <b>clutches</b> <b>engaged</b> when the shaft upon which they were mounted turned in either direction, but disengaged when the wheel turned them faster than the shaft. When driven in a straight line, both <b>clutches</b> would <b>engage,</b> and provide power to both rear wheels. When the car went around a corner, the outside wheel turned slightly faster than the inside wheel, disengaging the sprocket for the outside wheel, and propelling {{the car with the}} inside wheel only. On slippery roads, such as in deep mud, snow, or sand, if one wheel lost traction the other wheel would continue to pull, allowing the car the continue moving until either both wheels found traction once more, or both wheels lost traction completely. Because the cars were very light weight, they were capable of being driven through mud or snow which would immobilize heavier cars with conventional differentials.|$|R
5000|$|A dual-clutch {{transmission}} alternately uses {{two sets}} of internals, {{each with its own}} clutch, so that a [...] "gearchange" [...] actually only consists of one <b>clutch</b> <b>engaging</b> as the other disengages—providing a supposedly [...] "seamless" [...] shift with no break in (or jarring reuptake of) power transmission. Each clutch's attached shaft carries half of the total input gear complement (with a shared output shaft), including synchronised dog clutch systems that pre-select which of its set of ratios is most likely needed at the next shift, under command of a computerised control system. Specific types of this transmission include: Direct-Shift Gearbox.|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the shifters is also a matter of design; it need {{not be the case}} that all of the free-rotating gears with selectors are on one shaft, and the permanently splined gears on the other. For instance a five-speed transmission might have the first-to-second selectors on the countershaft, but the third-to-fourth selector and the fifth selector on the mainshaft, which is the configuration in the 1998 Honda Civic. This means that when the car is stopped and idling in neutral with the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> and the input shaft spinning, the third, fourth and fifth gear pairs do not rotate.|$|E
50|$|The Corvair Powerglide {{provided}} one reduction {{range and}} reverse, {{in addition to}} direct drive and neutral. Low and Reverse ranges were a 1.82 ratio reduction, using a single planetary gearset. Locking the planetary geartrain provided a 1:1 direct drive. The differential driven rear pump permitted push-starting the Powerglide-equipped Corvair (the last American automatic to do so), at speeds over 18 mph by creating adequate pressure to engage low band and turn over the engine via the torque converter. A multiple plate <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> reverse range, low was braked using a band on the forward clutch drum, and direct provided via clutches. The torque converter of the Corvair offered 2.6:1 reduction at stall, and improved car performance when engine speeds were below ~2000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{the car in}} gear {{with the}} <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> causes it to lurch {{forwards}} or backwards, since the starter motor by itself produces sufficient torque to move the whole vehicle; this can be highly dangerous, especially if the parking brake is not firmly applied and can be injurious to the starter and drivetrain. Therefore, novice drivers are taught to rock the knob of a manual gearbox {{from side to side}} before starting the engine to confirm that the gearbox is in neutral. For the same reason, modern cars require the clutch pedal to be depressed before the starter will engage. The latter practice is also useful in extremely cold conditions or with a weak battery, as it avoids the starter motor also having to turn over a gearbox full of cold and highly viscous oil.|$|E
50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate dog <b>clutches</b> instead to <b>engage</b> gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog <b>clutch,</b> that gradually <b>engages</b> the gears and matches their speed before the dog <b>clutch</b> <b>engages.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{a cooling}} fan for the {{honeycomb}} radiator and the engine incorporates a pump to ensure the flow of coolant. Lubrication is forced by pump to all the bearings. A float indicator shows the depth {{of oil in the}} crank chamber. Ignition is by High Tension Bosch magneto and may be manually advanced or retarded. The carburettor is by Claudel.The thin steel-cone <b>clutch</b> <b>engages</b> with the Ferodo lined flywheel. The Ferodo linings are in sections which may be replaced individually. The gearbox is suspended at four points. It is operated by a hand lever controlled by a gate and now has four speeds forward and reverse.|$|R
25|$|Note: {{the above}} all {{function}} like 2WD when multi-plate clutch coupling is not engaged (with exception of Subaru models), and like 4WD highrange in a part-time 4WD system when the <b>clutch</b> is <b>engaged</b> (usually by computer although some allow manual control). Some {{in this category}} have varying degrees of control in the torque distribution between front and rear by allowing some of the clutches in a multi-plate <b>clutch</b> coupling to <b>engage</b> and slip varying amounts. An example of a system like this is the BorgWarner i-Trac(TM) system.|$|R
50|$|The {{design team}} gained {{confidence}} in their concept in 1989, when they made a breakthrough in the multi-disc clutch's control system. Development of closed-loop control smoothed its operation. Using it, the multi-disc clutch made smaller adjustments, but did it more frequently. The microprocessor would review input from sensors every 20 milliseconds and decide if the front axle needed more torque. Using this technique, the unit's computer watched for drive wheel slip. If it sensed as little as half an rpm difference between {{the front and rear}} axles, it sent a power signal to the multi-disc clutch. The <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged,</b> diverting torque to the front axle in 10 percent increments, until it alleviated the drive wheel slip. As a result, the system could control runaway drive wheel speed in as little as a third of a wheel revolution.|$|E
5000|$|Farwell {{had more}} ideas to offer. For 1908, a new Model 9 50 hp appeared. It seems {{this the first}} Adams-Farwell with a new and ingenious four speed transmission. Since most {{contemporary}} cars had three speeds, the new Adams-Farwell offered an ingenious construction consisting of the transmission, two clutches, a lever for each of them, and one handle to operate the levers. One <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> gears 2 and 4, the other gears 1, 3, and reverse. So, two speeds could be [...] "preselected", but the one-handle operation prevented two speeds being engaged at the same time. Further, antiquated tiller steering {{was replaced by a}} wheel, and there was a pedal for acceleration. Therefore, the removable steering was no longer offered, but Adams-Farwells got a rail instead in which the column and pedal could be moved from the left to the right, allowing the driver to sit either at the left, the right or in the center. Model 9 came as 7-passenger touring, a 3-passenger coupé, and 3-passenger roadster, the latter replacing the Model 8-A, featuring normal chassis and body construction.|$|E
50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the <b>clutch,</b> <b>engaged</b> the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|E
5000|$|The Times, {{when they}} had a car on test, commented favourably on the new clutch, saying no {{previous}} Austin <b>clutch</b> had <b>engaged</b> smoothly and added [...] "the car is built for steady economical running rather than for speed or brilliance".|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As an {{important}} part of vehicle following control system, vehicle longitudinal dynamic model had significant effect on the research and development phases. The <b>clutch</b> <b>engaging</b> and exhaust brake process of AMT vehicle represented strong nonlinearity, and the theoretical models were complex and depended on many parameters. Focusing on the requirement of following control system, the models of the two processes above were simplified for the engineering application by combining theoretical analysis and real vehicle test data to describe the dynamic processes. Finally, the vehicle model based on MATLAB was build and the comparative experiments were conducted. The comparative results show that the simulation results agree well with the real vehicle tests...|$|R
50|$|In the wet the car also {{exhibited}} {{a tendency to}} momentarily lock the rear wheels during downchanges. This however was alleviated with the fitting of a power throttle system at Imola ensuring that the revs could be perfectly matched when the <b>clutch</b> was <b>engaged.</b>|$|R
50|$|In both types, a {{particular}} gear combination {{can only be}} engaged when the two parts to engage (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for the next gear are at a proper speed to engage. The vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower gear, the transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used {{to speed up the}} engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for engaging the next lower gear. For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the clutch, shift to neutral, then engage the clutch momentarily to force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to the next gear, a process called double clutching. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged</b> to the engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.|$|E
5000|$|When a {{car with}} a manual {{transmission}} is in motion with the <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged,</b> there is a mechanical connection between the engine and wheels which keep them in sync with each other. When shifting however, depressing the clutch is required. This breaks the mechanical connection between the engine and wheels, and the engine speed is no longer linked to that of the wheels. When upshifting, this is usually not a problem, as the tendency of the engine to reduce speed itself without gas will slow it to loosely match the lower speed of the higher gear. However, when downshifting, the engine needs to speed up to come to speed with the wheels. If the accelerator is not [...] "blipped" [...] (or briefly and quickly pressed to speed up the disengaged engine), the engine will have to take power from the wheels and momentum of the car to come to speed, which is often accompanied by a sudden deceleration of the vehicle due to the power suddenly going to the engine, often described as a [...] "lurch" [...] or [...] "jolt". This sudden external acceleration of the engine through the transmission also causes increased wear on the mechanics of the car. Therefore, a staple of advanced or professional manual-transmission driving is the [...] "rev match", or [...] "throttle blip", in which the driver quickly brings the engine up to speed with the wheels by use of the throttle. As downshifting is often necessary when accelerating into or out of a curve or other slow-down, advanced techniques such as the [...] "heel-toe method" [...] are often required, in which the toe of the right foot presses on the brake pedal, while the heel of the same foot blips the throttle.|$|E
5000|$|Another, {{different}} theme on the {{multiplate clutch}} is the clutches {{used in the}} fastest classes of drag racing, highly specialized, purpose-built cars such as Top Fuel or Funny Cars. These cars are so powerful that to attempt a start with a simple clutch would result in complete loss of traction. To avoid this problem, Top Fuel cars actually use a single, fixed gear ratio, {{and a series of}} clutches that are engaged one at a time, rather than in unison, progressively allowing more power to the wheels. A single one of these clutch plates (as designed) can not hold more than a fraction {{of the power of the}} engine, so the driver starts with only the first <b>clutch</b> <b>engaged.</b> This clutch is overwhelmed by the power of the engine, allowing only a fraction of the power to the wheels, much like [...] "slipping the clutch" [...] in a slower car, but working not requiring concentration from the driver. As speed builds, the driver pulls a lever, which engages a second clutch, sending a bit more of the engine power to the wheels, and so on. This continues through several clutches until the car has reached a speed where the last clutch can be engaged. With all clutches engaged, the engine is now sending all of its power to the rear wheels. This is far more predictable and repeatable than the driver manually slipping the clutch himself and then shifting through the gears, given the extreme violence of the run and the speed at which is all unfolds. Another benefit is that there is no need to break the power flow in order to swap gears (a conventional manual cannot transmit power while between gears, which is important because 1/100ths of a second are important in Top Fuel races). A traditional multiplate clutch would be more prone to overheating and failure, as all the plates must be subjected to heat and friction together until the clutch is fully engaged, while a Top Fuel car keeps its last clutches in [...] "reserve" [...] until the cars speed allows full engagement. It is relatively easy to design the last stages to be much more powerful than the first, in order to ensure they can absorb the power of the engine even if the first clutches burn out or overheat from the extreme friction.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electronically}} controlled {{gear shifting}} Tatra - a driver using a joystick just pre-sets a speed gear, {{and after the}} <b>clutch</b> is <b>engaged,</b> the speed shifting is carried out. The driver is informed about the shifted speed gear {{by means of a}} dashboard display.|$|R
5000|$|Cars with a Saxomat clutch did {{not have}} a clutch pedal. The Saxomat {{consisted}} of two independent systems: the centrifugal clutch, and the servo clutch. The centrifugal <b>clutch</b> was <b>engaged</b> above certain engine speed by centrifugal force acting on spinning weights inside the clutch, similar to a centrifugal governor.|$|R
5000|$|For the Dauphine, a Ferlec {{semi-automatic}} {{was offered}} from 1957 until 1963, when the [...] "fully automatic" [...] Jaeger electromechanical transmission control became available. The Ferlec transmission was a manual-selection transmission coupled to dry <b>clutch</b> that <b>engaged</b> and disengaged by touching the gearshift, similar to driver operation of Volkswagen's Automatic Stickshift, {{but without the}} torque converter of the VW.|$|R
