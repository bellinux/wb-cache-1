50|$|Immediately, Scheckter {{began to}} take {{advantage}} of the others' uncertainty in the conditions and, by lap five had moved from ninth to fourth. Stuck was also going well in the wet, and, despite losing his <b>clutch</b> <b>cable</b> in the first few laps, pulled away from Hunt. Lauda passed his teammate Reutemann for fifth spot when the Argentine spun. On lap 15, with Hunt four seconds behind, Stuck, struggling to make gear changes without a clutch, popped out of gear entering a corner and went straight on. He retired with damage to the monocoque.|$|E
5000|$|R-2000 Tiller: 4-strokes Lombardini HP10-14 petrol / diesel engine. Equipped with {{a safety}} reverse mechanism, {{allowing}} {{the machine to}} stop {{in the space of}} a few centimeters. The safety mechanism, invented, designed and finally adopted by Cugini Randi across the range of their tillers, allowed the model to be the winner of the 1st Prize at the 6th competition antinfortunistico ENPI (Ente Nazionale Prevenzione Infortuni) [...] for machines to be used on sloping ground. The safety mechanism was designed to enter immediately in operation and in case of breakage of the <b>clutch</b> <b>cable</b> too.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission: S1/J1/YS1 (4.4 final drive, <b>cable</b> <b>clutch,</b> {{optional}} LSD for YS1), Y1 (4.266 final drive, <b>cable</b> <b>clutch,</b> optional LSD) ...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{cable grip}} reduces wear due to sliding {{friction}} between cable and gripping surfaces. Drive wheels are grooved with a helical pattern that meshes with {{the lay of}} cable, analogous to a worm gear. Cable is gripped between drive wheels and guide rollers, and cable pull is exerted on the grip when drive wheels are slowed by hydraulic <b>clutches.</b> <b>Cable</b> grip may be applicable to cable-operated systems, such as ore trams in mines, overhead cable cars and ski lifts...|$|R
2500|$|In 1955, {{in order}} to prove the KR200's durability, Messerschmitt {{prepared}} a KR200 to break the 24-hour speed record for three-wheeled vehicles under [...] The record car had a special single-seat low-drag body and a highly modified engine, but the suspension, steering, and braking components were stock. Throttle, brake, and <b>clutch</b> <b>cables</b> were duplicated. [...] The record car was run on 29-30 August 1955 at the Hockenheimring for 24 hours and broke 22 international speed records in its class, including the 24-hour speed record, which it set at ...|$|R
5000|$|After Hammond {{found that}} his colleagues ruined his helmet and bought him a new one that was pink, the trio began making their way towards their next {{destination}} at the city of Nha Trang. Along the way, the trio encountered torrential rain, before May ran out of fuel {{and had to be}} aided by a local to refuel it, while Hammond's Minsk broke down after the <b>clutch</b> <b>cable</b> snapped and had to be repaired at a village along their route. At this point, the producers instigated a new rule that the bikes had to be repaired only with tools, after banning the trio from replacing parts on their bikes. They further added that if their bikes would not start, they would be forced to use an unappealing, and rather inappropriate vehicle - a 1973 Honda Chaly mini-bike, painted and flanked in a Stars and Stripes livery (similar to the bike seen in the film Easy Rider) and fitted with an iPod audio system continuously playing Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A."; both the iTunes and Netflix versions of the episode have the iPod playing [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". Upon fixing Hammond's bike, the trio continued on toward Nha Trang and managed to reach it, despite difficulties in the downhill journey as night fell; Clarkson struggled the most after his headlight failed, and so was forced to strap a torch onto his bike to keep going.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} create the effect of Herbie driving himself, Disney concocted a {{detailed}} system of sprockets and pulleys connected to a second steering column under the front seat for a rear seat driver. There was also {{a second set of}} pedal assemblies, <b>clutch</b> <b>cables</b> and a shifter extension. In The Love Bug, the rear seat driver sat low enough to see over the windshield but still out of the view of the camera. For Herbie Rides Again and Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, Disney installed a hood-mounted Carello fog light that concealed a small camera which allowed the rear seat driver to view the street and sit lower.|$|R
5000|$|The manual {{transmission}} is K50 type with <b>cable</b> <b>clutch</b> {{as opposed to}} the AE86's T50 transmission with hydraulic clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The 7.6 t flywheel, located {{outside the}} station and {{adjacent}} to the loop, {{is attached to a}} <b>clutch</b> and <b>cable</b> system, which in turn connects to a small four-wheeled catch car known as a [...] "bob". On the front of the bob is a launch pin that seats in a socket {{in the back of the}} train. Once the bob is seated, the operators receive the ready light.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically {{there were}} few changes, but the <b>clutch</b> changed from <b>cable</b> to {{hydraulic}} operation and the engine compression ratio increased to 7.2:1. The previously fitted anti-roll bar was no longer used. Wider 6.00x16 tyres were fitted to improve road holding.|$|R
50|$|Available {{only as a}} Sedan, {{this had}} a higher level {{interior}} with tachometer instrumentation, electric windows, electric door locks, electric door mirrors, clock and wheel covers as standard. Engines were D15B2 16V SOHC, same as the DX, with 5-speed <b>cable</b> <b>clutch</b> transmission. 4- speed automatic transmission was optional.|$|R
50|$|Riders use {{modified}} motocross bikes with after market {{parts to}} lower weight and improve performance. Riders will often shave down the seat foam {{to give a}} wider range of motion and better grip on the seat. Steering stabilizers are also common, and help keep the front tire running straight when tricks requiring the rider {{to let go of the}} handle bars are performed. Many riders will also shorten the width of the handle bars, to make it easier to put the legs around the bars, like such tricks as the 'heelclicker' or 'rodeo'. Excess cables, such as brakes and <b>clutch</b> <b>cables</b> are usually redirected away from the bars, to avoid riders getting their boots caught on the bike. The engine and mechanical details of a FMX bike are fairly stock, not needing the fine tuning of a racing bike. Riders may also choose to have 'lever' on their handlebars to help then when performing 'Kiss Of Death Backflips.' A 'lever' is usually a metal plate or pipe coming off the handle bars, and going in front of the riders wrist or lower arm to stop the rider from rotating during the flips, but letting the bike continue to move. Bikes have after market performance pipes that give more power. The bike must have very strong suspension and very high quality tires.|$|R
50|$|On {{motorcycles}} {{the clutch}} is {{operated by a}} hand lever on the left handlebar. No pressure on the lever means that the clutch plates are engaged (driving), while pulling the lever back towards the rider disengages the <b>clutch</b> plates through <b>cable</b> or hydraulic actuation, allowing the rider to shift gears or coast. Racing motorcycles often use slipper clutches to eliminate the effects of engine braking, which, being applied only to the rear wheel, can cause instability.|$|R
60|$|He drew {{level with}} her, <b>clutched</b> at her <b>cable,</b> a foot short, and was driven against her bows. Then the stream swept him onward, gasping, and clawing savagely at her {{slippery}} side, until his fingers found a hold. It was merely the rounded {{top of a}} bolt, but with a desperate effort he clutched the bent iron that led up from {{it to one of}} the dead-eyes of the mainmast-shrouds. He could not, however, draw himself up any further, and he hung on, wondering when his strength would fail him, until the Siwash, who had already crawled up the cable, leaned down from above and seized his shoulder. In another moment or two he reached the rail, and went staggering across the deck, dripping, and half dazed.|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha WR200 {{shown above}} {{has the same}} crank & Stroke as the DT200R & ATV Blaster. The WR200 crank cases {{are similar to the}} DT200R but with a bigger reed cage port and {{slightly}} revised induction port shapes in the crank cases. The WR200 has a larger cylinder bore size of 66.8mm diameter giving a displacement of 199cm with a standard compression of 6.3:1 in standard form. The standard cylinder is nickel plated and has slightly larger porting plus two boost ports ether side of the exhaust port. This in turn makes the WR200 power valve different in shape to allow three exhaust ports to be controlled. The WR200 has a direct <b>cable</b> <b>clutch</b> drive pinion in the clutch cover, where as the DT200R & Blaster use a conventional push rod through the clutch center. The WR200 also uses a larger Mikuni TM30SS Carburetor. The WR200 Frame, Tank, seat, plastics, forks, swingarm, airbox, rear shock and electrics differ from the DT200R.|$|R
50|$|The {{timing of}} the Cavalier's United Kingdom launch was well judged. The United Kingdom tax system meant that sales to company car fleets {{comprised}} {{a larger proportion of}} the overall market - especially for middle-weight saloons - than elsewhere in Europe: the Ford Cortina Mk II had been replaced by the Ford Cortina Mk III in 1970, but {{in the eyes of the}} all important company car fleet managers the newer Cortina never quite matched the earlier car for reliability, notably in respect of problems with its <b>cable</b> <b>clutch</b> and with camshaft wear in the 1.6 and 2.0 litre ohc units. The traditionally very conservative fleet market was therefore particularly receptive to Vauxhall's new Cortina challenger. At the time, British Leyland was facing criticism for the lacklustre design and doubts about build quality and reliability surrounding its cars, especially the Morris Marina and the smaller Austin Allegro. The Cavalier was launched around the same time as Chrysler's Alpine, which featured a more modern front-wheel drive hatchback layout and was voted European Car of the Year for 1976, but it would ultimately fail to meet sales expectations on the British market and was not reputedly a reliable or well-built car.|$|R
