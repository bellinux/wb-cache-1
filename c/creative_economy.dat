The research on <b>creative</b> <b>economies</b> {{presented in this paper}} was carried out in Kenya and has mainly focused on the use of mother tongues in the media and in the informal social set ups. The research reported herein focused on an advertisement by a bank used both on the television and radio; a performing arts group that is multilingual in composition; and a dance group that is also multilingual in its composition. A questionnaire was administered to 120 respondents who were required to give their opinion {{of the role of the}} mother tongue in these three <b>creative</b> <b>economies.</b> The questionnaire focused on i) the attitude towards the use of mother tongues in the three <b>creative</b> <b>economies</b> and ii) the perceived economic opportunities in the use of mother tongues.

The main objectives of the study are to present the spatial design of the regional systems of creativity in Romania and to identify the evolutionary trends, by creating spatial models for key economic indicators, specific to such economic activities. This paper focuses on how <b>creative</b> <b>economies</b> are concentrated in the national network of settlements and how they differentiate in terms of regional profile. Consequently, a yearly nationwide database was created for 2000 - 2012, which includes four-digit creative economic activities, according to the Classification of National Economy Activities, for each administrative unit in Romania. The analyses, conducted for the same period, show a concentration of <b>creative</b> <b>economies</b> as a national polycentric network which includes the capital city and cities with over 300, 000 inhabitants, as well as their structured territorial systems emerging around them, representing the local and regional polycentric networks. The analysis of the economic profiles highlights the growing share of <b>creative</b> <b>economies</b> in the national economy that tends to contribute more and more to the increase of the operational complexity of the local and regional economies...|$|R

30|$|Mother tongues are the {{foundation}} of the culture that is exploited in the <b>creative</b> <b>economies</b> (Kristeva [2010]). The mother tongues provide not only the language but the socio-cultural practices that go into performance art and dance. It is, therefore, essential to ground the knowledge of a mother tongue in the knowledge of the culture that it is embedded in. Any community that wants to exploit the mother tongues in <b>creative</b> <b>economies</b> must of necessity view the mother tongues positively. According to Deane ([2006]), people want to make informed choices regarding their mother tongues. They want to make use of their mother tongues not only for education but also for the transmission of social change, persuasion, entertainment and mobilization.|$|R

Is it possible for art and the creative arts to act as a process of `revealing&# 039; and `becoming&# 039; and `throwing light&# 039; on the world while working within the market economies of innovation and entrepreneurship where creativity has become a generalised discourse?
