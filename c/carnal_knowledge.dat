The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC's The Razors Edge (1990), Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (both in 1991), Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears (1991), and Van Halen's For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (1991) showcased this popularity. Additionally, the Black Crowes released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker (1990), which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies. In 1992, Def Leppard followed up 1987's Hysteria with Adrenalize, which went multi-platinum, spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{relations}} {{with a person}} under the age-of-consent are generally a criminal offense in the jurisdiction in which the act was committed, with punishments ranging from token fines to life imprisonment. Many different terms exist for the charges laid and include statutory rape, illegal <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge,</b> or corruption of a minor. In some cases, sexual activity with someone above the legal age-of-consent but beneath the age of majority can be punishable under laws against contributing to the delinquency of a minor.|$|E
500|$|After their 1970 breakup {{following}} {{the release of}} Bridge over Troubled Water, they both continued recording, Simon releasing a number of highly acclaimed albums, including 1986's Graceland. Garfunkel also briefly pursued an acting career, with leading roles in two Mike Nichols films, Catch-22 and <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge,</b> and in Nicolas Roeg's 1980 Bad Timing, as well as releasing some solo hits such as [...] "All I Know".|$|E
500|$|The title, [...] "If U Seek Amy", is a pun, {{meaning to}} sound like [...] "F-U-C-K me" [...] when heard in the chorus, [...] "All of the boys {{and all of the}} girls are begging to, if you seek Amy." [...] This wordplay was {{compared}} to passages of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and James Joyce's Ulysses where characters covertly spell out profanities, songs by Memphis Slim, R. Stevie Moore, April Wine, Poster Children and The Script entitled [...] "If You See Kay," [...] and the title of Van Halen's 1991 album, For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge.</b>|$|E
500|$|Facelift was {{certified}} gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) {{by the end}} of 1990, {{while the}} band continued to hone its audience, opening for such artists as Iggy Pop, Van Halen, Poison, and Extreme. In early 1991, Alice in Chains landed the opening slot for the Clash of the Titans tour with Anthrax, Megadeth, and Slayer, exposing the band to a wide metal audience but receiving mainly poor reception. Alice in Chains was nominated for a Best Hard Rock Performance Grammy Award in 1992 for [...] "Man in the Box" [...] but lost to Van Halen for their 1991 album For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge.</b>|$|E
500|$|Clooney and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel used various {{techniques}} when {{portraying the}} different decades of Barris's life. [...] "We thought {{in order to}} go back in time, most people remember things through film," [...] Clooney reasoned. [...] "I don't remember the 1950s [...] I wasn't around for them [...] I know the 50s through Technicolor. Not Technicolor as it was shot, but Technicolor as it has faded now." [...] The filmmakers studied various films and magazine issues of that decade for inspiration on the color palette. Racking focuses were highly stylized for scenes set in the 1960s, similar to the Spaghetti Westerns of that era. Hand-held cameras were used for scenes set in the 1970s, an homage to the films of Sidney Lumet, Mike Nichols and Alan J. Pakula, primarily Klute (1971), <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (1971), and The Parallax View (1974). Bob Fosse's All That Jazz also influenced Clooney's direction.|$|E
500|$|On 16 July—ten {{days after}} the article was published—Josephine gave a speech at a meeting at London's Exeter Hall calling for {{increased}} protection for {{the young and the}} raising of the age of consent. The following day she and George left for a holiday in Switzerland and France. While they were away, a moribund parliamentary bill from 1883 [...] dealing with the age of consent [...] was re-debated by MPs; the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 was passed on 14 August 1885. The Act raised the age of consent [...] from 13 to 16 years of age, while the procurement of girls for prostitution by administering drugs, intimidation or fraud was made a criminal offence, as was the abduction of a girl under 18 for purposes of <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The police investigated Stead's purchase, and Josephine was forced to cut her holiday short to return for questioning. Although she avoided all charges, Stead was imprisoned for three months.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} years of the decade the most notable successes were New Jersey (1988) by Bon Jovi, OU812 (1988) by Van Halen, while Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988) by Poison, spawned number one hit single [...] "Every Rose Has Its Thorn", and {{eventually}} sold eight million copies worldwide. Britny Fox from Philadelphia and Winger from New York released their eponymous débuts in 1988. In 1989 Mötley Crüe produced their most commercially successful album, the multi-platinum number one Dr. Feelgood. In the same year eponymous débuts included Danger Danger from New York, Dangerous Toys from Austin, Texas, who provided more of a Southern rock tone to the genre, [...] and Enuff Z'Nuff from Chicago who provided an element of psychedelia to their sound and visual style. L.A. débuts included Warrant with Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich (1989), and Skid Row with their eponymous album (1989), which reached number six in the Billboard 200, but they were {{to be one of the}} last major bands that emerged in the glam metal era. Glam metal entered the 1990s as one of the major commercial genres of popular music. In 1990 débuts for Slaughter, from Las Vegas with Stick It to Ya and FireHouse, from North Carolina, with their eponymous album reached number 18 and number 21 on the Billboard 200 respectively, but it would be the peak of their commercial achievement. Guns N' Roses' Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (both in 1991) and Van Halen's For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (1991) showcased the genre's popularity.|$|E

2500|$|Hagar {{appeared}} on four studio albums with the band, 5150 (1986), OU812 (1988), For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (1991), and Balance (1995), {{as well as}} one live album, [...] (1993). During Hagar's time with the band, some fans informally referred to the band as [...] "Van Hagar" [...] to distinguish it from the David Lee Roth lineup. With Hagar, all four studio releases reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts. For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge</b> was awarded the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal. The live album Live: Right Here, Right Now peaked at No. 5.|$|E

In Danish, [...] is rendered as [...] "unnatural <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge</b> with someone of the same sex or (now) with animals".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Ernie Ball {{produced}} an EVH signature [...] "Music Man" [...] guitar, which Van Halen {{used on the}} For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge</b> and Balance albums. This guitar is still commercially available under the Axis name, and retains all of the original features of the Edward Van Halen model. Although rumours abound of a personal falling-out between Van Halen and the Ernie Ball company's Sterling Ball, the official reason for the cessation of their commercial relationship was that Van Halen was upset that Ernie Ball could not produce enough of this guitar to meet demand.|$|E
2500|$|Van Halen {{also used}} the TransTrem in Pleasure Dome on For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge,</b> Me Wise Magic on Best Of – Volume I, and in Fire in the Hole on Van Halen III, where the songs go through several tuning changes, while {{retaining}} the same chord voicings. [...] The TransTrem system allows for the effect of an instant [...] "capo," [...] increasing the pitch of all strings by up to a minor third or lowering the pitch {{by as much as}} a perfect fourth, as well as giving the player the ability to [...] "whammy" [...] entire chords in-tune.|$|E
2500|$|All four studio albums {{produced}} {{during this period}} reached No. 1 on the Billboard pop music charts and 17 singles breached the top 12 of the mainstream rock tracks chart. During that era, a single taken from 1988's OU812, [...] "When It's Love," [...] reached the Top Five, peaking at No. 5. In addition, Van Halen was nominated for two Grammy Awards, winning the 1992 Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal award for the album For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge.</b> Van Halen continued to enjoy success throughout the mid-1990s. In 1995, Van Halen released the album Balance and supported Bon Jovi on their European Summer stadium tour. They also made a live album called [...]|$|E
2500|$|Augustine {{had served}} as a [...] "Hearer" [...] for the Manichaeans for about nine years, who taught that the {{original}} sin was <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge.</b> But his struggle to understand the cause of evil in the world started before that, at the age of nineteen. By malum (evil) he understood most of all concupiscence, which he interpreted as a vice dominating person and causing in men and women moral disorder. Agostino Trapè insists that Augustine's personal experience cannot be credited for his doctrine about concupiscence. He considers Augustine's marital experience to be quite normal, and even exemplary, aside from the absence of Christian wedding rites. As J. Brachtendorf showed, Augustine used Ciceronian Stoic concept of passions, to interpret Paul's doctrine of universal sin and redemption.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Van Halen {{began to}} use a brand new Kramer guitar with artwork similar to its predecessor, with a hockey-stick or [...] "banana" [...] headstock, which {{came to be known}} as the [...] "5150." [...] This guitar was rear-loaded (no pick guard), with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit and a maple neck that was later {{electronically}} mapped in order to be copied onto the later Music Man and Peavey signature models. This guitar was last used on the track [...] "Judgment Day" [...] on the For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge</b> album. [...] Various versions of it can be seen in the music videos for [...] "Panama", [...] "When It's Love", and the concert video Live Without a Net. The guitar itself was a variant of a Kramer Pacer, although not a model that was technically available at the time.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 September 2006, the BBC {{reported}} that the Ghanaian government had banned an LGBT rights conference that was alleged to be taking place on 4 September at the Accra International Conference Centre and at a venue {{in the city of}} Koforidua. Minister of Information and National Origin Kwamena Bartels said, [...] "The government does not condone any such activity which violently offends the culture, morality and heritage of the entire people of Ghana. Supporting such a conference, or even allowing it, will encourage that tendency which the law forbids. Government would like to make it absolutely clear that it shall not permit the proposed conference anywhere in Ghana. Unnatural <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge</b> is illegal under our criminal code. Homosexuality, lesbianism and bestiality are therefore offences under the laws in Ghana." [...] The conference eventually appeared to be a hoax.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 {{the band}} joined Black Crowes on tours of Australia and New Zealand. In the US they {{appeared}} on Late Night with David Letterman and performed [...] "Painless". At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 they won trophies for Album of the Year and Breakthrough Artist – Album for Baby Animals and Breakthrough Artist – Single for [...] "Early Warning". The band then toured as a support act for Van Halen's For Unlawful <b>Carnal</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Tour across the US from 28 January to 31 May, playing to arena-size audiences. Eddie Van Halen requested their presence {{after his wife}} Valerie had heard their album, and suggested them. Australian Rolling Stone placed DeMarchi on the cover. It {{was the first time}} they had put an Australian artist or group on the cover on the merits of a debut album. The band had played over 500 shows when they ended that tour in August 1992.|$|E
2500|$|Until 2012, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{considered}} rape a crime solely {{committed by}} men against women. In 2012, {{they changed their}} definition from [...] "The <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge</b> of a female forcibly and against her will" [...] to [...] "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, {{without the consent of}} the victim." [...] The previous definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow. The updated definition includes recognizing any gender of victim and perpetrator and that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape. The bureau further describes instances when the victim is unable to give consent because of mental or physical incapacity. It recognizes that a victim can be incapacitated by drugs and alcohol and unable to give valid consent. The definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level; it rather means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.|$|E
2500|$|Fuller is also {{recorded}} as having rescued people from drowning, acted as emergency midwife, and rescued {{a woman from}} a flooded house. [...] The types of crime that Fuller and subsequent police officers {{had to deal with}} in and around Monmouth as the century progressed were recorded in detail in the local newspapers, the Merlin and the Monmouthshire Beacon. [...] These crimes included theft of livestock, clothing, food, valuables, fuel (wood and coal); assault; vandalism; highway robbery; fraud; passing counterfeit coin; prostitution, and indecent exposure, as well as the more serious crimes of concealing the death of an infant, <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge</b> without consent, and murder. [...] The constable would have been present in court at Shire Hall when many of these cases came before the Quarter Sessions or Assizes. [...] Once the court had passed sentence there was a wide range of punishment available to the authorities. Capital offences were dealt with at Monmouth County Gaol, as were whippings and sentences of hard labour. [...] Although a police force of four constables and a sergeant was established in Monmouth in 1836, uncertain finances meant that within two years the force was reduced to just two constables.|$|E
2500|$|Henry later made it treasonous to {{deny the}} {{validity}} of his marriage to Anne Boleyn, and later still made it an offence to maintain {{the validity of the}} same marriage. [...] His union later with Catherine Howard proved lethal for Francis Dereham and Thomas Culpeper, after it was discovered that they each had <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Catherine. [...] Both men were executed in December 1541. [...] Culpeper was drawn on a hurdle to Tyburn and beheaded there, in itself unusual since most beheadings were carried out at Tower Hill. [...] There was nothing to distinguish Dereham's punishment however, as he was hanged, drawn and quartered in the same place. [...] Catherine was deprived of her queenship, and was beheaded in February the following year.

[...] Edward died a young man, however, and was succeeded by his half-sister, Mary I, who removed the changes from the statute books. [...] Mary also attempted to return England to Catholicism, but her marriage in 1554 to Philip II of Spain proved to be deeply unpopular, so much so that it was made treasonous to pray for her death, or to preach against Philip's title as king. [...] Her marriage prompted Thomas Wyatt the younger to rebel against the union, but the rising failed and consequently he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. [...] This was commuted to beheading; his head was later exhibited on a gallows near Berkeley Square, while his quarters were displayed at various places across the city. [...] As many as 400rebels may have been killed for their involvement in the uprising. [...] Also caught in the aftermath was William Thomas, a Welsh scholar accused by some of the rebels of planning to murder the queen. [...] He was hanged, drawn and quartered in May that year. [...] His head was placed on London Bridge, {{and the rest of his}} body at Cripplegate.|$|E

Evil was the chance which sent hither a man whose mixed speech of earthly wealth and unearthly or superhuman knowledge hath in it what does so especially captivate my poor father.

'There be those,' he said, 'and their number is legion, who will rather, like the wicked Ahab, listen to the dreams of the false prophet Zedekiah, than {{to the words of}} him by whom the Lord has spoken.' And he further insisted--'Ah, my brethren, there be many Zedekiahs among you--men that promise you the light of their <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge,</b> so you will surrender to them that of your heavenly understanding. What are they better than the tyrant Naas, who demanded the right eye of those who were subjected to him?' And further he insisted--" ...|$|E
60|$|As to what {{concerns}} religion, all the Japonians, excepting some few who make profession of atheism, and believe the soul mortal, are idolaters, {{and hold the}} transmigration of souls, after the doctrine of Pythagoras. Some of them pay divine worship to the sun and moon; others to the Camis, those ancient kings of whom we have made mention; and to the Potoques, the gods of China. There are divers of them who adore some kinds of beasts, and many who adore the devil under dreadful figures. Besides these, they have a certain mysterious deity, whom they call Amida; and say, this god has built a paradise of such distance from the earth, that the souls cannot reach it under a voyage of three years. But the god Xaca is he of whom they report the greatest wonders, {{who seems to be}} a counterfeit of the true Messiah, set up by the devil himself, or by his ministers. For if one would give credit to them, Xaca being born of a queen, who never had the <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge</b> of man, retired into the deserts of Siam, and there underwent severe penances, to expiate the sins of men: that coming out of his wilderness, he assembled some disciples, and preached an heavenly doctrine in divers countries.|$|E
60|$|But, {{though these}} complex ideas or {{essences}} of mixed modes {{depend on the}} mind, and are made by it with great liberty, yet they are not made at random, and jumbled together without any reason at all. Though these complex ideas be not always copied from nature, yet they are always suited to the end for which abstract ideas are made: and though they be combinations made of ideas that are loose enough, and have as little union in themselves as several other to which the mind never gives a connexion that combines them into one idea; yet they are always made {{for the convenience of}} communication, which is the chief end of language. The use of language is, by short sounds, to signify with ease and dispatch general conceptions; wherein not only abundance of particulars may be contained, but also a great variety of independent ideas collected into one complex one. In the making therefore of the species of mixed modes, men have had regard only to such combinations as they had occasion to mention one to another. Those they have combined into distinct complex ideas, and given names to; whilst others, that in nature have as near a union, are left loose and unregarded. For, to go no further than human actions themselves, if they would make distinct abstract ideas of all the varieties which might be observed in them, the number must be infinite, and the memory confounded with the plenty, as well as overcharged to little purpose. It suffices that men make and name so many complex ideas of these mixed modes as they find they have occasion to have names for, in the ordinary occurrence of their affairs. If they join to the idea of killing the idea of father or mother, and so make a distinct species from killing a man's son or neighbour, it is because of the different heinousness of the crime, and the distinct punishment is due to the murdering a man's father and mother, different to what ought to be inflicted on the murder of a son or neighbour; and therefore they find it necessary to mention it by a distinct name, which is the end of making that distinct combination. But though the ideas of mother and daughter are so differently treated, in reference to the idea of killing, that the one is joined with it to make a distinct abstract idea with a name, and so a distinct species, and the other not; yet, in respect of <b>carnal</b> <b>knowledge,</b> they are both taken in under INCEST: and that still for the same convenience of expressing under one name, and reckoning of one species, such unclean mixtures as have a peculiar turpitude beyond others; and this to avoid circumlocutions and tedious descriptions.|$|E
