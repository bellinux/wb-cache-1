5|$|At a {{labelled}} building, {{the player}} <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> {{of the car}} and enter, though enemies will only appear during certain times of the day. If the player arrives too early, the enemy gangsters will attempt to escape. If the player arrives too late, the building will be found vacant. A timetable of all meetings are included in the game's instruction manual. The aesthetic interior of buildings include two rooms, with limited decorations such as a pool table and chairs. Some buildings contain evidence bags which can be collected for extra points. Once the player comes into contact with an enemy, a separate window will appear which will display his name. The player can apprehend him by either catching or trapping him. Once caught, the player may take him to the city hall to interrogate him in order to receive information such as the location of the next gangster meetup. Points are gained by apprehending criminals, returning evidence bags or destroying cars.|$|E
25|$|The Sims Bustin' Out is {{the second}} title in The Sims console series. Bustin' Out was {{released}} for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and N-Gage {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2003. As the title suggests, Sims <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game. It was the second Sims game to not be on the PC; it was a follow up to The Sims, which was very similar to Bustin' Out, except the aims were shifted to getting job promotions and constantly fulfilling goals to get ahead in the game. The PlayStation 2 version also features the option to play online, though EA no longer supports it.|$|E
25|$|Harry {{also owns}} a mokeskin pouch, or small 'bag' {{that is used}} for storing items, which no one but the owner <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> He {{receives}} this from Hagrid as a 17th birthday present. Harry uses the pouch {{throughout the course of}} Deathly Hallows to keep several sentimental (yet, as he himself admits, otherwise worthless) objects such as the Marauder's Map, a shard of the magical mirror given to him by his god-father Sirius, the fake Horcrux locket that had belonged to Sirius's brother R.A.B (Regulus Arcturus Black), the Snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore, containing the Resurrection Stone that had previously been set into Voldemort's grandfather Marvolo Gaunt's signet ring, which Harry discovers is actually the second Hallow, a letter from his mother to Sirius with part of a photo (of him and his father, James), and eventually, his own broken wand (which Harry later repairs with the Elder Wand).|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} is upbeat, keeping in theme with the music. According to Madonna the verses are a mystical {{look at the}} {{universe}} and how small we are compared to it. She wanted to capture a feeling of [...] "wonderment" [...] with the lyrics, as if some one has just opened their eyes {{and looked at the}} world for the first time. With NME, she further clarified that the lyrics convey the feeling of being small in comparison to the vast universe. It also talks about how regular life goes on faster [...] "than the speeding light", but one <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of that journey and look at themselves with an outsider's perspective.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. [...] The two noted that, while the episode's premise [...] "brims over with atmosphere", the ending of [...] "Død Kalm" [...] was {{extremely}} lacking. Shearman and Pearson argued [...] "that if the writers can only devise a plot which paints them into a corner so awkward there's no realistic way they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> then they shouldn't write the story at all." [...] The two also criticized the episode's make up. They noted that [...] "Scully looks like a credible old lady, Mulder rather more like a man wearing several layers of latex." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{dramatic}} debate with Frederick Douglass at the AERA convention in 1869, Stone argued that suffrage for women {{was more important}} than suffrage for African Americans. She nevertheless supported the amendment, saying, [...] "But I thank God for that XV. Amendment, and hope that it will be adopted in every State. I will be thankful in my soul if any body <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the terrible pit. [...] But I believe that the safety of the government would be more promoted by the admission of woman as an element of restoration and harmony than the negro." [...] Stone and her allies expected that their active support for the amendment to enfranchise black men would lead their abolitionist friends in Congress to push for an amendment to enfranchise women as the next step, but that did not happen.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of the fourth season, Beaver joined the limited series Harper's Island. Although he initially feared that it would prevent future appearances of Bobby, {{he was able to}} maintain his Supernatural [...] "quota" [...] with seven episodes. The character's role increased for the fifth season, which made sense for the actor due to the apocalyptic storyline. The season also introduced a new story arc for Bobby: his use of a wheelchair. Series creator Eric Kripke explained that it [...] " [...] the Apocalypse matter"; the writers wanted [...] "real stakes and real loss and real obstacles thrown in our heroes' way" [...] to differentiate it from prior seasons. Though he found it to be a challenge, Beaver enjoyed the experience because he could perform tricks on set that his wheelchair-using college roommate had taught him. However, the actor did [...] " [...] very seriously", and commented, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the chair {{at the end of the}} day and go home and I recognize that, so many people can't and I have to be considerate to them and respect that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{resolution}} to this isolation and ineffectiveness is speaking out: restoring {{the voices of}} the people of Sunnydale. Shade states that this facet of the episode gives it a political overtone. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club writes that the silence imposed by The Gentlemen is a metaphor for how evil spreads: [...] "When dissent is stifled, or people fail to tell the truth, or when we’re just distracted by other concerns, things <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of hand." [...] Authority figures in the series, such as the school principal, the mayor's office, and the Sunnydale Police Department, repeatedly either abet the town's endemic evil or choose not to hear about it. During [...] "Hush", at Giles' apartment the Scoobies listen to a newscaster reporting that authorities in the town attribute the silence to a flu vaccine gone awry, causing mass laryngitis. Wilcox writes, [...] "ow many times will we see those in power maintain such a silence while evil proceeds? It is not surprising that [...] attendants wear straitjackets; their garb suggests the insanity of such behavior—the pretense of civilized politeness while killing is accepted is a matter of course." ...|$|E

500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them is my best friend. That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. I want it to really reflect the song. So I wanted to make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E

[...] The {{book is a}} {{self-help}} {{book with}} directions for achieving personal financial independence. The book is targeted toward people of limited means. In the fall of 2001, he co-authored Legal Lynching: The Death Penalty and America's Future, also known as Legal Lynching II. [...] With coauthors, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Jackson Jr., and Bruce Shapiro, the anti-death penalty voice was heard very publicly. The book was published, {{at a time when}} public opposition to the death penalty was at a historically high level, by two of America's most prominent civil rights leaders. It was a follow up to Legal Lynching: Racism, Injustice and the Death Penalty, which was released in 1996 by Jackson Sr. In 2001, Jackson Jr. authored , with his press secretary, Frank Watkins. [...] The book outlines his moral and political philosophies, and it provides an autobiographical sketch. [...] It provides analysis on the link between race and economics from colonial America to the present with a vision for the future. [...] In addition to the analysis, it provides eight proposed constitutional amendments that Jackson sees as essential to pursuit of broader social and economic opportunity. [...] Since the publication of this book, Jackson has refined these and formally proposed these constitutional amendments.|$|E
500|$|Ken Griffey, Jr. did not {{understand}} his line [...] "there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited" [...] and got quite frustrated when he was recording it. He was directed by Mike Reiss, and his father Ken Griffey, Sr. was also present, trying to coach his son. Roger Clemens, who made his own chicken noises, was directed by Jeff Martin, as was Wade Boggs. Mike Reiss directed {{most of the other}} players. Mike Scioscia accepted his guest spot in [...] "half a second," [...] while Ozzie Smith has stated {{that he would like to}} guest star again [...] "so [...] <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> [...]" [...] Don Mattingly, who was forced to shave off his [...] "sideburns" [...] by Mr. Burns during the episode, would later have an actual [...] "haircut controversy", while he was playing for the New York Yankees. The coaching staff forced him to cut his long hair, and was briefly dropped from the team line-up for not doing so. Many people believed the joke in the episode to be a reference to the incident, but [...] "Homer at the Bat" [...] was recorded a year before it happened. Many of the guest stars, including Terry Cashman, Wade Boggs and Darryl Strawberry all admit that they are more well known because of their appearance in the episode, Cashman having [...] "Talkin' Softball" [...] requested more often than [...] "Talkin' Baseball".|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“Her Handsome Hero” keeps things {{interesting}} by blurring {{the lines between}} hero and villain, with Belle, Emma and even Zelena being faced with major questions about who they are, who they want to be, and how they <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of their current situation.
