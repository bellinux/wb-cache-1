5|$|Another old {{structure}} {{removed from}} Europe was proposed for Wyntoon: the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England. Most of the priory {{had been used}} by Hearst to refurbish St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been <b>crated</b> and shipped to San Simeon for possible use there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn be incorporated into his great castle, and had Morgan study the possibilities.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been <b>crated</b> and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Peninsula was not {{the only}} region from which Napoleon took art. Under the Directory {{government}} of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist {{effort on the part of}} the government, but the Directory had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture. The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. As a result, there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, <b>crated,</b> and shipped back to France.|$|E
50|$|Locking {{the dog in}} a <b>crate</b> {{and letting}} it whine, bark and attempt to escape is common but such {{attempts}} to introduce <b>crate</b> training may cause a negative association with <b>crating.</b> The dog should become slowly accustomed to the <b>crate.</b> This can involve making a <b>crate</b> an inviting place by placing small familiar toys inside, moving the pet bed into <b>crate,</b> leaving unwashed items of the owner's clothing inside, rewarding pets for entering the <b>crate</b> and remaining inside, incorporating the <b>crate</b> as part of play, feeding the pet in the <b>crate,</b> allowing the pet to explore and use the <b>crate</b> until {{it is no longer}} intimidating, and eventually building to the pet sleeping in the <b>crate</b> overnight.|$|R
40|$|This {{demonstration}} project studied {{the differences in}} farrowing <b>crate</b> designs and the survival of piglets. Three basic <b>crate</b> designs were studied: <b>crates</b> with hydraulic side rails, <b>crates</b> with solid rod finger side rails, and freestall <b>crates.</b> <b>Crates</b> with hydraulic sides in this study had more pigs born alive, had fewer pigs born dead, weaned more pigs, and had higher weaned litter weights than any other <b>crate</b> studied. The freestall <b>crates</b> had the least number of pigs born alive, weaned fewest pigs, and had the lightest litter weaned weights. Freestall <b>crates</b> fell {{in the middle of}} hydraulic and solid rod <b>crates</b> for pigs born dead. The solid rod <b>crates</b> fell in the middle of hydraulic and freestall <b>crates</b> for pigs born alive and weaned litter weight. Solid rod <b>crates</b> weaned slightly more pigs than freestalls. Solid rod <b>crates</b> had the most number of pigs born dead. Flooring layout was not replicated for all <b>crate</b> designs.

5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and <b>crated</b> for its ocean voyage.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of wooden <b>crate</b> designs. By {{far the most}} common are 'closed', 'open' and 'framed'. A Closed <b>Crate</b> {{is one that is}} completely or nearly completely enclosed with material such as plywood or lumber boards. When lumber is used, gaps are often left between the boards to allow for expansion. An Open <b>Crate</b> is one that (typically) uses lumber for sheathing. The sheathing is typically gapped by at various distances. There is no strict definition of an open <b>crate</b> as compared to a closed <b>crate.</b> Typically when the gap between boards is greater than the distance required for expansion, the <b>crate</b> would be considered an open <b>crate.</b> The gap between boards would typically not be greater than the width of the sheathing boards. When the gap is larger, the boards are often considered 'cleats' rather than sheathing thus rendering the <b>crate</b> unsheathed. An unsheathed <b>crate</b> is a frame <b>crate.</b> A Frame <b>Crate</b> is one that only contains a skeletal structure and no material is added for surface or pilferage protection. Typically an open <b>crate</b> will be constructed of 12 pieces of lumber, each along an outer edge of the content and more lumber placed diagonally to avoid distortion from torque.|$|R

5000|$|Without proper conditioning, dogs may vocalize their {{distress}} and make efforts {{to escape the}} <b>crates.</b> <b>Crating</b> suppresses the dog's behavior, removes the dog's freedom of movement and is a negative punishment (removal of reward) under operant conditioning. Dogs who do not react well to negative punishment may find <b>crating</b> highly stressful. Long term or excessive <b>crate</b> confinement [...] "may lead to emotional and behavioral deterioration over time." [...] To the extent that <b>crating</b> reduces the amount of exposure to different environmental and social situations, it can make dogs more reactive (fearful or aggressive) or intolerant of novel situations. <b>Crating</b> [...] "may significantly exacerbate the {{distress and}} emotional reactivity associated with separation distress". Behavioral problems that compels owners to <b>crate</b> train in the first place, may be exacerbated by {{the negative effects of}} <b>crating.</b> A dog may form a strong attachment to the <b>crate</b> eventually, feeling comfort and safety, after the initial feeling of distress and vulnerability. This behavioral effect has been compared to Stockholm syndrome. Dogs that are trained to sleep in a <b>crate,</b> when allowed to sleep in a bedroom, can show signs consistent with that of separation distress, suggesting that dogs may love their <b>crate</b> [...] "perhaps in some cases more than they love the owner." [...] This bond with the <b>crate</b> may interfere with the human-animal bond and exacerbate bond-related behavior problems such as separation distressand owner-directed aggression.|$|R

25|$|An {{advantage}} of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding.

The old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of Hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions. <b>Crated</b> Hurricanes were assembled at Takoradi in West Africa and flown across the Sahara to the Middle East theatre and, to save space, some Royal Navy aircraft carriers carried their reserve Sea Hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies, which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed.|$|E
