40|$|AbstractThe {{deployment}} of {{carbon capture and storage}} technology involves a spatial coupling of point sources of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> with geologic reservoirs capable of storing <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>captured</b> from these point sources will be injected into these geologic reservoirs, {{which may or}} may not be proximal to the sources. This spatial coupling will occur through a dedicated <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> pipeline network that connects the industrial organization of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> production and <b>capture</b> with the geologic organization of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> injection and storage. The relative locations of these sources and sinks are an important component of the overall returns to scale for the integrated carbon capture and storage system. Aggregating CO 2 flows in close proximity to sources and reservoirs increases the utilization of economies of scale in pipeline transportation and impacts the returns to scale and preferred paths forward for targeted {{deployment of}} the entire coupled technological system. This paper derives deployment preferences by investigating how the spatial clustering and centralization of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> sources and reservoirs affects the ability to aggregate CO 2 flows into networked pipelines. One major result is that, depending on the clustering within and between <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> sources and reservoirs, it can be advantageous to transport <b>captured</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> to reservoirs that are not proximal to the point(s) of capture...|$|R

2500|$|The {{technology}} for pre-combustion is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, gaseous fuel (H2, CH4), and power production.

The resulting [...] can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H2 can now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>capture.</b> The [...] is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants, or to existing plants where re-powering is an option.

This model determines the working capacity of the sorbent by looking at the difference between the equilibrium adsorbed concentrations at the adsorption and desorption conditions, and uses the sensible and latent heating requirements to determine the minimum energy usage. Using the results of this model, a class of sorbents can be constructed that have nearly identical physical properties but variable heats of adsorption for <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> to mimic different adsorption mechanisms. Parametric studies are run to determine the calculated minimum energy requirements per ton of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>captured</b> for this class of sorbents and a global minimum is found.
