Several journalists noted {{the similarities between}} the song and other Gaga works, with Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly stating that it sounded like [...] "a watered down version of 'Poker Face'" [...] and Scott Shetler of PopCrush elaborating that [...] "like many of [...] Gaga's songs", it is [...] "likely to stick in your head long after the song has ended".
