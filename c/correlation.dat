5|$|Although the Calendar Round {{is still}} in use today, the Maya started using an {{abbreviated}} Short Count during the Late Classic period. The Short Count is a count of 13 k'atuns. For this reason, {{there is no direct}} <b>correlation</b> between the Long Count and the European calendar. The most generally accepted <b>correlation</b> is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, <b>correlation.</b> This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the Gregorian date of 12 November 1539. Epigraphers Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT <b>correlation.</b> The Spinden <b>Correlation</b> would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems {{with the rest of the}} Maya region. The George Vaillant <b>Correlation</b> would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{demonstrate}} that the quantum <b>correlations</b> of polarization (or spin) observables used in Bell's argument against local realism have to be interpreted as conditional quantum <b>correlations.</b> By taking into account additional sources of randomness in Bell's type experiments, i. e., supplementary to source randomness, I calculate (in the standard quantum formalism) the complete quantum <b>correlations.</b> The main message of the quantum theory of measurement (due to von Neumann) is that complete <b>correlations</b> can be essentially smaller than the conditional ones. Additional sources of randomness diminish <b>correlations.</b> One can say another way around: transition from unconditional <b>correlations</b> to conditional can increase them essentially. This is true for both classical and quantum probability. The final remark is that classical conditional <b>correlations</b> do not satisfy Bell's inequality. Thus we met the following conditional probability dilemma: either to use the conditional quantum probabilities, as was done by Bell and others, or complete quantum <b>correlations.</b> However, {{in the first case}} the corresponding classical conditional <b>correlations</b> need not satisfy Bell's inequality and in the second case the complete quantum <b>correlations</b> satisfy Bell's inequality.
