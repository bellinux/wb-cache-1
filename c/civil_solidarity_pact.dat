It grants unmarried couples, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, many rights, responsibilities and protections that married couples have. However, it does not allow benefits in taxation, social security, or health insurance premiums (unlike the federal law). The origin of the law lies in the French <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> law.|$|E

However, he says he will not ban the same-sex marriage law if elected President. He opposes adoption by same-sex couples.|$|R
50|$|The terms used to {{designate}} civil unions are not standardized, and vary widely {{from country to}} country. Government-sanctioned relationships that may be similar or equivalent to civil unions include civil partnerships, registered partnerships, domestic partnerships, significant relationships, reciprocal beneficiary relationships, common-law marriage, adult interdependent relationships, life partnerships, stable unions, <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pacts,</b> and so on. The exact level of rights, benefits, obligations, and responsibilities also varies, depending on the laws of a particular country. Some jurisdictions allow same-sex couples to adopt, while others forbid them to do so, or allow adoption only in specified circumstances.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{creating}} partnerships {{was signed}} on 9 July 2004 and took effect on 1 November 2004. The partnerships, {{which are based}} on the French <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> (PACS), are available for same-sex and opposite-sex couples. These partnerships provide many of the rights of marriage in relation to access to welfare benefits and fiscal advantages but not the same as marriage. They do not give the right to jointly adopt children.|$|E
5000|$|After the <b>Civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact,</b> {{marriage}} {{is only a}} step towards gay parenting. I am opposed to it. The State, which gives symbolism its force of constraint and benchmark for society - and not vice versa - should not allow marriage and filiation between two persons of the same sex. If human sexuality is not simply [...] "natural", it is not entirely cultural, free from the laws of reproduction.|$|E
5000|$|In France, a <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> (pacte civil de solidarité), {{commonly}} known as a PACS (...) , is a contractual form of civil union between two adults for organising their joint life. It brings rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage. The PACS was voted by the French Parliament in October 1999, largely to offer some legal status to same-sex couples.In 2012, 94% of PACS were nonetheless between opposite-sex couples.|$|E
50|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pacts</b> (PACS), {{a form of}} {{registered}} domestic partnership, were enacted in 1999 for both same-sex and unmarried opposite-sex couples {{by the government of}} Lionel Jospin. Couples who enter into a PACS contract are afforded most of the legal protections, rights, and responsibilities of marriage. The right to adoption and artificial insemination are also denied to PACS partners (and are largely restricted to heterosexual married couples). Unlike married couples, they were originally not allowed to file joint tax returns until after 3 years, though this was repealed in 2005, and joint tax returns can now be filed immediately.|$|R
50|$|In France, {{same-sex}} couples {{are allowed to}} wed (as of 2013), and are eligible to full military family benefits under French law. Until 2013, <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pacts</b> (PACS) were allowed to all same-sex and opposite-sex couples, but did not possess several rights which are made available to same-sex unions outside France, such as marriages in Belgium or civil partnerships in the United Kingdom. PACS are recognized by the French Armed Forces, but consequently confer fewer abilities or benefits to same-sex (or opposite-sex) couples than opposite-sex marriages. Joint adoptions of children by {{same-sex couples}} are also not legal under PACS.|$|R

50|$|The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) under George Papandreou, then in opposition, {{presented}} in April 2006, a legislative {{proposal for the}} recognition of unmarried couples, homosexual and heterosexual, following the French example of the <b>Civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact.</b> However, according to some LGBT groups, the proposal's controversial terminology made little headway on LGBT rights and PASOK's proposed partnership banned same-sex couples from adopting. In November 2008, PASOK once again submitted a draft law on civil partnership, even though it made no progress in the legislature.|$|E
50|$|The Juncker-Polfer Government {{consisting}} of the Christian Social People's Party (CSV) and the Democratic Party drafted a bill establishing partnerships, approving it in cabinet on 26 April 2002. The Council of State criticised in its opinion of 13 January 2004 taking the French <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> (PACS) as basis rather than the Belgian statutory cohabitation, which was of superior legal quality. Furthermore, it recommended considering the legalisation of same-sex marriage, again taking neighbouring Belgium, which had then recently taken that step, as example.|$|E
50|$|According to EU Court of Justice {{case law}} {{based on the}} Employment Equality Framework Directive, {{employees}} in a civil partnership with a same-sex partner must be granted the same benefits as those granted to their colleagues upon their marriage, where marriage is not possible for same-sex couples. The Court established this principle in 2008 {{in the case of}} Tadao Maruko v. Versorgungsanstalt der deutschen Bühnen with regards to a German registered life partnership. In December 2013, the Court confirmed this in the case of Frédéric Hay v. Crédit agricole mutuel (C-267/12) with regards to a French <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact,</b> which is significantly inferior to marriage than a German registered life partnership.|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{revolution}} in France {{in the decade}} of the 1970 s is characterized by social openness toward sex. There is a change in the pattern of spousal living, including same-sex relation. Homosexuals in France have the courage to declare their sexual orientation. Despite pros and cons within the French society, PACS or the <b>solidarity</b> <b>civil</b> <b>pact,</b> since 1999, allowed homosexual pairs to formalize their commitment outside marriage. French songs with homosexual themes began to appear in {{the decade of the}} 1960 s. Since then, around 90 songs foreground homosexuality through various themes and perspectives. In the first reading, the lyrics only foreground the emergence of consciousness or confession of a homosexual. The theme of the orientation of homosexual behaviour can be found in most of the songs. Other themes are related to other perspectives. Further discussion shows that these songs are presented in terms of three negative perspectives: negative, positive and neutral. The negative perspective uses homosexuality as an object of joke, the second proposes defense for the homosexual community, and the neutral perspective is completely descriptive and generally portrays sexuality and sensuality among the homosexuals...|$|R

However, while only very sparse information and estimates were available on the level of state fixed assets for the negotiations in spring 1993, the decisions for <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Pact</b> II in 2001 could rely on a broader data base. Estimates by DIW Berlin on state fixed assets in East and West Germany played an important part. They in turn were based on an estimated development in public investment for the years 1998 to 2004. A comparison of this with the actual development in east and west Germany shows considerable discrepancies between the forecast and the actual figures. ...|$|R
5000|$|In France since 1968, article 515-81 of Code civil defines {{domestic}} partnership (in French: concubinage [...] or concubinage notoire) as {{a de facto}} union between two persons, of different sex or of same sex, characterised by a stable and continuous cohabitation and partnership. The French fiscal administration takes it into account in the calculation of the solidarity tax on wealth but not for other purposes. All children enjoy equal right whether within or outside wedlock. Since 1999 French law also provides for a <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> (in French: pacte civil de solidarité, or PACS), a contractual form of civil union between two adults bringing additional rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage.|$|E
5000|$|Since then, the PCF's {{ideology}} {{has been}} marked by significant ideological evolution on some topics but consistency on other issues. Some of the most marked changes have come on individual rights and immigration. After having vilified homosexuality and feminism as [...] "the rubbish of capitalism" [...] in the 1970s, the PCF now fully supports both gay rights and feminism. In the 1980s, the PCF supported reducing the age of consent for homosexual relationships and opposed attempts to repenalize homosexuality. In 1998, the PCF voted in favour of the <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> (PACS), civil unions including homosexual couples. The PCF currently supports both same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption. On 12 February 2013, PCF deputies voted in favour of same-sex marriage and adoption rights in the National Assembly. (However, one PCF deputy, Patrice Carvalho, voted against.) The PCF also supports feminist movements and supports policies to further promote gender equality and parity.|$|E
5000|$|During this period, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and The Greens were in {{opposition}} {{while the government}} was led by the conservative Austrian People's Party (ÖVP).

First, in June 2004, The Greens proposed a [...] "Zivilpakt" [...] (de) modelled after the French <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> (PACS). In December 2004, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) adopted a major policy decision {{on the issue of}} equal treatment of same-sex couples. In addition to calling for the introduction of registered partnerships, the party supported the investigation of opening marriage for same-sex couples. In May 2005, The Greens became the first major party to expressly call for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. The Greens praised the June 2005 referendum in Switzerland legalising registered partnerships and called for equal rights in Austria. In April 2006, the Vienna branch of the Social Democrats (SPÖ) followed the Greens in explicitly calling for the legalisation of marriage and adoption for same-sex couples.|$|E

50|$|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, {{transgender}} (LGBT) {{rights in}} France {{have been seen}} as traditionally liberal. Although same-sex sexual activity was a capital crime that often resulted in the death penalty during the Ancien Régime, all sodomy laws were repealed in 1791 during the French Revolution. However, a lesser known indecent exposure law that often targeted homosexuals was introduced in 1960 before being repealed twenty years later. The age of consent for same-sex sexual activity was altered more than once before being equalized in 1982 under then-President of France François Mitterrand. After granting same-sex couples domestic partnership benefits known as the <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact,</b> France became the thirteenth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage in 2013. Laws prohibiting {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation and gender identity have been enacted since 1985. Transgender individuals are allowed to change their legal gender and since 2009, France became the first country in the world to declassify transgenderism as a mental illness. France has frequently been named one of the most gay friendly countries in the world. Recent polls have indicated that a majority of the French support same-sex marriage and in 2013, another poll indicated that 77% of the French viewed that homosexuality should be accepted by society, one of the highest in the world. Paris has been named by many publications as one of the most gay friendly cities in the world, with Le Marais, Quartier Pigalle and Bois de Boulogne being said to have a thriving LGBT community and nightlife.|$|E

The objective of the Intergenerational <b>Solidarity</b> <b>Pact</b> (ISP) was to increase the employment rate of older workers. The main policies consist in a reduction in employers’ social security contributions, several reforms intending to discourage access to early retirement, an easier access to working time reduction with (partial) wage compensation, and a pension bonus. In 2008, the reduction in employers’ social security contributions represented, on average, 0.7 % of total labor cost among workers aged 50 years old and over.

40|$|Up to 2019, the “Neue Länder” in Germany are benefitting from {{financial}} transfer {{within the framework}} of the <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact.</b> From 2005 to 2007, the “Neue Länder” were able to improve they financial situation and used the <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> payments efficiently. However, these payments are decreasing annually. This implies a significant financial reduction to the “Neue Länder’s” overall budgets and a considerable challenge for their future investments. This article analyses publications by the governments of the “Neue Länder” about their medium term budget planning and related progress reports from the year 2006. The consolidation of their budgets seems to be an essential aspect in the policy strategy of “Neue Länder” due to limited tax autonomy and legal restrictions on their expenditures. However, we identified several consolidation strategies with regard to infrastructural priorities, restructuring of administration, and creation of reserves. The public revenues of the “Neue Länder” are expected to decline in 2009 due to the current recession. In case that there are no fundamental changes in the underlying economic structures, the financial scope of the “Neue Länder” is going to be increasingly constrained, in particular with regard to future investments. ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{an issue of}} {{financing}} German Unity, curentlly through <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> II. Shortly after the reunification of Germany in 1990 {{it was obvious that}} the process of equalizing the economic levels of both parts of Germany required high financial transfers. And so the ambitious project called the economic reconstruction of eastern Germany (Aufbau Ost) was launched in order to provide eastern Germany the needed financial sources. Today it is done through the so called <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> II. The aim of this thesis is to find out how two economically different developed federal states (Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) were gaining and using those financial sources during a specified period. Another aim is to analyze the ways of usage, to identify the unusualness and also to find the cause of criticism that comes from the western old federal states. On the basis of the analysis of the gaining financial recourses by Saxony and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern emerged partly interesting findings. Both states, although they have many differences, invest in a similar way, especially into the infrastructural deficits. Opposite to that, they do not invest that much into the equalization of disproportional financial power of municipalities. This fact {{is one of the reasons}} why the old federal states [...] ...|$|R

40|$|At a {{time when}} Europe {{is looking for a}} third way between neo-liberalism and social democracy, this paper proposes to revisit the State/Market divide by {{examining}} the impact of the 'right of establishment' and the 'freedom to provide services' on policies that favour the provision of welfare services by organised civil society defined as a third sector between the State and the Market. To this end, an analytical distinction will be drawn between social solidarity, which refers to the redistributive policies of the welfare state, and <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity,</b> which manifests a political community's preference for civil society organisations in welfare delivery. The thrust {{of this paper is to}} argue that, in both Smits and Peerbooms, pursuant to which delivering welfare is an economic activity, and Watts, according to which the way welfare is delivered in the home state does not matter, the European Court of Justice has cast doubt on the hands-off approach initially adopted in Sodemare and Humbel, wherein social solidarity was clearly positioned in the non-economic sphere so that services financed essentially by the State and the <b>civil</b> <b>solidarity</b> structure through which those services are delivered would escape the reach of Community law...|$|R

The Saint-Imier coalition agreed to a <b>solidarity</b> <b>pact</b> to ensure the member federations' independent autonomy and their common union against the General Council. The Bakuninists rebuked the General Council for its centralization of political power and advocation for uniform action towards social emancipation. The coalition would become the Anti-authoritarian International, as formalized at the 1873 Congress of Geneva, and it held that only the proletariat masses could seek social emancipation for themselves through free, spontaneous action and egalitarian economic federation: It could not be imposed from hierarchy.|$|R
