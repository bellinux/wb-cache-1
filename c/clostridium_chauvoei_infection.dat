50|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> is an anaerobic, motile, Gram-positive bacterium. In {{cattle and}} sheep, a severe {{infection}} causes blackleg. Clostridial diseases are considered soil-borne diseases and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei,</b> specifically, {{is known to}} cause blackleg disease in humans and animals. As it is considered a soil-borne disease, scientists have found a correlation between flooding {{and the amount of}} bacteria found in the soil - the spores are redistributed to then contaminate soils, pastures, and water. A study conducted in Taiwan sought to test this correlation by using nucleic acid to extract <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> from the soil before and after flooding. For the first time, there is evidence to show that the environmental distribution of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> is increased after flooding.|$|R

40|$|Blackleg is an {{economically}} important disease of cattle, sheep and other ruminants which is endemic in both {{developed and developing}} countries of the world. Toxins and neuraminidase produced by <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> {{have been reported to}} play significant complimentary roles in the pathogenesis of the disease. In this study, the pathological changes caused by exogenous toxins produced following the culture of C. chauvoei at 24 and 48 h respectively were investigated and it was observed that the 24 h toxin produced more severe pathological changes, compared to the 48 h toxin. Necrosis was observed in the tissues examined, both grossly and histopathologically and was attributed probably to impaired cellular (mitochondrial) respiration. It was concluded that, although toxins produced by C. chauvoei {{play an important role in}} the mechanisms of blackleg, the role of leukotrienes (C 4, D 4 and E 4), cytokines (interleukin- 1, IL- 1; tumour necrosis factor-, TNF-), platelet-activating factor, interferon, complement fragments (anaphylatoxins C 5 a and C 3 a), prostaglandins and neuraminidase in the pathogenesis of C. <b>chauvoei</b> <b>infection</b> in mice need to be thoroughly investigated...|$|R
40|$|In all {{biological}} systems growth {{is defined as}} increase of chemical compounds. Bacteria can achieve to balanced growth if they are growing in a medium, which are completely adapted to it. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei,</b> (<b>Clostridium</b> feseri) is an anaerobic, spore forming, motile, and polymorph bacteria, which its size varies from 0. 5 - 1 to 3 - 8 micron and could be observed as individual bacterium, diplo, and rarely streptococcus. Blackleg is a fatal disease of young cattle. It produces an acute local infection, and the resulting blood poisoning leads to rapid death. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> and, less frequently, Clostridium septicum are the most commonly responsible organisms. Vaccination is the only effective means for controlling of blackleg disease. Several kinds of vaccine are available commercially. It is 4 decades that blackleg vaccine is produced in Razi institute and because of enhanced demand of country, {{decision was made to}} improve the production procedure of this vaccine using large-scale fermenter, so the aim of this study was adaptation of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> to growth and proliferation in fermenter for preparation of a potent vaccine. Accordingly attempts were made to prepare and formulate the ingredients in order to obtain high yield of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> in culture medium by fermenter. All experiments were done in two sets: A-growth in glass bottles using conventional culture medium and B-growth in fermenter using conventional culture medium similar to A and also enriched culture medium. Results showed high yield of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> suspension in fermenter after 10 hours, using enriched culture medium (more than 1, 480, 000, 000 organisms/ml), but no significant changes was obtained in glass bottles conditions comparing to the fermenter conditions. The safety and potency of the prepared vaccine was determined in sheep and guinea pigs according to British pharmacopoeia (veterinary) with satisfactory results.

40|$|<b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> is {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} diseases such as symptomatic coal (blackleg) and malignant oedema in cattle, sheep and many other domestic and wild animals. Vaccines for the control of this and other livestock diseases caused by various species of clostridia are widely used. For vaccine production it is desirable that high cellular density cultures with high immunogenic power are obtained, mainly because immunity to <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> is generally considered to be antibacterial rather than antitoxic. Consequently, culture conditions have to be adequately monitored and controlled. The aim of this work was to optimise the production of a vaccine against <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> based on strains IRP- 434, IRP 206, ATCC 10092, ATCC 11957 and LANIP, used by “Empresa Colombiana de Productos Veterinarios”, VECOL, S.

Spinach ferredoxin activity {{was determined by the}} absorbancy measuerment (UV. Spectrophotometer) in ultraviolet (UV) - visible region. Different concentrations of sterilized spinach ferredoxin were added to the Reinforced Clostridial Agar (RCA) and Reinforced Clostridial Medium (RCM) as substitutes for cysteine hydrochloride. The modified RCA and RCM media were then used for cultivation of Clostridium perfringens and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> strains. Absorbancy measurment and viable counts of some of the above mentioned anaerobic bacteria on spinach ferredoxin media gave better counts than the control media (RCA) and (RCM). The highest growth occurred with 1 % spinach ferredoxin added to both (RCA) and (RCM). Moreover, spinach ferredoxin supported the anaerobic bacterial growth even in its lowest concentration (0. 1 %). Generally, some of the tested anaerobic bacteria produced larger colonies on media prepared from the spinach ferredoxin. The redox-potential (E 0) was measured by platinum electrode during the growth of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> strain (Kad 1) on modified RCM without cysteine hydrochloride + 1 % spinach ferredoxin, RCM (control) and RCM without cysteine hydrochloride or spinach ferredoxin.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> causes blackleg, {{an acute}} disease {{associated}} with high mortality in ruminants. The apparent primary port of entry is oral, during grazing on pasture contaminated by spores. Cases of blackleg can occur year after year on contaminated pastures. A method to determine the prevalence of C. chauvoei spores on pasture would be useful. The standard method for C. chauvoei detection is culture and biochemical identification, which requires a pure culture. In most muscle samples from cattle dead from blackleg the amount of C. chauvoei in samples is high and the bacterium can easily be cultured, although some samples may be contaminated. Detection by PCR would be faster and independent of contaminating flora. Digested residues from biogas plants provide an excellent fertiliser, but {{it is known that}} spore-forming baeria such as Clostridium spp. are not reduced by pasteurisation. The use of digested residues as fertiliser may contribute to the spread of C. chauvoei. Soil, manure and substrate from biogas plants are contaminated with other anaerobic bacteria which outgrow C. chauvoei. Therefore, detection by PCR is would be useful. This study applied a PCR-based method to detect of C. chauvoei in 25 muscle and blood samples, 114 manure samples, 84 soil samples and 33 samples from the biogas process. Methods Muscle tissues from suspected cases of blackleg were analysed both by the standard culture method followed by biochemical identification and by PCR, with and without preculture. To investigate whether muscle tissue samples are necessary, samples taken by swabs were also investigated. Samples from a biogas plant and manure and soil from farms were analysed by culture followed by PCR. The farms had proven cases of blackleg. For detection of C. chauvoei in the samples, a specific PCR primer pair complementary to the spacer region of the 16 S- 23 S rRNA gene was used. Results <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> was detected in 32 % of muscle samples analysed by culture with identification by biochemical methods and in 56 % of cases by culture in combination with PCR. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> was detected in 3 (out of 11) samples from the biogas plants collected before pasteurisation, but samples taken after pasteurisation and after digestion all tested negative. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei</b> was not detected in any soil or silage samples and only one manure samples tested positive. Conclusion The diagnostic method used for C. chauvoei was not applicable in estimating the risk of blackleg on particular pastures from manure or soil samples, but found to be highly useful for clinical samples. </p...|$|R

The mature sialidase has a calculated molecular mass of 81 kDa and contains the carbohydrate binding module 32 (CBM 32, or F 5 / 8 type C domain), the sialic acid binding module CBM 40 and the enzymatically active sialidase domain found in all pro- and eukaryotic sialidases. Sialidase activity {{does not require the}} CBM 32 domain. The NanA protein is secreted by C. chauvoei as a dimer. The nanA gene was found to be conserved and sialidase activity was found in C. chauvoei strains isolated over a period of 50 years from various geographical locations. Antiserum directed against a recombinant 40 kDa peptide containing CBM 40 and part of the enzymatically active domain of NanA neutralized the secreted sialidase activity of all C. chauvoei strains tested...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was aimed at {{polymerase}} chain reaction (PCR) amplification and cloning of NAD-dependent betahydroxybutyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (BHBD) gene of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>chauvoei.</b> Materials and Methods: C. chauvoei was cultured and confirmed by 16 - 23 S rDNA spacer region primers. The primers for nad-bhbd gene of C. chauvoei were designed to aid in cloning into pRham-N-His SUMO-Kan vector, and nad-bhbd gene was amplified by PCR. The amplified nad-bhbd gene was purified and cloned into pRham-N-His SUMO-Kan expression vector. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. cloni 10 G cells and the clone was confirmed by colony PCR using the pRham-SUMO-NAD-For and pRham-SUMO-NAD-Rev primers and also by sequencing. Results: PCR amplification of nad-bhbd gene yielded a product length of 844 base pairs which was cloned into pRham-NHis SUMO-Kan vector followed by transformation into E. cloni 10 G chemically competent cells. The recombinant clones were characterized by colony PCR, sequencing, followed by basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) analysis to confirm the insert. Conclusions: Immunogenic protein NAD- dependent BHBD of C. chauvoei was cloned and the recombinant clones were confirmed by colony PCR and sequencing analysis...|$|R
