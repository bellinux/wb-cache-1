5|$|Yates has {{cautioned that}} P. {{gracilis}} {{may be a}} metataxon, which {{means that there is}} neither evidence that the material assigned to it is monophyletic (belongs to one species), nor that it is paraphyletic (belongs to several species). This is the case because the holotype of P.(Sellosaurus) gracilis has no skull, and the other specimens consist of skulls and material that overlaps too little with the holotype to make it <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> belongs to the same taxon. It is therefore possible that the known material contains more species belonging to Plateosaurus.|$|E
5|$|When Martin {{was between}} Hollywood {{projects}} {{in the summer of}} 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called Avalon. After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of A Game of Thrones. Putting Avalon aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was part of a longer story. After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story and started making maps and genealogies. However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series Doorways that ABC had ordered but ultimately never aired.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} such plats {{depicting}} naval actions and expeditions that {{are attributed to}} Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was presented to the}} king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that sank at the Battle of the Solent 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date, since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549. The galleasses, the Antelope, Hart, Bull and Tiger, all present in the second roll, were still being built around March 1546, and the Hart was not at sea until October that year. At the same time the Galley Blanchard, captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{origins of}} the {{expression}} have not been clearly established.

Thus, it is quite likely that it appeared in writing on the legal documents that the company had to draft in order to grant these concessions, a privilege that conferred upon it the status of royal factory.|$|E

A later mill building still stands near the house, although it not <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is on the same location. In 1296 it was documented as having formerly been a grange of Neath Abbey, known as Hirrole Grange, forerunner of the present name. By the late 18th century, there was a farmhouse on the site, and was part of the huge estates of Sir Herbert Mackworth of Gnoll Castle.|$|E

25|$|The USSR {{seemed to}} have {{completed}} {{the formation of a}} monolithic Soviet bloc and concluded the partition of Europe, which appeared to vindicate and certainly crystallized the pessimistic, darkest appraisals of Soviet power in the West by people who felt <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was folly to try to do business with Moscow. Because its impact was equally profound in Western Europe as in the United States, it helped unify Western countries against the Communist bloc. It gave an air of prescience to the French and Italian governments for having forced their local Communists out of their governments a year earlier.|$|E
25|$|None of Ward's {{friends or}} {{business}} acquaintances joined in {{his enthusiasm for}} his revolutionary idea. Although his idea was generally considered to border on lunacy and his first inventory was destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire, Ward persevered. In August 1872, with two fellow employees and a total capital of $1,600 he formed Montgomery Ward & Company. He rented a small shipping room on Normandy lane trail fleet and published a general merchandise mail-order catalog with 163 products listed. It is said that in 1880, Aaron Montgomery Ward initially wrote all catalog copy. When the business grew and department heads wrote merchandise descriptions, he still went over every line of copy to be <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was accurate.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Uruk period (c. 4100–2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of {{southern}} Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 people) where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area—from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as central Iran.|$|E

25|$|It seems <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was never}} rebuilt. Pliny the Elder {{mentions}} its name (Selinus oppidum), {{as if it}} still existed as a town in his time, but Strabo distinctly classes it with extinct cities. Ptolemy, though he mentions the river Selinus, does not mention a town of the name. The Thermae Selinuntiae (at modern Sciacca), which derived their name from the ancient city, and {{seem to have been}} much frequented in the time of the Romans, were situated at a considerable distance, 30km, from Selinunte: they are sulfurous springs, still much valued for their medical properties, and dedicated, like most thermal waters in Sicily, to San Calogero. At a later period they were called the Aquae Labodes or Larodes, under which name they appear in the Itineraries.|$|E
25|$|The leave is {{sometimes}} considered a cricket shot, {{even though the}} batsman physically does not play at or interfere with the ball as it passes him. The leave {{is likely to be}} used by batsmen during the first few balls they receive, to give themselves time to judge the conditions of the pitch and the bowling before attempting to play a shot. Leaving a delivery is a matter of judgement and technique. The batsman still has to watch the ball closely to ensure that it will not hit him or the wicket; he also has to ensure that his bat and hands are kept out of the path of the ball so that it cannot make accidental contact and possibly lead to him being out caught. Batsmen only leave the ball when they are <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will not hit the stumps.|$|E
25|$|The French {{government}} {{regarded the}} appointment of Palmerston as a certain sign of renewed hostilities. They availed themselves of a dispatch {{in which he had}} put forward the name of a Coburg prince as a candidate for the hand of the young queen of Spain as a justification for a departure from the engagements entered into between Guizot and Lord Aberdeen. However little the conduct of the French government in this transaction of the Spanish marriages can be vindicated, it is <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> originated in the belief that in Palmerston France had a restless and subtle enemy. The efforts of the British minister to defeat the French marriages of the Spanish princesses, by an appeal to the Treaty of Utrecht and the other powers of Europe, were wholly unsuccessful; France won the game, though with no small loss of honourable reputation.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{and exactly}} when the statue was commissioned, {{acquired}} or donated is unknown, and documents {{referring to the}} Madonna are scarce {{for the first couple}} of centuries of its existence. It seems <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was part of the cathedral treasure by 993, when Emperor Otto III paid the abbey a visit and donated a crown, the so-called “child’s crown”, which is also part of the treasure to this day. Since this first mention the Madonna has always been in the cathedral save in wartime. Apparently the bitter conflict between the diocese of Cologne and the Lords of Isenberg over control of Essen Abbey that resulted in the murder of Archbishop Engelbert at the hands of Friedrich von Isenberg in 1225 did not affect the sculpture, nor did the centuries-long quarrel over whether the city of Essen was legally a free imperial city or rather a dependency of the abbey.|$|E
25|$|The smaller of the Egyptian ells {{measured}} , but {{the standard}} Babylonian ell, cast in stone {{on one of}} the statues of King Gudea, was 49.5cm (19.49in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8cm (20.67 and 20.79in). The Books of Samuel portray the Temple as having a Phoenician architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships. Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5cm (19.49 or 20.67in), but are fairly <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was one of these two figures. From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit — the finger-breadth (Etzba) — can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2cm (0.83 or 0.87in); Rav Chayim No'eh approximates at 2cm (0.79in); Talmudic scholar Chazon Ish at 2.38cm (0.94in). The mile (Mil) is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760ft) — approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land mile of 5280ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6km).|$|E
25|$|In the inscription, the runes aukrimulfʀ {{are to be}} read as auk krimulfʀ and the k rune, , thus {{represents}} {{two letters}} at the same time. The runes represent the common Norse name Grímulfr, which was in use all over Scandinavia. It is of note that the name appears in such an old runestone as the other runic attestations of the name are considerably younger, and the name was common in medieval Norway. The name of the deceased, Eyvindr, is a common name in Swedish runic inscriptions, but not Eivísl, {{the name of the}} chieftain of the expedition. The only other secure attestation appears on the contemporary Sparlösa Runestone in Västergötland. Since the name appears on two runestones from roughly the same time and in two districts that were culturally closely connected, the name may refer to the same person on the two runestones. Unfortunately, the Sparlösa Runestone is damaged in several places and although it mentions a battle and although there are images like birds hovering above the rigging of a ship, scholars cannot be <b>certain</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> refers to a chieftain who had fallen in battle. The idenfication between the name Eivísl on the two runestones will remain a hypothesis.|$|E
