5000|$|A {{corporation}} sole {{is a legal}} entity consisting of a single ("sole") incorporated office, occupied by a single ("sole") natural person. A {{corporation sole}} {{is one of two}} types of corporation, the other being a <b>corporation</b> <b>aggregate.</b> [...] This allows corporations (often religious corporations or Commonwealth governments) to pass without interval in time from one office holder to the next successor-in-office, giving the positions legal continuity with subsequent office holders having identical powers and possessions to their predecessors.|$|E
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the writ was of little practical importance. Its principal uses were to compel the appearance of <b>corporations</b> <b>aggregate</b> in revenue suits, and to enforce judgments against shareholders in companies regulated by the Companies Clauses Act 1845, or similar private acts, and against garnishees in proceedings in foreign attachment in the Lord Mayor's Court. It was not used in Scottish law.|$|R

50|$|Corporations are bodies {{corporate}} {{created by}} statute or charter. A corporation sole is a corporation constituted {{by a single}} member, in a particular capacity, and that person's successors in the same capacity, {{in order to give}} them some legal benefit or advantage, particularly that of perpetuity, which a natural person could not have had. Examples are a religious officiant in that capacity, or The Crown in the Commonwealth realms. A <b>corporation</b> <b>aggregate</b> is a corporation constituted by more than one member.|$|E
50|$|In {{some common}} law jurisdictions a {{distinction}} is drawn between <b>corporation</b> <b>aggregate</b> (such as a company, {{which has a}} number of members) and a corporation sole (which is where a person's public office is deemed to have a separate personality from them as an individual). Both have separate legal personality. Historically most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the Archbishop of Canterbury is a corporation sole), but a number of other public offices are now formed as corporations sole.|$|E
50|$|Most {{corporations}} sole are church-related (for example, the Archbishop of Canterbury), {{but some}} political {{offices of the}} United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are also corporations sole. In the United Kingdom, for example, many of the Secretaries of State are corporations sole. In contrast to a corporation sole, a <b>corporation</b> <b>aggregate</b> consists {{of two or more}} persons, typically run by a board of directors. Another difference is that corporations aggregate may have owners or stockholders, neither of which are a feature of a corporation sole.|$|E

5000|$|In ecclesiastical law, {{appropriation}} is {{the perpetual}} annexation of an ecclesiastical benefice {{to the use}} of some spiritual <b>corporation,</b> either <b>aggregate</b> or sole. In the Middle Ages in England the custom grew up of the monasteries reserving to their own use the greater part of the tithes of their appropriated benefices, leaving only a small portion to their vicars in the parishes. On the dissolution of the monasteries the rights to collect [...] "great tithes" [...] were often sold off, along with former monastic lands, to laymen; whose successors, known as [...] "lay impropriators" [...] or [...] "lay rectors," [...] still hold them, the system being known as impropriation.|$|R

40|$|The {{early history}} of New Zealand is very complex {{and there is a}} natural {{tendency}} to focus on the Treaty of Waitangi and to seek in this the legitimation of the modern state. A consequence of this is that we seek to impose Western concepts on Maori which do not fit. The concept of the state in fact has a complicated history within the Western legal tradition. It is only in modern times that the Crown has been thought of as a <b>corporation</b> <b>aggregate.</b> At the same time, public international law has recognised a concept of the state for its purposes. This requires a permanent population, a defined territory, government and capacity to enter into relations with other states. Thus we have a poor fit between the domestic conceptions and the conception of public international law...|$|E
40|$|In the United Kingdom {{and those}} {{countries}} that recognise Elizabeth II as their Queen, there {{are to be found}} certain fundamental constitutional principles. One of these is that much of the legal basis of executive power derives from the Crown, though this has, in the past, often been downplayed for political and other reasons. Indeed, in the Commonwealth as a whole, political independence has often been equated with the reduction {{of the role of the}} Crown to a position of subservience to the political executive. What remains important is the position of the Crown as an organising principle of government (the framework upon which the structure of government is built), as a source of legitimacy, and as a symbol for permanent government. Executive power, therefore, remains based on the royal prerogative, and the ?third source? of authority (the legal powers of the legal natural person, as the Crown is a <b>corporation</b> <b>aggregate),</b> as well as upon statute law. The royal prerogative is the residue of royal power which derives from the ancient rights, privileges and powers of the Sovereign, including the prerogative of mercy, political prerogatives such as declaring war or peace, and financial prerogatives such as bona vacantia. Within the scope of the royal prerogative, the Sovereign once had a comparatively free hand to act. Yet even these powers are now limited by the legal concept of convention, and, more recently, by the principles of administrative law. The Sovereign enjoys certain powers, but these are to be exercised (for the most part) by Ministers responsible to Parliament, rather than by the Sovereign personally, without, however, prior authorisation ? or subsequent validation ? by Parliament. The idea that the prerogative is an uncomfortable fit with the supremacy of Parliament, and the rule of law, weakens its position (as does other factors), for it was seen as something of an enigma, or even a black hole. The very survival of the prerogative is now questioned in some quarters, though whether the curtailment of the prerogative results in its eventual extinction is a moot question ? as is the question of whether this would be a desirable outcome.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the transformations underwent by the corporate form from its Roman origins to the present. It shows that every {{time there was a}} shift {{in the role of the}} corporation, three theories of the <b>corporation</b> (the <b>aggregate,</b> artificial, and real entity theories) were brought forward in cyclical fashion. Every time, however, the real entity theory prevailed, and it was the dominant theory during periods ofstability in the relationship between the corporation, the shareholders, and the state. The {{article describes}} this evolution in detail, and then attempts to derive normative consequences for the legitimacy of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The basic argument is that under the real entity view, which is historically the dominant view of the corporation, CSR is normatively acceptable even when it does not contribute to the long-run welfare of the shareholders...|$|R
50|$|The {{substitution}} of one central corporation {{for the many}} local and independent corporations of the church, so far at least as the management of property is concerned, was a constitutional change of great importance, {{and the effect of}} it undoubtedly was to correct the anomalous distribution of ecclesiastical revenues by equalising incomes and abolishing sinecures. At the same time it was regarded as having made a serious breach in the legal theory of ecclesiastical property. The important principle, says Crippe, on which the inviolability of the church establishment depends, that the church generally possesses no property as a corporation, or which is applicable to general purposes, but that such particular ecclesiastical <b>corporation,</b> whether <b>aggregate</b> or sole, has its property separate, distinct and inalienable, according to the intention of the original endowment, was given up without an effort to defend it (Law Relating to the Church and Clergy).|$|R

30|$|For our example, we use {{portfolio}} of 5, 000 counterparties belonging to ten different sectors. The data {{used to estimate}} the sector distributions are monthly PD values over 10 years, which are estimated via a Merton type model (see Merton (1974)) from marked data (i.e. stock prices and liabilities) for over 20, 000 <b>corporations</b> and <b>aggregated</b> on sector level. The portfolio {{as well as the}} underlying data are explained in more detail in Fischer and Jakob (2015) and Jakob and Fischer (2014). We estimate pTAS distributions for each sector by using MLE and the empirically observed skewness and compare the results on portfolio risk figures with the original setting (i.e. gamma distributions parametrized via mean and variance) and a framework using the lognormal distribution and the Weibull distribution. Because of the relatively small number of observations (10 years of monthly data), we do not use the kurtosis or quantile estimation methods in this example. For the Monte Carlo simulation of the CreditRisk+ model the GCPM R-package is used. The dependency between sector variables are modeled via a Student-t copula with 3.8 degrees of freedom, estimated using a maximum likelihood approach 5.|$|R

5000|$|Economist Richard Koo {{wrote that}} Japan's [...] "Great Recession" [...] {{that began in}} 1990 was a [...] "balance sheet recession". It was {{triggered}} by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to become insolvent, meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero interest rates and expansion of the money supply to encourage borrowing, Japanese <b>corporations</b> in <b>aggregate</b> opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type Great Depression, in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the built-in flexibility properties — {{as measured by}} the elasticity of revenue with respect to profits — of the UK corporation tax system. Emphasis is placed on determining some of the major influences {{on the extent to which}} total corporation tax revenue changes when profits change over the economic cycle. A microsimulation model, CorpSim, is constructed and used to obtain numerical results. In the model, corporations use group relief, capital allowances and losses in a tax-minimising manner. The growth of <b>aggregate</b> <b>corporation</b> tax revenue in practice in the UK appears to be highly volatile in relation to the growth of profits. High volatility in revenue elasticities is found to be especially associated with economic downturns. In mild economic downturns, corporation tax revenue elasticities may rise (because tax growth falls less than profit growth), but in more severe downturns, large but temporary decreases in revenue elasticities (and even negative elasticities) can be expected. ...|$|R

This doctoral dissertation consists of a collection of articles aimed at the study of various econometric methodologies that allow for the use of large datasets in macroeconomic applications. Chapters 2 and 5 present large dimensional models to nowcast and forecast macroeconomic variables of interests, such as Finnish real output and the binary recession indicator. In particular, in Chapter 2 I use microeconomic data to create timely estimates of the aggregate output indicator of the Finnish economy. In Chapter 5, I use a large dimensional probit model to compute short and long-term forecasts of the United States recession indicator. Chapters 3 and 4 consist of studies related to Finnish enteprises. Specifically, in Chapter 3 I examine the employment behavior of small and large Finnish firms and analyze how their job creation and cyclicality has differed over the last 16 years. In Chapter 4, I analyze the effect of shocks to large Finnish <b>corporations</b> onto the <b>aggregate</b> business cycle, finding that the shocks to a small number of companies are able to explain a substantial share of the fluctuations in aggregate output.
