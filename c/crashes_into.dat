50|$|The {{film has}} a Japanese Zero fighter being damaged over a naval base and then {{deliberately}} <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a naval base hangar.

50|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, if the two {{vehicles}} {{have similar}} physical structure, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> another car is equivalent to <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a rigid surface (like a wall) at half of the closing speed. This means that rear-ending a stationary car while travelling at 50 km/h (30 mph) is equivalent, in terms of deceleration, to <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a wall at 25 km/h (15 mph). The {{same is true for}} the vehicle <b>crashed</b> <b>into.</b> However, if one of the vehicles is significantly more rigid (e.g. the rear of a truck) then the deceleration is more typically reflected by the full closing speed for the less rigid vehicle.|$|R
