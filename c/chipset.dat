5|$|The Itanium bus {{interfaces}} to {{the rest}} of the system via a <b>chipset.</b> Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The <b>chipset</b> is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a <b>chipset</b> costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a <b>chipset</b> in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chipset</b> {{and drivers}} used to {{implement}} USB and FireWire have a crucial {{impact on how}} much of the bandwidth prescribed by the specification is achieved in the real world, along with compatibility with peripherals.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} MacBook, {{available in}} {{black or white}} colors, was released on June 28, 2006, and used the Intel Core Duo processor and 945GM <b>chipset,</b> with Intel's GMA 950 integrated graphics on a 667MHz front side bus. Later revisions of the MacBook moved to the Core 2 Duo processor and the GM965 <b>chipset,</b> with Intel's GMA X3100 integrated graphics on an 800MHz system bus. Sales of the black polycarbonate MacBook ceased in October 2008, after {{the introduction of the}} aluminum MacBook.|$|E

50|$|Motherboards {{and their}} <b>chipsets</b> often come from {{different}} manufacturers. , manufacturers of <b>chipsets</b> for x86 motherboards include AMD, Broadcom, Intel, NVIDIA, SiS and VIA Technologies. Apple computers and Unix workstations have traditionally used custom-designed <b>chipsets.</b> Some server manufacturers also develop custom <b>chipsets</b> for their products.|$|R
5|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum {{data rate}} in USB2.0 is 480Mbit/s (60MB/s) per controller and is shared amongst all attached devices. Some <b>chipset</b> manufacturers overcome this bottleneck by providing multiple USB2.0 controllers within the southbridge.|$|E
5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments {{had been}} making {{available}} the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 <b>chipset</b> appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design a calculator to compete with the HP-35 using this series of chips. Despite scepticism about the feasibility of the project from Texas Instruments engineers, Nigel Searle was able to design algorithms that sacrificed some speed and accuracy in order to implement scientific functions on the TMS0805 variation.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{modifications}} to the algorithms used meant that a <b>chipset</b> intended for a four-function calculator was able to process scientific functions, but {{at the cost of}} reduced speed and accuracy. Compared to contemporary scientific calculators, some functions were slow to execute, and others had limited accuracy or gave the wrong answer, but the cost of the Sinclair was {{a fraction of the cost}} of competing calculators.|$|E
50|$|VIA's {{business}} {{focuses on}} integrated <b>chipsets</b> for the PC market. Among PC users, VIA {{is best known}} for its motherboard (core-logic) <b>chipsets.</b> However, VIA's products include audio controllers, network/connectivity controllers, low-power CPUs, and even CD/DVD-writer <b>chipsets.</b> PC and peripheral vendors such as ASUS then buy the <b>chipsets</b> for inclusion into their own product brands.|$|R

5|$|In March 2013, Juniper {{released}} the EX9200 switch, which isn't {{part of the}} MX Series, but uses the same software and Trio <b>chipset.</b> A virtualized MX series 3D router, the vMX 3D, was introduced in November 2014. A suite of updates were announced in late 2015. New MPC line cards were introduced, which have a throughput of up to 1.6 Tbit/s. Simultaneously the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) was announced. JET is a programming interface for integrating third-party applications that automate provisioning, maintenance and other tasks. The Junos Telemetry Interface was also announced at the same time. It reports data to applications and other equipment to automate changes to the network in response to faults or in order optimize performance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chipset</b> {{brought a}} 1066MHz system bus, use of DDR3 system memory, and {{integrated}} Nvidia GeForce 9400M graphics. Other changes include a display which uses LED backlights (replacing the fluorescent tube backlights {{used in the}} previous model) and arsenic-free glass, a new Mini DisplayPort (replacing the polycarbonate MacBook's mini-DVI port), a multi-touch glass trackpad which also acts as the mouse button, {{and the removal of}} the FireWire 400 port (thus it doesn't support Target Disk Mode, used for data transfers or operating system repairs without booting the system).|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Street Fighter II in 1991 is {{considered}} a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre. Yoshiki Okamoto's team developed the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre thus far. This allowed players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, which had previously required an element of luck. The graphics took advantage of Capcom's CPS arcade <b>chipset,</b> with highly detailed characters and stages. Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, Street Fighter II allowed players to play against each other. The popularity of Street Fighter II surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners bought more machines {{to keep up with}} demand. Street Fighter II was also responsible for popularizing the combo mechanic, which came about when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left no time for the opponent to recover if they timed them correctly.|$|E

50|$|Memory {{dividers}} {{are only}} applicable to those <b>chipsets</b> in which memory speed {{is dependent on}} FSB speeds. Certain <b>chipsets</b> like nVidia 680i have separate memory and FSB lanes due to which memory clock and FSB clock are asynchronous and memory dividers are not used there.

25|$|AMD {{released}} new <b>chipsets</b> in 2017 {{to support}} the release of their new Ryzen products.

While Intel did not confirm support for 6-series <b>chipsets,</b> TRIM on RAID 0 volumes {{has been shown}} to work on Z68, P67, and X79 <b>chipsets</b> by hardware enthusiasts with a modified RAID option ROM. It is speculated that the lack of official support for 6-series <b>chipsets</b> is due to validation costs or an attempt to encourage consumers to upgrade, rather than for technical reasons.|$|R
50|$|Video {{support is}} {{available}} along two paths: Panorama generic unaccelerated VESA driver, or SNAP accelerated video driver.
