60|$|The consul {{turned into}} one of the main arteries of St. Kentigern, a wide street that, however, began and ended inconsequently, and with half a dozen social phases in as many blocks. Here the snow ceased, the fog {{thickened}} suddenly with the waning day, and the consul found himself isolated and cut off on a block which he did not remember, with the clatter of an invisible tramway in his ears. It was a block of small houses with smaller shop-fronts. The one immediately before him seemed to be an optician's, but the dimly lighted windows also displayed the pathetic reinforcement of a few watches, cheap jewelry on cards, and several cairngorm brooches and pins set in silver. It occurred to him that he wanted a new watch crystal, and that he would procure it here and inquire his way. Opening the door he perceived that {{there was no one in}} the shop, but from behind the counter another open door disclosed a neat sitting-room, so close to the street that it gave the <b>casual</b> <b>customer</b> the sensation of having intruded upon domestic privacy. The consul's entrance tinkled a small bell which brought a figure to the door. It was Ailsa Callender.|$|E
60|$|He {{drew out}} of his breast pocket a new pigskin pocket-book. Mrs Verloc {{received}} it without another word, and stood still till the bell, clattering after Mr Verloc and Mr Verloc’s visitor, had quieted down. Only then she peeped in at the amount, drawing the notes out for the purpose. After this inspection she looked round thoughtfully, {{with an air of}} mistrust in the silence and solitude of the house. This abode of her married life appeared to her as lonely and unsafe {{as though it had been}} situated in the midst of a forest. No receptacle she could think of amongst the solid, heavy furniture seemed other but flimsy and particularly tempting to her conception of a house-breaker. It was an ideal conception, endowed with sublime faculties and a miraculous insight. The till was not to be thought of. It was the first spot a thief would make for. Mrs Verloc unfastening hastily a couple of hooks, slipped the pocket-book under the bodice of her dress. Having thus disposed of her husband’s capital, she was rather glad to hear the clatter of the door bell, announcing an arrival. Assuming the fixed, unabashed stare and the stony expression reserved for the <b>casual</b> <b>customer,</b> she walked in behind the counter.|$|E

The application considered is a real-life telephone customer care service. The {{purpose is to}} hypothesize the dominant theme of conversations between a <b>casual</b> <b>customer</b> calling. Conversations are processed by an automatic speech recognition system that provides hypotheses used for extracting word frequency. Features are extracted in different, broadly defined and partially overlapped, time segments. Combinations of each feature in different segments are represented in a quaternion algebra framework. The advantage of the proposed approach is made evident by the statistically significant improvements in theme classification accuracy...|$|E

The goal of this project is not about picking the best horse to win the race, but about enhancing the overall experience of new and <b>casual</b> <b>customers</b> in order to increase the attendance at live horse races. SomoTrack is offering a mobile web application to help the horse racing track enhance its new and casual customers’ experience during live races, potentially turning new customers into recurring customers. The application simplifies the steep learning curve associated with making bets and helps the <b>casual</b> <b>customers</b> to pick horses by eliminating the pain of interpreting raw data from the Daily Racing Form. Additionally, SomoTrack integrates the player’s racetrack experience with social networks like Twitter and Facebook, taking advantage of the power of word of mouth advertising...|$|R

60|$|As for Mr. Hopper, {{increase}} of salary {{had not changed}} him. He still {{lived in the same}} humble way, in a single room in Miss Crane's boarding-house, and he paid very little more for his board than he had that first week in which he swept out Colonel Carvel's store. He was superintendent, now, of Mr. Davitt's Sunday School, and a church officer. At night, when he came home from business, he would read the widow's evening paper, and the Colonel's morning paper at the office. Of true Puritan abstemiousness, his only indulgence was chewing tobacco. It was as early as 1859 that the teller of the Boatman's Bank began to point out Mr. Hopper's back to <b>casual</b> <b>customers,</b> and he was more than once seen to enter the president's room, which had carpet on the floor.|$|R

60|$|It was {{a quarter}} past eleven and the theatres were {{disgorging}} their usual nightly crowds. The most human thoroughfare {{in any of}} the world's great cities was at its best and brightest. Everywhere commissionaires were blowing their whistles, the streets were thronged with slowly-moving vehicles, the pavements were stirring with life. The little crowd which had gathered in front of the chemist's shop was swept away. After all, none of them knew exactly what they had been waiting for. There was a rumor that a woman had fainted or had met with an accident. Certainly she had been carried into the shop and into the inner room, the door of which was still closed. A few passers-by had gathered together and stared and waited for a few minutes, but had finally lost interest and melted away. A human thoroughfare, this, indeed, one of the pulses of the great city beating time night and day to the tragedies of life. The chemist's assistant, with impassive features, was serving a couple of <b>casual</b> <b>customers</b> from behind the counter. Only a few yards away, beyond the closed door, the chemist himself and a hastily summoned doctor fought with Death for the body of the girl who lay upon the floor, faint moans coming every now and then from her blue lips.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{a secret}} brand works off {{of one or more}} of three {{economic}} principles. The first is scarcity value. The secret brand creates products with highly specific, unique qualities, usually very subtle and invisible to the casual observer. These qualities do not necessarily improve the performance of the product and can be inefficiencies (e.g., using heavy-weight denim for <b>casual</b> clothes). The <b>customer</b> purchases the product for its rarity; to have something that is very difficult to acquire.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the service {{recovery}} paradox and double deviation on customers' overall satisfaction considering definitional and methodological issues. This study employed a scenario experimentation manipulated three dimensions of justice at two levels each (2 x 2 x 2 factorial design). A convenience sample of 286 <b>casual</b> restaurant <b>customers</b> was used in the study. Paired sample t-tests were employed to test recovery paradox and double deviation effects after selecting four groups of customers based on recovery satisfaction to take into account the if-condition in the definition of the service recovery paradox. Customers' post-recovery overall satisfaction could be higher than their initial overall satisfaction provided customers were highly satisfied with service recovery (recovery paradox). When customers are somewhat satisfied with recovery efforts, their initial overall satisfaction could be carried over after two transactional evaluations. Double deviation effects were obvious and consistent when customers were either highly dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied with service recovery...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempted to}} demonstrate the antecedents of Subjective Well-Being (SWB) {{and the effects of}} SWB, especially through the relationships among performance, satisfaction, value, SWB, and behavioral intention, in a dining out context. A conceptual model was developed and tested regarding the relationship between SWB-mediated satisfaction and value toward behavioral intention. The sample for this study consisted of fine dining (N = 157) and <b>casual</b> dining restaurant <b>customers</b> (N = 245). The proposed model and hypotheses tests were conducted using the LISREL 8. 71 program. SWB, a central concept examined in this study, was driven by customer satisfaction and value.

40|$|Repute {{is akin to}} honour and to the Weberian {{concept of}} status. It can be studied as a key {{dimension}} of social stratification within modern ‘informational’ societies: widely acknowledged celebrities stand at the top; ordinary people, at the bottom. Celebrity varies also in a ‘horizontal’ dimension : some reputations are limited to a specialized audience (fans of sports or movies, Catholic church faithful, etc.), while some wider celebrities reach a more general audience. Our sociology of celebrity relies upon the analysis of an original corpus: the covers of a French weekly picture magazine, Paris-Match. Only 20 % of the samples are subscribed, so the cover {{plays an important role}} in catching the eye of the numerous <b>casual</b> <b>customers.</b> Most of people whose photographs can be seen on the cover of such a general magazine belong to the world of large celebrity. A grid applied to the content of the covers allows to set up and measure celebrity scores. Among the full set of 2950 covers, 85 % include images of celebrities. 1560 personalities are represented. Along the total 1947 - 2005 period, their scores range from 0. 1 cover (smaller scores are conventionally neglected) to 63. 5 covers (Princess Caroline de Monaco). Inequalities in celebrity scores can be adjusted to a Pareto law (coefficient: 1. 3). Four main domains of specialization can be distinguished: aristocrats, show business personalities, politicians (religious authorities and members of the military are included here), and ‘others’ (sports, science, crime cases, etc.). In every domain, celebrities are selected, through special rules, by specialized agencies. Aristocrats inherit celebrity: here lineages, rather than persons, are entitled to celebrity. Show business obeys to the type of ‘winner-take-all’ economics described by S. Rosen (‘The Economics of Superstars’, AER 1981). In democracies, politicians are the winners of electoral tournaments. Sports display a lot of specialized competitions. Inequalities in the concentration of celebrity are at their highest level among aristocrats, and at their lowest in the ‘others’ column. Paris Match is in itself a selection agency. As a general-interest media, it plays a specific agenda setting role, sorting out the news by order of priorities. This selection is a second order one, coming after those made by specialized agencies. It is not of the ‘cup of the cups’ type: specialized audiences consecrate works and celebrities whose qualities are quite esoteric and can be appreciated only after a long apprenticeship, while general media are aimed at lay wide audiences. Therefore they tend to overrule the selections made by first order agencies, and to support easily accessed works and celebrities. When they portrait high brow celebrities, they focus on family events and love affairs – an approach that can be define as ‘people’. The ‘peopolization’ and ‘showbizification’ of Paris Match along the 1980 s and the 1990 s can be analysed as a consequence of the withering of grand history (especially wars) in which France had been directly implied until 1962. Grand history can be seen as a melting pot in which high brow and low brow cultures mix one with an other...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} understanding of a mediating effect of customer satisfaction on service quality satisfaction and customer loyalty relationship in Malaysian commercial banking industry. To analyze the <b>casual</b> relationships among <b>customer</b> satisfaction, customer trust and customer loyalty, the Structural Equation Model (SEM) was adopted. The model was designed and later analyzed by utilizing the Partial Least Square (PLS) procedure on data collected from a survey that yielded 521 usable questionnaires. The results showed that service quality enhances customer satisfaction in Malaysian commercial banking industry. It was also exposed that customer satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between service quality and customer loyalty. In future more research needs to be done to investigate the role of customer satisfaction in Malaysian commercial banking industry. It is vital to do the research utilizing experimental design by using longitudinal data in Malaysian commercial banking industry via vigorous measures. The findings suggest that the relationship between customer satisfaction and profitability may reside in customer satisfaction’s influence on customer loyalty, and the customer satisfaction plays a crucial role within the Malaysian commercial banking industry.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to empirically {{investigate}} the adoption of retail electronic commerce (REC). REC is a business transaction which takes place over the Internet between a casual consumer and a firm. The consumer has no long-term relationship with the firm, orders a good or service, and pays with a credit card. To date, most REC applications have not been profitable. To build profitable REC applications a better understanding of the system 2 ̆ 7 s users is required. ^ The research model hypothesizes that the level of REC buying is dependent upon the Buying Characteristics of Internet Use and Search Experience plus the Channel Characteristics of Beliefs About Internet Vendors and Beliefs About Internet Security. The effect of these factors is modified by Time. Additional research questions ask about the different types of REC buyers, the differences between these groups, and how these groups evolved over time. ^ To answer these research questions I analyzed publicly available data collected over a three-year period by the Georgia Institute of Technology Graphics and Visualization Unit over the Internet. Findings indicate the model best predicts Number of Purchases in a future period, and that Buyer Characteristics are most important to this determination. Further, this model is evolving over Time making Buyer Characteristics predict Number of Purchases better in more recent survey administrations. Buyers clustered into five groups based on level of buying and move through various levels and buy increasing Number of Purchases over time. ^ This is the first large scale research project to investigate the evolution of REC. This implications are significant. Practitioners with <b>casual</b> consumer <b>customers</b> need to deploy a finely tuned REC strategy, understand their buyers, capitalize on the company reputation on the Internet, install an Internet-compatible infrastructure, and web-enable order-entry/inventory/fulliment/shipping applications. Researchers might wish to expand on the Buyer Characteristics of the model and/or explore alternative dependent variables. Further, alternative theories such as Population Ecology or Transaction Cost Economics might further illuminate this new I. S. research domain. ...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Hotel, Restaurant, Institution Management & DieteticsCarol W. ShanklinKi-Joon BackThis study {{proposed}} and tested a theoretical model of service recovery consisting of antecedents {{and consequences of}} service recovery satisfaction. This study further tested recovery paradox effects and investigated the effects of situational and attributional factors {{in the evaluation of}} service recovery efforts and consequent overall satisfaction and behavioral intentions. The study employed scenario experimentation with three dimensions of justice manipulated at two levels each (2 x 2 x 2 between-groups factorial design). Postage paid, self-addressed envelopes and questionnaires (600 copies) were distributed. Participants represented 15 religious and community service groups. All respondents were regular <b>casual</b> restaurant <b>customers.</b> Of 308 surveys returned, 286 cases were used for data analysis. In study 1, the proposed relationships were tested using the structural equation modeling. In study 2, multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of covariance tests were employed to test proposed hypotheses. The three dimensions of justice had positive effects on recovery satisfaction. Recovery satisfaction had a significant positive effect on customers’ trust. Trust in service providers had positive effect on commitment and overall satisfaction. Commitment had positive effects on overall satisfaction and behavioral intentions. This study indicated that, although a service failure might negatively affect customers’ relationship with the service provider, effective service recovery reinforced attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. The results of this study emphasized that service recovery efforts should be viewed not only as a strategy to recover customers’ immediate satisfaction but also as a relationship tool to provide customers confidence that ongoing relationships are beneficial to them. This study did not find recovery paradox in the experimental scenarios. The magnitude of service failure had significant negative effects on perceived justice and recovery satisfaction. Customers’ rating of stability causation had significant negative effects on overall satisfaction, revisit intention, and word-of-mouth intention. The study findings indicated that positive recovery efforts could reinstate customers’ satisfaction and behavioral intentions up to those of pre-failure. Restaurant managers and their employees need to provide extra efforts to restore the customers’ perceived losses in serious failure situations. Service providers should reduce systematic occurrences of service failure so customer will not develop stability perception...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{capabilities in}} technology, modern hydrographic surveys are comprised of similarly {{increasing amounts of}} data, only a minute fraction of which is currently available in the nautical charts produced by the NOAA Office of Coast Survey (OCS). Simultaneously, {{a tremendous amount of}} effort goes into the generalization and optimal cartographic representation of the hydrographic data onto raster products, from which the vector products are digitized. Preserving and maintaining a single database of high-resolution vector source data will retain— and make accessible—much more of the hydrographic data collected, alleviate the burden of generalization, and would allow for delivery of high-resolution vector products, as well as a very wide selection of raster products. From high-resolution source data, raster output could be generated at customer specifications. These “user-defined” raster products could be suitably tailored to meet anyone’s needs, regardless if they are a mariner, a scientist, a fisherman, a student, or a <b>casual</b> “common man” <b>customer.</b> The “user-defined” concept will ultimately improve our ability to meet the highly variable needs of our customers. This paper is intended as an exploratory endeavor, specifically, using the Paper Chart Editor component of CARIS HPD to create examples of the kinds of raster products one can create from high-resolution source data, how this process could optimize the current raster chart production workflow within OCS, while also providing a stronger focus on customer service. Finally, the capabilities and lessons learned from the experimentation with HPD will be applied toward the NOAA-wide implementation of Nautical Chart System II (NCSII) ...|$|R

Identification of the navigational {{patterns}} of casual visitors {{is an important}} step in online recommendation to convert <b>casual</b> visitors to <b>customers</b> in e-commerce. Clustering and sequential analysis are two primary techniques for mining navigational patterns from Web and application server logs. The characteristics of the log data and mining tasks require new data representation methods and analysis algorithms to be tested in the e-commerce environment. In this paper we present a cube model to represent Web access sessions for data mining. The cube model organizes session data into three dimensions. The COMPO-NENT dimension represents a session as a set of ordered components {c 1,c 2, [...] ., cP}, in which each component ci indexes the ith visited page in the session. Each component is associated with a set of attributes describing the page indexed by it, such as the page ID, category and view time spent at the page. The attributes associated with each component are defined in the ATTRIBUTE dimension. The SESSION dimension indexes individual sessions. In the model, irregular sessions are converted to a regular data structure to which existing data mining algorithms can be applied while the order of the page sequences is maintained. A rich set of page attributes is embedded in the model for different analysis purposes. We also present some experimental results of using the partitional clustering algorithm to cluster sessions. Because the sessions are essentially sequences of categories, the k-modes algorithm designed for clustering categorical data and the clustering method using the Markov transition frequency (or probability) matrix, are used to cluster categorical sequences. ...|$|R
