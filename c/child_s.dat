40|$|Objectives: {{review the}} literature, {{exploring}} {{factors that contribute}} to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior such as the role of learning and social context. Methods: the review of the literature was done using Medline, Psyclit, and Lilacs as resources for assessing international and national research articles on child nutrition, with an emphasis on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior. These articles were revised and grouped together according to the topic. Results: family is responsible for the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior through social learning. Parents are <b>children</b> <b>s</b> first nutritional educators. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> eating experiences are influenced by cultural and psychosocial factors. Social context plays a relevant role in this process, especially through the strategies used by parents to encourage children to have a balanced diet and to eat specific foods. These strategies may contain adequate and inadequate stimuli as to the development of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> food preference and food intake self-control. Conclusion: the learning process is a determining factor for <b>children</b> <b>s</b> eating behavior, and is associated with three factors: food flavor conditioning, food postingestional consequences, and social context. Parents are deeply concerned with the amount of food their children eat and not with the development of more adequate habits and attitudes related to dietary quality. J. pediatr.

40|$|Qualitative {{study on}} the meaning of a <b>child</b> <b>s</b> birth to the father. Its general purpose was to {{comprehend}} the significance the man attaches to his <b>child</b> <b>s</b> birth and its specific objectives were to identify the man s feelings with regard to his <b>child</b> <b>s</b> birth as well as to verify his attitude toward a <b>child</b> <b>s</b> birth. The study was founded on the theoretical reference system about the man in the gravid-puerperal cycle and the humanization of the assistance. The data were obtained through semistructured interview performed with men accompanying their children s birth whose wives were in the immediate puerperium. This stage occurred in two maternity hospitals in Natal-RN, both of which adopt the principle of safe notherhood in the attendance of women in the process of parturition. The material apprehended from the statements was treated in conformity with the content analysis method in the mode of thematic analysis according to Bardin. Three thematic categories emerged from this process: the father s attitude toward his <b>child</b> <b>s</b> birth, the father s feelings in respect of his <b>child</b> <b>s</b> birth, and the informations received by the father {{in the course of his}} <b>child</b> <b>s</b> birth. The speech content was analyzed in accordance with the principles of symbolic interactionism according to Blumer. The results showed that the husbands interact with their respective wives and respond with attitudes of care, help, support, and encouragement within the principles of humanization intermingled with feelings of happiness, restlessness, and suffering leading them to appraise and exalt their consorts. Besides, we verified that the father s attitudes and feelings in the delivery room in the light of symbolic interactionism tend to be influenced by the interaction between him and the attending professionalsCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorEstudo qualitativo acerca do significado do nascimento de um filho para o pai. Teve como objetivo geral compreender o significado que o homem atribui ao nascimento do filho e específicos identificar os sentimentos do homem frente ao nascimento do filho e verificar a atitude do homem diante do nascimento de um filho. O estudo foi fundamentado pelo referencial teórico sobre o homem no ciclo gravídico-puerperal e a humanização da assistência. Os dados foram obtidos através de entrevista semi-estruturada realizada junto a homens que acompanharam o nascimento de seus filhos e cujas mulheres estavam no puerpério imediato. Essa etapa ocorreu em duas maternidades no município de Natal RN, as quais adotam o princípio da maternidade segura no atendimento à mulher no processo da parturição. O material apreendido dos depoimentos foi tratado conforme o método de análise de conteúdo na modalidade de análise temática segundo Bardin. Desse processo emergiram três categorias temáticas: atitude do pai frente ao nascimento do filho, sentimentos do pai relativos ao nascimento do filho e informações recebidas pelo pai durante o processo de nascimento do filho. O conteúdo das falas foi analisado à luz dos princípios do interacionismo simbólico de acordo com Blumer. Os resultados evidenciaram que os homens interagem com suas respectivas mulheres e respondem com atitudes de cuidados, ajuda, apoio e encorajamento dentro dos princípios da humanização, entremeadas por sentimentos de felicidade, inquietações e sofrimento, levando-os a valorizar e enaltecer as suas companheiras.

Entendemos a instituição de educação infantil como espaço que deve respeitar a criança como pessoa em condição {{peculiar}} de desenvolvimento. Adotamos a abordagem sócio-histórica compreendida a partir de Vygotsky e Leontiev, com a teoria social da construção do conhecimento e seu diálogo com autores como Piaget e Brougère. A brincadeira é vista como fruto das relações sociais com grande influência no desenvolvimento infantil. A pesquisa é realizada em 04 creches públicas, dentre 18 existentes no município. Enquanto sujeitos da investigação participam 09 educadoras que trabalham com crianças de 03 e 04 anos e as crianças de suas respectivas salas. Os procedimentos empregados para a constituição do corpus da pesquisa são a observação participante e a entrevista semi-estruturada com as educadoras, enfocando a atividade da brincadeira, especificamente na forma como se manifesta na educação infantil. A partir da constituição do corpus empregamos a análise temática de conteúdo. Agrupamos o comparecimento da brincadeira na educação infantil em três núcleos temáticos para análise detalhada: 1. Brincadeira possibilitada pela educadora; 2. Brincadeira proposta pela educadora; 3. Brincadeira iniciada pelas crianças. Os resultados mostram que, apesar das limitações que configuram a rotina nas creches, a brincadeira comparece na educação infantil.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services offer children a means of developing their reading skills through the provision of books and other resources. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> library services might be operated by public libraries, school library services or schools. A small proportion of public library authorities in the UK choose to operate specialist mobile libraries which cater for children alone. Such vehicles deliver a library service to children {{across a range of}} geographic and socioeconomic areas with the stated aims of promoting reading and a love of books, and accessing children who would not otherwise use library services. This study evaluated whether <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries (CMLs) across the UK reach those aims and examined the methods by which the aims were targeted. It was decided that the most appropriate research method was to take an inductive perspective and qualitative approach forming a constructivist methodology. The evaluation was achieved by the use of grounded theory as a general method together with ethnographic techniques, in order to observe and understand the interactions of social actors, and identify the processes used to encourage reading. Interviews with key individuals were primarily held to gain access into the field and inform the scope of the research. Participant observations were conducted on 12 of the 26 <b>children</b> <b>s</b> libraries operating in the UK and further interviews with <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library (CML) operators and CML service managers were also carried out. Extensive field notes were taken, then coded and analysed by the grounded theory method in order to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> and adults perceptions of the value of a CML to their lives. A model of the influences on <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reading was developed to understand the place of a CML in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> literacy. Existing published research was used initially to set the context of the study, and then as data throughout the project. Published and recognised theories about literacy development, learning, and well-being were consulted at relevant points during the research. Analytical reports of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> library services, practitioner handbooks and professional magazines were searched along with unpublished documents provided by library authorities. Issues that were raised from these sources included: the role of untrained library staff; supplying library services to the socially excluded; working with other agencies and the use of reading intervention schemes. The history, function, purpose and definition of CMLs were outlined. Five theories of event, reach, resource, process and well-being emerged from the data and examples of best practice were identified. The daily operation of a CML was modelled using those five theories to create a transferable standard against which to judge similar <b>children</b> <b>s</b> provision. It was found that <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile libraries promote reading because of their transient nature; through the relationships of children with the staff who work on the vehicles; {{by the nature of the}} learning environment and specialist stock of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> mobile library, and because they access children who would otherwise not use any other library service...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{right to}} {{adequate}} food is protected in {{international human rights}} law, yet {{millions of people are}} suffering from malnutrition worldwide. Children and adolescents living in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes are considered a vulnerable group. Malnutrition in the girl child is of particular concern since it has intergenerational consequences. Little is known about the nutritional status of adolescent girls living in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City, Uganda. A cross-sectional study is an important first step to identify the main nutritional challenges in order to intervene appropriately. Aim: The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess the nutritional status of adolescent girls in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City, by evaluating anthropometric indicators, assessing body composition and investigating dietary patterns. Subjects and methods: A total of 44 girls aged 10 – 19 years living at five <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes participated in the study. A reference group consisted of 27 adolescent girls from three boarding schools in Kampala City. Height and weight were measured to assess the proportion of girls who were stunted, thin, overweight or obese. Body composition data was obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Dietary intake was evaluated with a Food Frequency Questionnaire, calculation of dietary diversity score (DDS) and a 24 -hour dietary recall. Results: Adolescent girls in selected <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes in Kampala City suffered from stunting, overweight or obesity, and were at risk of insufficient intakes of multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids. Dietary diversity was low with a median score of 3 out of 9 food groups. Animal products were rarely consumed. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> home participants appeared especially at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins A, B 12, C, D, E and calcium. Median estimated intake of vitamins B 12 and D were zero. The adequacy of the diet in terms of energy, macronutrients and micronutrients varied among the different <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes, and within the various homes. At two of the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> homes the girls consumed a more adequate diet compared to the reference group, whereas three homes consumed a less adequate diet compared to the reference group.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to examine how {{children}} with high and intermediate imperforate anus and their parents {{have been affected by}} the malformation. Materials: For Paper I three patients with high imperforate anus and their families were interviewed. The patients were born before 1987 and {{at the time of the}} interview they were 12, 14, and 22 years old. Papers II-V are based on the same study sample. Twenty-five children with high or intermediate imperforate anus born 1987 - 1992 and their parents participated in the index group. Two groups of children similar in age and gender distributions, along with their parents, served as controls. Methods: In Paper I an exploratory study was performed with interviews. An interview guide that consisted of open-ended and structured questions was used. The sessions covered many different aspects of the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> malformation, as well as treatment and psychosocial consequences of the defect. In Papers II-V individual questionnaires were used for the children and the parents. The questionnaires were developed on the basis of the previous interview study and covered psychosocial domains and physical domains. An additional questionnaire was used consisting of items about the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> experiences of the medical treatment in early age. To look for emotional or behavioral problems among children, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used and filled in by the parents, while teachers filled in the Teacher s Report Form (TRF). Results: In the analysis of the interviews four categories related to effects of the malformation emerged; they were physical, emotional, social, and family. The physical and emotional effects of the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> malformation influenced the family s experiences. Children with imperforate anus exhibited an overall positive attitude on the questionnaires; their psychosocial function seemed to be good even though the children had problems with their bowel functions as compared to the control groups. In the CBCL, the children with imperforate anus were assessed by their parents to have significantly more emotional/behavioral problems than were assessed by parents of the children in control groups. In the TRF, the teachers reported few symptoms for the index group children. Parents reported about extensive care of the child, saying that they had been very much involved in the follow-up treatment. The parents of children with imperforate anus were less satisfied with information received, compared with the parents in the two control groups. There was a gender difference on how responsibility for the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> care was divided between the mother and the father. The children had non-verbal memories of medical treatment early in life, according to their parents reports. Conclusions: Parents of children with imperforate anus had experienced suffering and many difficulties associated with the malformation. Children with imperforate anus in this study did not seem to have any psychosocial impairments, though their parents stated that they experienced leakage, constipation, and fecal odor. The children might have some psychosocial difficulties, according to parents, but not according to their teachers. Parents of children with imperforate anus experienced less satisfaction with medical care and reported that the support received had been insufficient. The mothers of children with imperforate anus seemed to be the main caregivers. Talking to your child about medical treatment at an early age seems to relate positively to the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> psychosocial function. The conclusions of this thesis may lead to an improved understanding of the care for the children with imperforate anus and their parents...|$|E

The parent s questionnaire consisted of 59 items covering various domains such as the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> hospital care, questions about psychosocial issues concerning both the child and the parent and finally the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> physical functioning associated with the malformation. Child Behavior Checklist was filled in by the parents. Teachers Report Form was filled in by the children s teachers. Results: In the analysis of the interviews four categories related to effects of the malformation emerged: physical, emotional, social, and family. The physical and emotional effects of the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> malformation influenced the family s experiences. Children with imperforate anus exhibited an overall positive attitude. They reported that they enjoyed school, had good relationships with schoolmates, had several friends, and participated in leisure activities. Constipation occurred more frequently than in control groups. Answers from parents of children with imperforate anus indicated lower values on variables concerning care, information, and involvement in the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> healthcare treatment, compared with the two control groups. No significant differences on these issues were found between the answers of the mothers and fathers of children with imperforate anus. In the CBCL, the children in the index group were assessed to have significantly more emotional/behavioral problems than the children in control groups. In the TRF, the teachers reported few symptoms for the index group children. Conclusions: Parents of children with imperforate anus had experienced suffering and many difficulties associated with the malformation. Children with imperforate anus in this study did not seem to have any psychosocial impairment, though their parents stated that they experienced leakage, constipation, and fecal odor. The children might have some psychosocial difficulties according to parents but not according to their teachers. Parents of children with imperforate anus experienced less satisfaction with medical care and the support received had been insufficient. An open communication and an interaction between healthcare professionals are important. Psychosocial support for children with imperforate anus and their parents has been limited in our clinic earlier, and a liaison between the pediatric surgery unit and the child and adolescent psychiatry unit would be desirable...|$|E

A Labovian analysis of the evaluative function of narrative is supplemented with ethnographic research and Bakhtin and Volosinov s work, to demonstrate more dynamic and complex processes in <b>children</b> <b>s</b> talk.

The <b>children</b> <b>s</b> reproduction and framing of other people s and their own voices enables them to explore the different perspectives of characters within the story, and also to comment on and evaluate these perspectives. The stories are orientated towards listeners and previous conversational turns, and they also set up intertextual connections with other stories and other conversations, to create additional connotations and layers of meaning. <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> narratives revisit particular themes and preoccupations, for example toughness and gentleness, their emerging new gendered identities and relationships, and their changing relations with parents and other authority figures.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD thesis explored the experiences of dependent children and children care-givers facing challenges with their parent s cancer. The aim was to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> information experience including their perception of cancer and information culture; information needs, information seeking behaviour, barriers and enablers. The research used a six-stage process. This was informed by an extensive literature review and discussions with cancer specialists, psychologists and researchers from United Kingdom, United States, Australia and Malaysia. This study used a three-cycle, eight-step process of Participative Action Research (PAR) with participation from ten Malay breast cancer patients and their dependent children. Three bilingual (English and Bahasa Malaysia) instruments were developed; 1) An Inquiry to Participate Form to select participants who had dependent children, 2) Three opened-ended questions to obtain <b>children</b> <b>s</b> cancer experience and information needs where drawing was used to encourage <b>children</b> <b>s</b> responses and, 3) A 15 -question questionnaire to understand <b>children</b> <b>s</b> experience and information preference. Cancer affected parenting abilities and challenging experiences identified the lack of culturally relevant information and the shift in caregiving responsibilities to dependent <b>children.</b> <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> understanding of cancer was influenced by their experiences and observations, many of which resulted in misconceptions about cancer, its causes, treatment and preventative measures. <b>Children</b> participant <b>s</b> reaction to a health situation triggered their information behaviour. The burden of caregiving {{and the consequences of}} a lack of information were greater than anticipated; children had many dimensions of concern and experienced many challenges. This advocated for a more assessable, attractive and sensitive information system.

The Family Safety/Applied Behavior Analysis Initiative at the University of South Florida is part of a statewide project designed to serve foster parents and the children in the foster care system, has developed a training program entitled. Parenting Tools for Positive Behavior Change [...] To date, the effectiveness of the parenting course has been evaluated in two ways. First, parents have been tested in role-play situations before and after training, and have shown improvements in their use of positive parenting skills. Second, frequency of foster home placement disruptions has been evaluated. The Preliminary results suggest that the parenting course was successful in decreasing the costs associated with placement disruptions, as well as reducing the number decreasing the costs associated with placement disruptions, as well as reducing the number of restrictive placements. Despite the promising results thus far, research has not been conducted to determine whether the parenting course reduces coercion in interactions between parents and children.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Norway between the period of August and December 2012. The study is focused on {{communication}} between children with cochlear implants (CI) and their hearing parents. Parents of deaf children encounter a unique challenge to family unity. Since most of these parents are themselves hearing, they experience a feeling of being different from their child (Adams, 1997). As a result, most of these parents {{do not know how to}} communicate with them. With the advancement of cochlear implant technology, and earlier identification of deafness in children, the potential for intervention has changed a lot. However, it is important to understand that simply providing CI does not mean that a child will start to understand spoken language. There is an important distinction between the ability to hear sounds, and the understanding of speech. In bridging this distinction, parents have to help their child a lot, because they are the main people who can help them in language development. Parents need to learn how to develop their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> communication skills through meaningful everyday interactions with them. Qualitative research was chosen as an approach in this study. Using a qualitative research and case study design, this thesis describes the communication process between hearing parents and their cochlear implanted children. The study sheds light on how parents help their children to develop communication skills. Data was collected by means of observation, note taking, and interview. The data is mostly based on observations of the parent –child interaction. This thesis is organized into 5 chapters. I discussed in Chapter 1 the difficulties that parents face when learning that their child has a hearing disorder. They must make early decisions for treatment, and need to find the time to learn methods to communicate with their child. They must also manage their expectations, and learn the important distinction between hearing sound and understanding language. In the second chapter, I presented a literature review that covered useful and relevant research to my research problem. I described different types of hearing loss, and potential treatments. The three children I studied as a part of this thesis were all prelingually deaf, which means that they lost their hearing before they had learned to speak or understand a language. In chapter II, I also drew on theories from researchers such as Vygotsky, who suggests that early development and learning best takes place within the context of the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> cultural group, usually the family. Vygotsky places an emphasis on the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> interaction with others, and parent s role in facilitating language and communication development in the child. This theory forms the basis for the hypothesis that a <b>child</b> <b>s</b> success with cochlear implants heavily depends on their parent s efforts in helping them. Bruner similarly agrees with Vygotsky that a child learns language in interaction with adults, and parents should play an active role in assisting a <b>child</b> <b>s</b> learning. They both emphasise the social nature of learning, citing that parents should help children develop their language abilities through the process of scaffolding. I explain in Chapter 3 my research methods, explaining that the qualitative research method is most suited to this type of study. A qualitative research method enabled observation and interviews, whereby I could ascertain from the parents the methods they use to communicate with their cochlear implanted children, as well as their <b>child</b> <b>s</b> medical history and the parent s feelings and opinions on certain methods, and their reasons for choosing them. My sample was small due to the relatively rare nature of CI, and the difficulties in contacting potential recipients. I also had strict criterion that needed to be met. I followed every procedure in ensuring the recipient s confidentiality and informing them that they could withdraw at any time, and arranged interviews with the parents to gather relevant background information and to arrange a time and place for observations. This was extremely useful as these observations have formed the backbone of my thesis, and I managed to observe the parents in different situations and utilising different methods of communication and encouragement. Ethical considerations were also accommodated, and all the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> names were changed to protect confidentiality. In the fourth chapter, an actual analysis of my results was outlined, including several example conversations between the parents and their child, describing the communication strategies the family were using and its subsequent impacts. I provided a brief history and description of the three children, including their age of diagnosis and the age they had CI implanted. The conclusion is in chapter 5. My findings support the theories of Vygotsky and Bruner, as well as past research by Hart & Riley s, Spencer & Lederbergs and Warren & Walkers. Parents who listen to their child, follow their lead, actively engage and use positive feedback can have excellent communication with their children...|$|E

Analysis of indenture terms indicates that relationships between end payments (freedom dues) and education and training clauses varied by region. In Boston, education and training clauses were associated negatively with freedom-dues clauses, but in Rhode Island and Charleston the relationship was positive. Variation in freedom dues to suit the needs of the master or overseer of the poor, without reference to the worker-child s own interests, resulted from the <b>child</b> <b>s</b> lack of advocacy during contract formation. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how I {{improved}} my portfolios assessment {{practices by}} making <b>children</b> <b>s</b> portfolios freely available to children, {{their parents and}} whānau in the early childhood care and education centre where I worked. As the teacher researcher I present an insider perspective, my world view on how I improved my pedagogical practices {{in order to gain}} a deeper understanding of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning, and my role in supporting <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning. This study has two components, a) the writer as the teacher researcher and, b) accessibility of <b>children</b> <b>s</b> portfolios and the involvement of children in the portfolio process. This study uses a qualitative research design, a mixed methodology of self-study action research and case study. Three theories, ecological, sociocultural, and Donald Schön s (1983) theory of learning and practice have informed and guided this research. This eclectic mix of theoretical frameworks provided me with some valuable insights on ways of examining and using portfolios with children, and understanding <b>children</b> <b>s</b> views on their portfolios. The findings in this study are particular to the centre where I worked and they may not be generalisable to other early childhood care and education centres. Nonetheless, my experiences highlight the potential importance of the process and issues that arise from making portfolios accessible. The findings revealed that my experiences of engaging in self-study action research promoted within the centre a community of learners, and an enquiry approach to teaching and learning. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} making portfolios freely available provides children with an understanding of the purpose, contents and ownership of their portfolios. When children frequently use and share their portfolios with peers and teachers it can promote critical self-reflection and self-assessment of their learning. Involving children in the portfolio process makes visible to children the value of their contributions to their learning. Overall, this study has significantly improved my pedagogical practices. It has enhanced teachers learning which has in turn, benefited the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> learning. Beyond that, making the portfolios accessible has strengthened parental understanding of their <b>children</b> <b>s</b> experiences at the centre...|$|R
