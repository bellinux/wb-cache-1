60|$|May 21.--Early {{this morning}} we {{proceeded}} upwards, our prospect more gloomy than ever. The path, which still lay up steep ridges, was very slippery, owing to the rain upon the clayey soil, and was only passable from the hold afforded by interlacing roots of trees. At 8000 feet, some enormous detached masses of micaceous gneiss rose abruptly from the ridge, they were covered with mosses and ferns, and from their summit, 7000 feet, {{a good view of}} the surrounding vegetation is obtained. The mast of the forest is formed of:-- (1) Three species of oak, of which Q. annulata ? with immense lamellated acorns, and leaves sixteen inches long, is the tallest and the most abundant.--(2) Chesnut.--(3) Laurineae of several species, all beautiful forest-trees, straight-holed, and umbrageous above.--(4) Magnolias.* [Other trees were Pyrus, Saurauja (both an erect and climbing species), Olea, <b>cherry,</b> <b>birch,</b> alder, several maples, Hydrangea, one species of fig, holly, and several Araliaceous trees. Many species of Magnoliaceae (including the genera Magnolia, Michelia, and Talauma) are found in Sikkim: Magnolia Campbellii, of 10,000 feet, is the most superb species known. In books on botanical geography, the magnolias are considered as most abounding in North America, east of the Rocky Mountains; but this is a great mistake, the Indian mountains and islands being the centre of this natural order.]--(5) Arborescent rhododendrons, which commence here with the R. arboreum. At 8000 and 9000 feet, a considerable change is found in the vegetation; the gigantic purple Magnolia Campbellii replacing the white; chesnut disappears, and several laurels: other kinds of maple are seen, with Rhododendron argenteum, and Stauntonia, a handsome climber, which has beautiful pendent clusters of lilac blossoms.|$|E

50|$|To {{properly}} bend a {{sheet of}} wood, {{there are a few}} techniques that will help. The hardness of the wood will determine how long is required to soak the wood in water. The harder the wood, the more time is needed to fully soak the wood, making it easier to bend and preventing the wood from springing back to its original form. Popular hardwoods are oak, maple, <b>cherry,</b> <b>birch,</b> walnut, ash and poplar. Common softwoods are pine, fir, spruce, hemlock, cedar and redwood.|$|E
