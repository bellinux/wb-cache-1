Due to their relatively simple structure Gaussian channels [1] provide an ideal theoretical playground {{for the study of}} quantum communication protocols [2]. Bounds and, in some cases, explicit values for the classical [3] or quantum [4] capacities of these channels have been extensively discussed in literature (e. g. see Refs. [1, 5, 6, 7]). Recently weak-degradability was proposed as an useful tool for studying the quantum capacity properties of one-mode Gaussian channels [8]. This suggested the possibility of classifying all one-mode Gaussian channels in terms of a simple canonical form (see Ref. [9]). Moreover, proceeding along similar lines, the exact solution of the quantum capacity of an important subset of those maps was obtained in Ref. [10].

40|$|In nature, {{one finds}} large {{collections}} of different protein sequences exhibiting {{roughly the same}} three-dimensional structure, and this observation underpins the study of structural protein families. In studying such families at a global level, a natural question to ask is how close to “optimal ” the native sequences are {{in terms of their}} energy. We therefore define and compute the evolutionary capacity of a protein structure as the total number of sequences whose energy in the structure is below that of the native sequence. An important aspect of our definition is that we consider the space of all possible protein sequences, i. e. the exponentially large set of all strings over the 20 -letter amino acid alphabet, rather than just the set of sequences found in nature. In order to make our approach computationally feasible, we develop randomized algorithms that perform approximate enumeration in sequence space with provable performance guarantees. We draw on the area of rapidly mixing Markov chains, by exhibiting a connection between the evolutionary capacity of proteins and the number of feasible solutions to the Knapsack problem. This connection allows us to design an algorithm for approximating the evolutionary <b>capacity,</b> <b>extending</b> a recent result of Morris and Sinclair on the Knapsack problem.

40|$|Sodium batteries, {{as well as}} lithium batteries, {{were widely}} studied from the late 1970 s and {{throughout}} the 1980 s. [1] However, interest in sodium batteries rapidly vanished, owing to the superior properties of the lithium technology. But, the large diffusion of lithium batteries in the electronic consumer market contributed to a rapid rise {{in the price of}} lithium. Owing to the large availability of sodium and its low cost, ambient temperature Na-based batteries have the potential to meet large-scale grid-energy-storage requirements. [2]. Sodium has an ionic radius larger than lithium (1. 06 Å vs 0. 76 Å, respectively), preferring 6 -fold coordination in octahedral or prismatic sites. This results in the confinement of the Na-based cathode structures into two big classes, i. e. poly-anionic networks[3] and layered compounds. The synthesis of a new layered cathode material, Na 0. 5 [Ni 0. 23 Fe 0. 13 Mn 0. 63]O 2, and its characterization in terms of crystalline structure and electrochemical performance in a sodium cell, is reported.

These studies can also be classified into two fold: (i) buffer capacity determination problem, and (ii) FA entrance sequence determination problem. Inman (2003) determines buffer capacity of an ASRS type buffer to restore the altered sequence for a specified service level defined by car manufacturers. Meissner (2010) also studies buffer capacity determination problem for restoring the altered sequence for mix-bank type buffer and also compares the resequencing performances of both ASRS and mix-bank buffer by measuring the similarity between FA entrance sequence and scheduled sequence. Gusikhin et al. (2008) find optimal FA entrance sequence that minimizes the violation from FA station capacities for ASRS type buffer. Boysen et al.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} process of {{adaptation to the}} aquatic environment has dramatically modified the anatomy and physiology of secondarily-aquatic, air-breathing seabirds and marine mammals to address oxygen constraints and unique sensorimotor conditions. As taxa that have arguably undergone significant evolutionary transformations, deep-diving sphenisciforms (penguins) and obligatorily aquatic cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) provide an excellent opportunity to study such physiological and anatomical adaptation. Investigation of heart rates of free-ranging emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) equipped with digital electrocardiogram recorders and time depth recorders revealed a phenomenal dive <b>capacity</b> <b>extending</b> to 431 m as well as extreme bradycardia, reaching heart rates as low as 10 beats min- 1 during deep dives to promote oxygen conservation. The organization and potential function of the cetacean brain were examined with structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging of post-mortem killer whale (Orcinus orca) and bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) brains. Structural images were acquired for an O. orca brain in situ and underwent manual segmentation to obtain volumetric measurements of neuroanatomy including gray and white matter, constituent neural regions (i. e., cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum), and subcortical and midbrain structures. This O. orca {{had one of the}} largest forebrains studied to date with cerebral volume comprising 81. 51 % of the total brain volume. Moreover, the cerebral white matter of O. orca and other delphinoids exhibited isometric scaling unlike other mammals suggesting that this divergent morphology may have evolved in response to the sensorimotor demands of the aquatic environment. Examination of T. truncatus cerebral white matter with diffusion tractography revealed widespread structural asymmetries potentially attributable to brain enlargement and isometrically-scaled white matter. Moreover, these structural asymmetries may underpin previously reported observations of functional and behavioral lateralization in cetaceans. These studies of cetacean anatomy and sphenisciform physiology provide insight into and promote our understanding of the evolution of arguably the most ocean-adapted seabirds and marine mammals...|$|E
40|$|The {{grain size}} {{distribution}} of settled sediment within storage reservoir Otmuchów. The river Nysa Kłodzka is flowing through the flat-reduction Otmuchów. There are localized two storage reservoirs Otmuchów and Nysa. The first of these reservoirs have been constructed in the period 1928 - 1933 and the filling was completed in 1934. Reservoir Nysa was completed in 1971. Both reservoirs are located {{within walking distance of}} each other, creating since 1971 cascade. Reservoir Otmuchów is located above the Nysa reservoir what cause, that in the bowl of the Otmuchów reservoir, the significant part of transported by Nysa Kłodzka sediments is deposited. When established after the 1997 flood damming levels, summer and winter, the length of the reservoir Otmuchów is suitably from 4. 5 to 5 km. At the maximum impoundment level and a maximal capacity of 130. 45 million m 3 the reservoir length reach approx. 7 km.

40|$|Cooperative {{in general}} and MPFCs in {{particular}} is used as key pillar in the rural development strategy of Ethiopia to address the existing malfunctioning agricultural marketing system. This research is conducted on role of MPFCs in the supply chain of Wheat in Gedeb-Hasasa Woreda, Ethiopia. The main objectives were to identify financial performance, role of MPFCs in marketing farmers output, to investigate and describe wheat marketing channel, role of cooperative in farm inputs supply, members participation and perception to the cooperative service and determinant of MPFCs involvement in marketing farmers output and factors that motivates farmers to supply their wheat to the cooperatives. To accomplish this study both primary and secondary sources that combine qualitative and quantitative data were used. Moreover, two-stage random sampling was employed to select 5 MPFCs and 160 sample on basis of statistical random sampling technique of probability proportional to size. Structured interview schedule was used to collect primary data from famer members. Moreover, semi structured interview for sample traders and focus group discussion was held with committee members and organizer. Data analysis was carried out using financial ratio analysis, descriptive statistics and econometric model. Descriptive statistics like frequency, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values had been used. Furthermore, financial analysis was done using 2 years audit report to assess the financial performance of the 5 MPFCs. Besides, econometrics model called a multiple linear regression employed using STATA software version 10 to investigate factors that influence farmers to supply their wheat to the cooperatives. As financial ratio analysis shows, cooperatives under investigation were not at better financial position to undertake the output marketing and in diversifying their services to satisfy farmers demand for services. MPFCs under investigation using current ratio all except Abdi Boru were below satisfactory level {{on the basis of}} the 2009 / 10 audit report. While in the year 2010 / 11 cooperatives current ratio was showed slight improvement. Surplus ratio of the MPFCs has been insignificant based on the two years audit report under investigation. Further, leverage ratio analysis shows that cooperatives under investigation for the last two years more than 65 % of their assets were financed by outsiders rather than cooperatives own worth. As the result of descriptive analysis shows, most (47. 5 %) of the farmers did not use cooperatives as their farm outlet. Besides, MPFCs role in the study area in purchasing the members wheat rated as poor by majority (71. 25 %) of sample farmers and 47. 5 % and 31. 88 % sample farmers sold their wheat to wholesalers and local market respectively. Moreover, of the total sample, 31. 25 % of them rented-out their land to outsiders. Accordingly, of the 13 explanatory variables access to credit, yield of wheat and educational level found to exert direct and significant impact on farmers supply of wheat while, price offered and proximity to district market were found to have negative significant influence on farmers supply of wheat to the cooperatives. Improving financial <b>capacity,</b> <b>extending</b> credit and tractor service, training and education, delivery time of farm inputs, members’ participation and saving habits of farmers, purchasing role of cooperatives, avoiding interferences, and minimizing bilateral role of traders were some of the interference areas that need to be considered by concerned stakeholders to improve the role and function of MPFCs in marketing out puts of farmers in the supply chain...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} {{methodology}} to evaluate the engineering and economic implications of maximizing performance of the United States' commercial fleet of nuclear power plants. This methodology addresses aggressive power uprates and life extensions afforded by advances {{in the state of the}} art of nuclear technology. America's commercial nuclear power plants were initially licensed for 40 years. A successful license renewal program is being executed to extend operational lifetimes to 60 years, which has supported the installation of more than 7000 MWe of generating capacity via power uprates. Yet improvements in instrumentation, analytical methods, operational strategies, materials, components, systems, and fuels enable plant operators to consider simultaneously extending plant lifetimes to 80 years, and further increasing plant generating <b>capacity.</b> <b>Extending</b> plant lifetimes requires certain plant structures, systems, and components (SSC) to be refurbished or replaced. Performing these changes with other plant upgrades required to provide a 25 % or more power increase - a mega-uprate - can lead to improved returns and savings for investors, rate payers, and operators over the remainder of the plant's lifetime provided confidence in the plant's ability to operate through the remainder of the extended life can be demonstrated. A methodology was developed in this thesis to enable the analysis of the tradeoffs and implications of performing life extensions and mega-uprates together using probabilistic methods to address the uncertainties associated with these large-scale projects. This methodology evaluates the integrated design and capital asset management strategies for nuclear power plants to support decision-making to aggressively uprate and upgrade plants considering multivariate criteria, uncertainties, and multiple time-dependent options. Such a capability has significant value for evaluating future refurbishment and uprate options. This thesis resolves several outstanding design and analysis issues surrounding large-scale projects such as large power uprates, refurbishment, modernization, and subsequent license renewal by: (1) proposing an improved statistical treatment of life-limiting component uncertainties; (2) evaluating plant-wide design approaches to realize power uprates greater than 20 %; (3) improving the treatment of cost uncertainties, particularly those that arise from technology risk; (4) implementing an integrated decision framework that quantifies and propagates uncertainties; and (5) enhancing the method's accuracy and applicability by incorporating material improvements in the state of knowledge of the conditions that affect the plant's performance. The methodology was implemented via a suite of computer codes referred to as the Integrated Plant Lifetime and Uprate Model - IPLUM - which was used to aid with these analyses. Results of this thesis suggest that most nuclear power plants are capable of operating up to 80 years without replacing or refurbishing major life-limiting structures provided no major construction defects are introduced. Most PWRs can achieve 25 %- 40 % uprates without introducing unfeasible design modifications. This thesis suggests that a four-loop Westinghouse plant can realize a 25 % power uprate for a mean cost of about $ 1100 /kWe installed. Additionally, new fuel technologies such as accident-tolerant cladding and higher density fuels may reduce the capital costs of these projects by increasing safety margins which reduces the need upgrade or replace plant systems. Combined life extension and mega-uprates may enable plant operators to install more than 20 GWe of nuclear capacity for less than the cost of building equivalent capacity in the form of new large reactors or small modular reactors. Mega-uprates also enable the expansion of carbon-free energy production with potentially superior economics to fossil fuel plants, while also enabling more flexible operational strategies such as load following. Additionally, the risk metrics of adding capacity via life extension and mega-uprates are reduced by upgrading existing plants instead of building new plants. Ultimately, the methods developed and used in this thesis highlight the sensitivities of a combined power uprate and life extension to: 1) plant degradation models and data; 2) technological readiness of high-performance plant components and systems; 3) experience with large power uprates; 4) cost uncertainties due to market conditions and technology risk; and 5) future energy prices. Perturbations in any of these areas may introduce enough downside risk to negate the decision to implement these design options. Therefore it is essential that plant operators use confirmed plant condition information and identify contingencies specific to their plant, plans, and projects. Furthermore, a principal result of this work is enhanced quantification and characterization of the uncertainties associated with power uprates. The unique features of the net present value and return on investment probability distributions produced by these analyses provide improved insights into the risks and rewards of large power uprates, which will allow plant owners to better understand and manage these risks. by Jacob Dominic DeWitte.
