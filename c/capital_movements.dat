5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of <b>capital</b> <b>movements.</b> The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E

We find that financial imperfection causes firm heterogeneity and that trade and <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> are complements in the sense that trade in goods affects the productivity distribu- tion only when accompanied by international <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> (trade induces <b>capital</b> outflow from South when capital has been internationally mobile).

40|$|This paper {{views the}} modern world economy to be {{constructed}} with democratic countries that implement trade policies as an income distribution policy, World Trade Organization that intends to improve world welfare by prohibiting export subsidies but allowing import and export tariffs, and international <b>capital</b> <b>movement.</b> Based on this view, it explores {{the effects of these}} WTO rules on the volume of international trade in goods, the direction and volume of international <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> and world welfare in a two-country, two-good, two-factor model with capital specific to the production of one good and internationally different production technologies. It shows that if the export subsidies and import tariffs prevail as the Nash equilibrium trade-policy measures in the era before the WTO is established, the enforcement of those WTO rules reduces the volume of trade in goods, expands international <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> the direction of which is the same as international trade in the capital-intensive good but shrinks international <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> the direction of which is opposite to it, and the expansion in international <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> cannot necessarily compensate the loss of world welfare caused by the reduction in international trade in goods and the failure in achieving the Pareto optimu...|$|R

This complementarity disappears if financial institution is perfect or almost perfect; trade in goods and <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> are substitutes as traditional literature shows in such cases.

50|$|<b>Capital</b> <b>movements</b> {{offset the}} {{surpluses}} or deficits {{in the current}} account. A current account surplus, for example, implies that rather than using all the foreign currency earned by selling exports to buy imports, corporations and individuals choose to invest the money in foreign-currency-denominated assets instead. As measured in Japan's balance of payments data, <b>capital</b> <b>movements</b> consist of long- and short-term investments and movements in official foreign exchange reserves and private bank accounts. <b>Capital</b> <b>movements</b> include loans, portfolio investments in corporate stock, and direct investment (establishment or purchase of subsidiaries abroad). A capital outflow occurs when a Japanese individual or corporation makes a loan, buys foreign stock, or establishes a subsidiary abroad. A capital inflow occurs when foreigners engage in these operations in Japan.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{international}} trade in goods and <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> on the productivity distribution and industry-wide productivity when countries are heterogeneous {{in the quality of}} their financial institutions. In autarky, firm heterogeneity in their productivities arises in countries with poor financial institutions, while all firms adopt a high-productivity technology in countries with better financial institutions. Trade in goods will not change the productivity distribution (nor the industry-wide productivity as a result) in any country, although it lowers equilibrium interest rates in countries with poor financial institutions while it raises them in countries with better financial institutions. Allowing international <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> in addition to the trade, however, makes a large impact on the industry. Capital flight from countries with poor financial institutions occurs, which may lead to global convergence in which all firms in the world adopt the high-productivity technology under a relatively high interest rate. But if the worldwide average of quality of financial institution is low, international <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> will reduce worldwide production efficiency such that low-productivity firms re-emerge even in northern countries as well as in southern countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{established}} Helpman (1993) model by introducing international <b>capital</b> <b>movement,</b> and obtains new results concerning the welfare implications of tightening {{intellectual property rights}} (IPR) in the South. First, if separated capital markets in the North and the South are integrated, enforcement of IPR would have more desirable welfare effects in both regions. Second, when international <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> is allowed, the North always gains from the tightening of IPR if the imitation rate is sufficiently high. This implies that the North's demand on the South to tighten IPR becomes stronger as the integration of international capital markets progresses. Copyright � 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

30|$|The LOE {{macroeconomic}} policy framework {{is in line}} with the theory of trilemma, or the impossible trinity, which is a classic conclusion of the open macroeconomics (Mundell 1963; Fleming 1962). According to this theory, a fixed foreign exchange rate, free <b>capital</b> <b>movement,</b> and an independent monetary policy cannot coexist simultaneously; thus, the policymakers must choose two objectives among the three. A country with open capital account and fixed exchange rate will lose the independence of its domestic monetary policy. A country with fixed exchange rate and the indent on independent monetary policy must control the capital account. A country with free <b>capital</b> <b>movement</b> and independent monetary policy must allow float exchange rate.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{perception}} {{by the public}} {{may be that the}} [...] "central bank" [...] controls some or all interest rates and currency rates, economic theory (and substantial empirical evidence) shows {{that it is impossible to}} do both at once in an open economy. Robert Mundell's [...] "impossible trinity" [...] is the most famous formulation of these limited powers, and postulates that it is impossible to target monetary policy (broadly, interest rates), the exchange rate (through a fixed rate) and maintain free <b>capital</b> <b>movement.</b> Since most Western economies are now considered [...] "open" [...] with free <b>capital</b> <b>movement,</b> this essentially means that central banks may target interest rates or exchange rates with credibility, but not both at once.|$|R
50|$|At that time, European Union {{countries}} maintained some {{restrictions on}} trade and (especially) on <b>capital</b> <b>movements.</b> These were gradually eliminated through the Single Market programme and the liberalization of <b>capital</b> <b>movements,</b> {{so that by the}} late 1980s one of the two remaining objectives had to go to for consistency to be maintained. He proposed that the third objective (independent monetary policies) be abandoned, by creating a single currency and a single European central bank, so that the other three objectives could be attained. The Delors Report of April 1989 endorsed this view and recommended a European Monetary Union (EMU) with a single currency.
