50|$|A {{hardware}} security module (HSM) is {{a physical}} computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides <b>cryptoprocessing.</b> These modules traditionally {{come in the form}} of a plug-in card or an external device that attaches directly to a computer or network server.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend of data {{breaches}}, which this report looks into. The breaches often turn out to have, at their core, an element of either poor security management, or outdated or incorrectly applied security procedures. With this in mind, an affordable off-the-shelf microcontroller development kit is suggested {{as a way to}} lessen the impact of data theft during data breaches. Utilising an Arduino Due this report looks at the performance available for <b>cryptoprocessing</b> and key storage, showing that while it is not a viable solution for encrypting large amounts of data, it is however suitable for securely encrypting limited data sets, such as customer data...|$|E
