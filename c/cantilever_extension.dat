40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and radiographic changes at implants in posterior maxillary and mandibular areas supporting single-unit crowns (SCs) and fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with one mesial or distal <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension</b> after an observation period {{of at least}} 3 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventeen subjects with 19 implant-supported SCs and 21 subjects with 21 implant-supported FDPs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All FDPs were supported by two implants and had a span of 3 - 4 units. All reconstructions were incorporated in the posterior maxilla or mandible. The mesial and distal radiographic marginal bone loss from baseline (i. e. delivery of the reconstruction) to the follow-up examination was averaged and compared between SCs supporting one <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension</b> with that of implants supporting FDPs adjacent to or distant from the <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension.</b> Changes in mean pocket probing depth (PPD) were calculated and compared between the three groups. RESULTS: The mean observation period was 78. 2 +/- 34. 5 months for SCs supported by one implant and 67. 8 +/- 29. 8 months for FDPs supported by two implants. No implant loss occurred, yielding a 100 % survival rate. At baseline, the mean radiographic bone levels +/- SD were 2. 6 +/- 0. 3 mm for implants supporting SCs, 2. 6 +/- 0. 3 mm for implants of FDPs adjacent to the <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension,</b> and 2. 4 +/- 0. 5 mm for implants of FDPs distant from the <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension.</b> At follow-up, the corresponding mean bone levels +/- SD were 2. 7 +/- 0. 4, 2. 7 +/- 0. 5, and 2. 8 +/- 0. 5 mm, respectively. No statistically significant differences (P > 0. 05) were observed comparing the mean marginal bone loss between the three groups. Moreover, mean changes in PPD between baseline and follow-up were not statistically significantly different (P > 0. 05) between the three groups. CONCLUSION: The presence of one mesial or distal <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension</b> in the posterior maxilla or mandible does not jeopardize the marginal bone levels of implants supporting SCs or short-span FDPs after a mean observation period of at least 5 years. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Implant-supported fixed partial denture with <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension</b> can {{transfer}} the excessive load {{to the bone}} around implants and stress/strain concentration potentially leading to bone resorption. This study investigated the effects of implant configurations supporting three-unit fixed partial denture (FPD) on the stress and strain distribution in the peri-implant bone by combining clinically measured time-dependent loading data and finite element (FE) analysis. A 3 -dimensional mandibular model was constructed based on computed tomography (CT) images. Four different configurations of implants supporting 3 -unit FPDs, namely three implant-supported FPD, conventional three-unit bridge FPD, distal cantilever FPD and mesial cantilever FPD, were modelled. The FPDs were virtually inserted to the molar area in the mandibular FE models. The FPDs were loaded according to time-dependent in vivo-measured 3 -dimensional loading data during chewing. The von Mises stress (VMS) and equivalent strain (EQS) in peri-implant bone regions were evaluated as mechanical stimuli. During the chewing cycles, the regions near implant necks and bottom apexes experienced high VMS and EQS than the middle regions in all implant-supported FPD configurations. Higher VMS and EQS values were also observed at the implant neck region adjacent to the <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension</b> in the cantilevered configurations. The patient-specific dynamic loading data and CT-based reconstruction of full 3 D mandibular allowed us to model the biomechanical responses more realistically. The results provided data for clinical assessment of implant configuration to improve longevity and reliability of the implant-supported FPD restoration...|$|E

40|$|Background/purpose: The {{design and}} {{materials}} of a prosthesis affect the loading of dental implants and deformation of the bone. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effects of prosthesis design and materials on the stress distribution of implant-supported prostheses. Materials and methods: A 3 -dimensional finite element analysis method was selected to evaluate the stress distribution in the bone. Three different models were designed as follows: a 3 -unit implant-supported fixed partial denture (FPD) composed of a metal framework and porcelain veneer with (M 2) or without a <b>cantilevered</b> <b>extension</b> (M 1) and an FPD composed of a fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) framework and a particulate composite veneer without a <b>cantilevered</b> <b>extension</b> (M 3). In separate load cases, 300 -N vertical, 150 -N oblique, and 60 -N horizontal forces were applied to the prostheses in the models. von Mises stress values in the cortical and cancellous bone were calculated. Results: In cortical bone, the highest von Mises stresses were noted in the M 2 Model with a vertical load; whereas, higher stresses were observed in the M 1 Model with horizontal and oblique loads. The lowest stress values were determined in the M 3 Model for all loading conditions. In cancellous bone, decreased stress values were found with all 3 models under the applied loads. Conclusions: Prosthesis design and materials affect the load-transmission mechanism. Although additional experimental and clinical studies are needed, FRC FPDs can be considered a suitable alternative treatment choice for implant-supported prostheses.

40|$|In {{long-term}} oral rehabilitation treatments, {{resistance of}} provisional crowns {{is a very}} important factor, especially in cases of an extensive edentulous distal space. The aim of this laboratorial study was to evaluate an acrylic resin cantilever-type prosthesis regarding the flexural strength of its in-balance portion as a function of its extension variation and reinforcement by two types of fibers (glass and polyaramid), considering that literature is not conclusive on this subject. Each specimen was composed by 3 total crowns at its mesial portion, each one attached to an implant component (abutment), while the distal portion (cantilever) had two crowns. Each specimen was constructed by injecting acrylic resin into a two-part silicone matrix placed on a metallic base. In each specimen, the crowns were fabricated with either acrylic resin (control group) or acrylic resin reinforced by glass (Fibrante, Angelus) or polyaramide (Kevlar 49, Du Pont) fibers. Compression load was applied on the cantilever, in a point located 7, 14 or 21 mm from the distal surface of the nearest crown with abutment, to simulate different extensions. The specimen was fixed on the metallic base and the force was applied until fracture in a universal test machine. Each one of the 9 sub-groups was composed by 10 specimens. Flexural strength means (in kgf) for the distances of 7, 14 and 21 mm were, respectively, 28. 07, 8. 27 and 6. 39 for control group, 31. 89, 9. 18 and 5. 16 for Kevlar 49 and 30. 90, 9. 31 and 6. 86 for Fibrante.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{systematically}} appraise {{the impact}} of mechanical/technical risk factors on implant-supported reconstructions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A MEDLINE (PubMed) database search from 1966 to April 2008 was conducted. The search strategy {{was a combination of}} MeSH terms and the key words: design, dental implant(s), risk, prosthodontics, fixed prosthodontics, fixed partial denture(s), fixed dental prosthesis (FDP), fixed reconstruction(s), oral rehabilitation, bridge(s), removable partial denture(s), overdenture(s). Randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective cohort studies with a mean follow-up of at least 4 years were included. The material evaluated in each study had to include cases with/without exposure to the risk factor. RESULTS: From 3, 568 articles, 111 were selected for full text analysis. Of the 111 articles, 33 were included for data extraction after grouping the outcomes into 10 risk factors: type of retentive elements supporting overdentures, presence of <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension(s),</b> cemented versus screw-retained FDPs, angled/angulated abutments, bruxism, crown/implant ratio, length of the suprastructure, prosthetic materials, number of implants supporting an FDP, and history of mechanical/technical complications. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a metal framework in overdentures, the presence of <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension(s)</b> > 15 mm and of bruxism, the length of the reconstruction, and a history of repeated complications were associated with increased mechanical/technical complications.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to analyze the stress {{distribution}} on components of a mandibular-cantilevered implant-supported prosthesis with frameworks cast in cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) or palladium-silver (Pd-Ag) alloys, according to the cantilever length.

Two linear strain gauges were fixed on the mesial and distal aspects of each abutment to capture deformation. A vertical static load of 100 N {{was applied to the}} cantilever arm at the distances of 10, 15, and 20 mm {{from the center of the}} distal abutment and the absolute values of specific deformation were recorded. Different patterns of abutment deformation were observed according to the framework alloy. The Co-Cr alloy framework resulted in higher levels of abutment deformation than the silver-palladium alloy framework. Abutment deformation was higher with longer <b>cantilever</b> <b>extensions.</b> Physical properties of the alloys used for framework interfere with abutment deformations patterns.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze whether or not a <b>cantilever</b> <b>extension</b> on a fixed dental {{prosthesis}} (FDP) supported by implants increased the amount of peri-implant bone loss or technical complications compared with reconstructions without cantilevers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four partially dentate patients with a total of 54 FDPs supported by 78 implants were enrolled in the study. Twenty-seven FDPs were with cantilever and 27 FDPs were without cantilever (control group). All FDPs were supported by one or two implants and were located in the posterior maxilla or mandible. The primary outcome variable was change in peri-implant marginal bone level from the time of FDP placement to the last follow-up visit. FDPs were under functional loading for a period of 3 up to 12. 7 years. Statistical analysis was carried out with Student's t-test. Regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the influence of confounding factors on the peri-implant bone level change. In addition, implant survival rates were calculated and technical complications assessed. RESULTS: After a mean observation period of 5. 3 years, the mean peri-implant bone loss for the FDPs with cantilevers was 0. 23 mm (SD+/- 0. 63 mm) and 0. 09 mm (SD+/- 0. 43 mm) for FDPs without cantilever. Concerning the bone level change at implants supporting FDPs with or without cantilevers no statistically significant differences were found. The regression analysis revealed that jaw of implant placement had a statistically significant influence on peri-implant bone loss. When the bone loss in the cantilever group and the control group were compared within the maxilla or mandible separately, no statistically significant difference was found. Implant survival rates reached 95. 7 % for implants supporting cantilever prostheses and 96. 9 % for implants of the control group. Five FDPs in the cantilever group showed minor technical complications, none were observed in the control group. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study it was concluded that cantilever on FDPs did not lead to a higher implant failure rate and did not lead to more bone loss around supporting implants compared with implants supporting conventional FDPs. In contrast to these results more technical complications were observed in the group reconstructed with cantilever...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to assess the}} survival rates of short-span implant-supported cantilever fixed dental prostheses (ICFDPs) and the incidence of technical and biological complications after an observation period of at least 5 years. Material and methods: An electronic MEDLINE search supplemented by manual searching was conducted to identify prospective or retrospective cohort studies reporting data of at least 5 years on ICFDPs. Five- and 10 -year estimates for failure and complication rates were calculated using standard or random-effect Poisson regression analysis. Results: The five studies eligible for the meta-analysis yielded an estimated 5 - and 10 -year ICFDP cumulative survival rate of 94. 3 % [95 percent confidence interval (95 % CI) : 84. 1 - 98 %] and 88. 9 % (95 % CI: 70. 8 - 96. 1 %), respectively. Five-year estimates for peri-implantitis were 5. 4 % (95 % CI: 2 - 14. 2 %) and 9. 4 % (95 % CI: 3. 3 - 25. 4 %) at implant and prosthesis levels, respectively. Veneer fracture (5 -year estimate: 10. 3 %; 95 % CI: 3. 9 - 26. 6 %) and screw loosening (5 -year estimate: 8. 2 %; 95 % CI: 3. 9 - 17 %) represented the most common complications, followed by loss of retention (5 -year estimate: 5. 7 %; 95 % CI: 1. 9 - 16. 5 %) and abutment/screw fracture (5 -year estimate: 2. 1 %; 95 % CI: 0. 9 - 5. 1 %). Implant fracture was rare (5 -year estimate: 1. 3 %; 95 % CI: 0. 2 - 8. 3 %); no framework fracture was reported. Radiographic bone level changes did not yield statistically significant differences either at the prosthesis or at the implant levels when comparing ICFDPs with short-span implant-supported end-abutment fixed dental prostheses.

The proposed ACP comprises an inclined <b>cantilever</b> and <b>extension,</b> and a tip located at the free end of the extension, which makes the AFM capable of topography at sidewalls of microstructures.

40|$|AbstractThe Romanian {{existing}} building stock of collective dwellings is {{in a vast}} majority composed of reinforced concrete large prefabricated panel blocks of flats, erected during Communism. According to the 1992 Census, these standardized and widespread buildings housed almost 60 percent of the urban population of the country. Due to the small, inflexible apartments {{on one hand and}} the changing living conditions of the contemporary Romanian society on the other, a need for extending the inner surface of the existing flats has been identified. This situation led to the adoption of technically restrictive ground-floor spatial additions and other vernacular solutions that are being applied to upper stories, some of them not being able to provide, in many cases, any forms of long term structural guarantee to their users. The present paper describes a prefabricated steel structure solution for <b>cantilevered</b> apartment <b>extensions</b> that can be independently attached to the façade, as well as some technical connecting details to the {{existing building}}. A global structural analysis performed on a virtual model depicting a widespread type of block of flats (Model 770) proves the non-intrusive influence the <b>cantilevered</b> apartment <b>extensions</b> have over the existing buildings, in multiple different scenarios of attachments. Moreover, a FEM analysis of the proposed details further shows the reliability of the examined solution...|$|R
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The {{benefits}} {{and limitations of}} jaw treatments with tilted versus vertical implants, as well as prosthesis design with and without posterior cantilevers, have been extensively discussed. However, biomechanical advantages associated with cantilevers in fixed dentures (FDs) and tilted implants in the maxillae are less well documented. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare and analyze, via 3 -dimensional (3 -D) finite element analysis, stresses transmitted to tilted versus vertical implants and the surrounding periimplant bone in the maxillae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 3 -D edentulous maxillary model was created using customized computer software (FEMAP 8. 3). Four implants were virtually placed in the premaxilla and splinted with an FD. Keeping the prosthesis length constant, 4 different configurations were evaluated with the distal implants inclined 0, 15, 30, and 45 degrees; <b>cantilever</b> <b>extensions</b> were 13, 9, 5, and 0 mm, respectively. A vertical load (150 N) was applied to the distal portion of the posterior cantilevers. Von Mises' stress values transmitted to periimplant bone and at the metal framework of FDs on implants were evaluated in cancellous and cortical bone. RESULTS: The maximum stresses recorded in periimplant bone for the vertical implants were 75. 0 MPa (distal implants), 35. 0 MPa (mesial implants), and 95. 0 MPa for the metal frameworks. Tilted distal implants, with consequent reduction of the posterior cantilevers, resulted in decreased stress values for all of the variables: - 12. 9...|$|R

Chances for the survival of the three groups of FDPs with end abutments were very high (risk for failure 2. 8 %, 0 %, 5. 6 %). The probability to remain without complications and/or failure was 70. 3 %, 88. 9 % and 74. 7 % in FDPs with end abutments, but 49. 8 - 25 % only in FDPs with extensions at 10 years. Conclusions: In patients treated for chronic periodontitis and provided with ceramo-metal FDPs, high survival rates, especially for FDPs with end abutments, can be expected. The incidence rates of any negative events were increased drastically in the three groups with extension cFDPs (tt, ii, ti). Strategic decisions in the choice of a particular FDP design and the choice of teeth/implants as abutments appear to influence the risks for complications to be expected with fixed reconstruction. If possible, extensions on tooth abutments should be avoided or used only after a cautious clinical evaluation of all options. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{aimed to}} {{screening}} and documenting {{the diversity of}} scale characteristics of two species belonging to two different genera of the family Sparidae: Acanthopagrus bifasciatus and Rhabdosargus sarba from the Red Sea. The valid useful scale characters for systematic purposes were determined in the term of morphometry and Scanning Electron Microscopic techniques. A wide spectrum of size-free intraspecific variations between different body regions was recorded in each species in terms of morphometric indices. The scale characters included the overall form of the scales and their morphometrics, radii counts, shape of interradial tongues, the first circuli, form of interradial circuli and their denticles, the outer lateral and inner lateral circuli and {{the form of the}}ir denticles, granulation of the caudal field and the shape of ctenii. Moreover, the form of the lateral line canal, the relative position of their anterior and posterior openings and the <b>cantilevered</b> anterior <b>extension</b> of the canal were valid in differentiation between species...|$|R

50|$|The shops on {{the north}} side have <b>cantilevered</b> rear <b>extensions.</b> Consequently, the {{northern}} external façade of the bridge is asymmetrical, much altered and of no architectural merit, whereas the southern external side clearly shows the hand of Robert Adam.Built of limestone, in classic Palladian style, the southern façade {{takes the form of a}} temple-like central bay with symmetrical wings connecting to two flanking, terminating pavilions. The central bay is given eminence by a broken pediment supported by austere Doric pillasters. It in turn is flanked by two small bays, each with a small pointed pediment supported by shallow pilasters, which further emphasise and complement the central broken pediment sitting above a large Palladian window - the focal point of the building. On this southern side the structure comprises a principal floor at street level, with a low mezzanine separated by stone banding above. Beneath the principal floor is a sub-floor constructed in the masonry between the spans of the bridge, its presence indicated by ocular windows placed symmetrically beneath the span of each arch. This ocular motif, on a reduced scale, is repeated symmetrically at mezzanine level beneath the central broken pediment. The two terminating pavilions, in reality slight projections, have shallow saucer domes concealed behind their pointed pediments. The roof is pitched and of Welsh slate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Scale {{characteristics}} and its detailed structure from different body regions were studied in three Plectorhynchus species {{in terms of}} morphometry and Scanning Electron Microscopic techniques. The present work has been suggested to the rarity of taxonomic and biological information about the three Plectorhynchus species, P. gaterinus, P. pictus and P. schotaf from the Red Sea. A wide spectrum of size-free intraspecific and interspecific variations was recorded and documented concerning the overall form of the scales and their morphometrics, scale surface morphology, the primary, secondary and tertiary radii counts, shape of interradial tongues and the first circuli, the interradial circuli, most outer lateral circuli, inner lateral circuli, denticles on circuli, interradial and intercircular grooves, segmentation and granulation pattern of the caudal field and the shape of ctenii. The quantitative scale characters of Plectorhynchus species are subjected to cluster analysis that revealed two main subclusters, the first includes P. gaterinus and P. schotaf, and the second subcluster includes P. pictus. In addition to the intraspecific variations, the highly significant interspecific variations in the morphometric indices also were evident from one body region to another (P< 0. 01). The pattern of variations reflected by CVA referred to the partial discrimination between the three Plectorhynchus species considered. Among the scale characteristics used to differentiate between Plectorhynchus species are the overall shape of the lateral line canal, the relative position of its anterior and posterior openings and the <b>cantilevered</b> anterior <b>extension</b> of the canal...|$|R

[...] The expansion by Diller Scofidio + Renfro and FXFOWLE extended the travertine cladding of the original building along the West 65th Street facade, and also created an adapted extension of the Brutalist geometries on the upper stories. The fourth-story row of recesses housing windows is extended, but with the glass displaced and extending beyond the recesses, differentiating the extension from the original building and subtly beginning to break the original Brutalist box.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the efforts made {{to study the}} process of comminution to previous Weiss domain polarization and phase transition in piezoceramics together with the versatility of low-temperature-cofired ceramics-based devices and components for their ready adoption for typical applications {{in the area of}} micro-fluidics. A conceptual micro-fluidic module has been presented and few unit entities necessary for its realization have been described. The purpose of these entities is to position the sensors and actuators by using piezoelectric materials. Investigations are performed to make useful constructions like diaphragms and cantilevers for laying the sensing elements, cavities for burying the electronic chip devices, and channels for fluid transportation. In order to realize these constructions, the basic step involves machining of circular, straight line, rectangular and square-shaped structure in the green ceramic tapes followed by lamination and firing with post-machining in some cases. The diaphragm and cavity includes one or more un-machined layer stacked together with several machined layers with rectangular or square slits. The <b>cantilever</b> is an <b>extension</b> of the diaphragm creation process with inclusion of a post-machining step. The channel essentially consists of a machined green ceramic layer sandwiched between an un-machined and a partially machined layer. The fabrication for all the above constructions has been exemplified and the details have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{normal and}} lateral line cycloid scales of a cyprinid fish Capoeta damascina (Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1842) have been {{subjected}} to the scanning electron microscopy technique in order to study their detailed structure. The scales have the general morphological characteristics of the cycloid scales. In the normal scale located below the dorsal fin, the focus lies towards the anterior region and is covered by reticulate or honeycomb form structures with few mucous pores. There is a clear-cut demonstration between the anterior and posterior region. In the posterior section, the scale has several rows of pigmented granules (tubercles) with different shapes from round to oval, semi-oval and even oblong structure. On the dorsal side, the anterior circuli bear teeth-like structures called lepidonts which help the scale in firm attachment to the skin. The circuli may also have calcium projections. The lateral line scale has a canal which characteristically lies along the anterior-posterior axis, slightly towards the posterior part with two anterior and posterior openings. The anterior opening is wider than the posterior opening and is hidden by an evelike <b>extension</b> <b>cantilevered</b> over it. Based on the obtained results it could be concluded that the shape and size of lepidonts on the circuli crest and also the pattern of reticulate or honeycomb form structures in the focus region may provide reliable taxonomic tools...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the results of a survey of dentists practicing implant dentistry regarding their knowledge of risk factors that they considered to be important for predicting dental implant failure. Materials and Methods: A pilot-tested questionnaire was distributed to 100 dentists known to practice implant dentistry. The questionnaire enquired about speciality, qualifications, dental implant experience in addition to knowledge of factors that could lead to dental implants failure. Results: Seventy seven participating dentists were working in private sector and 58 were general dental practitioners. Forty eight dentists were reported to place more than 50 implants (per year), and 50 % had an experience of less than 5 years. The most widely used implant system in Jordan was the Oraltronics (Pit-Easy®) with 54 % having used it. Fifty percent of dentists believed that the posterior maxilla was the most risky intra-oral site for implant failure. Over 50 % of the sample believed that cylindrical and machined surface implants were the most risky types of implants associated with failures. Seventy four dentists believed that posterior <b>extension</b> <b>cantilever</b> design was the prosthetic design most associated with dental implant failure. Experience, age and specialty significantly influenced the knowledge of factors that could lead to implant failure (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: The results obtained underscore the importance of obtaining comprehensive implantology education in Jordan...|$|R
