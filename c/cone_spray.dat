40|$|Abstraet [...] F',xperiments were {{performed}} to understand better nucleate boiling heat transfer and critical heat flux (CHF) for full <b>cone</b> <b>sprays.</b> The effects of spray nozzle, volumetric flux, subcooling and working fluid were investigated. Dense sprays greatly reduced evaporation efficiency, and their boiling curves exhibited an unusually small increase inslope upon transition between the single phase and nucleate boiling regimes. Sa~ater mean diameter (SMD) data were successfully correlated for fluids with vastly different values of surface tension. This correlation was based upon orifice diameter and the Weber and Reynolds numbers of the orifice flow prior to liquid breakup. Also developed was a new CHF correlation which accurately predicted ata for FC- 72, FC- 87 and water. This correlation shows a strong dependence of CHF on volumetric flux and Sauter mean diameter. It is shown that by combining the correlations for CHF and SMD {{it is possible to}} predict accurately CHF for full <b>cone</b> <b>sprays</b> without having to conduct expensive and laborious drop sizing measurements for each individual nozzle. 1...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{configurations}} {{of the solid}} <b>cone</b> <b>spray</b> nozzle is shown in a schematic diagram. A swirling liquid motion is induced with the vane structure, however; the discharge flow fills the entire outlet orifice. For the same capacity and pressure drop, a full cone nozzle will produce a larger drop size than a hollow cone nozzle. The coverage is the desired feature for such a nozzle, which is often used for applications to distribute fluid over an area.|$|E
50|$|Pressure-swirl {{spray nozzles}} are {{high-performance}} (small drop size) devices with one configuration shown. The stationary core induces a rotary fluid motion which causes the swirling of the fluid in the swirl chamber. A film is {{discharged from the}} perimeter of the outlet orifice producing a characteristic hollow <b>cone</b> <b>spray</b> pattern. Air or other surrounding gas is drawn inside the swirl chamber to form an air core within the swirling liquid. Many configurations of fluid inlets are used to produce this hollow cone pattern depending on the nozzle capacity and materials of construction. The uses of this nozzle include evaporative cooling and spray drying.|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{analysis of}} flow in simplex fuel atomizers using the arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian method is presented. It {{is well established}} that the geometry of an atomizer {{plays an important role}} in governing its performance. We have investigated the effect on atomizer performance of four geometric parameters, namely, inlet slot angle, spin chamber convergence angle, trumpet angle, and trumpet length. For a constant mass flow rate through the atomizer, the atomizer performance is monitored in terms of dimensionless film thickness, <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> half-angle, and discharge coefficient. Results indicate that increase in inlet slot angle results in lower film thickness and discharge coefficient and higher <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle. The spin chamber converge angle has an opposite effect on performance parameters, with film thickness and discharge coefficient increasing and the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle decreasing with increasing convergence angle. For a fixed trumpet length, the trumpet angle has very little influence on discharge coefficient. However, the film thickness decreases, and <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle increases with increasing trumpet angle. For a fixed trumpet angle, the discharge coefficient is insensitive to trumpet length. Both the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle and the film thickness are found to decrease with trumpet length. Analytical solutions are developed to determine the atomizer performance considering inviscid flow through the atomizer. The qualitative trends in the variation of film thickness at the atomizer exit, <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle, and discharge coefficient predicted by inviscid flow analysis are seen to agree well with computational results...|$|R

Ensaio realizado com bicos de cone vazio tipo disco mostrou, em certos casos, aumentos superiores a 100 % sobre a vazão inicial, já nas primeiras 50 horas de operação. Evidentemente, isto também conduz a um aumento de mais de 100 % na quantidade de defensivos aplicados, caso o usuário não se aperceba do problema. Observou-se menor influência do aumento do orifício do disco sobre a vazão. Por outro lado, os helicóides apresentaram pronunciado desgaste, afetando diretamente a vazão. Esse desgaste ainda alterou a característica do cone de pulverização do bico, preenchendo o seu centro. Foi notada também redução do ângulo do cone, bem como aumento do tamanho das gotículas. In {{this paper}} it was studied the {{abrasive}} action of a copper oxichloride spray mixture on some disc type hollow <b>cone</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles under usual pressures. Changes in spray nozzles characteristics were noticed during {{the work as}} increasing in the flow-rate, decreasing in the spraying angle, and filling of the hollow cone with high density of spray droplets. The flow rate change is of main importance because if neglected it may contribute to excessive deposition of pesticides on the plants. Beyond the pesticides wastage it implies in great hazzard to environmental contamination and phyto-toxicity. Among the nozzles components tested the core showed higher wearing. The one made of brass was more sensitive to abrasive action of spray mixture than nylon ones, while that of stainless steel showed to be the strengthest.

40|$|Spray/wall {{interactions}} significantly influence air/fuel {{mixing and}} emissions in modern spark-ignited, direct injection engines. Yet, the complex phenomena are hardly understood - especially not {{with respect to}} the large number of parameters and the associated wide ranges occuring in an engine. Modelling spray/wall interactions thus presents a major drawback in numerical simulations done in engine development. This thesis focuses on the impact of dense, high-pressure hollow <b>cone</b> <b>sprays</b> for which existing wall interaction models are evaluated in detail and shown to fail. To the best of the author's knowledge no model adapted to the considered spray type was available which was furthermore accompanied by a severe lack of quantitative experimental data. Therefore, Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) is used to gather data on the normal impact of an isooctane spray with 50 bar injection pressure on a hemispherical copper target. The latter can be heated and wall temperatures up to 200 °C are studied. Moreover, an additional oil film can be applied on the surface to simulate the oil film on a cylinder liner lubricating the piston motion. Variations in the particle Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 on impact are achieved in changing the distance between injector and target. As the question how PDA data concerning spray/wall interaction have to be evaluated has not been studied thoroughly yet, a fundamental analysis was carried out and is presented in this thesis. The results are not limited to dense and high-pressure, hollow <b>cone</b> <b>sprays</b> but may serve as general guidelines for future data evaluation. Based on the measurements, the impact mechanisms of dense, high-pressure sprays are discussed where film fluctuations leading to ligament breakup are found to be decisive. For the considered high Reynolds numbers, inertial forces dominate all other forces which results in negligible parameter influence of the mean Reynolds number and the wall temperature. The oil film is observed to be quickly removed by the impacting spray which points out that spray/wall interactions on a cylinder liner may seriously endanger the operability of an engine. Finally, empirical correlations describing the secondary spray on wall interaction are developed from the gathered data and an extrapolation to oblique impact is proposed. This first empirical model adapted to dense, high-pressure hollow <b>cone</b> <b>sprays</b> is implemented in numerical code in a Lagrangian approach. Details of the implementation are given. The model is validated in several cases for impact angles between 30 ° and 90 ° measured relative to the wall and for injection pressures of 50 bar and 200 bar with very good results...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study is to characterize palm olein/diesel blends spray in terms of spray angle and SMD under different injection pressures using a hollow cone pressure swirl atomizer. The physical properties of five diesel/palm olein blends, namely B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and B 25 were measured and their spray characteristics were tested at injection pressures of 0. 8 MPa, 1. 0 MPa, and 1. 2 MPa under ambient atmospheric condition. The results were compared to spray established using petroleum diesel fuel. The SMD was measured using a phase Doppler analyzer (PDA). The <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle was visualized using a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. The results indicated that petroleum diesel fuel had the widest cone angle followed by B 5, B 10, B 15, B 20 and B 25 under the same injection pressure. Additionally, when the injection pressure increases from 0. 8 MPa to 1. 2 MPa, the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle widen accordingly. It is concluded that high content of palm olein in the palm biofuel blends increases viscosity and surface tension and hence higher value of SMD and narrower <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle was generated.

After sequential combination of back-projected images at each voxel plane of the volume the 3 -D droplet and ligament positions can be readily obtained.

The motivation is to explore retrofitting of conventional engines for direct injection {{to take advantage of}} low emissions and high thermal efficiency of the direct injection concept. Fuel–air mixing is studied at different loads by developing and apply-ing a model based on the Lagrangian-drop and Eulerian-fluid (LDEF) procedure for modelling the two-phase flow. The Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model for modelling the hollow <b>cone</b> <b>spray</b> and appropriate models for droplet impingement, drag and evaporation are used. Moving boundary algorithm and two-way inter-action between both phases are implemented. Fuel injection timing and quantity is varied with load.

The pulsator and swirl injector were designed, built and cold flow tested at Two Phase Flow Laboratory, at Purdue University. The swirl injector {{was subjected to}} periodic pressure pulsation in high frequency range, up to 700 Hz, by the hydro-mechanical pulsator. The air core diameter inside the transparent swirl injector vortex chamber and the nozzle orifice were measured by the high speed camera. In addition, the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> developed near the nozzle exit was measured. Periodic pressure oscillation across the injector changed the air core diameter as much as 15 % and the <b>spray</b> <b>cone</b> angle as much as 6 % downstream from the nozzle exit plane.

The hollow <b>cone</b> <b>spray</b> was injected into a constant pressure bomb filled with quiescent air. The fuel was fed at 7 MPa constant pressure to the injector. Three parameters were changed to study {{the effect of the}} injection conditions on the spray angle: fuel composition, fuel temperature and air pressure in the test bomb. The injector tip was heated up to 150 °C to keep the fuel to be injected at the desired temperature. Different blends of iso-octane and n-pentane were used to obtain fuels with different bubble temperature at the same air pressure. In a reduced set of experiments, only with pure fuels, the ambient pressure was varied to change the bubble temperature independently from the fuel temperature. It was observed that, when the fuel conditions exceed the bubble point, the spray angle, measured close to the injector, becomes wider.
