5|$|In early 2016, the a {{la carte}} menu was stopped and the {{restaurant}} moved to serving only set menus. This was attributed to a desire to reduce the food waste produced by the restaurant, which staff hoped that <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> by half {{as a result of}} the change. The children's menu consists of smaller portions of the main menu.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the expansion's {{official}} release, the PlayStation 4 version was re-released to fix performance issues. In a performance analysis by Eurogamers Digital Foundry, {{it was discovered that}} although Fallout 4 typically ran at 30 frames per second (fps), when the player was outside and, in Far Harbors foggy biomes, the frame rate <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> to 15 fps, and <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> even lower during action-oriented events such as firefights. In the same analysis, the Xbox One version was found to run at 20–30 fps but experienced various issues, such as stuttering and software lock-ups. The update toned down the level of fog, and was successful in making the game more stable.|$|E
5|$|The 1897–8 {{season at}} Newport saw the {{beginning}} of a 'historic' partnership at half-back between Phillips and Llewellyn Lloyd that lasted till 1901. Phillips and Lloyd were thought of as a pair, both playing along similar lines and sharing the work of scrum-half and outside-half. While Lloyd was a smarter runner, Phillips was a better kick, but both of them <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> goals, and were remarkable in their kicks to touch.|$|E

5|$|The Klondike {{could be}} reached only by the Yukon River, either {{upstream}} from its delta, downstream from its head, or {{from somewhere in the}} middle through its tributaries. River boats could navigate the Yukon in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could be hot, while from October to June, during the long winters, temperatures <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E
5|$|In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the {{opportunity}} to play in New York. Although ecstatic, Chrisye was afraid of telling his father, who he thought would disapprove of the idea. He eventually fell ill for several months, during which time the rest of the band left for New York. After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother, his father agreed that he <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> out of college to join Gipsy. After his health improved, in mid-1973, he left with Pontjo to meet Gipsy in New York. That same year he dropped out of Trisakti.|$|E
5|$|Planetary {{models of}} atoms were not new, but Bohr's {{treatment}} was. Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin {{on the role}} of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.|$|E

5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> if it was not either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E

25|$|Depopulation caused {{labor to}} become scarcer; the {{survivors}} were better paid and peasants <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> {{some of the}} burdens of feudalism. There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings including the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt.

25|$|Dumbo {{aircraft}} {{were sent}} aloft to patrol likely areas where American airmen might ditch. The Dumbo would radio {{the position of}} any survivors spotted in the water, and one or more actions could take place. The Dumbo, if a flying boat configuration, could land {{and pick up the}} survivors, or it <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> emergency supplies such as a lifeboat, by parachute. A nearby ship or submarine could be requested to come rescue the survivors, or an air-sea rescue station could be signaled to send a rescue boat.|$|E

Although the rumor was completely false, Brezhnev believed it anyway and ordered the development of a Soviet Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|The maximum areal {{storage density}} for flash memory used in solid state drives (SSDs) is 2.8Tbit/in2 in {{laboratory}} demonstrations as of 2016, and the maximum for HDDs is 1.5Tbit/in2. The areal density of flash memory is doubling every two years, similar to Moore's law (40% per year) {{and faster than}} the 10–20% per year for HDDs. As of 2016, maximum capacity was 10terabytes for an HDD, and 15terabytes for an SSD. HDDs were used in 70% of the desktop and notebook computers produced in 2016, and SSDs were used in 30%. The usage share of HDDs is declining and <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> below 50% in 2018–2019 according to one forecast, because SSDs are replacing smaller-capacity (less than one-terabyte) HDDs in desktop and notebook computers and MP3 players.|$|E
25|$|Btrieve for Windows {{was created}} {{before the company}} rewrote the {{codebase}} to use the MKDE. It featured SEFS and MEFS file sharing mechanisms; used shadow-paging and allowed for exclusive and concurrent locks. It handled version 6.x and 6.1 files differently. Version 6.x files could handle operations on part of a record rather than locking the entire record. It handled records larger than 64KB, implemented VATs, ACSs, new data types, allowed for percentage operations (where the record could be located and manipulated by the physical location in the file) and handled duplicate keys. Version 6.x was capable of dropping or adding any index on the fly (version 6.0 and below <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> only supplemental indexes). Version 6.1 files allowed for concurrent and system transactions, the optional renumbering of keys, case insensitive ACS tables, and enhanced locking operations.|$|E

25|$|The frontoviks had to live, {{fight and}} die in small {{circular}} foxholes dug into the earth with enough room {{for one or two}} men with slit trenches being to connect what the Germans called “Russian holes”. The soldiers were usually not issued blankets or sleeping bags, even in the winter. Instead, the frontovik slept in their coats and shelter-capes usually on pine, evergreen needles, fir boughs, piled leaves or straw. In the winter, the temperature <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> as low as -60°F (-50°C), making General Moroz (General Frost) as much an enemy as the Germans. Spring started in April and with it came rains and snowmelt, making the battlefields into a muddy quagmire. Summers were dusty and hot while with the fall came the rasputitsa (time without roads) as heavy autumn rains once again turned the battlefields into muddy quagmires that made the spring rains look tame by comparison.|$|E
25|$|London {{had nine}} million people—a {{fifth of the}} British population—living {{in an area of}} , which was {{difficult}} to defend because of its size. Based on experience with German strategic bombing during World War I against the United Kingdom, the British government estimated after the First World War that 50 casualties—with about one third killed—would result for every tonne of bombs dropped on London. The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy <b>could</b> <b>drop</b> per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938, experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high-explosive and incendiary bombs, the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. In 1939 military theorist Basil Liddell-Hart predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in Britain could occur in the first week of war.|$|E
