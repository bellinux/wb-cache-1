5|$|Christians {{from many}} traditions were critical, saying the {{movement}} was hyper-emotional, misused Scripture and lost focus on Christ by overemphasizing the Holy Spirit. Within a short time ministers were warning their congregations {{to stay away from}} the Azusa Street Mission. Some <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and tried to get the building shut down.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} Bamber {{had not received}} {{a telephone call from}} his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> before calling Bamber. They also argued that, had Bamber really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly there himself.|$|E
5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> It was initially believed that the head had been in the bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head had been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E

50|$|An inquest {{into her}} {{disappearance}} began on 17 July 2012. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> investigation into her disappearance {{found that she}} most likely drowned. During the inquest, the coroner criticised Woodhouse and Carroll for not <b>calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> themselves. <b>The</b> High Court subsequently found that the suggestion that their failure to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> had contributed to Asher's death was based on speculation.|$|R

5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was the only white student in the classroom. Most {{of the students had}} no problem with Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, his father had been suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E
5|$|When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, {{discovered}} {{she had not}} returned home by the morning, she expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed DeSimone's car still parked, but did not make any closer investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he {{decided to try to}} move it to allow the delivery through. Inside he discovered DeSimone's partially clothed body on the back seat. He immediately <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b>|$|E
5|$|By then, Manning {{was living}} as an openly gay man. Her {{relationship}} with her father was apparently good, but there were problems between Manning and her stepmother. In March 2006, Manning reportedly threatened her stepmother with a knife during an argument about Manning's failure to get another job; the stepmother <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police,</b> and Manning was asked to leave the house. Manning drove to Tulsa in a pickup truck her father had given her, at first slept in it, then moved in with a friend from school. The two got jobs at Incredible Pizza in April. Manning moved on to Chicago before {{running out of money}} and again having nowhere to stay. Her mother arranged for Brian's sister, Debra, a lawyer in Potomac, Maryland, to take Manning in. Nicks wrote that the 15 months Manning spent with her aunt were among the most stable of her life. Chelsea had a boyfriend, took several low-paid jobs, and spent a semester studying history and English at Montgomery College, but left after failing an exam.|$|E

5|$|In Liverpool, at 8:30 am on 17 May, Saturday, {{the twins}} went into St Anne Street Police Station to report {{concerns}} over Sabina's children. At midday the pair boarded a National Express coach to London. A police report {{stated that the}} twins suddenly disembarked from the coach at Keele services, a motorway service station, as they were not feeling well. The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed the twins clinging tightly to their bags and did not let them re-board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items. The manager of the service station was informed and, also feeling suspicious of the pair, <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> Officers arrived {{to talk to them}} but left after deeming the women harmless.|$|E

Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders at the murder scene, calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E
5|$|On 19March 1995, a Mass {{was celebrated}} in the {{reclaimed}} part of the church {{under the direction of}} Papal Nuncio John Bukowski, who delivered Pope John PaulII's blessing to the parish. In a new decision dated 2November 1995, Luzhkov ordered Mosspetspromproyekt to leave the building {{by the end of the}} year at the latest. When the order was still not implemented, parish members entered the institute on 2January 1996 and began the removal. Institute director Evgeny Afanasyev <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> once again, but on this occasion, they declined to intervene. Subsequently, the institute director asked the parish priest for a final extension of the removal date by two weeks—Mosspetspromproyekt vacated the building on 13January 1996. On 2February 1996, the Archdiocese of Mother of God at Moscow obtained official permission to use the church indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of September 18, 1964, Kinne left the hotel without Pugliese, either to acquire money because the couple was running low or to get {{medicine}} she required. Kinne encountered Francisco Parades Ordoñez, a Mexican-born American citizen, at a bar that night and accompanied {{him back to his}} room in Hotel La Vada. According to Kinne's account, she went with Ordoñez to see photographs he offered to show her, but he soon began to make sexual advances toward her and she was forced to fire her gun at him in an attempt to protect herself. Kinne maintained later that she had had no intention of killing or harming Ordoñez, and had intended only to frighten him, but her bullets struck him in the chest and killed him. Responding to the sound of gunfire, hotel employee Enrique Martinez Rueda entered the room. Kinne fired again and hit Rueda in the shoulder. Wounded, Rueda fled the room, locking Kinne inside, and <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) demands £4000 {{for some}} goods he asked Anthony and Tyler to sell, Anthony says he only has £3000 as {{he needed to}} pay some bills. He agrees to sell a {{necklace}} {{to get some of}} the money, but instead, he gives it to Amira. He then gambles the rest but loses it. Derek then asks Anthony and Tyler to either pay up or steal cable from the railway, otherwise he will break their legs. Anthony goes to Michael for financial help but Michael locks Anthony in his office and calls the police, who arrest Derek and Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), who offered to help the brothers. They are released without charge, but Derek then accuses Anthony and Tyler of calling the police, and increases their debt to £8000. They realise Michael <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and confront him, and his partner Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) discovers what is going on. She pays off the debt, but Michael takes a beating from Derek.|$|E
5|$|When {{they are}} young, Sam breaks into the orphanage {{he was thrown}} out of to get to Nathan, and tell him some grim news. To make up for the bad part, Sam leads Nathan to the house of Evelyn,a {{historian}} who was legally sold their mother's belongings. They attempt to retrieve the items, but are caught. Evelyn <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> before she knew that the boys were the offspring of Cassandra Morgan, an employee of hers. Evelyn collapses from her lung disease and the boys are associated with her death. They flee, and Sam prompts Nathan that they can become explorers, under the new surname of Drake. It is implied that Sam , around 19 or 20 years old was behind bars when Nathan around 14 or 15 years old stole Francis Drake's ring in Columbia, and when he first partnered with Victor Sullivan, he presumably later met Victor but never saw him eye to eye, and distrusted him.|$|E

Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E
