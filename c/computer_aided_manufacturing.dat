2500|$|In {{computer}} aided design, <b>computer</b> <b>aided</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> {{and computer}} graphics, a powerful extension of B-splines is non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). NURBS are essentially B-splines in homogeneous coordinates. Like B-splines, they {{are defined by}} their order, and a knot vector, {{and a set of}} control points, but unlike simple B-splines, the control points each have a weight. When the weight is equal to 1, a NURBS is simply a B-spline and as such NURBS generalizes both B-splines and BÃ©zier curves and surfaces, the primary difference being the weighting of the control points which makes NURBS curves [...] "rational".|$|E
