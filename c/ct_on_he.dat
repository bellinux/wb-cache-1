40|$|Abstract The authors {{report the}} case of a 4 -year boy who {{required}} anaesthetic and surgical care during LASER excision of laryngeal papillomatosis. He presented with hoarseness and stridor and underwent emergency tracheostomy after confirmation of laryngeal papillomas <b>on</b> <b>CT</b> scan. <b>He</b> required LASER treatment under general anaesthesia with a requirement of paediatric LASER-safe endotracheal tube but unfortunately, this was not available in the country. Balanced anaesthesia technique using inhalational anaesthetic, muscle relaxant and narcotic is used with modifications. After three successful surgical sessions, the airway became patent and tracheostomy was de-cannulated. The perioperative issues surrounding this process are discussed including anaesthetic induction in the patient with a compromised airway, maintenance anaesthetic techniques, methods used for ventilation during LASER surgery of the upper airway, surgical implications and hazards of LASER to the operating room personnel...|$|R

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONWilkie's {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) compresses the third part of the duodenum causing proximal dilatation of small bowel. It is due to loss of the fat pad that sits between the duodenum and SMA and therefore is most commonly seen in {{people who have had}} significant weight loss. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 79 year old man presented with anaemia and weight loss and an ascending colon malignancy was found. He was built up nutritionally and subsequently underwent a right hemicolectomy. Post operatively he had persistent nausea and vomiting and duodenal compression by the SMA was identified <b>on</b> <b>CT</b> imaging. <b>He</b> was managed initially with parenteral nutrition then gradually enteral feeding was introduced via a nasojejunal tube. Symptoms resolved with weight gain and he was discharged well. DISCUSSIONThis condition often presents insidiously with intermittent nausea and vomiting. It infrequently occurs with a more acute onset in surgical patients. It has a classic appearance <b>on</b> <b>CT</b> imaging and is usually managed with conservative treatment although surgical options are feasible if this fails. CONCLUSIONWilkie's syndrome is an interesting and infrequent cause of small bowel obstruction following colorectal surgery. A high index of suspicion is required...|$|R
40|$|Upper tract urothelial {{carcinoma}} (UC) is {{an uncommon}} tumor. Ectopic kidney {{is also a}} rare entity. The combination of these two conditions is very rare. A 49 -year-old male complained of right flank pain with hematuria. <b>On</b> <b>CT</b> scan <b>he</b> {{was found to have}} a malrotated right kidney with soft tissue seen in the upper calyceal group and a normal left kidney. Diagnostic cystoscopy was unremarkable. Radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision was performed. Pathology report revealed low grade urothelial carcinoma. Patient's symptoms disappeared postoperatively. Follow up showed no recurrence during the first two years in the bladder and upper tract in the contralateral kidney. Isolated UC of ectopic kidney is rare disease three cases were reported in literature. Although treatment of this tumor can be challenging due to its complex blood supply and position inside the pelvis, treatment strategy is still similar as for orthotopic kidneys...|$|R
