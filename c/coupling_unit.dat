25|$|The {{two most}} common {{factory-installed}} locking differentials use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous <b>coupling</b> <b>unit</b> {{to join the}} shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{kinetics}} of condensation reactions in phosphotriester synthesis of oligonucleotides on polystyrene copolymer resin support, using monomers, dimers, and trimers as the <b>coupling</b> <b>units.</b> The condensations follow pseudo first order kinetics, with a rate constant that decreases from monomers to dimers to trimers. Arrhenius plots indicate a nearly constant activation energy of around 10. 4 kcal mol- 1. Extrapolation to find the Arrhenius preexponential factor, A, is inaccurate because of the limited temperature range studied.

50|$|ControlTrac II was a Ford {{four-wheel drive}} {{system based on}} a viscous <b>{{coupling}}</b> <b>unit.</b> The viscous coupling replaced the typical center differential used in four-wheel drive applications. The system worked normally in front wheel drive {{but in addition to}} the front wheels being driven, a shaft is powered that runs to the viscous coupling in the rear. If the front wheels slip, the viscous coupling progressively releases torque to the rear wheels. Additionally, the ControlTrac II system provided a mechanical lock of four-wheel drive though there was no low range provided by the system.|$|E
50|$|Some 4 {{wheel drive}} cars use a centre viscous <b>coupling</b> <b>unit</b> {{that will provide}} most power to the rear wheels unless the amount of torque being {{supplied}} to the rear wheels is {{in excess of the}} traction limits of the rear tyres, such as in a Lamborghini Murciélago. Others contain a computer that will decide how much power to distribute to any wheel at any time depending on the circumstances of each wheel. In general the M4 system is not widely used as it is suited toward sports cars and some off-road racing vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|The T4 {{was also}} {{available}} {{with a permanent}} 4WD system that uses a Viscous <b>coupling</b> <b>unit</b> as a centre differential to regulate the distribution of torque to the rear axle.

50|$|Further, the 993's {{optional}} all {{wheel drive}} system was refined over that of the 964. Porsche departed from the 964's setup consisting of three differentials and revised the system based on the layout from its 959 supercar, replacing the centre differential with a viscous <b>coupling</b> <b>unit.</b> In conjunction with the 993's redesigned suspension, this system improved handling characteristics in inclement weather and still retained the stability offered by {{all wheel drive}} without having to suffer as many compromises as the past all wheel drive system.

5000|$|In 1993, Alfa {{introduced}} a four-wheel-drive variant called the Q4 (short for Quadrifoglio 4), which {{was equipped with}} the most powerful 3-Litre V6 engine fitted to the 164, featuring 24-valves. The Q4's four-wheel-drive system ("Viscomatic") was co-developed with the Austrian company Steyr-Puch. and was more advanced than others compared at the time. The system consisted of a viscous <b>coupling</b> <b>unit,</b> central epicyclic differential and Torsen differential in the rear. Connected to the ABS and [...] "Motronic" [...] engine management modules, the power driven to the rear axle was continuously variable from 0 to 100% subject to road conditions. Torque was distributed between axles depending on the speed, turning radius, engine rpms, throttle position and ABS parametrics. This model was equipped with a Getrag 6-speed manual gearbox.|$|E

The 1987 Galant also featured [...] "Dynamic ECS", a world’s first production semi-active electronically controlled suspension system (a means of actively controlling a vehicle’s cornering attitude (body roll) and dynamic performance) that Mitsubishi developed. Mitsubishi's active ECS enhanced ride comfort and kept body inclination to a minimum under all driving conditions by controlling the grip between the tires and the road surface.|$|E
5000|$|For the Celica, the {{original}} ST165 GT-Four of October 1986 had [...] "Center Diff.

Neither the Previa nor the Celica have a lockable transfer case, but the viscous coupling can be temporarily disabled for testing purposes via a selector switch on the transfer case assembly. The vehicle should not be driven with the viscous coupling disabled as transfer case or transmission damage will occur. Very few Celicas also had a Torsen rear differential. This style of differential is like an open differential under normal conditions, but when one of the rear wheels starts to lose traction, it will transmit power to the wheel with the most available traction.|$|E
