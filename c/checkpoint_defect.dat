40|$|SummaryPten−/− cells {{display a}} {{partially}} defective checkpoint {{in response to}} ionizing radiation (IR). The <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> was traced {{to the ability of}} AKT to phosphorylate CHK 1 at serine 280, since a nonphosphorylated mutant of CHK 1 (S 280 A) complemented the <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> and restored CDC 25 A degradation. CHK 1 phosphorylation at serine 280 led to covalent binding of 1 to 2 molecules of ubiquitin and cytoplasmic CHK 1 localization. Primary breast carcinomas lacking PTEN expression and having elevated AKT phosphorylation had increased cytoplasmic CHK 1 and displayed aneuploidy (p < 0. 005). We conclude that loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of AKT impair CHK 1 through phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and reduced nuclear localization to promote genomic instability in tumor cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPARK 2, an {{ubiquitin}} ligase closely {{correlated with}} Parkinson's disease and cancer, {{has been shown}} to accumulate at centrosomes to ubiquitinate misfolded proteins accumulated during interphase. In the present study, we demonstrated that PARK 2 can also localize to centrosomes in mitosis and that the protein does not fluctuate through the S- to M-phase. A C-terminal truncation of PARK 2 resulted in a spindle assembly <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect,</b> characterized by HeLa cells able to bypass mitotic arrest induced by nocodazole and form multinucleated cells when overexpressing the C-terminal truncated PARK 2 protein. The spindle assembly <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> may be due to a change in a biochemical or structural property of PARK 2 caused by the C-terminal truncation, resulting in a loss of self-interaction between PARK 2 proteins...|$|E
40|$|Werner {{syndrome}} (WS) {{is a human}} {{genetic disorder}} characterized by extensive clinical features of premature aging. Ataxia-telengiectasia (A-T) is a multisystem human genomic instability syndrome that includes premature aging {{in some of the}} patients. WRN and ATM, the proteins defective in WS and A-T, respectively, play significant roles in the maintenance of genomic stability and are involved in several DNA metabolic pathways. A role for WRN in DNA repair has been proposed; however, this study provides evidence that WRN is also involved in ATM pathway activation and in a S-phase checkpoint in cells exposed to DNA interstrand cross-link–induced double-strand breaks. Depletion of WRN in such cells by RNA interference results in an intra-S <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect,</b> and interferes with activation of ATM as well as downstream phosphorylation of ATM target proteins. Treatment of cells under replication stress with the ATM kinase inhibitor KU 55933 results in a S-phase <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> similar to that observed in WRN shRNA cells. Moreover, γH 2 AX levels are higher in WRN shRNA cells than in control cells 6 and 16 h after exposure to psoralen DNA cross-links. These results suggest that WRN and ATM participate in a replication checkpoint response, in which WRN facilitates ATM activation in cells with psoralen DNA cross-link–induced collapsed replication forks...|$|E

The cmk 2 + gene {{is not essential}} for cell viability but overexpression of cmk 2 + blocks the cell cycle at G 2 phase and this inhibition is cdc 2 -dependent. The Cmk 2 is a cytoplasmic protein expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, peaking at the G 1 /S boundary.

Examining checkpoint-dependent mechanisms controlling fork stability, {{we find that}} fork reversal and dormant origin firing due to <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects</b> are rescued in checkpoint mutants lacking THO, TREX- 2, or inner-basket nucleoporins. Gene gating tethers transcribed genes to the nuclear periphery and is counteracted by checkpoint kinases through phosphorylation of nucleoporins such as Mlp 1. Checkpoint mutants fail to detach transcribed genes from nuclear pores, thus generating topological impediments for incoming forks. Releasing this topological complexity by introducing a double-strand break between a fork and a transcribed unit prevents fork collapse. Mlp 1 mutants mimicking constitutive checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation also alleviate <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects.</b> We propose that the checkpoint assists fork progression and stability at transcribed genes by phosphorylating key nucleoporins and counteracting gene gating, thus neutralizing the topological tension generated at nuclear pore gated genes...|$|R

Here we analyzed 358 genome rearrangements generated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{selected by the}} loss of the nonessential terminal segment of chromosome V. The rearrangements appeared to be generated by both nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination and targeted all chromosomes. Fifteen percent of the rearrangements occurred independently more than once. High levels of specific classes of rearrangements were isolated from strains with specific mutations: translocations to Ty elements were increased in telomerase-defective mutants, potential dicentric translocations and dicentric isochromosomes were associated with cell cycle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects,</b> chromosome fusions were frequent in strains with both telomerase and cell cycle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects,</b> and translocations to homolog genes were seen in strains with defects allowing homoeologous recombination.

40|$|We {{identified}} an allele of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC 20 that {{exhibits a}} spindle-assembly <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect.</b> Previous studies indicated that loss of CDC 20 function caused cell cycle arrest {{prior to the}} onset of anaphase. In contrast, CDC 20 - 50 caused inappropriate cell cycle progression through M phase {{in the absence of}} mitotic spindle function. This effect of CDC 20 - 50 was dominant over wild type and was eliminated by a second mutation causing loss of function, suggesting that it encodes an overactive form of Cdc 20 p. Overexpression of CDC 20 was found to cause a similar <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect,</b> causing bypass of the preanaphase arrest produced by either microtubule-depolymerizing compounds or MPS 1 overexpression. CDC 20 overexpression was also able to overcome the anaphase delay caused by high levels of the anaphase inhibitor Pds 1 p, but not a mutant form immune to anaphase-promoting complex- (APC-) mediated proteolysis. CDC 20 overexpression was unable to promote anaphase in cells deficient in APC function. These findings suggest that Cdc 20 p is a limiting factor that promotes anaphase entry by antagonizing Pds 1 p. Cdc 20 p may promote the APC-dependent proteolytic degradation of Pds 1 p and other factors that act to inhibit cell cycle progression through mitosis...|$|E
40|$|Centromeric {{instability}} {{is characterized}} by dynamic formation of centromeric breaks, deletions, isochromosomes and translocations, which are commonly observed in cancer. So far, however, the mechanisms of centromeric instability in cancer cells are still poorly understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that G 2 <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> promotes centromeric instability. Our observations from multiple approaches consistently support this hypothesis. We found that overexpression of cyclin B 1, one of the pivotal genes driving G 2 to M phase transition, impaired G 2 checkpoint and promoted the formation of centromeric aberrations in telomerase-immortalized cell lines. Conversely, centromeric instability in cancer cells was ameliorated through reinforcement of G 2 checkpoint by cyclin B 1 knockdown. Remarkably, treatment with KU 55933 for only 2. 5 h, which abrogated G 2 checkpoint, was sufficient to produce centromeric aberrations. Moreover, centromeric aberrations constituted the major form of structural abnormalities in G 2 checkpoint-defective ataxia telangiectasia cells. Statistical analysis showed that the frequencies of centromeric aberrations in G 2 checkpoint-defective cells were always significantly overrepresented compared with random assumption. As there are multiple pathways leading to G 2 <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect,</b> our finding offers a broad explanation for the common occurrence of centromeric aberrations in cancer cells. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. postprin...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the checkpoint response to aberrant initiation, we analyzed the cell cycle checkpoint response induced by mutations of Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA primase. DNA primase has two subunits, Spp 1 and Spp 2 (S. pombe primases 1 and 2). Spp 1 is the catalytic subunit that synthesizes the RNA primer, {{which is then}} extended by DNA polymerase α (Polα) to synthesize an initiation DNA structure, and this catalytic function of Polα {{is a prerequisite for}} generating the S-M phase checkpoint. Here we show that Spp 2 is required for coupling the function of Spp 1 to Polα. Thermosensitive mutations of spp 2 + destabilize the Polα-primase complex, resulting in an allele-specific S phase <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect.</b> The mutant exhibiting a more severe <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> also has a higher extent of Polα-primase complex instability and deficiency in the hydroxyurea-induced Cds 1 -mediated intra-S phase checkpoint response. However, this mutant is able to activate the Cds 1 response to S phase arrest induced by temperature. These findings suggest that the Cds 1 response to the S-phase arrest signal(s) induced by a initiation mutant is different from that induced by hydroxyurea. Interestingly, a polαts mutant with a defective S-M phase checkpoint and an spp 2 mutant with an intact checkpoint have a similar Polα-primase complex stability, and the Cds 1 response induced by hydroxyurea or by the mutant arrests at the restrictive temperature. Thus, the Cds 1 -mediated intra-S phase checkpoint response induced by hydroxyurea can also be distinguished from the S-M phase checkpoint response that requires the initiation DNA synthesis by Polα...|$|E

40|$|Activation of the Chk 1 {{protein kinase}} by DNA damage enforces a {{checkpoint}} that maintains Cdc 2 in its inactive, tyrosine- 15 (Y 15) phosphorylated state. Chk 1 downregulates the Cdc 25 phosphatases and concomitantly upregulates the Wee 1 kinases {{that control the}} phosphorylation of Cdc 2. Overproduction of Chk 1 causes G 2 arrest/delay independently of DNA damage and upstream checkpoint genes. We utilized this to screen fission yeast for mutations that alter sensitivity to Chk 1 signaling. We describe three dominant-negative alleles of cdr 1, which render cells supersensitive to Chk 1 levels, and suppress the <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects</b> of chk 1 Δ cells. Cdr 1 encodes a protein kinase previously identified as a negative regulator of Wee 1 activity in response to limited nutrition, but Cdr 1 has not previously been linked to checkpoint signaling. Overproduction of Cdr 1 promotes <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects</b> and exacerbates the defective response to DNA damage of cells lacking Chk 1. We conclude that regulation of Wee 1 by Cdr 1 and possibly by related kinases is an important antagonist of Chk 1 signaling and represents a novel negative regulation of cell cycle arrest promoted by this checkpoint...|$|R

40|$|We {{screened}} radiation-sensitive yeast mutants for DNA damage checkpoint {{defects and}} identified Dot 1, the conserved histone H 3 Lys 79 methyltransferase. DOT 1 deletion mutants (dot 1 �) are G 1 and intra-S phase checkpoint defective after ionizing radiation but remain competent for G 2 /M arrest. Mutations that affect Dot 1 function such as Rad 6 -Bre 1 /Paf 1 pathway gene deletions or mutation of H 2 B Lys 123 or H 3 Lys 79 share dot 1 � checkpoint defects. Whereas dot 1 � alone confers minimal DNA damage sensitivity, combining dot 1 � with histone methyltransferase mutations set 1 � and set 2 � markedly enhances lethality. Interestingly, set 1 � and set 2 � mutants remain G 1 checkpoint competent, but set 1 � displays a mild S phase <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect.</b> In human cells, H 3 Lys 79 methylation by hDOT 1 L likely mediates recruitment of the signaling protein 53 BP 1 via its paired tudor domains to double-strand breaks (DSBs). Consistent with this paradigm, loss of Dot 1 prevents {{activation of the}} yeast 53 BP 1 ortholog Rad 9 or Chk 2 homolog Rad 53 and decreases binding of Rad 9 to DSBs after DNA damage. Mutation of Rad 9 to alter tudor domain binding to methylated Lys 79 phenocopies the dot 1 � <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> and blocks Rad 53 phosphorylation. These results indicate a key role for chromatin and methylation of histone H 3 Lys 79 in yeast DNA damage signaling.

In addition, we show that two t(X; 1) -positive RCC tumor cell lines are defective in their mitotic checkpoint. Transfection of PRCCTFE 3, but not the reciprocal product TFE 3 PRCC, disrupts the mitotic checkpoint in human embryonic kidney cells.

Re-duced expression of PP 5 attenuated DNA-damage-in-duced activation of ATM. Expression of a catalytically inactive PP 5 mutant inhibited the phosphorylation of ATM substrates and the autophosphorylation of ATM on Ser 1981, and caused an S-phase <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> in DNA-damaged cells.

40|$|The WD-repeat {{proteins}} Rae 1 and Bub 3 show extensive sequence homology, {{indicative of}} functional similarity. However, {{previous studies have}} suggested that Rae 1 is involved in the mRNA export pathway and Bub 3 in the mitotic checkpoint. To determine the in vivo roles of Rae 1 and Bub 3 in mammals, we generated knockout mice that have these genes deleted individually or in combination. Here we show that haplo-insufficiency of either Rae 1 or Bub 3 results in a similar phenotype involving mitotic <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects</b> and chromosome missegregation. We also show that overexpression of Rae 1 can correct for Rae 1 haplo-insufficiency and, surprisingly, Bub 3 haplo-insufficiency. Rae 1 -null and Bub 3 -null mice are embryonic lethal, although cells from these mice did not have a detectable defect in nuclear export of mRNA. Unlike null mice, compound haplo-insufficient Rae 1 /Bub 3 mice are viable. However, cells from these mice exhibit much greater rates of premature sister chromatid separation and chromosome missegregation than single haplo-insufficient cells. Finally, we show that mice with mitotic <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects</b> are more susceptible to dimethylbenzanthrene-induced tumorigenesis than wild-type mice.

Third, ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) -ATR interacts with MCM 7.

50|$|Changes in {{patterns}} of sister chromatid cohesion have been observed in cases of DNA damage. Cohesin is required for repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). One mechanism of DSB repair, homologous recombination (HR), requires {{the presence of the}} sister chromatid for repair at the break site. Thus, it is possible that cohesion is required for this process because it ensures that the sister chromatids are physically close enough to undergo HR. DNA damage can lead to cohesin loading at non-CAR sites and establishment of cohesion at these sites even during G2 phase. In the presence of ionizing radiation (IR), the Smc1 subunit of cohesin is phosphorylated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. ATM is a key kinase in the DNA damage <b>checkpoint.</b> <b>Defects</b> in cohesion can increase genome instability, a result consistent with the ties between cohesion and DNA damage pathways.|$|R

Because nibrin is crucial for embryonic survival, direct demonstration by targeted deletion that nibrin functions in class switch recombination has been lacking.

Despite their p 53 -nulllike aggressive phenotype, apoptosis-defective lymphomas that retain intact p 53 genes do not display the <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects</b> and gross aneuploidy that are characteristic of p 53 mutant tumors.

Furthermore, chromatid cohesion, whose dissolution triggers anaphase, is dispensable for S phase checkpoint arrest. Kinetochore–spindle attachments are required to prevent spindle extension during replication blocks, and chromosomes with two centromeres or an origin of replication juxtaposed to a centromere rescue the rad 53 <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect.</b> These observations suggest that checkpoint signaling is required to generate an inward force involved in maintaining preanaphase spindle integrity during DNA replication distress.

In this study, we evaluated mitotic spindle checkpoint competence in HCC cell lines, using nocodazole and colcemid, which inhibit spindle assembly. Six of the eleven HCC cell lines tested showed a defect in mitotic competency. In addition, these six HCC cell lines also showed a reduction in the expression of a major mitotic checkpoint protein, called Mitotic Arrest Deficient 2 (MAD 2). This association of mitotic spindle checkpoint incompetence and the downregulation of MAD 2 protein in these HCC cells suggest that deficiency of the MAD 2 protein {{may play a role in}} mitotic spindle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> in HCC. In addition to MAD 2, we have also examined the expression of MAD 1, the binding partner of MAD 2, which also plays an important role in the progression of mitosis. During the evaluation of MAD 1 expression, we have identified a novel splicing variant of MAD 1, which we named MAD 1 β. This isoform was detected in all HCC cell lines tested and in most of the human HCC samples and their corresponding nontumorous livers. Upon sequencing, we found that MAD 1 β had no exon 4, which was likely a result of different splicing. In addition, with confocal microscopy, overexpression of MAD 1 β in HCC cell lines resulted in a different subcellular localization (cytoplasmic) as compared with that of MAD 1 (nuclear). These results suggest that exon 4 may contain a nuclear localization signal which can regulate the localization of MAD 1 protein in cells. Overall, our results suggest that reduced MAD 2 expression may contribute to mitotic <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defect</b> in HCC. In addition, further investigation into this newly identified MAD 1 isoform, MAD 1 β, is warranted...|$|E

Using a mouse model harboring primary, genetically modified myc-driven lymphomas, we show that disruption of apoptosis downstream of p 53 by Bcl 2 or a dominant-negative caspase 9 confers—like p 53 loss—a selective advantage, and completely alleviates pressure to inactivate p 53 during lymphomagenesis. Despite their p 53 -null-like aggressive phenotype, apoptosis-defective lymphomas that retain intact p 53 genes do not display the <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects</b> and gross aneuploidy that are characteristic of p 53 mutant tumors. Therefore, apoptosis is the only p 53 function selected against during lymphoma development, whereas defective cell-cycle checkpoints and aneuploidy are mere byproducts of p 53 loss...|$|R
40|$|Aneuploidy is a {{frequent}} property of cancer cells that arises {{as a consequence of}} chromosomal instability (CIN). A major safeguard mechanism protecting cells from CIN is the spindle assembly checkpoint. This checkpoint surveys proper attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and effectively suppresses erroneous chromosome segregation by delaying mitotic progression until proper spindle-chromosome interactions have been established. Several lines of evidence suggest that the development of aneuploidy may be a gradual process that in many cases could result from subtle spindle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects</b> that occur during tumorgenesis and steadily weaken spindle checkpoint function. Here we discuss the evidence for this concept and address the question whether normal somatic cells and tumor cells could perhaps exhibit differences in spindle checkpoint regulation that allow the design of more specific anti-tumor strategies that effectively kill tumor cells but spare normal cells...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{components}} of the Mre 11 /Rad 50 /Nbs 1 complex give rise to genetic disorders characterized by neurological abnormalities, radiosensitivity, cell cycle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>defects,</b> genomic instability and cancer predisposition. Evidence exists that this complex associates with chromatin during DNA replication and acts as a sensor of double strand breaks (dsbs) in DNA after exposure to radiation. A series of recent reports provides additional support that the complex senses breaks in DNA and relays this information to ATM, mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), which in turn activates pathways for cell cycle checkpoint activation. Paradoxically members of the Mre 11 complex are also downstream of ATM in these pathways. Here, Lavin attempts {{to make sense of}} this sensing mechanism with reference to a series of recent reports on the topic. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
