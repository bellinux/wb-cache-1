5|$|The wreck is {{steadily}} decaying, turning to oxide {{at a rate}} of 0.5–1 ton per day (assuming one ten-thousandth of an inch per day on all surfaces). Eventually Titanics structure will collapse, and she will be reduced to a patch of rust on the seabed, with any remaining scraps of the ship's hull mingled with her more durable fittings, like the propellers, bronze <b>capstans,</b> compasses and the telemotor.|$|E
5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with <b>capstans.</b> When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E
50|$|A holding <b>capstan</b> is {{a ratchet}} device {{that can turn}} only in one direction; once a load is pulled into place in that direction, it can be held with a much smaller force. A powered <b>capstan,</b> also called a winch, rotates so that the applied tension is multiplied by the {{friction}} between rope and <b>capstan.</b> On a tall ship a holding <b>capstan</b> and a powered <b>capstan</b> are used in tandem so that a small force {{can be used to}} raise a heavy sail and then the rope can be easily removed from the powered <b>capstan</b> and tied off.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, {{a single}} machine head {{consists}} of a cylinder or <b>capstan,</b> mounted {{at the center of}} a pinion gear, a knob or [...] "button" [...] and a worm gear that links them. The <b>capstan</b> has a hole through the far end from the gear, and the string is made to go through that hole, and is wrapped around the <b>capstan.</b> To complete the string installation, the string is tightened by turning the <b>capstan</b> using the tuning knob. The worm gear ensures that the <b>capstan</b> cannot turn without a movement on the knob; it also allows precise tuning.|$|R

5|$|In 1761 John Griffin {{published}} {{a letter in}} the London Chronicle recommending methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing and described the bolts and rings he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour. Mooring rings were still there in 1824, and around 1830, three <b>capstans</b> {{at the base of}} the cliffs and bollards along the cliffs, by which means boats could be warped safely past the bar were installed.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the <b>capstans,</b> bollards and mooring rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{deployment}} of Spitfires to Australia was kept secret {{so that the}} Japanese were not alerted to their presence, and the Australian Government directed that the aircraft {{be referred to as}} <b>Capstans</b> (after the brand of cigarettes) and their Merlin engines as Marvels. General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, agreed that the Australian Government could choose when to announce the presence of the Spitfires, but warned against exaggerating the impact they were likely to have.|$|E

50|$|<b>Capstan</b> Island got {{its name}} from a <b>capstan</b> located on an island very near to the village. A <b>capstan</b> is a sturdy wooden post and handle, mounted in a {{stabilizing}} frame, used to wind in a rope or cable to block seals in the bay. Around 1851 residents began sealing in this area. A large <b>capstan</b> {{was placed on the}} small island just offshore and a seal net attached to it. When harp seals migrated along the shore in spring, the net 'box' trapped them. <b>Capstan</b> Island is located in the Labrador Straits region on Route 510, only 39 km from the Quebec/Labrador border.|$|R
50|$|There also existed a <b>capstan,</b> {{but only}} the base remains, which {{is known as the}} Ferry <b>Capstan</b> Base. There is no clear {{evidence}} of the construction date or usage, however there are accounts of it pulling a dredger and barges up the river, via a rope connected to a winch in the <b>capstan.</b> The accounts vary as to how it was powered, either by convicts or animals pushing an iron bar to rotate the <b>capstan,</b> which was centred on a vertical axle.|$|R
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and <b>capstans</b> on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E
5|$|A list of {{necessary}} equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, <b>capstans,</b> pulleys, and 40 pounds of tallow for lubrication. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships {{to be used}} as hulks were Jesus of Lübeck and Samson, each of 700tons burthen and similar in size to the Mary Rose. Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the Mary Rose. The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.|$|E
25|$|Mooring {{requires}} {{cooperation between}} {{people on a}} pier and on a vessel. Heavy mooring lines are often passed from larger vessels to people on a mooring by smaller, weighted heaving lines. Once a mooring line {{is attached to a}} bollard, it is pulled tight. Large ships generally tighten their mooring lines using heavy machinery called mooring winches or <b>capstans.</b>|$|E

25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} use outriggers, or booms, to tow the trawl. These outriggers {{are usually}} fastened to, {{or at the}} foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with <b>capstans</b> are installed on the deck to haul the catch.|$|E
25|$|These motors were {{originally}} invented {{to drive the}} <b>capstan(s)</b> of magnetic tape drives in the burgeoning computer industry, where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are still widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available, the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos.|$|E
25|$|The dock {{itself is}} still {{substantially}} intact, other than its former entrances and exits, {{all but one}} of which have been filled in or blocked. It still has a working connection to South Dock, which is now a marina, and it has a small marina of its own at its eastern end. There are no traces of the former warehouses, although many of the old <b>capstans</b> and some of the hydraulic machines on the quayside have been preserved.|$|E
5000|$|Like its audio counterpart, moving tape {{past the}} read/write heads on nine-track digital {{required}} precise control, accomplished by a <b>capstan</b> motor. The <b>capstan</b> motor {{was designed for}} very smooth operation. Feedback to the control electronics was accomplished by a tachometer, usually an optical [...] "tone wheel", to control tape velocity. Starting and stopping the <b>capstan</b> was controlled by ramp generators to ensure a properly sized inter-record gap, the gap between blocks of information.|$|R
50|$|Such {{mechanisms}} are not often found since the {{rack and pinion}} is generally more robust for the same job. However the <b>capstan</b> and bowstring is easily fabricated by the home builder from scratch, where accurate rack and pinion {{mechanisms are}} not, and also require much looser tolerances between the working parts. The angle between the <b>capstan</b> shaft and the linear element can also be variable without any special couplings needed, such as universal joints. The cable is typically steel and can be tensioned at the points where it {{is connected to the}} bow. Another feature of the <b>capstan</b> and bowstring is that it can be designed to slip at the ends of its travel if desired by the simple expedient of having the cable slip around the <b>capstan,</b> forming a simple torque-limiting clutch. <b>Capstan</b> and bowstring mechanisms can be used wherever a rack and pinion or other rotary-to-linear conversion is found, such as in the steering mechanism of vehicles, etc.|$|R
60|$|The <b>capstan</b> {{stands on}} the main-deck, {{sometimes}} near {{the centre of the}} vessel, at other times near the bow or the stern. It is a massive block of timber moving on a pivot, which is turned round by wooden levers, called <b>capstan</b> bars, or hand-spikes, and is used for any purpose that requires great tractive power--the drawing in of the cable, for instance, or warping the ship; which means that a rope is fixed on shore, or by an anchor {{to the bottom of the}} sea, and the other end of it is coiled round the <b>capstan,</b> so that when the <b>capstan</b> is forced round by the handspikes, the rope coils on to it, and the ship is slowly dragged forward.|$|R
25|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{developed}} {{large wooden}} wine presses that utilized large beams, <b>capstans</b> and windlasses to exert {{pressure on the}} pomace. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church. There are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was likely because added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus manual treading was substantial enough to justify the cost.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{monolith}} lifted by cranes was the 108t {{heavy corner}} cornice block of the Jupiter temple at Baalbek, {{followed by an}} architrave block weighing 63t, {{both of which were}} raised to a height of about 19m. The capital block of Trajan's Column, with a weight of 53.3t, was even lifted to c. 34m above the ground. As such enormous loads far exceeded the lifting capability of any single treadwheel crane, it is assumed that Roman engineers set up a four-masted lifting tower in the midst of which the stone blocks were vertically raised by the means of <b>capstans</b> placed on the ground around it.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{monolith}} moved was the trilithon, a {{group of}} three monumental blocks in the podium of the Jupiter temple at Baalbek. The individual stones are 19.60m, 19.30m and 19.10m long respectively, with a depth of 3.65m and a height of 4.34m. Weighing approximately 800t on average, they were transported a distance of 800m from the quarry and probably pulled by the means of ropes and <b>capstans</b> into their final position. The supporting stone layer beneath features a number of blocks which are still in the order of 350t. The various giant stones of Roman Baalbek rank high among the largest man-made monoliths in history.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} braking cable-payout mechanism {{has been}} developed. Whereas other such mechanisms operate at payout speeds that {{vary with the}} length of payout, this mechanism operates at approximately constant payout speed, regardless {{of the length of}} cord that has already been paid out. The present mechanism includes a spool, a <b>capstan</b> assembly, and centrifugal brakes. The spool is used to store the cord and, unlike in the prior mechanism, is not involved in the primary braking function. That is, the spool operates {{in such a way that}} the cord is unwound from the spool at low tension. The spool is connected to the rest of the mechanism through a constant- torque slip clutch. The clutch must slip in order to pay out the cord. As the cord leaves the spool, it passes into the <b>capstan</b> assembly, wherein its direction is changed by use of the first of three idler sheaves and it is then routed into the first of three grooves on a <b>capstan.</b> After completing less than a full circle in the first groove, the cord passes over the second idler sheave, which is positioned to enable the cord to make the transition to the second groove on the <b>capstan.</b> Similarly, a third idler sheave enables the cord to make the transition to the third groove on the <b>capstan.</b> After traveling less than a full circle in the third groove, the cord leaves the <b>capstan</b> along the payout path. The total wrap angle afforded by this capstan-and-idler arrangement is large enough to prevent slippage between the cord and the <b>capstan.</b> The <b>capstan</b> is connected to a shaft that, in turn, is connected to a centrifugal brake. Hence, the effective payout radius, for purposes of braking, is not the varying radius of the remaining cord on the spool but, rather, the constant radius of the grooves in the <b>capstan.</b> The payout speed is determined primarily by this radius and by the characteristics of the centrifugal brake. Therefore, the payout speed is more nearly constant in this mechanism than in the prior mechanism...|$|R

25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, <b>capstans</b> and windlasses to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and continuous presses used in wineries today.|$|E
25|$|Powered operation. On large modern canals, {{especially}} {{very large}} ones such as ship canals, the gates and paddles are {{too large to}} be hand operated, and are operated by hydraulic or electrical equipment. On the Caledonian Canal the lock gates were operated by man-powered <b>capstans,</b> one connected by chains to open the gate and another to draw it closed. By 1968 these {{had been replaced by}} hydraulic power acting through steel rams. Even on smaller canals, some gates and paddles are electrically operated, particularly if the lock is regularly staffed by professional lock keepers. On the River Thames below Oxford all the locks are staffed and powered. Powered locks are usually still filled by gravity, though some very large locks use pumps to speed things up.|$|E
500|$|Although a {{technical}} analysis {{has shown that}} the transport of triremes (25 t, [...] long, [...] beam), albeit difficult, was technically feasible, it is assumed that the vessels were usually smaller boats rather than ships. To avoid damaging the keel during transport, hypozomata, thick ropes running from bow to stern, to reduce sagging and hogging of the hull, must have been used. Ship and cargo were presumably pulled by men and animals with ropes, tackles and possibly also <b>capstans.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{method for}} {{reliability}} sensitivity design is presented based on fourth moment technique, and the reliability {{sensitivity of the}} <b>capstan</b> in track-laying vehicle with non-normal random parameters is extensively discussed. The variation regularities of reliability sensitivity are obtained {{and the effects of}} design parameters on reliability of the <b>capstan</b> in track-laying vehicle are studied. The method presented in this paper provides the theoretic basis for the reliability design of the <b>capstan</b> in track-laying vehicle, the production can be very useful if it extended to correlated area of machine sensitivity design...|$|R
50|$|As {{reported}} by the local newspaper (as reported in The Colliery Guardian on 15 March 1926.) the six men were finishing work on the second shaft when their portable platform below ground collapsed. The <b>Capstan</b> engine which malfunctioned was powered by a two-cylinder engine; attached to each drum however on the <b>Capstan</b> engine were pawls or ratchets which should have prevented the <b>Capstan</b> engine slipping; and the inspected machinery {{was found to be}} in order; there was no evidence to prove mechanical failure or human aberration. At the coroner's inquest the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The given verdict had been largely influenced by a special report made regarding this accident by Mr H.M. Hudspeth, H.M. Divisional inspection for the Yorkshire division of mines. The conclusion he personally produced was that the engine driver accidentally put his level into the position for lowering scaffold while the <b>capstan</b> drums were held by the restraining pawls. It was his recommendation that pawls should not be used on worm driven <b>capstan</b> engines.|$|R
