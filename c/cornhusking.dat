40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study composites from <b>cornhusks</b> and chicken feathers, which are abundant, cheap, and provide an opportunity to replace non environmentally-friendly raw materials used to reinforce composites. Light-weight composites have been prepared from ground chicken quill (CGCQ) and polypropylene (PP), chicken feather fiber (FF) and high density polyethylene/polypropylene (HDPE/PP), chemically extracted <b>cornhusk</b> fibers (CHF) and PP, and split <b>cornhusk</b> (MSH) and PP web utilizing compression molding. Mechanical and sound absorption properties have been compared with jute-PP composites, which are currently being used as automotive interior composites. ^ The effect of holding temperature, time, thickness, concentration of reinforcing materials, fiber length, and chemical treatment on mechanical and sound absorption properties have been studied. Higher temperature and holding time lead to increased mechanical properties; however, too high temperature and long time lead to agglomeration of matrix polymer leading to substantial variation in properties. Mechanical and sound absorption properties initially increase and then decrease with increasing thickness and concentration. Increasing length leads to increasing mechanical properties; however, variation in properties increases. Enzyme treatment of CHF results in increased mechanical and sound absorption properties. ^ Optimized CGCQ-PP has similar flexural strength (FS) and offset yield load (OSY), lower modulus of elasticity (MOE), and lower tensile strength (TS) and tensile modulus (TM) compared with jute-PP. Noise reduction coefficient (NRC) of CGCQ-PP is 71 % higher than that of jute-PP. Mechanical properties of FF-HDPE/PP are inferior to jute and quill composites; however, sound absorption is 29 % better than jute and 25 % less compared with quill composites. CHF-PP has 33 % higher FS, 71 % lower MOE, 43 % higher TS, 54 % lower TM, and slightly higher NRC compared with jute-PP. MSH-PP preparation is a novel method, which allows utilization of materials of any shape and incorporation of technical materials inside the composites in a one-step continuous process. This method may open the door {{for a wide variety of}} agricultural byproducts in composites. Although the mechanical properties of MSH-PP are inferior to jute-PP, MSH-PP has 100 % better sound absorption. ...|$|R

40|$|Traditional doll-making has {{important}} meanings that translate into personal and communal identity. As {{one of the}} earliest discovered play artefacts, dolls are deeply intertwined with symbolic meanings around spirituality, rituals, familial histories and communal traditions. These values are especially important in Indigenous groups where health and well-being pivots on the preservation of cultural heritage. This article develops the theory on the well-being functions of doll-making through the exploration of three different practices in Indigenous cultures across the globe. We explore the Gomeroi Yarning dolls (Australia), Six Nations <b>Cornhusk</b> dolls (Canada) and Siyazama Zulu dolls (South Africa) to show that, through building the expression of local community-level identity, these dolls support Indigenous world-views around well-being. Specifically, the Gomeroi Yarning dolls encourage the sharing of oral personal narratives, the Six Nations <b>Cornhusk</b> dolls promote the transmission of cultural teachings, and the Siyazama Zulu dolls create community support networks through locally relevant HIV/AIDS awareness. As a result, local Indigenous communities are strengthened through the space that is created for a healing process, capacity building for problem-solving, and the reclaiming of Indigenous identity. All of these factors are important steps for moving forward from the silence, dealing with trauma and difficult situations, and thus transforming pain and grief through cross-cultural communication...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{cellulose}} fibers with properties {{similar to}} that of cotton and linen have been obtained from the byproducts of all the major food crops. Lignocellulosic agricultural byproducts are cheap and abundant sources that could be used as alternative sources for natural cellulose fibers. Finding alternative sources for fibers will be necessary in the near future due to the issues concerning the price and availability of the natural and synthetic fibers in current use. ^ Corn, rice, wheat, sorghum and soybeans are the major food crops of the world. Cultivation of these crops generates substantial amounts of byproducts that are of limited use at present. These lignocellulosic byproducts could be used to produce natural cellulose fibers for textiles, composite and other industrial applications. Using the byproducts for high value industrial applications will increase the value of these agricultural crops and reduce our dependence on natural and synthetic fibers by providing cheap and sustainable resource for the fibers. ^ For the first time <b>cornhusks,</b> cornstalks, rice straw, wheat straw, sorghum stalk and leaves and soybean straw have been used to produce natural cellulose fibers. Simple fiber extraction methods were developed to obtain fibers from these sources with properties similar to or better than those of natural cellulose fibers such as cotton and linen. The fibers obtained were studied for their composition, morphological and physical structure and properties. ^ This research shows that lignocellulosic agricultural byproducts can be used to produce natural cellulose fibers with properties suitable for textile, composite and other fibrous applications. Studies also show that the fibers are processable on the textile machinery and useful for various applications. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to obtain a fermentation substrate with a high content of cellulose and hemicellulose, as well as to decrease the cellulose cystalinity. Dried corn stover was crushed to pass 40 mesh, added by Ca(OH) and water, then heated at a certain time. The experimental design was prepared using a four-factor central composite design (CCD). The results of the chemical pretreatment were treated using hydrothermolysis methods for enhancing the lignin removal and decreasing cellulose crystalinity. The suitable process condition for chemical pretreatment was achieved at the loading of 0. 075 g Ca(OH) /g corn stover and 6. 25 ml water/g corn stover, temperature 74. 6 OC at 2 hours. After hydrothermolysis, cellulose and hemicellulose were dissolved at the percentages of 52. 40 % and 31. 84 % respectively, while the fraction of solid substrate had a composition of cellulose of 42. 68 % and hemicellulosa of 34. 68 %. The crystalinity of cellulose from the leaves, cobs, and <b>cornhusk</b> decreased significantly. The SEM results indicated that the surface of cell wall of corn stover had been perforated by these pretreatment processes. These pores might increase the enzymatic hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic corn stover. Tujuan penelitian adalah mendapatkan substrat fermentasi dengan kandungan selulosa dan hemiselulosa tinggi serta menurunkan kristalinitas komponen selulosa. Limbah tanaman jagung yang sudah kering dihancurkan hingga lolos 40 mesh, ditambah Ca(OH) dan air, kemudian dipanaskan pada suhu dan waktu tertentu. Rancangan percobaan disusun dengan menggunakan central composite design (CCD) dengan empat faktor. Hasil terbaik tahap ini diberi perlakuan hidrotermolisis untuk meningkatkan penyisihan komponen lignin dan menurunkan kristalinitas selulosa. Hasil pene­ litian menunjukkan bahwa kondisi proses terbaik adalah penambahan 0, 075 g Ca(OH) /g biomas dan 6, 25 ml air/g biomas, suhu pemanasan 74, 6 OC dengan waktu 2 jam. Setelah hidrotermolisis, 52, 40 % selulosa dan 31, 84 % hemise­lulosa terlarut ke dalam air, sedangkan substrat fraksi padat memiliki komposisi selulosa 42, 68 %, hemisellulosa 34, 68 %. Penurunan kristalinitas selulosa terjadi pada substrat dari daun, tongkol, dan kelobot. Hasil SEM mengindikasikanterbentuknya pori­pori pada substrat padat yang diharapkan dapat meningkatkan efektivitas hidrolisis enzimatik...|$|R
