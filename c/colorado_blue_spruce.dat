5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has won several awards. In 2007, {{the book}} was named one of The New York Times 100 Notable Books, {{and one of its}} Notable Children's Books. The novel was named the best book of 2007, by Newsweek critic Malcolm Jones. Publishers Weekly also listed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows among their Best Books of 2007. In 2008, the American Library Association named the novel one of its Best Books for Young Adults, and also listed it as a Notable Children's Book. Furthermore, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows {{received}} the 2008 <b>Colorado</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Spruce</b> Book Award.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there were}} also some more {{positive}} reviews of Eldest. Bookmarks magazine saw Eldests similarity to other works, but said that Eldest displayed more emotional depth than Eragon. Publishers Weekly also gave a positive review for Eldest, praising the revelations in the final pages. Barnes & Noble gave a positive review for Eldest, in particular for its style, characters and themes such as friendship, forgiveness, responsibility, and honor. Eldest won the 2006 Quill Award in Young Adult Literature. Eldest also {{was nominated for a}} British Book Award in the Children's Book of the Year section, the Disney Adventures Book Award, the <b>Colorado</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Spruce</b> Award, Young Adult Book Award, and the Wyoming Soaring Eagle Book Award.|$|E
5|$|Although Sidney was the {{architect}} of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, and both the 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the Troy and Boston Railroad on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional landscape design techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage. Boetcher brought in rare and foreign plants to help beautify the cemetery, including umbrella pines and <b>Colorado</b> <b>blue</b> <b>spruce.</b>|$|E
50|$|The yellow-headed spruce sawfly (Pikonema alaskensis Rohwer) {{is widely}} {{known in the}} {{northern}} United States and Canada as a destructive pest of spruce (Shenefelt and Benjamin 1955). It attacks white, black, Norway, and <b>Colorado</b> <b>blue</b> <b>spruces.</b> The larvae at first prefer new foliage, but after becoming about half-grown, old needles are included in their diet too. Young plantations become susceptible a few growing seasons after establishment.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} reflectance spectra {{for control}} and treated (surface wiped) current-year foliage of Douglas fir, and Sitka, <b>Colorado,</b> and <b>Blue</b> <b>spruce</b> (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb. ] Franco, Picea sitchensis [Bong. ] Carr., Picea pungens Engelm., and Picea pungens Engelm. var. hoopsii, respectively) {{were obtained from}} 220 to 700 nm. The green color of the control foliage of both Douglas fir and Sitka spruce was unaffected by the treatment whereas the blue-green and blue-white foliage of control <b>Colorado</b> and <b>Blue</b> <b>spruce,</b> respectively, became “green” {{as a result of}} the wiping. The relative reflectance curves for all green foliage, including the treated <b>Colorado</b> and <b>Blue</b> <b>spruce,</b> were all very similar with a peak in the green (540 - 560 nm), minima in the red (660 - 680 nm) and blue (450 - 500 nm), and very low reflectivities in the ultraviolet (λ < 400 nm). In contrast, the control foliage for <b>Colorado</b> and <b>Blue</b> <b>spruce</b> both showed a generally higher relative reflectance over most of the visible spectrum (400 - 700 nm) with a marked increase in the blue region (400 - 500 nm). At wavelengths below 420 nm, their relative reflectances increased sharply with decreasing wavelength, the reflectance at 220 nm for <b>Blue</b> <b>spruce</b> being over four times that at 540 nm...|$|R
40|$|Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) was {{purified}} from <b>blue</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea pungens Engelm.) and Engelmann spruce (P. engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.), and was digested {{with several}} restriction endonucleases. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were identified that differentiated both species. Intraspecific conservation of the RFLPs that distinguished each species {{was confirmed by}} examining eight trees from the natural range of <b>blue</b> <b>spruce</b> and six of Engelmann spruce. Four Engelmann <b>spruce</b> x <b>blue</b> <b>spruce</b> F, hybrids had cpDNA with the banding pattern of <b>blue</b> <b>spruce,</b> indicating paternal transmission of the chloroplast markers. These data were then {{used to assess the}} parentage of three naturally occurring putative hybrids. The presence of typical Engelmann spruce banding patterns indicates that Engelmann spruce was the pollen parent, yet interspecific crosses with <b>blue</b> <b>spruce</b> as the female parent are known to be incompatible. Thus, the cpDNA data suggest these trees are not F, hybrids...|$|R
500|$|Major {{themes in}} the novel are death {{and living in a}} {{corrupted}} society, and critics have compared them to Christian allegories. Generally well-received, the book won the 2008 <b>Colorado</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Spruce</b> Book Award, and the American Library Association named it a [...] "Best Book for Young Adults". A two-part film adaptation began showing in November 2010 when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 was released; Part 2 was released on 15 July 2011.|$|E
500|$|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban won several awards, {{including}} the 1999 Booklist Editors' Choice Award, the 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers, the 1999 FCGB Children's Book Award, the 1999 Whitbread Book of the Year for children's books., and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel,. It was also {{nominated for the}} 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel but lost to A Deepness in the Sky. Prisoner of Azkaban additionally won the 2004 Indian Paintbrush Book Award and the 2004 <b>Colorado</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Spruce</b> Young Adult Book Award. Additionally, it was named an American Library Association Notable Children's Book in 2000 {{as well as one}} of their Best Books for Young Adults. As with the previous two books in the series, Prisoner of Azkaban won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize Gold Medal for children aged 9–11 and made the top of the New York Times Best Seller list. In both cases, it was the last in the series to do so. However, in the latter case, a Children's Best Sellers list was created just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in July 2000 in order to free up more room on the original list. [...] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 24 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.|$|E
2500|$|On Saturday, October 27, 2012, a [...] <b>Colorado</b> <b>blue</b> <b>spruce</b> from Virginia {{was planted}} {{as the new}} National Christmas Tree. The Park Service decided to plant the tree even though Hurricane Sandy would pass near the D.C. area in less than 48 hours. Park Service horticulturists felt the tree was safer in the ground than in the {{container}} {{in which it was}} shipped. Wires were attached to the tree to help stabilize it, and a special base (hidden by mulch and soil) surrounded the roots to help prevent flooding.|$|E

Knowing the tree was at risk and would eventually need to be replaced, a successor tree had already been selected. The new tree was planted on March 19, 2011. The new tree was a [...] tall <b>Colorado</b> <b>blue</b> <b>spruce</b> which was obtained from an unnamed tree nursery in New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|A 42-foot <b>Colorado</b> <b>blue</b> <b>spruce</b> {{from the}} Sunset Lake Nursey near Shickshinny, Pennsylvania, was {{donated by the}} National Arborist Association and planted in the Ellipse close to the Zero Milestone (just east of the central north-south axis of the White House). The tree arrived in the city via flatbed truck and was planted on October 11, 1973. The tree was badly damaged just before it was planted when it fell off the flatbed truck {{carrying}} it, an accident which had significant effects on the tree's lifespan. North of the tree, a bronze plaque was installed that read [...] "National Christmas Tree, Transplanted October 11, 1973, Christmas Pageant of Peace Committee." [...] Initially, the General Electric company, which had been donating the lighting for the tree for years, developed a [...] "cool lighting" [...] system to help protect the tree from the heat damage caused by standard Christmas tree lights. But this scheme was subsequently abandoned due {{to the need to}} conserve energy because of the 1973 oil crisis. Instead, eight colored floodlights {{at the base of the}} tree were used to illuminate the National Christmas Tree's decorations and its [...] high gold snowflake tree-topper (although the snowflake itself was lit from within). The spotlights did not illuminate the tree directly for fear of causing heat damage; instead, the light was reflected on the tree. To further conserve energy, the National Christmas Tree was lit not 24 hours a day but only from 5 P.M. to 10 P.M.|$|E
