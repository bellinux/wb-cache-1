5|$|Alarmed by the Georgian successes, Süleymanshah II, the resurgent Seljuqid {{sultan of}} Rûm, rallied his vassal emirs and marched against Georgia, but his camp was {{attacked}} and destroyed by David Soslan at the Battle of Basian in 1203 or 1204. The <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> Tamar {{describes how the}} army was assembled at the rock-hewn town of Vardzia before marching on to Basian and how the queen addressed the troops from the balcony of the church.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav {{retreated to}} Dorostolon, which the Byzantine armies besieged for sixty-five days. Cut off and surrounded, Sviatoslav came {{to terms with}} John and agreed to abandon the Balkans, renounce his claims to the {{southern}} Crimea, and return west of the Dnieper River. In return, the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus' with food and safe passage home. Sviatoslav and his men set sail and landed on Berezan Island {{at the mouth of}} the Dnieper, where they made camp for the winter. Several months later, their camp was devastated by famine, so that even a horse's head could not be bought for less than a half-grivna, reports the Kievan <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> the Primary Chronicle. While Sviatoslav's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus', it weakened the Bulgarian statehood and left it vulnerable to the attacks of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer four decades later.|$|E

5|$|In 1688, the Spanish sent {{three more}} expeditions, two by sea {{and one by}} land. The land expedition, led by Alonso De León, {{discovered}} Jean Gery, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including {{a woman who had}} been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish expedition, , wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the Pope, as Pope Alexander VI had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland colony {{was founded}} by Cecil Calvert in 1634. Like his father George Calvert, who had {{originated}} the efforts {{that led to the}} colony's charter, Cecil Calvert was Catholic at a time when England was dominated by the Anglican Church. The Calverts intended the colony as a haven for Catholics fleeing England and as a source of income for themselves and their descendants. Many of Maryland's first settlers were Catholic, including at least two Catholic priests, one of whom became the earliest <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> the colony's history. But whatever Calvert's intentions, Maryland was a colony of an Anglican nation. Its charter had been granted by an Anglican king and seems to have assumed that the Church of England would be its official church. Anglican and later Puritan newcomers quickly came to outnumber the early Catholic settlers. Thus, by 1649 when the law was passed, the colonial assembly was dominated by Protestants, and the law was in effect an act of Protestant tolerance for Catholics, rather than the reverse.|$|E
5|$|William {{wrote an}} account of the Lateran Council and a history of the Islamic states from the time of Muhammad. Neither work survives. He is famous today as the author of a history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. William {{composed}} his chronicle in excellent Latin for his time, with numerous quotations from classical literature. The chronicle is sometimes given the title Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum ("History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea") or Historia Ierosolimitana ("History of Jerusalem"), or the Historia for short. It was translated into French soon after his death, and thereafter into numerous other languages. Because it is the only source for the history of twelfth-century Jerusalem written by a native, historians have often assumed that William's statements could be taken at face value. However, more recent historians have shown that William's involvement in the kingdom's political disputes resulted in detectable biases in his account. Despite this, he is considered the greatest <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> the crusades, {{and one of the best}} authors of the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|William Thorne, the 14th century <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> the abbey, records 598 as {{the year}} of the foundation. The monastic {{buildings}} were most likely wooden in the manner of Saxon construction, so they could be quickly built. However, building a church of solid masonry, like the churches Augustine had known in Rome, took longer. The church was completed and consecrated in 613. Ca. 624 a short distance to the east, Eadbald, son and successor of Ethelbert, founded a second church, dedicated to Saint Mary which also buried Kentish royalty. The abbey became known as St Augustine's after the founder's death.|$|E

25|$|In the 6th century, {{when the}} Irish missionary Columba first sailed to Iona, he first {{arrived at the}} island of Hinba, which he later treated to {{as a place of}} contemplative retreat. The {{extensive}} early Christian sculptures and structures on Canna, and its traditional association with Iona, have made many consider it to be the otherwise unidentified Hinba. However, Adomnán (the <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> the life of Columba) noted that Brendan the Navigator stopped at Hinba while traveling from Ireland to Iona; Canna is a most unlikely landfall on such a journey as it is well beyond the destination.|$|E
25|$|The Earl of Pembroke, his retinue and Wilton {{embarked}} at Plymouth aboard a transport fleet which was unprepared for serious engagement. The Castilian chronicler Pero López de Ayala estimated that this fleet had 36 ships,whereas the <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> the French court estimated {{it to be}} 35. Jean Froissart, {{in one of his}} two descriptions of the battle, put the English force on 'perhaps' 14 ships. A fleet of 20 vessels is considered a creditable force. As most of them were small transports, Sir Philip Courtenay, the Admiral of the West, was detached to escort them with 3 ships with large tonnage and towers utilizable by archers.|$|E
25|$|Hauz Rani and Budayuni Gates, {{which were}} {{reportedly}} once prominent gates, are now traced in ruins. An interesting anecdote of {{history of the}} Budayuni gate, considered then as the principal gate of the city by Ibn Battuta (the <b>chronicler</b> <b>of</b> the period, mentions it as the main gate to the city), is that Allauddin Khalji had resolved to shun drinking of alcohol by emptying his wine caskets and breaking his rich Chinaware at this gate. The gate was also known for punishment meted out to the guilty. They were tortured and beheaded in public view at this gate. A strict watch was maintained at this gate to detect and prevent incursions by Mongolians.|$|E
