40|$|Present low {{interest}} rates environment brings about numerous economic effects. Insurance companies are also strongly affected, since traditional insurance products often provide guaranteed returns to policyholders. As guaranteed returns are related to market interest rates, {{the question about the}} optimality <b>of</b> currently applied <b>guaranteed</b> returns becomes increasingly compelling in the insurance sector. This paper examines optimality <b>of</b> <b>guaranteed</b> returns from a solvency aspect. With the applied theoretical approach it is possible to identify multiple optima, from which the "best" is defined as the efficient one. In this framework, some theoretical properties <b>of</b> optimal <b>guaranteed</b> returns are described and existence criteria for the efficient optimum are derived. The paper aims at contributing to the literature also by highlighting a price sensitivity related effect <b>of</b> the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>guaranteed</b> returns in the insurance sector...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We analyse {{contracts}} which pay out a <b>guaranteed</b> minimum rate <b>of</b> {{return and}} {{a fraction of}} a positive excess rate, which is specied {{on the basis of a}} benchmark portfolio. These contracts are closely related to unitlinked lifeinsurance/savings plan products and can be considered as alternatives to a direct investment in the underlying benchmark portfolio. The option embedded into the savings plan is in fact a power op-tion, and thus the specication of the " contract parameters is closely related to well known features of these nancial derivatives. The key issue, both in order to rigorously justify valuation by arbitrage arguments and to prevent the guarantees from becoming uncontrollable liabilities to the issuer, is the risk management of the embedded options by a tractable and realistic hedging strategy. The long maturity of lifeinsurance prod-ucts makes it necessary to lift the Black/Scholes assumptions and consider an uncertain volatility scenario, thus explicitly taking into account risk". In this context, we show how to determine the contract parameters conservatively and implement robust risk management strategies.

40|$|We analyse {{contracts}} which pay out a <b>guaranteed</b> minimum rate <b>of</b> {{return and}} {{a fraction of}} a positive excess rate, which is specified {{on the basis of a}} benchmark portfolio. These contracts are closely related to life–insurance products and can be considered as alternatives to a direct investment in the underlying benchmark portfolio. In particular, the effects of modelling a roll–over savings plan along the lines of Miltersen and Persson (1998) are analysed where the participation in the excess return is given in an exponential form. We discuss some important features of this contract specification, which heretofore have not been considered in the literature. For one, the option embedded into the savings plan is in fact a power option with a payoff which is neither convex nor concave in the value of the underlying benchmark. The power of the embedded option is equal to the participation rate α in the excess return above the guarantee, and the strike depends on α as well as the minimum guaranteed rate g. Thus the specification of the “fair” contract parameters is closely related to well known features of power options. The long maturity of life–insurance products makes it necessary to lift the Black/Scholes assumptions and consider an uncertain volatility scenario. This gives rise to an interesting pricing and hedging problem. In particular, we show how to determine the contract parameters conservatively and implement robust risk management strategies.

40|$|Much of the {{extensive}} empirical literature on insurance markets has focused on whether adverse selection can be detected. Once detected, however, {{there has been little}} attempt to quantify its importance. We start by showing theoretically that the efficiency cost of adverse selection cannot be inferred from reduced form evidence of how "adversely selected" an insurance market appears to be. Instead, an explicit model <b>of</b> insurance contract <b>choice</b> is required. We develop and estimate such a model {{in the context of the}} U. K. annuity market. The model allows for private information about risk type (mortality) as well as heterogeneity in preferences over different contract options. We focus on the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> length <b>of</b> <b>guarantee</b> among individuals who are required to buy annuities. The results suggest that asymmetric information along the guarantee margin reduces welfare relative to a first-best, symmetric information benchmark by about £ 127 million per year, or about 2 percent of annual premiums. We also find that government mandates, the canonical solution to adverse selection problems, do not necessarily improve on the asymmetric information equilibrium. Depending on the contract mandated, mandates could reduce welfare by as much as £ 107 million annually, or increase it by as much as £ 127 million. Since determining which mandates would be welfare improving is empirically difficult, our findings suggest that achieving welfare gains through mandatory social insurance may be harder in practice than simple theory may suggest. ...|$|R

The present paper aims at discussing meanings attributed to the occurrence of a psychotic crisis in society, based on possible repercussions of that crisis {{in the lives of}} the patient and his family, as well as on relations that they begin to develop with mental health institutions. Instead of seeking the discourse of greater legitimacy, among the discourse of specialist, the patient or his family, about the psychotic sickening process, it is necessary to identify the different modes of interpretation about its nature and therapeutic itinerary made by the people directly involved. Since health and sickness are constituted from their interrelations, it is necessary to evaluate the symptoms associated to the problematization of the meanings attributed by the patient and his family to the crisis and to the treatment.

Two of IGA'a major challenge are the assembly of patches (Constructive Solid Geometry geometries made of Boolean primitives) and local refinement. In the present work we apply the Additive Schwarz Domain Decomposition on overlapping domains. To leverage the power of IGA we consider non matching meshes to solve PDEs on CSG assemblies. As a side effect also we deal with local refinement. As a first step we study a collection of simple two domains problems, using the software package GeoPDEs, all of them converged rapidly, even on very distorted domains. For local refinement we implement a Chimera type of zooming together with ASDDM iterations, and here again we get very attractive results. A last effect is that the additive methods are naturally parallelizable and thus can extend to large 3 D problems. We give some examples of computations on multi-patch bodies.
