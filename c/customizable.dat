Up to eight players {{can play in}} a game {{with a variety of}} modes to choose from, with AI filling spots at the server host's choice. GameSpy Technologies had hosted matchmaking and other servers for multiplayer games played online through their dedicated server until December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Adventures of Mana is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} the player controls a young hero who, along with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The game is a 3D remake of the two-dimensional Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, containing the same content. In the smartphone versions of the game, the player controls the hero by using a <b>customizable</b> virtual joystick and button set.|$|E

5|$|The QuickWindow case {{accessory}} for the G2 {{was unveiled}} on 30 July 2013—prior to {{the unveiling of}} the phone itself. The QuickWindow case consists of a plastic shell with a polyurethane flip cover. The cover contains a rounded rectangular window that exposes {{a portion of the}} display, allowing a number of functions to be accessed without opening the cover, including notifications, a <b>customizable</b> clock, and a music player.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{features}} a multiplayer mode for one-on-one tactical battles. Players spend a predefined points budget on assembling a squad of up to six humans, aliens, or a mixture of both. Human units are <b>customizable</b> in terms of weaponry, armor and gadgets. A simplified version of the single-player perk system is also present. Alien units may not be customized but possess the abilities of corresponding aliens types in the single-player mode of the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{overarching}} story {{follows the}} protagonist, a <b>customizable</b> Avatar {{created by the}} player, as they are unwillingly drawn into a war between the Kingdoms of Hoshido (their birthplace) and Nohr (their adopted home), and must choose which side to support. In Revelation, the Avatar rallies both sides against the true mastermind behind the war. The gameplay, which revolves around tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield, shares many mechanics with previous Fire Emblem games, although some elements are unique to each scenario.|$|E
5|$|Tim Schafer, the game's {{creative}} director, {{was inspired}} to create the game by his own past musical experiences. The game features the character of Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled after Jack Black, a roadie who is transported to a fantasy world inspired by the artwork of heavy metal album covers. Eddie becomes the world's savior, leading the down-trodden humans against a range of supernatural overlords using a battle axe, his Flying V guitar that can tap into the magical powers of the world, and a <b>customizable</b> hot rod.|$|E
5|$|Videoball {{rules are}} fully <b>customizable.</b> Players choose from several color schemes, field layouts and patterns, {{and number of}} balls in play. They can also choose the time limit and allow for special scoring, in which special shots count as more than one point. The game is visualized in all solid, bright colors and basic shapes, and {{features}} voiceover announcers. Games last an average of four minutes, though they can last several times more.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics Advance {{uses the}} {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics, but introduced certain {{changes such as}} a <b>customizable</b> map for the world of Ivalice. While built for the Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy Tactics Advances graphics are vibrantly colored and extensively detailed, and though environments and characters are wholly sprite-based, facial expressions are easily identifiable and many motion frames {{have been given to}} create a smooth animation. The game also introduced an option to switch between three display modes. Two of the modes are optimized for gameplay on Game Boy Advance and the new Game Boy Advance SP respectively, and there's also a TV mode for better color display while playing this game into a television screen by using a Game Boy Player which, must be attached to a Game Cube for this to work.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem is a {{tactical}} role-playing game which puts {{players in the}} role of a <b>customizable</b> Avatar: their gender, appearance, character class and statistics can be tailored by the player. Missions are split between story-based chapters and optional side chapters: side chapters give access to new playable characters outside the main narrative. Players can save at any time during battles, with the game opening offering a save {{at the end of each}} chapter. Outside battles, the player can visit towns to buy supplies and items such as weapons. Characters recruited by the player can also engage in support conversations accessed through the battle menu: these raise a character's support rank and grant boons during battle. How characters connect through supports is documented using a relationship chart.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{was given a}} <b>customizable</b> ship named the Nemesis, {{commanded}} by Sterling and his crew. The player's choices in the game would determine the crew they could hire, which in turn affected the ship's attributes. The vessel {{could be used to}} explore the Caribbean Sea and battle other crafts. During combat, the player could maneuver the ship, fire the cannons, or board the enemy vessel for hand-to-hand combat. If the enemy craft was boarded and the enemy crew was eliminated, the player received more loot than if it was destroyed. Loot salvaged in these battles could be sold in markets.|$|E
5|$|The HTC Dream (also {{known as}} the T-Mobile G1 in the United States of America and parts of Europe, and as the Era G1 in Poland) is a {{smartphone}} developed by HTC. First released in September 2008, the Dream was the first commercially released device to use the Linux-based Android operating system, which was purchased and further developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance to create an open competitor to other major smartphone platforms of the time, such as Symbian operating system, BlackBerry OS, and iOS. The operating system offers a <b>customizable</b> graphical user interface, integration with Google services such as Gmail, a notification system that shows a list of recent messages pushed from apps, and Android Market for downloading additional apps.|$|E
5|$|The Story Mode, {{reveals the}} game's plot through battles {{interleaved}} with conversations between the player character and its enemies. It {{vary depending on}} the player's choice and performance in the battles; there is a total of 60 possible endings. The Training Mode allows the player to learn attacks by fighting a <b>customizable</b> CPU enemy. Two players can play in the Versus 2P, and on the Versus CPU the player fight against an AI-controlled character. In addition to those modes, there is a gallery with artworks, character endings, and cut scenes that are unlocked by playing Arcade, Mission and Story Mode.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully <b>customizable</b> fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD {{displays}} video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by <b>customizable</b> attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not have been possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a <b>customizable</b> interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E
5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly <b>customizable</b> and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' video memory and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
5|$|Downloadable content (DLC) for {{the game}} was {{released}} following its launch. The game's Season Pass includes access to all DLC, {{as well as some}} additional abilities, and the documentary Grounded: Making The Last of Us; the documentary was released online in February 2014. Two DLC packs were included with some of the game's special editions and were available upon release. The Sights and Sounds Pack included the soundtrack, a dynamic theme for the PlayStation 3 home screen, and two avatars. The Survival Pack featured bonus skins for the player following the completion of the campaign, and in-game money, as well as bonus experience points and early access to <b>customizable</b> items {{for the game}}'s multiplayer. Abandoned Territories Map Pack, released on October 15, 2013, added four new multiplayer maps, based on locations in the game's story. Nightmare Bundle, released on November 5, 2013, added a collection of ten head items, nine of which are available to purchase separately.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the series, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U are {{non-traditional}} fighting games where players use different attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. The games are crossover titles that feature characters, items, music, and stages from various Nintendo franchises, including Mario, Donkey Kong, Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Kirby, Metroid, Star Fox, The Legend of Zelda, Kid Icarus, and Animal Crossing among others, as well as from several third-party franchises, including Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog and Bayonetta, Capcom's Mega Man and Street Fighter, Bandai Namco's Pac-Man, and Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII. New features include having up to eight players fighting at a time on the Wii U version, support for Nintendo's line of Amiibo, using custom Miis as playable fighters, post-release downloadable content including additional fighters and stages, and <b>customizable</b> special moves unlockable for every non-DLC character. Some features from previous games in the series were removed, such as the story mode in Brawl.|$|E
5|$|Players are {{penalized for}} using certain vampiric {{abilities}} {{in front of}} witnesses; exposing their existence loses masquerade points, although additional masquerade points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the masquerade five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has humanity points, representing the vampire's humanity. Some actions cost humanity points; a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on a killing spree, when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be triggered by {{a large amount of}} damage. Like masquerade points, losing all humanity points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast. Some areas, known as Elysium, prevent the use of Disciplines or weapons. Players can recruit a female ghoul, Heather, as a <b>customizable</b> servant who gives them blood, gifts, and money.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{types are}} the deathmatch (and its team-based variant) in which players score points by killing other players' characters; and capture the flag, in which teams attempt to {{penetrate}} the opposing base, capture a flag {{and return it to}} their own base whilst preventing the other team from doing the same. Other game modes may involve attempting to capture enemy bases or areas of the map, attempting to take hold of an object {{for as long as possible}} while evading other players, or deathmatch variations involving limited lives or in which players fight over a particularly potent power-up. These match types may also be <b>customizable,</b> allowing the players to vary weapons, health and power-ups found on the map, as well as victory criteria. Games may allow players to choose between various classes, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, equipment and roles within a team.|$|E
5|$|Within certain conditions, {{characters}} {{can perform}} Special Moves, <b>customizable</b> powerful moves tied to Jobs: after a Special Move is performed, the entire party is granted buffs {{for a limited}} period. This period is represented with a specific tune that plays over normal battle music. Various elements {{can be added to}} Special Moves, such as granting elemental properties, launching status ailments at enemies, recovering HP and MP, and temporary status ailment immunity to the party. The customization of Special Moves is directly tied to the creation of specialist shops during the reconstruction of Norende. Experience points acquired {{at the end of a}} battle enable characters and their assigned Jobs to level up, unlocking new abilities and boosting character stats such as available HP and MP. Bonuses are gained if the party fulfilled certain conditions. Job abilities and levels can also be borrowed from online friends, in a feature called Abilink. Any Job can be borrowed from available players regardless of their current level.|$|E
5|$|The battle system, {{called the}} Style-Change Active Time Battle system, uses {{elements}} from the Active Time Battle (ATB)-based Paradigm {{system from the}} first and second XIII games and bears similarities to the dressphere system featured in Final Fantasy X-2. Lightning has access to several <b>customizable</b> outfits (garb) with different power sets (plural: Schemata; singular: Schema). Each garb has its own separate ATB gauge, and actions for them are mapped onto the controller's face buttons, meaning that the usual menu-style ATB battle system is no longer needed: this enables Lightning to be moved around the battle field to a limited degree. The majority of the garbs and their accessories are either purchasable in the in-game shops or received upon completing quests. Stronger garbs, items, shields and weapons are unlocked in Hard Mode, along with access to more challenging areas and boss battles. Lightning can equip three Schemata directly, while having additional slots for backup costumes which can be equipped outside battle. She can be equipped with a close-combat weapon (sword, spear, etc.), a shield and a cosmetic accessory. The color scheme of each garb can be customized using both pre-set and custom color: there are options to alter both specific portions and all portions of the costume.|$|E
25|$|Production {{and tools}} layer: generates content {{production}} tools, game development middleware, <b>customizable</b> game engines, and production management tools.|$|E
25|$|The {{status bar}} is fully <b>customizable.</b> Users can right click the status bar and add or remove {{what they want}} the status bar to display.|$|E
25|$|The Quick Access toolbar (by default) sits in {{the title}} bar {{and serves as a}} {{repository}} of most used functions, such as save, undo/redo and print. It is <b>customizable,</b> although this feature is limited, compared to toolbars in previous Office versions. Any command available in the entire Office application can be added to the Quick Access toolbar, including commands not available on the ribbon as well as macros. Keyboard shortcuts for any of the commands on the toolbar are also fully <b>customizable,</b> similar to previous Office versions.|$|E
25|$|Booster packs {{allowed for}} the player to enjoy and {{experience}} very <b>customizable</b> PvE gameplay. The Defense of Crete booster pack was the first booster pack to be released for Age of Empires Online.|$|E
25|$|Generation 2: (2GB, 4GB, 8GB) Stretched {{rectangle}} with rounded edges. 2.2", Active Matrix OLED Display, <b>customizable</b> with themes, FM {{and voice}} recording, UMS(MSC) - MTP compatible (interchangeable), cradle available for extra functionality.|$|E
25|$|HSL and HSV are {{sometimes}} {{used to define}} gradients for data visualization, as in maps or medical images. For example, the popular GIS program ArcGIS historically applied <b>customizable</b> HSV-based gradients to numerical geographical data.|$|E
25|$|The {{open and}} <b>customizable</b> nature of Android allows device makers {{to use it}} on other {{electronics}} as well, including laptops and netbooks, smartbooks, cameras, headphones, home automation systems, game consoles, mirrors, media players, and landline telephones.|$|E
25|$|A {{self-described}} underground culture collective {{known as}} Otaku Gang released a computer parody fighting game known as Harambe vs. Capcom, with Harambe {{being able to}} fight characters from Capcom's Street Fighter franchise. The game itself is a fullgame of M.U.G.E.N, a <b>customizable</b> fighting game.|$|E
25|$|FreeHand 8.0 {{sold for}} $399 in 1998. This version began {{integrating}} to the Web {{with the ability}} to export graphics directly to Macromedia Flash. <b>Customizable</b> toolbars and keyboard shortcuts were prominent features. Also Lens Fill and Transparency, Freeform tool, Graphic Hose, Emboss Effects, and a “Collect for Output” function for print.|$|E
