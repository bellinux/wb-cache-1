For equal stability, 10 times higher Li+ than Na+ concentrations were required, reflecting the 10 times lower binding affinity for Li+ than for Na+. In a recent structural model of c 11, the Na+ or Li+ binding ligands are located on neighboring c-subunits, which thus become crossbridged by the binding of either alkali ion with a concomitant increase in the stability of the ring.

A series of experiments from our own laboratory is then described, in which 2 H and 13 C have been used to investigate the stereochemistry of cyclization to form C 40 and C 50 - and i-ring carotenoids. Novel procedures involving 2 H labelling from 2 H 20 have been used to demonstrate carotenoid transformations during biosynthesis and chloroplast development and to define the stereochemistry of the H attack at C- 2 which initiates carotenoid cyclization. Procedures by which microorganisms are allowed to metabolize ['HI-glucose, in 2 H 20, or [13 C 6]-glucose to make endogenous specifically labelled substrates are described. These methods allow the carotenoid C-I methyl substituents to be distinguished even when incorporation of exogenous labelled substrates is not possible, and have been used to show that the stereochemistry of cyclization to form the p- and <b>C-rings</b> of the C 40 carotenoids zeaxanthin and lutein is the same...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{analysis revealed}} that transcription of the Bacillus subtilis yetM gene encoding a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent monooxygenase was triggered by certain flavonoids during culture and was derepressed by disruption of the yetL gene in the opposite orientation situated immediately upstream of yetM, which encodes a putative MarR family transcriptional regulator. In vitro analyses, including DNase I footprinting and gel retardation analysis, indicated that YetL binds specifically to corresponding single sites in the divergent yetL and yetM promoter regions, with higher affinity to the yetM region; the former region overlaps the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of yetL, and the latter region contains a perfect 18 -bp palindromic sequence (TAGTTAGGCGCCTAACTA). In vitro gel retardation and in vivo lacZ fusion analyses indicated that some flavonoids (kaempferol, apigenin, and luteolin) effectively inhibit YetL binding to the yetM cis sequence, but quercetin, galangin, and chrysin do not inhibit this binding, implying that the 4 -hydroxyl group on the B-ring of the flavone structure is indispensable for this inhibition and that the coexistence of the 3 -hydroxyl groups on the B- and <b>C-rings</b> does not allow antagonism of YetL...|$|R
40|$|Phytochrome B (PhyB), one of {{the major}} photosensory {{chromoproteins}} in plants, mediates a variety of light-responsive developmental processes in a photoreversible manner. To analyze the structural requirements of the chromophore for the spectral properties of PhyB, we have designed and chemically synthesized 20 analogs of the linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) chromophore and reconstituted them with PhyB apoprotein (PHYB). The A-ring acts mainly as the anchor for ligation to PHYB, because the modification of the side chains at the C 2 and C 3 positions did not significantly influence the formation or difference spectra of adducts. In contrast, the side chains of the B- and <b>C-rings</b> are crucial to position the chromophore properly in the chromophore pocket of PHYB and for photoreversible spectral changes. The side-chain structure of the D-ring is required for the photoreversible spectral change of the adducts. When methyl and ethyl groups at the C 17 and C 18 positions are replaced with an n-propyl, n-pentyl, or n-octyl group, respectively, the photoreversible spectral change of the adducts depends on the length of the side chains. From these studies, we conclude that each pyrrole ring of the linear tetrapyrrole chromophore plays a different role in chromophore assembly and the photochromic properties of PhyB...|$|R

Secondary efficacy endpoints were a significant improvement of visual acuity/light perception and/or object recognition (clinicaltrials. gov, NCT 01024803). During up to 12 months observation time twenty-one participants (72 %) reached the primary endpoints, of which thirteen participants (45 %) reported restoration of visual function which they use in daily life. Additionally, detection, localization, and identification of objects were significantly better with the implant power switched on in the first 3 months.

40|$|The sodium ion-translocating F 1 F 0 ATP synthase {{from the}} {{bacterium}} Ilyobacter tartaricus contains a remarkably stable rotor ring composed of 11 c subunits. The rotor ring was isolated, crystallised in two dimensions and analysed by electron cryo-microscopy. Here, we present an a-carbon {{model of the}} c-subunit ring. Each monomeric c subunit of 89 amino acid residues folds into a helical hairpin consisting of two membrane-spanning helices and a cytoplasmic loop. The 11 N-terminal helices are closely spaced within an inner ring surrounding a cavity of, 17 A ̊ (1. 7 nm). The tight helix packing leaves no space for side-chains and is accounted for by a highly conserved motif of four glycine residues in the inner, N-terminal helix. Each inner helix is connected by a clearly visible loop to an outer C-terminal helix. The outer helix has a kink near {{the position of the}} ion-binding site residue Glu 65 in the centre of the membrane and another kink near the C terminus.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in the journal Circuit World and the definitive published version is available at [URL] This paper presents the results of a 32 year old laboratory study of whisker growth from tin electrodeposits that was originally undertaken to gain an increased understanding of the phenomenon of tin whisker growth. Design/methodology/approach: Whisker growth was evaluated using electroplated <b>C-rings</b> (both stressed and un-stressed) that were stored throughout in a desiccator at room temperature. Analysis has recently been undertaken to evaluate whisker growth and intermetallic growth after 32 years storage. SEM analysis has been performed to investigate whisker length and, using polished cross-sections, the morphology, thickness and type of intermetallic formation. Findings: Normal tin plated deposits on brass and steel with a copper barrier layer nucleated whiskers within 5 months and in each case these grew to lengths between 1 and 4. 5 mm. For normal tin electroplated onto brass, a one or two month nucleation period was needed before whiskers developed. They reached a maximum length of about 1. 5 mm after 6 months and little or no further growth occurred during the subsequent 32 years. Very few whiskers grew on the tin-plated steel samples and no intermetallic formation was observed. None of the fused tin-platings nucleated whiskers during the 32 year period. Practical implications: Knowledge about vintage whiskers is important in order that we can take steps to increase the resiliency of our space missions. Similarly, such knowledge is important to engineers engaged on products reaching their nominal end-of-life, but where for reasons of economy, these products cannot be replaced Originality/value: This study represents a unique insight into whisker growth and intermetallic formation over an extremely long time period...|$|R

Activity assay of the catalysts showed that the carbon nanotubes-supported Rh-phosphine complex catalysts displayed not only high activity of propene conversion but also excellent regioselectivity to the product butylaldehyde.

The characterization by using TEM, HRTEM, XRD, Raman, XPS, BET and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) methods indicated that the carbon nanofibers prepared were quite even nanotubes with the outer diameters at 15 - 20 nm and the inner diameters (i. e., pore diameters) at similar to 3 nm. Each tube wall was constructed of many layers of carbon with graphite-like platelets in a cross-section orientation of 'parallel type' or 'fishbone type'; their C (1 s) electron binding energy was about 0. 5 eV {{lower than that of}} graphite.
