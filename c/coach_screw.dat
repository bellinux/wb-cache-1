40|$|Notched {{connections}} are extensively used in timber-concrete (TC) composite beams and floors. Their main advantage is {{a significantly higher}} shear strength and stiffness compared to mechanical fasteners. Several mechanical and geometrical aspects, however, should be properly taken into account for design optimization of notched connections, as they strongly affect their structural performance and the corresponding failure mechanisms. In this paper, a preliminary Finite-Element (FE) numerical investigation is carried out by means of full 3 D numerical models. The mechanical behaviour of each connection component (e. g. the reinforced concrete topping, the steel <b>coach</b> <b>screw,</b> the timber beam) is properly implemented. Shear or crushing failure mechanisms in the concrete, possible plasticization of the <b>coach</b> <b>screw,</b> as well as longitudinal shear or tension {{perpendicular to the grain}} failure mechanisms in the timber beam are taken into account using cohesive elements, damage material constitutive laws and appropriate surface-tosurface interactions. The results of parametric FE studies are compared to experimental data derived from literature, {{as well as to the}} results of simplified analytical models, demonstrating that the FE model is capable to capture the experimental behaviour of the connection including the failure mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Notched {{connections}} are extensively used in timber–concrete (TC) composite beams and floors {{due to their}} typically high shear strength and stiffness. Several variables can affect their overall structural performance and failure mechanism, and their structural optimisation still represents an open issue. This paper presents an exploratory finite element (FE) numerical investigation carried out through advanced three-dimensional (3 D) models, where a key role is assigned to several mechanical features. The typical non-linear behaviour of each component (the reinforced concrete topping, the steel <b>coach</b> <b>screw,</b> the timber beam) is implemented. Shear or crushing failure mechanisms in the concrete and possible yielding of the <b>coach</b> <b>screw</b> as well as failure mechanisms in the timber beam due to longitudinal shear or tension {{perpendicular to the grain}} can be taken into account via cohesive elements, material damage and surface-to-surface contact interactions. Based on a parametric study of TC connections with different geometrical properties, the FE results are compared with past short-term push-out experimental data taken from literature as well as with predictions of simplified analytical models available in literature. It is shown that the FE model is capable of capturing the behaviour of the notched connections, including the collapse load and the failure mechanisms...|$|E

Push-out tests on four different types of STC lap joints connected by <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> (with and without a reinforcing nail plate), high-strength bolts and a combination of glued and screwed joints are reported, and the load-slip behaviour and failure modes of the connections are characterised.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{outcomes}} of an extensive research project on timber-concrete composite (TCC) floors at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. Two phases of the entire programme are described (1) push-out tests on different notched connection systems and (2) first month monitoring of TCC floor beams after construction. A semi-prefabricated TCC floor system that is economical, practical and easy to construct is proposed. An analytical model for strength evaluation of a typical notched connection reinforced with <b>coach</b> <b>screw</b> is presented. Four best connection details were selected and used to design and construct TCC beams for application in medium to long-span office floors. The composite beams are being and will be tested under short- and long-term loading. The experimental results of the first month monitoring of beams after construction are reported and compared with a uniaxial finite element model which was specially developed for long-term and collapse analysis of TCC beams.

40|$|The notched {{connection}} for timber-concrete composite beams is obtained by cutting a notch from the timber beam and {{filling it with}} concrete during the pouring of the concrete slab. This type of connection {{has the advantage of}} high stiffness and strength compared to mechanical fasteners. The paper presents the outcomes of a parametric study of fourteen variations of notched connections which were loaded to failure under shear in push-out specimens. Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) was used for the timber part. Stiffness and strength values obtained from the different connection variations were compared to each other in order to identify the best types. Rectangular and triangular notches reinforced with a <b>coach</b> <b>screw</b> were found to perform satisfactorily. An alternative connection system with punched metal plates was also found to perform well, with the additional benefit of ease of construction. The experimental results were compared with numerical results carried out using a 3 D finite element model implemented in ANSYS software package.

The now standard large softwood sleepers were used throughout along with high quality <b>coach</b> <b>screws,</b> plates and hundreds of tonnes of new granite ballast. The track height was significantly raised in places to give a reasonable depth of ballast under the sleepers, with the sub formation improved and even completely rebuilt in some locations.|$|R
50|$|Many screws use a {{screwdriver}} head fitting, {{rather than an}} external wrench. Screwdrivers are applied in-line with the fastener, {{rather than from the}} side.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{outcomes}} of short-term collapse tests performed on eleven LVL (laminated veneer lumber) -concrete composite floor T-beams. Different variables such as span length (8 and 10 m), connection and concrete type, and design level (well- and under-designed, in terms of connector numbers) were investigated. During the tests, mid-span deflection, connection slips and strains were measured. Connection types investigated include triangular and rectangular (150 mm and 300 mm long) notches cut in the timber and reinforced with a <b>coach</b> <b>screw,</b> and modified toothed metal plates pressed {{on the edge of}} the LVL joists. All of the beam specimens were designed using the effective bending stiffness or γ-method, in accordance with Annex B of Eurocode 5. All well-designed beams provided more than 95 % composite action even though there were relatively few connectors (e. g. six 300 mm long notches on the 8 m span beam). The beams with 300 mm rectangular notched connection exhibited the best performance, with high stiffness and strength beyond the ultimate limit state load level and, requiring fewer connectors along the beam. The triangular notch was found to be a viable alternative, with more connectors but easier and faster to cut than a rectangular notch. Metal plate connectors provide a practical construction possibility, but the beam stiffness was found to rapidly deteriorate beyond the ultimate limit state load level...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of timber-concrete composite beams with mechanical shear connectors. The {{analysis of these}} structures is complex due to the discontinuity caused by slip at the interface between the timber and concrete and can only be achieved {{by the use of}} sophisticated analytical techniques. A literature review has been carried out highlighting the fact that only a limited amount of theoretical and experimental work exists on timber- concrete composite beams. The fundamental objectives of this study were to develop suitable analytical and experimental models so as to better understand the behaviour of these structures. Fifty seven push-out specimens and seven beams were tested {{in order to determine the}} load/slip characteristics of the <b>coach</b> <b>screw</b> connectors and how these influence the behaviour of the beams. It was found that the bond and friction at the timber-concrete interface had a significant effect on the behaviour of the joints and beams. Analyses were carried out using a fully non-linear finite element package, LUSAS. The finite element model developed consisted of standard two dimensional elements and the results from the beam tests were used in a validation exercise. In general, good agreement was obtained for the stiffness of the beams throughout their loading history. Studies were carried out using the analytical model to determine the influence of the main parameters on the stiffness of the beams. The connector stiffness and timber properties were found to have a strong influence while the concrete properties were not significant at working load level. Further analytical studies were carried out for a wide range of geometric properties. The information obtained was used in the formulation of a design procedure which allowed for slip at the interface of the beams. Recommendations are included for future research on timber-concrete composite beams...|$|E

All of the beam specimens were designed using the effective bending stiffness or gamma -method, in accordance with Annex B of Eurocode 5. The same method was used for an analytical-experimental comparison of the beam's performance at ultimate (ULS) and serviceability (SLS) limit state. All well-designed beams provided more than 95 % composite action even though there were relatively few connectors (e. g. six 300 mm long notches on the 8 m span beam). The ULS and SLS live load capacity of the beams was found to be approximately 90 % of that of a fully composite beam. Correction factors providing a 15 % increase for deflection and a 13 % reduction of the effective bending stiffness are proposed for calculations using the transformed section method for all well-designed beams, i. e. beams designed using the gamma -method according to Annex B of Eurocode 5. Although the gamma -method was found to be significantly underestimate the ULS strength, it provided an accurate prediction of the short-term deflection. In terms of the connection type, the 300 mm rectangular notches provided the best performance, with high stiffness and strength beyond the ULS load level, and requiring fewer connectors along the beam. The triangular notch was found to be a viable alternative, with more connectors but was easier and faster to cut than a rectangular notch. Metal plate connectors provide a practical construction possibility, but the beam stiffness was found to rapidly deteriorate beyond the ULS load level...|$|E

25|$|Splicing timber piles {{is still}} quite common {{and is the}} easiest of all the piling {{materials}} to splice.

The follower pile is then simply slotted into {{the other end of the}} tube and driving continues. The steel tube is simply there to ensure that the two pieces follow each other during driving.

40|$|In recent years, timber–concrete {{composite}} {{systems have}} become more widely used as a new construction technique for buildings and bridges. The main advantage is that the compressive strength of concrete is exploited {{through the use of}} composite action while timber beams are able to resist the tensile stresses. The level of composite action, which can be achieved by the system, is dependent on the type of shear connector used. There is a lack of knowledge, however, on the performance of these types of connections when subjected to cyclic loading, which is typical for bridges. Testing was performed in the Structures Laboratory of the University of Canterbury to analyse the fatigue behaviour of two types of timber–concrete connections via push-out specimens, and two beam specimens representing strips of composite floor with the same connection types. The two types of connection investigated were: (i) a rectangular notch connection reinforced with a <b>coach</b> <b>screw</b> (also known as lag screw); and (ii) a connection with toothed metal plates punched into laminated veneer lumber (LVL). The stiffness of the connection was monitored throughout the cyclic loading along with the total amount of slip occurring between the concrete and timber. After the application of 2 million cycles, the push-out and beam specimens were loaded to failure in order to quantify their maximum strength. The strength of the rectangular notched connection after cyclic loading was 0. 95 times of the one without cyclic loading, while for the metal plate connection was 0. 60 times. For the metal plate connection, a continuous increase in slip was observed with increased cycles possibly due to accumulated damage from repeated loading. The rectangular notch connection displayed more resistance to changes in slip, strength and stiffness than the metal plate connection. No obvious loss of stiffness was observed in the rectangular notch connected floor beams after 2 million cycles, and when tested to failure the stiffness was very similar to the same floor beam that had not been cyclically loaded. The floor beam with metal plate connections did not perform well and failed after 350, 000 cycles. The loss of strength, stiffness and composite action in this floor beam compared to the one without cyclic loading was significant. In this respect, the rectangular notch connection system is recommended for use in bridge design as opposed to metal plate connections...|$|E

In the proposed steeltimber composite (STC) system, bolt and <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> are employed to transfer shear between steel beam and prefabricated timber slab {{and provide a}} composite connection. A series of experimental push-out tests were carried out on cross-banded LVL-Steel and CLT-Steel hybrid specimens to investigate the behaviour of different connection types. Furthermore, the load-deflection response of full-scale STC beams was captured by conducting 4 -point bending tests on STC beams. The failure modes of connections and composite beams have been monitored and reported.

Surface notches in the LVL beam that are reinforced with <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> are shown to provide the greatest stiffness and strength, as well as favourable post-peak behaviour. The behaviour of full-scale concrete-LVL composite beams that were tested to failure is also described. The feasibility of using proprietary lightweight concrete panels for the slab, and using straight and draped prestressing tendons is also explored. The best cost-to-benefit ratio is shown to be provided by the plain composite structure where, again, the connection system is the most important aspect of providing good structural performance...|$|R
40|$|Timber-concrete {{composite}} (TCC) floor systems utilize {{composite action}} between a timber joist and a concrete topping {{to increase their}} span. Their overall structural performance is significantly influenced by the load-slip relationship, strength, stiffness and positions of the connectors providing the composite action. The relatively low elastic modulus of timber, however, may affect the dynamic (vibration) performance of medium to long-span TCC floors. Three broad areas are currently under investigation at the University of Canterbury: (1) {{the choice of the}} best type of connection: (2) the collapse behaviour under static (gravity) loads; and (3) the vibration susceptibility. This paper presents preliminary results of experimental tests used to characterise the connection systems as they are tested to failure under monotonic loads. Based on those outcomes, a semi-prefabricated composite floor system is proposed. The system is constructed from prefabricated panels made from timber joists and plywood sheets, and by a concrete slab cast-in-situ on top of the panels. Two different types of connection systems are shown to perform satisfactorily: notches cut from laminated veneer lumber (LVL) joists and reinforced with <b>coach</b> <b>screws,</b> and toothed metal plates pressed into LVL joists.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a novel semi-prefabricated LVL-concrete composite floor that has been developed in New Zealand. In this solution, the floor units made from LVL joists and plywood are prefabricated in the factory and transported to the building site. The units are then lifted onto the supports and connected to the main frames of the building and to the adjacent units. Finally, a concrete topping is poured on top of the units in order to form a continuous slab connecting all the units. Rectangular notches cut from the LVL joists and reinforced with <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> provide the composite action between the concrete slab and the LVL joists.

A design procedure based {{on the use of the}} effective flexural stiffness method, also known as the “gamma method” is proposed for the design of the composite floor at ultimate and serviceability limit states, in the short and long term. By comparison with the experimental results, it is shown that the proposed method leads to conservative design.

50|$|Early locomotive-powered {{railways}} {{had used}} short cast iron rails carried on stone blocks. A few were trying timber sleepers {{to support the}} rails and to maintain the gauge between them. These rails were brittle and broke easily, and they gave a rough ride due {{to the difficulty of}} maintaining a smooth line between the blocks or sleepers. Wrought iron rails were being manufactured but they were of poor quality due to the difficulty of cooling them evenly during manufacture. Brunel decided to use a continuously supported wrought iron rail, a bridge rail with a smaller rail section that cooled more evenly. This was an inverted-U section with wide flanges that could be bolted to the timber bearer, which was known as a 'longitudinal' baulk. The rail was usually kept off this by small wooden packing pieces that could be replaced when they were worn out by the passage of the trains, and therefore avoid the expense of replacing the heavier longitudinals. The rails were bolted to the longitudinals by long fang bolts or <b>coach</b> <b>screws,</b> and the rail joints were later supported by a base plate formed with a plug in the void of the inverted U shape rails so as to keep the rails in line with each other.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental campaign aimed to evaluate the performance of timber beams strengthened in bending using GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) plates mechanically attached with high-strength metal screws. Modest ratios of GFRP composite reinforcement can increase beam load-carrying capacity and manipulate failure mode from the brittle tensile in the unreinforced beams to a more extensible failure in the strengthened timber beams. Application of mechanical reinforcement presents a solution of reversibility, compatibility and durability for reinforced timber. The experimental campaign focused on load-deflection relationship and failure modes in order to increase the bending capacity and stiffness of the timber beam. Oak beams with dimensions 145 x 145 x 2450 mm were reinforced with un-bonded pultruded GFRP plates. Hexagon head <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> 16 mm diameter, 130 mm length, grade 8. 8, were used to mechanically attach the reinforcement along with 34 mm outer diameter fender washers, distributing the fastening load away from the screw’s position. All beams were tested until failure under the four-point bending configuration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reinforcement method and ability to reversibly repair the timber, representing a capability to be utilised in the new constructions or restoration of timber structures...|$|R
40|$|Connecting timber {{panels to}} steel girders using {{mechanical}} fasteners (e. g. screws and bolts) {{is an attractive}} and novel method for developing a fully prefabricated and sustainable hybrid steel-timber composite (STC) floor that can also facilitate future dismantling and recycling of the structural components. This study concerns the short-term behaviour of innovative STC floors comprising of cross-laminated timber (CLT) and/or laminated veneer lumber (LVL) panels connected to steel girders by various mechanical fasteners and/or glue. The mechanical characteristics of STC connections play {{an essential role in}} the safe and economical design of hybrid STC structures and floor systems. Accordingly, at the first stage of this research project, short-term behaviour of STC connections has been investigated. Push-out tests on different types of STC lap joints with <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> (with and without a reinforcing nail plate), high-strength bolts and a combination of glued and screwed connectors are reported, and the load-slip behaviour, stiffness, strength and failure modes of the STC connections are characterised. At the second stage, short term behaviour of STC system was investigated through four-point bending tests. The results of four-point bending tests performed on full-scale STC beams are reported and the structural behaviour (i. e. the load-deflection response, short-term stiffness, and peak load capacity and failure modes) of the proposed STC system are studied. At the last stage of the project, extensive non-linear 1 D and 2 D finite element (FE) analyses of STC beams are carried out and the numerical results are verified against the test results. It is shown that 1 D and 2 D FE models can adequately capture the structural response of the STC beams. Using the FE and experimental results, the composite efficiency of STC beams that can significantly influence their structural behaviour beams is determined. In addition, the mechanical behaviour of lap STC connections was investigated through using a nonlinear 3 D continuum-based FE model. In the FE models developed, the non-linear behaviour and failure of the timber is captured by a stress-based failure criterion formulated in the framework of continuum-damage mechanics. Yielding of the steel plates and fasteners (i. e. <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> and bolts) is captured by an elastic-hardening plastic constitutive law. These FE models are validated against experimental (push-out) tests conducted on LVL and Steel-CLT composite lap connections. It is shown that the FE models developed can adequately predict the load-slip response and failure mode of the hybrid steel-timber composite connections tested. The validated FE model is used to undertake a parametric study that elucidates the influence of the yield strength and the length of the fasteners and the post-tensioning force in the bolts on the stiffness, load carrying capacity and load-slip behaviour of hybrid steel-timber composite connections...|$|R

The tests {{have been conducted}} on two 5. 8 m span timber concrete composite beams (referred to as TCC beams here onwards) with two different connector types: Type 17 screws and four notches with <b>coach</b> <b>screws.</b> The materials used are laminated veneer lumber (LVL) for the beams and 32 -MPa concrete for the flanges. Three serviceability tests were conducted on the beams, two short-term (quasi-static loading) and one longterm (sustained loading) tests. The short-term tests were completed before the start and {{after the end of}} the long-term test. Both short-term tests aim to identify the initial and residual stiffness respectively. The ultimate strength of the specimens was also investigated in the course of the last test. During the long-term test (duration of approximately 500 days), the specimens were under a sustained load (1. 7 kPa) whilst the environmental conditions were cyclically alternated between normal and very humid conditions - A typical cycle duration was six to eight weeks. The temperature remained quasi constant (22 °C). The mid-span deflection, LVL-beam EMC and relative humidity of the air were continuously monitored during the test. This test aim to quantify the creep effect of the TCC beams. The paper starts with a brief literature review, continues with a presentation of the laboratory investigations and then {{presents a}} thorough discussion and analysis of the long-term and short-term investigations...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} the best floor {{solution}} {{has always been a}} key issue in the design and construction of multi-storey timber buildings. Strict performance requirements such as effective acoustic separation of inter-tenancy floors, thermal mass, fire resistance, limitation of deflection, resistance to vibrations and effective diaphragm action are very hard to comply with if only timber is used. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the preliminary and some ongoing research in the short- and long-term carried out mainly at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, for the realisation of a semi-prefabricated laminated veneer lumber (LVL) -concrete composite floor system in both the local and Australasian market. The paper discusses a novel semi-prefabricated LVLconcrete composite system where panels made from LVL joists and plywood flooring are prefabricated off-site. Once the panels are lifted onto the supports and connected side-by-side, a concrete topping is cast-in-situ so as to form a continuous slab connecting all the panels. Composite action between the concrete topping and the panels is achieved using different types of connectors, such as various forms of notches cut from the LVL joists and reinforced with <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> or toothed metal plates pressed in the LVL joists. After pointing out the advantages of the proposed system over traditional only-timber and only-concrete floor solutions, the paper describes push-out tests in the short-term on connections used in the LVL-concrete composite. Tests to failure of small LVL-concrete composite blocks (push-out tests) with different types and shapes of connection systems were performed at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia. The results are parametrically evaluated and discussed in detail. The failure mechanism of the notched connection is highlighted together with the strength and stiffness values for each tested connection system. Subsequently, the four best connection systems were identified and used in beam specimens of 8 - 10 m in span. The experimental program on the beams is presented briefly in order to provide information of the different phases of the project...|$|R

Michigan State tried a running play resulting in no gain. Facing third down, Michigan State likely could have easily spiked the ball to stop the clock. However, with the clock running, it was perceived by many fans and sports commentators that chaos reigned on the MSU sideline.

40|$|Concrete is {{the most}} widely used {{construction}} material in the world. This material causes formation and release of CO 2 and high energy consumption during manufacturing. One way to decrease concrete consumption negative consequences is to replace it with lower needed primary energy materials, like timber. The engineered wood products such as laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and cross laminated timber (CLT/X-lam) with improved structural characteristics, durability and fire resistance have made it possible for structural engineers to design and construct large multi-storey multi-bay buildings. Use of timber in structures is beneficial from both structural and environmental points of view. To name a few advantages, it has low carbon foot print, less energy consumption to be manufactured, less demand of work force, deconstruction capability, fast installation and low self-weight that ultimately lead to smaller size for structural component (e. g. beams and columns and foundation dimensions). In this paper, at first behaviour of Steel-Timber Composite (STC) simple 2 bay beam with prefabricated cross banded LVL slabs with <b>coach</b> <b>screws</b> (self-tapping screws are assumed to be utilised for transferring the interface shear between the steel girder and the prefabricated timber slab and providing a composite connection) is captured by a nonlinear finite element model and the results are compared with similar Steel-Concrete Composite (SCC) system. Concrete hybrid structures have slightly higher strength and stiffness in compare to timber hybrid structures; On the other hand, timber structures are lighter, less pollutant and green to the environment, have simpler and faster and cheaper fabrication process and can be dismantled to recycling its structural components. Moreover, in a 1 bay simple beam, effect of different parameters such as screw size, screw spacing, length of beam, timber slab and beam size on the load carrying capacity and composite efficiency of the STC system with LVL slab are evaluated. Results show that, screw spacing effect is more than screw size effect. In other words, in order to reach high strength and stiffness and appropriate composite action between slab and beam, also to avoid brittle failure, it is highly recommended to use many smaller diameters screws instead of few large diameters ones...|$|R
