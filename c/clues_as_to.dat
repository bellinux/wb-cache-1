5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much {{of what has been}} documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} Shaftesbury's disappearance, Detective Chief Superintendent Graham Cox, head of Sussex Police CID, who had been {{contacted}} by Lady Frances Ashley-Cooper, {{said that they were}} treating the matter as a murder case. The French police agreed with Cox, {{due to the lack of}} ransom demands or signs of fraud. Whether dead or alive, there were still no <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the whereabouts of the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury.|$|E
5|$|Within the sonnet, {{the speaker}} contemplates his {{inability}} to articulate his admiration for the Fair Youth, a fault he attributes to his jealousy of the Fair Youth's appearance in the poems of the speaker's Rival Poet. Sonnet 86 is notable within the Rival Poet subsection of sonnets because it allegedly provides important <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the historical identity of this Rival Poet. The sonnet is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, containing 14 lines of iambic pentameter and ending in a rhymed couplet.|$|E

5|$|Jeff first {{appears in}} Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is Elena's cameraman. He is voiced by Gregory Myhre. Jeff, along with Elena, went to Nepal {{to prove that}} Lazarevic was alive, running into Nate and Chloe. They then team up to find Shambala. after Nate and Chloe {{investigate}} a Temple with <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> where the location of Shambala is, they return to find Jeff injured by a bullet wound to the abdomen. Drake, escorted by Chloe and Elena, tries to carry Jeff to safety but they are caught and Lazarevic executes Jeff in front of Drake and Elena.|$|E
5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> what the player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} Dutch (Adam Baldwin), Romeo (Nolan North), and Mickey (Alan Tudyk) {{discussing}} the Covenant ship above New Mombasa, with the Rookie asleep nearby. Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes the Rookie {{and the team}} enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to miss the ship. The Covenant ship enters slipspace, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes into a building on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six hours. He awakens and proceeds to find <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> {{what happened to his}} squadmates.|$|E
5|$|With the 2005 {{discovery}} of a new chamber and the 2008 {{discovery of}} two further tomb entrances, the valley is known to contain 63 tombs and chambers (ranging in size from KV54, a simple pit, to KV5, a complex tomb with over 120 chambers). It was the principal burial place of the major royal figures of the Egyptian New Kingdom, {{as well as a}} number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with scenes from Egyptian mythology and give <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the beliefs and funerary rituals of the period. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the opulence and power of the Pharaohs.|$|E
5|$|In 1392, King Richard II of England {{created the}} first in a {{succession}} of Ireland kings of arms. It is unknown why such an office was called into being. Froissart notes the creation of Chandos le Roy d'Ireland, but does not give any <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the reasoning. It does, however, fit into the general English policy in Ireland at the time. Richard II sought to re-establish English control in those areas where the native Irish had reasserted their independence. The appointment {{can be seen as a}} necessary part of the preparations for the appointment of the Duke of Gloucester as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1392. Richard intended Gloucester to lead a major military campaign, and such a campaign would have necessitated the involvement of heralds to marshal arms and provide advice and evidence in case of heraldic disputes.|$|E
50|$|Although cillies {{were not}} {{actually}} cribs, the chit-chat in clear that Enigma operators indulged in amongst themselves, often gave a <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the cillies {{that they might}} generate.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Zvi Aharoni, {{one of the}} Mossad {{agents who}} had been {{involved}} in the Eichmann capture, was placed in charge of a team of agents tasked with locating Mengele and bringing him to trial in Israel. Inquiries in Paraguay gave no <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> his whereabouts, and they were unable to intercept any correspondence between Mengele and his wife Martha, then living in Italy. Agents following Rudel's movements did not produce any leads. Aharoni and his team followed Gerhard to a rural area near São Paulo, where they located a European man believed to be Mengele. Aharoni reported his findings to Harel, but the logistics of staging a capture, budgetary constraints, and the need to focus on the nation's deteriorating relationship with Egypt led the Mossad chief to call a halt to the operation in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} from which S.thiersii derives its carbon is the {{cellulose}} of the decomposing plant material found in its grassland habitat. The enzymes that degrade cellulose are homologous to the enzymes used by ectomycorrhizal fungi that have symbiotic associations with plant roots. In {{an attempt to}} identify the genes involved in these processes, researchers at the United States Department of Energy and University of Wisconsin are jointly working to sequence the S. thiersii genome and to compare it with that of Amanita bisporigera, a species which forms mycorrhizal relationships with tree and which has already been partly sequenced. They hope {{to better understand the}} genetic pathways involved in the evolution of ectomycorrhizal associations. Another research objective is to establish whether the enzymes used by S. thiersii to degrade cellulose can be cost-effectively used in the conversion of crop residues into biofuels. S.thiersii seems to be expanding its range northwards and its genome may provide <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how it is adapting to climate change and further information on mycorrhizal relationships.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{was known}} to the ancients, such as Galen, and various theories were proposed about {{its role in the}} body, but major <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when acromegaly due to pituitary tumors was described. The first known report of hypopituitarism was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had suffered severe puerperal fever eleven years earlier, and subsequently suffered amenorrhea, weakness, signs of rapid aging and anemia. The pituitary gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior pituitary. The eponym Simmonds' syndrome is used infrequently for acquired hypopituitarism, especially when cachexia (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of hypopituitarism were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of how common hypopituitarism could be in previous head injury victims.|$|E
25|$|A {{new study}} {{finds that the}} white blood cell levels in men {{decrease}} faster during aging than in women, possibly providing one <b>clue</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why women have longer average lifespans.|$|R

25|$|The {{study of}} light and the {{interaction}} {{of light and}} matter is termed optics. The observation and study of optical phenomena such as rainbows and the aurora borealis offer many <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the nature of light.|$|E
25|$|This {{strategy}} was chosen after Uchiyama {{and others on}} the design team spent time in the United States studying owners of earlier RX-7s and other sports cars popular in the American market. The Porsche 944 was selling particularly well at the time and provided <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> what sports-car enthusiasts might find compelling in future RX-7 styling and equipment.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{immediately}} installed {{monitoring equipment}} and analyzed the volcano for <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> its previous eruptive history. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal found in old volcanic deposits revealed {{the last three}} major explosive eruption periods in recent millennia, about 5500, 3500 and 500 years ago. Geological mapping showed {{that much of the}} surrounding plains were formed by lahar flood deposits from previous eruptions.|$|E
25|$|Beth Jarrett, 39. A {{homemaker}} who {{has long}} kept the Jarrett household neat and well-organized, {{to the point of}} being anal retentive. She plays golf and is very active in the community but does not work outside the home. The novel gives little detail of her personal background, although her still-living parents provide some <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how she might have become this way.|$|E
25|$|Like the UK version, {{the first}} two Australian seasons {{included}} a 'special episode' which revealed all the <b>clues</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> {{the identity of the}} Mole and how close each player had been to finding them. Unfortunately, it wasn't particularly popular with audiences and so, in subsequent seasons, it was replaced by a five-minute segment {{at the end of the}} final episode in which all of the clues were briefly revealed.|$|E
