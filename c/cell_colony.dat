We therefore examined the effects of G-CSF in combination with murine interleukin 3 on proliferation of murine blast cell colony-forming cells. The time course of total colony formation and multilineage colony formation by spleen cells harvested from mice 4 days after injection of 5 -fluorouracil at 150 mg/kg was significantly shortened in cultures containing both factors in contrast with cultures supported by either factor alone. Serial observations of individual multipotential blast <b>cell</b> <b>colonies</b> (mapping) revealed that blast <b>cell</b> <b>colonies</b> emerged at random time intervals in the presence of interleukin 3 or G-CSF.

5000|$|Kaushansky {{was born}} on October 20, 1953 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His father who “always {{wanted to be an}} American” {{migrated}} with the family to the United States, when Kaushansky was 2 years old. Kaushansky graduated from UCLA in 1975, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.S. in biochemistry. He stayed at UCLA to obtain his medical degree in 1979. It was here that he met his future wife Lauren who was also at the time enrolled as a student at UCLA. As he left to join the University of Washington in Seattle to complete his internship and residency, Lauren enrolled for a Master’s in Education at Antioch University in Seattle. Kaushansky was appointed Chief Resident at the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington in 1982.Describing himself as a “biochemist at heart”, Kaushansky fell in love with hematology during his second year of residency. Curious about blood diseases and disorders, he chose to focus on the field during his fellowship between 1982 and 1986 at the University of Washington. His decision to pursue hematology was also influenced by the persuasive arguments of Dr. Clement Finch, the then Chief of Hematology at the University of Washington, who said “there is no other discipline in medicine where we know more about the biochemistry of disease than in hematology”. In a Q&A session with the American Society of Hematology, Dr. Kaushansky recalled: [...] Following my clinical training in hematology, I entered the laboratory of Dr. John Adamson, who followed Clem as chief of the division. John suggested a project and a pathway: after acquiring the tools of blood <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> growth, that I should purify a colony-stimulating factor (CSF), a substance that stimulates the proliferation of blood cells in the bone marrow, by joining the laboratory of Dr. Earl Davie, then Chair of the Department of Biochemistry. In that dual mentoring setting, where protected time for junior faculty was the rule, I gained a great deal, and emerged with a purified blood cell growth factor (GM-CSF), skills in both protein purification (separating one type of protein out from components in the blood) and gene cloning, and “technical courage,” the term used by the Nobel laureate Dr. Joe Goldstein to depict the capacity to move one's science however it progresses. I also developed a strong appetite for the discovery of new knowledge and a passion to translate that new knowledge into the tools to help patients with hematologic disease. [...] During his time in Seattle, he was honored with the NIH Physician Scientist Award in 1984, given to promising physician-scientists early in their careers. He was also awarded the junior faculty award by the American Cancer Society and was elected a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians.|$|E
40|$|Counting {{cells and}} colonies is an {{integral}} part of high-throughput screens and quantitative cellular assays. Due to its subjective and time-intensive nature, manual counting has hindered the adoption of cellular assays such as tumor spheroid formation in high-throughput screens.

40|$|The {{growth of}} T {{lymphocyte}} colonies in agar {{is dependent on}} the cooperation of a number of different cell types and their products. Among these interacting cells are monocytes and/or macrophages. Monocytes are capable of producing both interleukin 1 (IL- 1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These two factors display a positive influence on T <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> formation. Recombinant IL- 1 and recombinant TNF were both shown to stimulate T <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> growth in a dose-dependent manner, and this stimulation could be blocked by prior incubation with anti-IL- 1 or anti-TNF, respectively. In addition, conditioned medium obtained from monocytes cultured in the presence of endotoxin also stimulated T <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> formation. This stimulation by monocyte-conditioned medium was partially suppressed by incubation with anti-TNF or anti-IL- 1, while incubation with both antibodies together displayed greater suppression. In conclusion, monocytes produce at least two factors, IL- 1 and TNF, which can stimulate T <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> formation by peripheral blood lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} TSK-type neural fuzzy network (TNFN) {{with a group}} interaction-based {{evolutionary}} algorithm (GIEA) for constructing the cancer <b>cell</b> <b>colonies</b> diagnosis system (CCCDS). The proposed GIEA is designed {{on the basis of}} symbiotic evolution which each chromosome in the population represents only partial solution. The whole solution consists of several chromosomes. The GIEA is different from the traditional symbiotic evolution. Each population in the GIEA is divided into several groups. Each group represents a set of the chromosomes that belongs to only one fuzzy rule. Moreover, in the GIEA, the interaction ability is considered that the chromosomes will interact with other groups to generate the better chromosomes by elites-base interaction crossover strategy (EICS). In the CCCDS, the EICS is used to train the CCCDS. After trained by the EICS, the CCCDS can diagnose the visible cancer <b>cell</b> <b>colonies</b> automatically.

This collective behavior was characterized by means of the Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi mathematical paving techniques combined with the computer-assisted microscope analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei. This methodology enabled growth to be characterized in terms of <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> size and density. In addition to this colony pattern characterization, the DNA ploidy level was assessed by means of DNA histogram typing. The cell proliferation level was also determined. Ten astrocytic and two medulloblastoma cell lines treated weekly with BCNU were analyzed. Study of the <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> architecture and cell proliferation revealed specific BCNU-induced modifications in connection with the origins of the cell lines, i. e. astrocytoma (AST), glioblastoma (GBM), or medulloblastoma (MED).

We have previously reported on the role of T cells and their subsets on B cell proliferation in that we did not observe suppression of B <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> growth by T cells. We now report on the role of B cells in limiting B cell proliferation. B cell colonies were grown in methyl cellulose for either 3 days or 5 - 6 days utilizing 2 x 10 (5) T cells irradiated with 9, 000 rads, and 2 x 10 (5) B cells. The B cells were then obtained from these colonies and increasing numbers of cells were added to fresh autologous B cells that were further cultured for 5 days to form new B cell colonies. At the end of this period, B <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> numbers were determined. Our data show that addition of CD 19 - and CD 20 - positive B cells recovered from mature colonies after 5 days to fresh B cells suppressed further B <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> growth in all cases tested, whereas addition of CD 19 -positive B cells recovered from immature colonies after 3 days of culture did not suppress further B <b>cell</b> <b>colony</b> growth.
