50|$|After the war Rabagliati {{became a}} member <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd's</b> <b>of</b> London, and in August 1920, as a {{representative}} of the White Cross Aviation Insurance Association, was appointed to Lloyd's Aviation Sub-Committee. In August 1929 he was a member of the British Aviation Insurance Group, authorized to issue Certificates of Airworthiness. In January 1930 he was appointed to Lloyd's Aviation Advisory Committee, as an underwriting member <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd's,</b> and <b>of</b> Messrs. Willis, Faber and Dumas.

50|$|The Lloyd's Agency Network was {{established}} in August 1811 by the then <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd's</b> <b>of</b> London.

40|$|Assignment {{messages}}" are maximally general {{messages to}} describe substitutable preferences {{by means of}} a linear program. With "integer assignment messages," there exist integer-valued Walrasian allocations, extending a result <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>S.</b> Shapley and Martin Shubik (1971). Any pure Nash equilibrium profile of the Walrasian mechanism with participants limited to assignment messages is also a Nash equilibrium of the unrestricted Walrasian mechanism. Assignment exchanges are generalizations of single-product double auctions and are related to ascending multi-product clock auctions and the Vickrey mechanism. Assignment messages also have additional applications in mechanism design. (JEL D 44, D 82) ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} three prototypical models of noncooperative {{oligopoly}} in markets with {{a continuum of}} traders : the model of Cournot-Walras equilibrium of Codognato and Gabszewicz (1991), the model of Cournot-Nash equilibrium <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>S.</b> Shapley, and the model of Cournot-Walras equilibrium of Busetto et al. (2008). We argue that these models are all distinct and only the Shapley's model with a continuum of traders and atoms gives an endogenous explanation of the perfectly and imperfectly competitive behavior of agents in a one-stage setting. For this model, we prove a theorem of existence of a Cournot-Nash equilibrium. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{introduces}} bicooperative {{games and}} develops some general values on the vector space of these games. First, we define biprobabilistic values for bicooperative games and observe {{in detail the}} axioms that characterize such values. Following the work of Weber [R. J. Weber, Probabilistic values for games, in: A. E. Roth (Ed.), The Shapley Value: Essays in Honor <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd</b> <b>S.</b> Shapley Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1988, pp. 101 – 119], these axioms are sequentially introduced observing the repercussions they have on the value expression. Moreover, compatible-order values are introduced and there is shown {{the relationship between these}} values and efficient values such that their components are biprobabilistic values...|$|R
25|$|Because Lloyd's was a {{tax shelter}} {{as well as}} an {{insurance}} market, the second issue affecting Lloyd's was an increase in its external membership: {{by the end of the}} 1970s, the number of passive investors dwarfed the number of underwriters working in the market. Third, during the decade a number of scandals had come to light, including the collapse of the Sass syndicate, which had highlighted both the lack of regulation and the lack of legal powers <b>of</b> the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd's</b> (as it was then) to manage the Society.|$|R
50|$|From 1823 to 1831 Wigram {{is listed}} {{as the owner of}} two ships {{in the service of the}} East India Company. In 1824 he was elected a member <b>of</b> <b>Lloyds,</b> and on 24 March 1824 was married at St George's, Hanover Square, by William Knox, Bishop of Derry, to the bishop's daughter, Isabella Charlotte, who was a niece of Thomas Knox, 2nd Viscount Northland, later created Earl of Ranfurly. They had three sons and three daughters. Until 1830 the Wigrams lived at 36, Wimpole Street, Westminster. They then moved to Thorpe Combe House and in 1841 to Dulwich. Wigram was a partner in Huldart's Patent Cables Company and Reid's Brewery Company, was on the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd's</b> Register <b>of</b> Shipping, and was a member of a Royal Commission of inquiry into the law {{governing}} pilots.|$|R
50|$|James Burns {{was born}} at Glasgow in 1864, and educated at Repton. He was the {{principal}} Director of the shipping business of Messrs. G. & J. Burns, Limited, and took {{a strong interest in}} everything connected with shipping. He was President of the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom in 1899. In 1900 he became Chairman of the Glasgow Shipowners' Association, and was an Honorary Member <b>of</b> the Advisory <b>Committee</b> on New Lighthouse Works to the Board of Trade. He was a Director of the Cunard Steamship Co., Ltd., and of the Clydesdale Bank Ltd. He was a member <b>of</b> the Glasgow <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lloyd's</b> Register, a representative of Glasgow on the London General <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> Lloyds' Register, and a Director of the Clyde Steamship Owners' Association. He was an Associate of the Institute of Naval Architects and of the Scottish Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders. He was also involved in the religious and philanthropic life of the city.|$|R
25|$|On September 8, 1924, it was {{reported}} that more than 25 percent of the Inglewood Klan unit — named the Med Mosher Klan No. 1 — had left the national organization and formed a group called the Reformed Order <b>of</b> Klansmen. Spokesmen <b>Lloyd</b> <b>S.</b> Sanderson and A.H. Van de Mark accused the national body of despotism, graft and un-Americanism.|$|R
50|$|The son <b>of</b> E. <b>S.</b> <b>Lloyd</b> CSI, Christopher Lloyd {{was educated}} at Marlborough College and Lincoln College, Oxford. In 1938, he married Katherine Brenda Sturge, {{with whom he}} had one son and one daughter.|$|R
500|$|It {{was during}} his early career, during the Napoleonic Wars, that Nicolls earned his {{reputation}} as [...] "Fighting Nicolls", for as an officer on small ships, he was engaged in numerous fierce actions on small boats and at gun batteries. On 5 November 1803, during the blockade of Saint-Domingue, Lieutenant Nicolls took a 12-man cutting-out party in the cutter from HMS Blanche and captured the French cutter Albion from under the battery at Monte Christi. Albion had a crew of 43 men and was armed with two 4-pounder guns and six swivel guns. The British lost two dead, and two wounded including Nicolls. In single combat, the French captain wounded Nicolls severely with a pistol shot before himself being killed. For his courage in this action, Nicolls was awarded with a sword valued at £30 by the <b>committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lloyds.</b> In 1804 Nicolls led another boat assault in the capture of a French brig, and led a landing party of Royal Marines in the siege of Franco-Dutch forces at Curaçao. Nicolls and his men withstood 28 consecutive days of continuous enemy assaults on their positions.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to the theorization of global maritime circulation as a key category of a global biopolitics of security. It seeks to advance knowledge on the ways in which liberal life is promoted and protected by exacerbating global circulation. It focuses on the security effects of a complex maritime insurance apparatus driven by global insurance in which the Joint War <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Lloyd’s</b> Market Association and the International Underwriting Association plays a pivotal role. Through the analysis of the inclusion of the Strait of Malacca in the Lloyd’ War List in 2006 under the argument of heightened piracy, it is argued that global maritime insurance performs a special security role, that of stewardship, in securing the circulation of the high seas...|$|R
25|$|Pickle was {{the first}} ship to bring the news of Nelson's victory to Great Britain, {{arriving}} at Falmouth on 4 November 1805, after a hard voyage in bad weather. Vice Admiral Collingwood, who had assumed command {{after the death of}} Nelson, chose her to carry his dispatches describing the battle and announcing Nelson's death. Collingwood sent Pickle, captained by John Richards Lapenotière, back to Britain with the dispatches telling of the great victory. This was a signal honour for any junior officer as it almost guaranteed promotion. After arriving in Falmouth, Lapenotière took a chaise to London to deliver the dispatches to the Admiralty, stopping 21 times to change horses. The Admiralty duly promoted him to Commander for this service, and the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Lloyd's</b> Patriotic Fund gave him a sword worth 100 guineas and £500 in cash. The route that Lapenotière travelled is now known as The Trafalgar Way.|$|R
5000|$|The couple {{moved to}} Hampstead Heath in 1905 {{for the sake}} of her health, which was now delicate. In 1907, John became {{secretary}} of the Civil Service Commission and this position gave him sufficient time to write books too. They worked together on these with Barbara focussing on the research while John concentrated on the writing. While she had done better academically at Oxford, she told her husband John that [...] "she hated using her brains". He wrote that her strength was [...] "putting great masses of fact & detail in order, seizing their significance & seeing how they should be set out." [...] Their first work together was a study of the effects of enclosure and the Industrial Revolution upon the working classes. When taken to the publishers, Longmans, this was found to be too long and so Barbara restructured the work into separate volumes. The first of these was The Village Labourer which was published in 1911. This was well-received and had an immediate political impact, informing Liberal policy produced by the Land Enquiry <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> David <b>Lloyd</b> George - a driver of the Liberal welfare reforms.|$|R
