50|$|On 28 March 2017, Hungarian Minister of Human Resources Zoltán Balog, also {{responsible}} for education, submitted a bill to Parliament to amend Act CCIV of 2011 on National Higher Education. The bill aims to introduce new regulations for foreign-operating universities, several of which affect CEU. Notably, such universities could only operate if the Hungarian government has {{an agreement with the}} university's other <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> (concerning CEU, the agreement is between the State of New York and the city of Budapest). In addition, universities operating outside of the European Union should have a campus in their other <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> where comparable degree programs would be offered (currently not the case for CEU). Furthermore, both existing and new non-EU academic staff would be required to apply for working permits. This requirement is seen by critics as placing CEU at a particular disadvantage, given that it relies largely on non-EU faculty. Finally, the law would also prohibit both the American and Hungarian entities from sharing the same name.|$|E

40|$|In {{organisational}} theory, {{there is}} increased concern over how a particular context affects the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> firms, especially in multinational organizations. As these firms operate in different contexts, {{there is growing}} interest in learning how social institutions from these contexts may influence the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> these firms. MNC subsidiaries, principally, have {{attracted the attention of}} academics because they move in different spaces that are interrelated (e. g. <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, industry and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations),</b> which may have different institutional settings. The implementation of control mechanisms in MNC subsidiaries represents an organizational area that is significantly influenced by these forces. This thesis develops a theoretical framework to explain the presence of control devices in MNC subsidiaries. The framework encompasses different levels <b>of</b> analysis: <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> industry and the organization itself. The aim is to explain the presence of control mechanism in MNC subsidiaries by examining features that might affect the implementation of these devices. The framework places particular emphasis on two areas. First, understanding the effect of institutions based in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin on the implementation of control mechanisms in MNCs. And second, appreciating the effect of institutions in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> on the implementation of these devices in subsidiaries.
