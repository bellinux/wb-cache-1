5|$|Whether the bigeye and {{smalltooth}} sand tigers {{belong in}} the same family as the superficially similar sand tiger shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|E

50|$|After being shuffled {{between the}} genera Carcharias and Odontaspis {{in the family}} Odontaspididae by various authors, in 1973 Leonard Compagno resurrected Jean Cadenat's 1963 {{subgenus}} Pseudocarcharias from synonymy for this species and placed it within its own family. The morphology of the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> suggests affinity with the megamouth shark (Megachasmidae), basking shark (Cetorhinidae), thresher sharks (Alopiidae), and mackerel sharks (Lamnidae). More recent phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial DNA, {{have suggested that the}} <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> is closely related to either the megamouth shark or the sand sharks (Odontaspididae). Alternately, analysis based on dentition suggests that the closest relatives of the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> are the thresher sharks, followed by the mackerel sharks. Fossil Pseudocarcharias teeth dating to the Serravallian age (13.6 - 11.6 Ma) of the Miocene epoch have been found in Italy, and are identical to those of the modern-day <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) is {{a species}} of {{mackerel}} shark and the only extant {{member of the family}} Pseudocarchariidae. A specialized inhabitant of the mesopelagic zone, the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> can be found worldwide in tropical waters from the surface to a depth of 590 m. It performs a diel vertical migration, staying below a depth of 200 m during the day and ascending into shallower water at night to feed. Typically measuring only 1 m in length, the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> is the smallest living mackerel shark. It can be distinguished by its elongated cigar-shaped body, extremely large eyes, and relatively small fins.|$|E

50|$|An active-swimming {{predator}} of pelagic bony fishes, squid and shrimp, the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> has {{a sizable}} oily liver that {{allows it to}} maintain {{its position in the}} water column with minimal effort. The size and structure of its eyes suggests that it is adapted for hunting at night. The <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> is aplacental viviparous, with females typically giving birth to litters of four. The fetuses are oophagous, meaning that they feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated for this purpose by their mother. Due to its small size, the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> poses little danger to humans and is of little commercial importance. However, substantial numbers are caught as bycatch, leading it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This species was responsible for damaging deep sea fiberoptic cables when the technology was first deployed in 1985.|$|E
50|$|In Dorset the Reading Formation {{appears on}} the coast at Studland Bay and at other points inland. The Hertfordshire puddingstone is a {{well-known}} rock from near {{the base of the}} formation; it is a flint pebbly conglomerate in a siliceous matrix. The fossils, estuarine, freshwater and marine, include Corbicula cuneiformis, C. tellinella, Ostrea bellovacina, Viva parus lentus, Planorbis hemistoma, Melania (Melanatria) inquinata, Neritina globulus, and the remains of turtles, <b>crocodiles,</b> <b>sharks,</b> birds (Gastornis) and the mammal Coryphodon. Bricks, tiles and coarse pottery and occasionally firebricks have been made from the clay beds in this formation.|$|R

50|$|With a long body, small fins, {{and large}} liver rich in {{squalene}} and other low-density lipids, the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> is convergently similar to mesopelagic dogfish sharks {{such as the}} cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). The liver may comprise {{a fifth of the}} shark's weight, and acts as an incompressible float that allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy in the water column with little effort. Like many other inhabitants of the mesopelagic zone, the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> apparently migrates closer to the surface at night to feed and descends into deeper water during the day, being rarely found above a depth of 200 m (660 ft) during daytime.|$|E
50|$|The large {{eyes of the}} <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark,</b> {{equipped}} with a reflective green or yellow retina and lacking an expanded iris, {{suggest that it is}} a nocturnal hunter that relies on sight to pick out the silhouettes or bioluminescence of its prey. Little is known of the crocodile shark's feeding habits; it is thought to be an active, fast-swimming predator based on its strong musculature, large tail, and behavior when captured. On one occasion, a <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> off Cape Point, South Africa, jumped out of the water in pursuit of bait. Its diet consists of small to medium-sized bony fishes (including bristlemouths and lanternfishes), squid (including onychoteuthids, mastigoteuthids, pholidoteuthids, and cranchiids) and shrimp. Crocodile sharks are not known to be preyed upon by any other species.|$|E
50|$|With {{its small}} size, non-cutting teeth, and oceanic habitat, the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> is not {{considered}} dangerous to humans. However, it has a powerful bite that invites caution. This species is a common bycatch of various pelagic longline fisheries meant for tuna and swordfish. The largest numbers are caught by the Japanese yellowfin tuna fishery and the Australian swordfish fishery, both operating in the Indian Ocean. This species is also sometimes caught on squid jigs and in tuna gillnets. It is usually discarded due to its small size and low-quality meat. However, its oily liver is potentially valuable. No data {{is available on the}} population status of the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark,</b> though it is probably declining from bycatch mortality. Coupled with its low reproductive rate, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assessed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
50|$|The site, {{located at}} an {{elevation}} of 700 - 750 m, has been discovered in 2004 and the preliminary research began in 2005 {{with the help of}} German paleobiologists from Freiburg. In the Upper Triassic, 230 to 200 million years ago, the area was a shallow, ending part of the large tropical sea, the Tethys Ocean. The mud and sediments petrified in the form of plates which are rich in remains of mollusk shells (which have been found on the slopes of the Stara Planina at over 1440 m), sea worms, snails and other marine animals (sea <b>crocodiles,</b> <b>sharks,</b> giant mollusks) with indications that fossils of the dinosaurs can be found also.

50|$|From {{distribution}} records, {{the crocodile}} shark's range {{seems to be}} bound by the latitudes 37°N and 44°S, where the average sea surface temperature is 20 °C (68 °F). This species is not evenly distributed but is rather locally abundant in certain areas, suggesting {{that it is not}} strongly migratory. The <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> is usually found in the pelagic zone from the surface to a depth of 590 m (1,940 ft). It is occasionally encountered inshore near the bottom and has been known to strand on the beaches of South Africa, possibly after being stunned by upwellings of cold water. In March 2017, one <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> washed ashore dead off the coast of Devon, England in Hope Cove, the first ever seen off the coasts of the United Kingdom. Thus far, it remains unknown as to why this particular shark was present so far north of its normal range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> is aplacental {{viviparous}} {{and typically}} {{gives birth to}} litters of four, two pups to each uterus. The gestation period is unknown but believed to be long. The embryos have yolk sacs at 3 - 4 cm (1.2 - 1.6 in) long; once the yolk sac is fully absorbed they become oophagous: the mother produces large numbers of thin-walled egg capsules that contain 2 - 9 eggs each, which are then consumed by the unborn embryos. The abdomens of the embryos become characteristically distended with ingested yolk material, which can make up {{a quarter of the}} embryo's total weight. It is unclear how two <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> fetuses manage to share a single uterus, when in some other oophagous mackerel sharks such as the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), only one fetus survives in each uterus. The pups are born at approximately 40 cm (16 in) long; males attain maturity at 74 - 110 cm (29 - 43 in) and females at 89 - 102 cm (35 - 40 in). There is no defined reproductive season.|$|E

50|$|After AT&T {{installed}} the first deep sea fiberoptic cable between Gran Canaria and Tenerife in the Canary Islands in September 1985, the system suffered {{a series of}} shorts that necessitated costly repairs. It was discovered that attacks from the <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> were {{responsible for most of}} the failures, possibly because they were attracted to the electric field around the cables. Since crocodile sharks are not benthic in nature, they were presumably biting the cables as they were being deployed. The problem was solved by protecting the cables with a layer of steel tape beneath a dense polyethylene coating.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crocodile</b> <b>shark</b> has a {{spindle-shaped}} {{body with}} a short head and a bulbous, pointed snout.

There are fewer than 30 tooth rows in either jaw; in the upper jaw, the first two large teeth are separated from the lateral teeth by a row of small intermediate teeth.|$|E
5000|$|Howard-Wilks works independently, often {{painting}} from memory. His subject matter reflects his personal interests and often depicts the Australian landscape, Australian Rules Football, marine life and trains. Howard-Wilks’ paintings are often characterised by {{the construction of}} unique perspectives and compositions, which emphasizes the spatial vastness {{of the sky and}} clouds. Rather than producing realist depictions, Howard-Wilks’ imagery combines his acute observations with his use of reference material. As the environmental arts organisation CLIMARTE has noted, Howard-Wilks [...] "is dedicated to exploring themes such as Australian landscapes, seascapes, the environment, football and more specifically, sharks, magpies and trains." [...] This echoes the sentiments of journalist Julia Irwin, who states that [...] "The inspiration for his Howard-Wilks' detailed gouache painting stems from his diverse interests including Australian animals and plants, trains and his favourite football team — Collingwood." [...] Howard-Wilks' practice is also meticulously detailed in its unity of seemingly disparate references.
