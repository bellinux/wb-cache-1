5|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} is {{one part of}} the study of horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or government departments. Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
5|$|Four hybrids {{have been}} named, all made in {{cultivation}} (although the first may possibly {{occur in the}} wild). The International Code of Nomenclature for <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants</b> recommends that <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> should be named under its rules, not those appropriate for natural species and hybrids. The Group names given below were provided by McMillan and Horobin.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> {{taxonomy}} is {{the study}} of the theory and practice of the science that identifies, describes, classifies, and names cultigensthose plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. <b>Cultivated</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomists do, however, work with all kinds of plants in cultivation.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} Liliaceae genera are popular <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> {{in private and}} public spaces. Lilies and tulips in {{particular}} have had considerable symbolic and decorative value, and appear frequently in paintings and the decorative arts. They are also an economically important product.|$|E
5|$|Banksia lemanniana {{has been}} shown to have a low to {{moderate}} susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. A study on <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> in South Australia inoculated with P.cinnamomi and P.citricola found B.lemanniana to have an overall low susceptibility overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared more vulnerable than 10-month-old ones.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, a new {{cultivar}} called 'Student' {{was developed}} by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England. He back-crossed <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> to wild stock, aiming to demonstrate how native plants could be improved by selective breeding. This experiment was so successful, 'Student' became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to germinate. In the absence of further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George recommends that <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> be treated as for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light pruning not below the green foliage.|$|E
5|$|Records {{from the}} Auburn Public Library, when subpoenaed, showed that Nickell had checked out {{numerous}} books about poisons, including Human Poisonings from Native and <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants</b> and Deadly Harvest. The former was marked as overdue in library records, indicating that Nickell had borrowed but never returned it. The FBI identified Nickell's fingerprints on cyanide-related {{pages of a}} number of the works she had checked out from the library in this period.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They {{discourage}} {{wanton destruction}} of nature including of wild and <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants.</b> Hermits (sannyasins) were urged {{to live on}} a fruitarian diet {{so as to avoid}} the destruction of plants. Scholars claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} {{the historical development of}} cultivated plant taxonomy traces the way cultigens have arisen and been incorporated into botanical science; it also demonstrates how two approaches to plant nomenclature and classification have led to the present-day International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and International Code of Nomenclature for <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} algae {{are regularly}} monitored and removed {{to protect the}} benthic habitat. Indigenous sorts of <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{structure}} of the Botanical Code the Cultivated Plant Code is set out {{in the form of an}} initial set of Principles followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles. Amendments to the Cultivated Plant Code are prompted by international symposia for cultivated plant taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the International Commission on the Nomenclature of <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants.</b> Each new Cultivated Plant Code includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.|$|E

5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious {{pathogens}} of many <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
5|$|Plants serve many {{functions}} in culture. The reliable provision of food through agriculture {{is the basis}} of civilization. The study of plant uses by native peoples is ethnobotany, while economic botany focuses on modern <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants.</b> Plants are used in medicine, providing many drugs from the earliest times to the present, and as the feedstock for many industrial products including timber and paper as well as a wide range of chemicals. Plants give millions of people pleasure through gardening.|$|E
5|$|The {{species are}} native to meadows and woods in {{southern}} Europe and North Africa with {{a center of}} diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants</b> have naturalised widely, and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some Narcissus species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing urbanisation and tourism.|$|E

5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{presents}} {{an illustration of}} unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. Weeders {{do not want to}} select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like <b>cultivated</b> <b>plants,</b> yet there is no other option. For example, the Echinochloa oryzoides plant, a species of grass found as a weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields, looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, {{as in the case of}} rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the {{cultivated}} plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes. The provisions of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Botanical Code) serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific community, while those of the International Code of Nomenclature for <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants</b> (Cultivated Plant Code) are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce — the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} international communication on cultivated plant taxonomy, organisation of international symposia, and general communication on topics of interest. In 1988 a Horticultural Taxonomy Group (Hortax) was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation, the Nomenclature and Registration Working Group of the Vaste Keurings Commissie in the Netherlands. One development promoting discussion was the newsletter Hortax News which was superseded in February 2006 by {{the first issue of}} Hanburyana, a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural taxonomy. This filled a gap left when the American journal Baileya ceased publication in the early 1990s. Another development was the launch, in 2007, at the Sixth Symposium on the Taxonomy of <b>Cultivated</b> <b>Plants</b> at Wageningen of the International Association for Cultivated Plant Taxonomy. Hortax also publishes Plant Names: A Guide for Horticulturists, Nurserymen, Gardeners and Students.|$|E
