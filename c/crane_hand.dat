50|$|Titan was {{fabricated}} in the United Kingdom during World War I by Cowans, Sheldon & Company of Carlisle, then {{transported to}} Australia in parts for assembly at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney. Ordered on 5 October 1916, construction at Cockatoo commenced on 7 March 1917. The crane was launched on 5 December 1917. However, during construction, the 40-ton lead screws for the crane's jib arm were lost when the merchant ship Afric was torpedoed. The crane {{could be used}} in a limited capability, although it was not until 1919 that replacement screws of sufficient quality were acquired. Titan was completed on 3 December 1919.

40|$|The {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} {{problem in the}} boundary layer induced by a continuous moving surface is important in many manufacturing processes in industry such as the boundary layer along material handling conveyers, the aerodynamic extrusion of plastic sheet, the cooling of an infinite metalic plate in a cooling bath (which may also be electrolyte).

50|$|Weed cutting {{boats are}} {{developed}} {{to enable the}} maintenance of canals, lakes and rivers and to remove excessive aquatic life such as algae and other plants that may negatively affect a waterway's ecology. Mechanical harvesters are large floating machines that have underwater cutting blades that sever the stems of underwater plants, gather the weeds and raise them on conveyor belts, storing the vegetation on board in a hold. Periodically this is discharged to a barge or an onshore facility. The harvested product can be composted, sent to a landfill site or used in land reclamation. In developing countries aquatic vegetation may be harvested by hand or by net from the shore, cut and harvested by boat and lifted ashore by <b>hand,</b> <b>crane,</b> pump or conveyor system. The harvested vegetation {{may be used for}} the feeding of livestock. To reduce the high moisture content and {{to make it easier to}} transport, the weed can be chopped and pressed. Other uses to which the harvested vegetation can be put include ensiling the material for livestock fodder, adding it to the soil as a bulky organic fertilizer, manufacturing the raw material into pulp, paper or fibre, and fermenting it to produce methane for energy production.|$|R
50|$|Verwood {{station was}} 14 miles and 38 chains from Alderbury Junction, {{some way to}} the west of the village on the B3081. This crossed the line on an over-bridge just to the north of the station. The station {{consisted}} of a passing loop with two platforms plus goods facilities. The up platform was used in both directions when ths signalbox was closed. When the signalbox was open there were two single line sections West Moors to Verwood and Verwood to Fordingbridge, operated by Tylers No 6 tablets, when shut the two token were locked away behind the lever frame (lever 11 was the section locking lever) and a long section staff was withdrawn for a section from West Moors to Fordingbridge. The main station building was a single-storey, double gabled brick building, with platform canopy, on the up platform. Next to it was the LSWR Type 1 signal box and beyond that a parcels store. On the down platform was a timber shelter. At the southern end of the down platform a ground frame was located, this had to be operated for the passage of all down trains when the signalbox was open, it also was required for access to the sidings. In the station yard was the Albion Hotel. The goods yard was at the southern end of the up platform and consisted of a number of sidings, some serving the nearby brick works. A single siding ran between a cattle loading dock and the up platform. Verwood was the only station, other than Fordingbridge, to be equipped with a loading crane. In the later years that the station was open timber for various railway works was forward to the works after being loaded by the <b>hand</b> <b>crane.</b> The Albion Hotel (now the Albion Inn) and the road bridge are the only remaining structures with the road being rerouted across the station site.|$|R
40|$|Robotic {{arms and}} cranes show some {{similarities}} {{in the way they}} operate and in the way they are designed. Both have a number of links serially attached to each other by means of joints that can be moved by some type of actuator. In both systems, the end-effector of the manipulator can be moved in space and be placed in any desired location within the system’s workspace and can carry a certain amount of load. However, traditional cranes are usually relatively big, stiff and heavy because they normally need to move heavy loads at low speeds, while industrial robots are ordinarily smaller, they usually move small masses and operate at relatively higher velocities. This is the reason why cranes are commonly actuated by hydraulic valves, while robotic arms are driven by servo motors, pneumatic or servo-pneumatic actuators. Most importantly, the fundamental difference between the two kinds of systems is that cranes are usually controlled by a human operator, joint by joint, using simple joysticks where each axis operates only one specific actuator, while robotic arms are commonly controlled by a central controller that controls and coordinates the actuators according to some specific algorithm. In other words, the controller of a crane is usually a human while the controller of a robotic arm is normally a computer program that is able to determine the joint values that provide a desired position or velocity for the end-effector. If we especially consider maritime cranes, compared with robotic arms, they rely on a much more complex model of the environment with which they interact. These kinds of cranes are in fact widely used to handle and transfer objects from large container ships to smaller lighters or to the quays of the harbours. Therefore, their control is always a challenging task, which involves many problems such as load sway, positioning accuracy, wave motion compensation and collision avoidance. Some of the similarities between robotic arms and cranes can also be extended to robotic hands. Indeed, from a kinematic point of view, a robotic hand consists of one or more kinematic chains fixed on a base. However, robotic hands usually present a higher number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and consequentially a higher dexterity compared to robotic arms. Nevertheless, several commonalities can be found from a design and control point of views. Particularly, modular robotic hands are studied in this thesis from a design and control point of view. Emphasising these similarities, the general term of robotic manipulator is thereby used to refer to robotic arms, <b>cranes</b> and <b>hands.</b> In this work, efficient design methods for robotic manipulators are initially investigated. Successively, the possibility of developing a flexible control architecture that allows for controlling different manipulators by using a universal input device is outlined. The main challenge of doing this consists of finding a flexible way to map the normally fixed DOFs of the input controller to the variable DOFs of the specific manipulator to be controlled. This process has to be realised regardless of the differences in size, kinematic structure, body morphology, constraints and affordances. Different alternative control algorithms are investigated including effective approaches that do not assume a priori knowledge for the Inverse Kinematic (IK) models. These algorithms derive the kinematic properties from biologically-inspired approaches, machine learning procedures or optimisation methods. In this way, the system is able to automatically learn the kinematic properties of different manipulators. Finally, a methodology for performing experimental activities in the area of maritime cranes and robotic arm control is outlined. By combining the rapid-prototyping approach with the concept of interchangeable interfaces, a simulation and benchmarking framework for advanced control methods of maritime cranes and robotic arms is presented. From a control point of view, the advantages of releasing such a flexible control system rely on the possibility of controlling different manipulators by using the same framework and on the opportunity of testing different control approaches. Moreover, from a design point of view, rapidprototyping methods can be applied to fast develop new manipulators and to analyse different properties before making a physical prototyp...|$|R
