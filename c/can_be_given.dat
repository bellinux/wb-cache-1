Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a suitable inner product. Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} energy content of space-time. The tangent space of a Lie group <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> naturally {{the structure of a}} Lie algebra and can be used to classify compact Lie groups.|$|E

These conversations improve affinity between characters and grant stat boots in battle. Supports are ranked from C to A, with A being the highest rank and granting the best bonuses.|$|E
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} is Law 33 in the laws of cricket {{established}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batsman <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> out for handling the ball if, while playing a delivery, the batsman intentionally touches the ball with {{one or both of}} their hands not holding the bat. A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman handles the ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E

5|$|Since 2014, {{the winner}} has been {{announced}} during a live broadcast of ESPN's SportsCenter. Immediately following the announcement, the award winner {{and the other}} finalists are honored at a banquet in Los Angeles. The most recent recipient of the award is Brendan McKay of the University of Louisville. Although it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to any amateur player, the award has always been given to a college baseball player. In addition, only two winners were not attending NCAA Division I institutions when they won the award—junior college players Alex Fernández in 1990 and Bryce Harper in 2010.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's Church, Bodewryd {{is a small}} medieval {{church in}} the hamlet of Bodewryd, in Anglesey, north Wales. The date of {{construction}} is unknown, {{but there was a}} church on this site in 1254 and the earliest feature to which a date <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> is a doorway in a 15th-century style dating to around 1500. When the church was restored in 1867 after being struck by lightning, stained glass with Islamic-influenced patterns was included in the windows, a requirement of Lord Stanley of Alderley, the church's benefactor, who was a convert to Islam.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{a day and}} night cycle, with enemies becoming stronger during the night. During nighttime, players can collect hidden fireflies, with a reward available for collecting them all. Other collectible creatures include Warp Squids, which are squid-shaped items hidden within dungeons, and which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to larger mother squids in each town {{in exchange for the}} ability to instantly warp there. Finally, heart vessels can be obtained to increase Shantae's maximum health. The game also features various minigames, such as dancing or gambling, in order to earn additional gems.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} Fiona as she {{explores the}} environment, evades and hides from enemy pursuers, and occasionally fights against the castle's inhabitants. Sometimes Fiona will panic when in danger, {{in which case}} she begins to run on her own and the player loses some control. Hewie is a central part to the gameplay, and accompanies Fiona throughout the game. He <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> orders to explore the environment, attack enemies, and otherwise aid in Fiona's survival. Capcom added the dog mechanic during development thinking retailers and players alike would not enjoy a survival horror title with a lone female protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completing}} either game, players {{receive a}} password {{that can be}} used to play an alternative version of the other. In this version, some characters mention passwords that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to characters in the first game in exchange for an item or upgrade. Then, by taking a new password back into the linked game, the item or upgrade can be transferred. Rings can be traded by this password system or randomly created by connecting two games with a Game Link Cable.|$|E
5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given.</b>|$|E

5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful battle, experience points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and they are given one ability point each, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player can try to persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for magnetite, money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but cost money to summon, and consume magnetite as the player walks around. The demons' attitude towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons together into a new one.|$|E
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} was {{formerly}} one of the methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batsman <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that {{the ball was}} going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.|$|E
5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} Vault as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their Vault. Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} Vault, and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability {{provides an}} example of an NL-complete problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> the structure of a median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E
