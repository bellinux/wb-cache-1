40|$|Abstract. The initiation, {{propagation}} and broadening of <b>crazes</b> in polycarbonate {{were studied}} {{with the aid}} of polarizing microscopy. A loading instrument supplying uniaxial stretch is designed to match polarizing microscopy. With polarizing microscopy, online observations of <b>crazes</b> and stress field can be done simultaneously. <b>Crazes</b> appear in bilateral anteriority of the crack tip and direction of length is perpendicular to the maximum principal stress. Stress on the boarder of the <b>crazing</b> zone is taken as the initiating point of the <b>crazes</b> and length to time of <b>crazes</b> follows exponent law. The initiation, propagation and broadening of <b>crazes</b> is a time-dependent process...|$|R
50|$|The matrix <b>crazing</b> theory {{focuses on}} {{explaining}} the toughening effects of <b>crazing.</b> <b>Crazes</b> {{start at the}} equator where principal strain is highest, propagate perpendicular to the stress, and end when they meet another particle. <b>Crazes</b> with perpendicular fibrils can eventually become a crack if the fibrils break. The volume expansion associated with small <b>crazes</b> distributed through a large volume compared to the small volume of a few large cracks in untoughened polymer accounts for a large fraction {{of the increase in}} fracture energy.|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{strength}} of cast polymethyl methacrylate plastic {{as a result}} of <b>crazing</b> is of considerable importance to the aircraft industry. Because of the critical need for basic information on the nature of <b>crazing</b> and the effects of various treatments and environmental conditions on its incidence and magnitude, an investigation of this phenomenon was undertaken. The following factors were examined: (1) the effect of stress-solvent <b>crazing</b> on tensile strength of polymethyl methacrylate; (2) the critical stress and strain for onset of <b>crazing</b> at various temperatures; (3) the effect of molecular weight on crazing; and (4) the effect of multiaxial stretching on <b>crazing</b> of polymethyl methacrylate and other acrylic glazing materials...|$|R

5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the <b>craze</b> for reality television.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{study has}} been made of <b>crazing</b> stress in {{oriented}} glassy polystyrene. The aim was to develop a methodology for prediction of <b>crazing</b> stress in glassy polymers with frozen-in molecular orientation. Oriented specimens of two grades of monodisperse polystyrene (PS) and one grade of polydisperse PS were produced by uniaxial melt-drawing and subsequent quenching of compression-moulded bars.

The <b>crazing</b> stress increased substantially with orientation, and the magnitude of the increase relaxed approximately on a timescale associated with the longest Rouse time. Specifically, a linear correlation was found, to within experimental scatter, between the increase in <b>crazing</b> stress and the orientation expressed in terms of frozen-in conformational stress, as predicted by the theory of Maestrini and Kramer [13]. The inverse gradient (constant β in the theory) was found to be 0. 059  ±  0. 002, when inferring the conformational stress from the measured birefringence. <b>Crazing</b> was found to be suppressed in favour of yielding in the most highly oriented specimens, and this could be explained in terms of the differing sensitivities of <b>crazing</b> and yield to molecular orientation...|$|R

5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, {{who went on to}} book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle <b>craze</b> faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Teaneck {{was created}} on February19, 1895 by {{an act of}} the New Jersey Legislature from {{portions}} of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township, both of which are now defunct (despite existing municipalities with similar names), along with portions of Bogota and Leonia. Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January14, 1895, in which voters favored incorporation by a 46–7 margin. To address the concerns of Englewood Township's leaders, the new municipality was formed as a township, rather than succumbing to the borough <b>craze</b> sweeping across Bergen County at the time. On May3, 1921, and June1, 1926, portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township.|$|E

5|$|The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun {{was the fourth}} and final film in the series {{directed}} by Guy Hamilton. The script was written by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz. The film was set {{in the face of}} the 1973 energy crisis, a dominant theme in the script. Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then popular martial arts film <b>craze,</b> with several kung fu scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in Thailand, Hong Kong, and Macau. Part of the film is also set in Beirut, Lebanon, but it was not shot there.|$|E
5|$|As Schwarzenegger only {{signed on}} for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only {{six and a half}} months were {{available}} for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo <b>craze,</b> in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man.|$|E
5|$|British trad jazz band-leader Chris Barber {{was one of}} {{the major}} figures in the {{development}} and popularisation of rhythm and blues in Britain the 1950s. His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle <b>craze</b> and the development of electric rhythm and blues, as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements. He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues, served as co-director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish the Marquee Club, which would become one of the major venues for British R bands. He also brought over American folk and blues performers who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America, a series of tours that began with Josh White and Big Bill Broonzy in 1951, and would include Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry, Memphis Slim, Muddy Waters and Lonnie Johnson.|$|E

50|$|ESC and polymer {{resistance}} to ESC (ESCR) {{have been studied}} for several decades. Research shows that the exposure of polymers to liquid chemicals tends to accelerate the <b>crazing</b> process, initiating <b>crazes</b> at stresses that are {{much lower than the}} stress causing <b>crazing</b> in air. The action of either a tensile stress or a corrosive liquid alone would not be enough to cause failure, but in ESC the initiation and growth of a crack is caused by the combined action of the stress and a corrosive environmental liquid.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crazing</b> is the {{phenomenon}} {{that produces a}} network of fine cracks {{on the surface of}} a material, for example in a glaze layer. <b>Crazing</b> frequently precedes fracture in some glassy thermoplastic polymers. <b>Crazing</b> occurs in regions of high hydrostatic tension, or in regions of very localized yielding, which leads to the formation of interpenetrating microvoids and small fibrils. If an applied tensile load is sufficient, these bridges elongate and break, causing the microvoids to grow and coalesce; as microvoids coalesce, cracks begin to form.|$|R
5|$|During the Victorian era, Clevedon {{became a}} popular seaside town, having {{previously}} been an agricultural village. Due to improving transport links, via the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon {{was able to}} cater for the late 19th century <b>craze</b> for bathing in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations can still be seen), and bathing machines on the main beach. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. At Clevedon tourism grew following {{the opening of a}} branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line, enabling travel {{from the rest of the}} country. It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Hu Die {{declined}} to renew her contract with Tianyi, and {{signed with the}} rival Mingxing (Star) Film Company, led by the shrewd businessman and director Zhang Shichuan, and the talented writer Zheng Zhengqiu. She had a salary of $1,000 a month, a large sum at the time. Her first film with Mingxing was Tower in the White Clouds (1928). She befriended her co-star Ruan Lingyu; the two women would become China's biggest film stars of the 1930s. Her role as Red Girl in the film The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple (1928) propelled her to stardom. The film was such a success that the studio made 17 sequels {{of the same name}} between 1928 and 1931. It started a <b>craze</b> for martial arts films, but also attracted criticism from intellectuals when children neglected their schoolwork to study martial arts or devote themselves to martial arts fiction.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a <b>craze</b> among high society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{movement}} were in the British jazz, skiffle and folk movements of the 1950s. The 1958 visit of Muddy Waters influenced key figures Cyril Davies and Alexis Korner to turn to electric blues and form the band Blues Incorporated, which became something of a clearing house for British rhythm and blues musicians. A flourishing scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success. Major acts included the Rolling Stones, Manfred Mann, The Animals, The Yardbirds, Them, and the Spencer Davis Group, who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964, {{in the wake of}} the Merseybeat <b>craze,</b> becoming central to the mod subculture in the UK and a second wave of British Invasion acts in the US.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the mid-1950s}} in Britain the blues {{was seen as}} a form of folk music. When Broonzy toured England he played a folk blues set to fit British {{expectations}} of American blues, rather than his current electric Chicago blues. Skiffle clubs included the ‘Ballad and Blues’ club in a pub in Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl. In its early stages these clubs saw the playing of British and American folk music that included folk blues. As the skiffle <b>craze</b> subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs, following the lead of MacColl, began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material, partly as a reaction to the growth of American dominated pop and rock n’ roll music, often banning American music from performances and became more exclusively English folk clubs.|$|E
