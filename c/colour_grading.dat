500|$|When Heiter is {{operating}} on his victims, Jenny's teeth were digitally removed in post-production. However, other effects were relatively simple to create. Heiter's [...] "three dog" [...] {{was created by}} photoshopping an image of three Rottweilers to create an image of dogs joined together. <b>Colour</b> <b>grading</b> was used extensively throughout the production of The Human Centipede. For example, {{at the end of}} the film when Lindsay is left between the dead bodies of Jenny and Katsuro, their skin tones were lightened to further emphasise that they were dead and Lindsay was still alive.|$|E
500|$|Cellador Productions of Bangalore {{worked on}} the film's sound design; Nixon George and Rajeesh K. R. {{designed}} its soundscape. Since Maheshinte Prathikaram was set in Prakash City in Idukki, it required natural sounds which blended with the dialogue and music instead of dominating them. George and Rajeesh recorded in all the locations and found it of great help during the final editing process. Creating sound effects for the climactic fight was difficult: [...] "We used {{a big piece of}} meat to produce the sound effects of punches and kicks. It took a long time and a lot of trial and error". Editor Saiju Sreedharan was the film's colourist, correcting the <b>colour</b> <b>grading</b> and developing its digital intermediate.|$|E
2500|$|Half-Blood Prince was {{released}} in 2009 and became the only film in the series to gain an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. Yates worked alongside French cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel on, what Yates called, extensively <b>colour</b> <b>grading</b> the [...] "incredibly rich" [...] picture by making it look [...] "very European" [...] and drawing influences from the Dutch painter Rembrandt. The film garnered a mix of accolades and was acclaimed for its stylised character-driven approach, but some fans complained about the script's deviation from the novel and the film's slight romantic comedy nature. In response to this criticism, renowned BAFTA member and film critic Mark Kermode praised Yates' directing and ranked the film [...] "second best" [...] in the series, behind Prisoner of Azkaban.|$|E

2500|$|Seamus McGarvey {{served as}} the film's cinematographer, {{shooting}} the film digitally using Arri Alexa cameras with Panavision C-Series anamorphic lenses. Sequences of the film set in the year 1954 were shot using vintage lenses from the early 1960s {{in order to give}} the film a [...] "distant period feel." [...] This effect was enhanced though the digital intermediate's <b>colour</b> <b>grading,</b> as McGarvey noted that the [...] "look I wanted was a peeled look with muted colors and diffusion on the highlights, a sense of period distance. I found a lot of photographs and magazines, and I knew that I wanted the blacks to be imbued with a tint of magenta." [...] Though the film was made to be released in 3D, it received a predominantly 2D release. McGarvey himself decided to shoot the film as if it were only 2D, because he dislikes working with 3D filming equipment and the experience of watching 3D films in theatres.|$|E
