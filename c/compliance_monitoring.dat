40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the validity of}} 3 commercially available at recording thoracic-lumbar-sacral orthosis (TLSO) wearing time of children {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI) and to assess each monitor’s function during daily activities. Summary of Background Data. A major limitation to studies assessing the effectiveness of spinal prophylactic bracing is the patient’s compliance with the prescribed wearing time. Although some studies have begun to use objective <b>compliance</b> <b>monitors,</b> there is little documenta-tion of the validity of the monitors during activities of daily life and no comparisons of available monitors. Methods. Fifteen children with SCI who wore a TLSO for paralytic scoliosis were observed for 4 days during their rehabilitation stay. Three <b>compliance</b> <b>monitors</b> (2 tempera-ture and 1 pressure sensitive) were mounted onto each TLSO. Time of brace wear from the monitors was compared with the wear time per day recorded in diaries. Results. Observed versus monitored duration of brace wear found the HOBO (temperature sensitive) to be the most valid <b>compliance</b> <b>monitor.</b> The HOBO had the low-est average of difference and variance of difference scores. The correlation between the recorded daily en-tries and monitored brace wear time was also highest for the HOBO in analysis of dependent and independent scores. Bland-Altman plots showed that the pressure sen-sitive monitor underestimated wear time whereas the temperature monitors overestimated wear time. Conclusion. Compliance to prescribed wearing sched-ule has been a barrier to studying TLSO efficacy. All 3 monitors were found to measure TLSO compliance, but the 2 temperature monitors were more in agreement with the daily diaries. Based on its functional advantages com-pared with the HOBO, the StowAway TidbiT will be used to further investigate the long-term compliance of TLSO bracing in children with SCI...|$|R

30|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper by Rahman about <b>compliance</b> temperature <b>monitors</b> for scoliosis braces [1]. This study confirms our everyday clinical experience with <b>compliance</b> <b>monitors</b> for braced patients. In fact, since 2010, our institute has systematically applied this kind of monitoring in everyday clinical practice [2]. We already have 2, 106 patients in brace treatment who allowed us to monitor them during therapy. Thanks to this large experience, {{we now know that}} the use of this tool can improve results for our patients. Today, when braced patients do not accept the use of sensors, treatment becomes more difficult and less accurate. Recently, we interviewed patients and parents who said they would recommend the use of these monitors to other families (unpublished data). The awareness of being monitored, if well managed by explaining to patients and parents its advantages, can increase compliance, as shown in a randomized clinical trial by Miller et al. [3].|$|R
