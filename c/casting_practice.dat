40|$|Vertical direct chill (VDC) casting of {{aluminium}} alloys is a mature process that has evolved over many decades through gradual change to both equipment design and <b>casting</b> <b>practice.</b> Today, air-pressurised, continuous lubrication, hot top mould systems with advanced station automation are selected as the process of choice for producing extrusion billet. Specific sets of operating parameters are employed on these stations for each alloy and size combination to produce optimal billet quality. The designs and parameters are largely derived from past experience and accumulated know-how. Recent experimental work at the University of Queensland has concentrated on understanding {{the way in which}} the surface properties of liquid aluminium alloys, e. g., surface tension, wetting angle and oxide skin strength, influence the size and shape of the naturally-stab le meniscus for a given alloy, temperature and atmosphere. The wide range of alloy-and condition-dependent values measured has led to the consideration of how these properties impact the stability of the enforced molten metal meniscus within the hot top mould cavity. The actual shape and position of the enforced meniscus is controlled by parameters such as the upstream conduction distance (UCD) from sub-mould cooling and the molten metal head. The degree of deviation of this actual meniscus from the predicted stable meniscus is considered to be a key driver in surface defect formation.

The hoard presented here was found at Waterden, Norfolk, England by metal detecting and excavation after it was scattered by the plough. The find comprises 201 fragments from approximately 130 swords and spearheads. It is important for understanding the evolution of the Bronze Age sword in Britain, and also for understanding the destruction and deposition of weapons in weapon-only assemblages. Besides a consideration of the hoard from a typological perspective the project used five methods of examination: a) a surface study for manufacturing traces, combat damage, possible cremation, and damage in the ground or at recovery, b) radiography, c) compositional analysis by electron probe microanalysis, d) optical metallography, and e) microhardness testing. This is the first occasion in which these techniques have been combined in the investigation of a complete hoard.

40|$|The {{lower part}} of the blast furnace {{contains}} a coke bed, which is of fundamental importance to the process and its stability. The properties of this bed are determined the qualities of the coke lumps charged to the process, their response to the harsh furnace environment and the deposition of debris particles generated within the system. The coke bed may also retain solid slag residues or kish graphite. Accordingly, the properties of the coke bed, particularly its permeability to fluids, dynamically in response to operational changes. The present work is the first attempting to find methods for the routine monitoring of these critical process dynamics. A method for estimating the hearth coke bed voidage in the plane of the taphole has been developed which employs data routinely collected in the course of furnace casting operations. It is shown that <b>casting</b> <b>practice</b> itself can influence this voidage due to ability of high buoyancy forces, as experienced by coke particles in an iron bath, to cleanse the coke bed of small particles when the iron bath height is high. The Deadman Cleanliness Index (DCI) has been developed for routine monitoring of the status of the coke bed in this crucial region. Calculation of this index relies on fact that metal dripping through the deadman coke bed does not generally reach chemical equilibrium with the bed. Accordingly, the degree of departure from saturation with carbon is influenced by the permeability of the bed and provides one basis for estimating the bed 2 ̆ 7 s cleanliness. This is reinforced by a term recognising the risk associated when insufficient superheat is available to the dripping slag phase, which must also percolate through the bed. Several operational and raw material influences on deadman cleanliness have been identified.

40|$|The British {{sculptor}} Rachel Whiteread (b. 1963) employs {{her signature}} <b>casting</b> <b>practice</b> to render negative space as solid, positive form. Untitled (Room), 1993, was cast from a freestanding {{model of a}} room designed by the artist and built with prefabricated elements. This paper argues that Room utilises architectural representation as a cultural and political form of critique, placing the practice of architecture into question, and focussing upon aspects of the interior that can be overlooked. Further, it is proposed that Room also reveals a richness in regard to how architectural forms of representation might co-mingle, obfuscating divisions between the drawn and the modelled. Room critiques the mass-produced post-war interiors found in London, hidden beneath the veneers of architectural progress. Room {{is viewed as a}} manifestation of a ‘lack’ inherent in the mass-production spirit as it was outlined in Le Corbusier’s polemical ‘Manual of Dwelling’ in Towards a New Architecture. The paper compares the artist’s critical practice of divesting architecture of detail to the work of the photographer James Casebere. Both artists, it is suggested, endeavour to create disquieting representations of interior spaces. The second section of this paper examines a selection of gouache studies of Room. In these drawings, the artist utilises mixed system techniques that incur paradoxical qualities that complement those at work in her negative cast. These drawings, conceived by the artist as strategic sites of correction, are compared to the sinopia or ‘under drawings’ that were hidden beneath the wall surfaces of Renaissance frescoes. Whiteread’s cast is also shown to have a consonance with drawings of the developed surface interior, which also depict the interior of a room detached from its surroundings. Standing outside the discipline of architecture, Whiteread draws attention to architecture’s blind spots. She achieves this by constructing her own critical archive of drawings, and sculptures of the interior.

The ingots, 305 x 965 x 2000 - 3600 mm in size, were cast by Alcan. Homogenization involved 24 to 48 h soaks at 545 °C. Ingots were hand-forged by HDAF Ltd. to sizes up to 356 x 356 x 1524 mm, then solution-treated at 530 °C for 6 h and water quenched. The material was aged {{at various times}} at temperatures of 150, 170, and 190 °C. Microstructures were examined by TEM, CBED, SEM, AES, and optical microscopy. Mechanical properties were characterized by tensile, fracture toughness, and stress corrosion tests. A strong correlation was observed between grain boundary precipitation of a icosohedral (I) phase and certain mechanical properties. The I-phase has been tentatively identified as Al 6 CuLi 3, historically called "T 2 ". When the I-phase was predominant, the fracture toughness, SCC, and tensile ductility were invariably low. Factors identified as promoting the formation of I-phase were cooling rates from the solution treatment temperature slower than - 10 °C s- 1, increased aging time, and increased aging temperatures in the range 150 to 190 °C. Aging conditions which minimized {{the formation of the}} grain boundary I-phase and, consequently, improved the mechanical properties were determined. Three distinct constituent phases were found in cast ingots having only slightly different chemistries. Remnants of these constituent phases were present in every subsequent stage of thermal processing. One, AlLiSi, was discovered to promote surface pitting and to substantially lower the stress corrosion cracking resistance. This phase's reactivity with seawater appears to promote dissolution of the adjacent matrix.

40|$|Continuous casting {{technology}} {{has been one of}} the main technologies that has adequately driven the production costs of alloys down. An understanding of the solidification behavior of metallurgical slags (e. g. continuous casting mold slags) is the basis for optimization of continuous casting as the solidification behavior of mold slag significantly influences the lubrication between the solidified steel shell and the copper mold, and the thermal resistance at the interface between mold flux film and mold, therefore further controlling the heat transfer in continuous <b>casting</b> <b>practice.</b> The behavior of oxide dissolution in metallurgical slags is at least related with three applications, i. e. metal cleanliness, refractory degradation and slag formation in metallurgical processes. Therefore, providing fundamental information related to the solidification and dissolution characteristics of metallurgical slags has become essential. In order to avoid and reduce time-consuming and expensive experiments at high temperatures, numerical simulation is increasingly used. It offers complementary insights in experimental results and contributes to the determination of the fundamental phenomena at the root of the observed behavior. In this work, the phase-field method coupled with the FACTSage Toxide thermodynamic database is adopted to investigate all the factors affecting the solidification and dissolution behavior of metallurgical slags, such as temperature and composition. Isothermal crystallization of hexagonal Wollastonite in ternary CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 melts was simulated using quantitative phase-field modelling. Simulation results show a transition from flat to dendritic growth of CaSiO 3, where the formation of dendritic Wollastonite is favorable at a lower Al 2 O 3 content, a lower temperature and a stronger anisotropy in interfacial energy. Simulations also show that the dendrite tip velocity firstly increases until it reaches a maximum value and then decreases slowly when further decreasing the temperature. The results show that the effect of anisotropy strength in solid-liquid interfacial energy on the tip velocity is less important for crystals with hexagonal symmetry than for crystals with cubic symmetry. Moreover, in the present work, a modified analytical Kurz, Giovanola, and Trivedi (KGT) model considering the effects of solute interactions on diffusion and the dendrite tip velocity has been adopted by replacing the main diagonal diffusion coefficients by the eigenvalues of the full diffusion matrix. Validation of the modified model was performed by comparing the phase-field results with the modified KGT model, showing a good quantitative agreement. Furthermore, the crystallization behavior of CaSiO 3 was comprehensively investigated using in-situ confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) for different CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 melts and over a wide range of temperatures. It was observed that the undercooling required for dendritic growth increases with decreasing Al 2 O 3 content (for the same basicity) and increasing basicity (for the same Al 2 O 3 content). With increasing temperature, the growth rate first increases and then decreases. The experimental results are consistent with the simulation results, which further validates the applied phase-field approach. A phase-field model has also been implemented to study the dissolution behavior of alumina (Al 2 O 3) in CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 slags. The simulations allowed evaluating the influence of temperature and composition on the diffusion paths and dissolution rates for the dissolution of Al 2 O 3 solid particles into CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 slags. The results obtained in the simulations are consistent with experimental observations and the predictions from an analytical dissolution model. The phase field simulations show that the dissolution rate of Al 2 O 3 increases with temperature. Increasing CaO/SiO 2 at a fixed Al 2 O 3 content or decreasing Al 2 O 3 content at a fixed CaO/SiO 2 ratio also results in a higher dissolution rate of Al 2 O 3. The results are further interpreted based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Concrete {{technology}} – porosity is decisive By RALEJS TEPFERS Porosity is {{the number}} of pores in a material for instance pores in certain concrete. Porosity is usually expelled in volume percent. The porosity of concrete has influence on the properties in many aspects. Composition of concrete, <b>casting</b> in <b>practice,</b> maturing and hardening, cement reactions and risks at freezing, all are influenced by porosity.

40|$|Phase-field {{modeling}} of rapid alloy solidification, {{in which the}} rejection of latent heat from the growing solid cannot be ignored, has lagged significantly behind the {{modeling of}} conventional <b>casting</b> <b>practices</b> which can be approximated as isothermal. This is in large {{part due to the}} fact that if realistic materials properties are adopted, the ratio of the thermal to solute diffusivity (the Lewis number) is typically 103 – 104, leading to severe multi-scale problems. However, use of state-of-the-art numerical techniques, such as local mesh adaptivity, implicit time-stepping and a non-linear multi-grid solver, allow these difficulties to be overcome. Here we describe how the application of such a model, formulated in the thin-interface limit, can help to explain the long-standing phenomenon of spontaneous grain refinement in deeply undercooled melts. We find that at intermediate undercoolings the operating point parameter, σ*, may collapse to zero, resulting in the growth of non-dendritic morphologies such as doublons and ‘dendritic seaweed’. Further increases in undercooling then lead to the re-establishment of stable dendritic growth. We postulate that remelting of such seaweed structures gives rise to the low undercooling instance of grain refinement observed in alloys...|$|R
