5000|$|In {{the system}} of divided ringing, the ringing circuit was {{separated}} from the talking circuit by adding a ground connection between the central office and the subscriber stations for ringing. On the same subscriber line, one party used the tip {{side of the line}} and ground for ringing, whilst the other party on the same line used the ring wire and ground for ringing, to achieve full selectivity for two-party lines, in which only the selected station would ring. These names for the wires are derived from the paired cord plugs—used on a manual switchboard—composed of three parts: the tip and the sleeve separated by a narrow metal band called the ring, each of these three components being insulated from one another. [...] In the Bell System, the two stations were thus called the tip party and the ring party, In combination with <b>code</b> <b>ringing,</b> this method could be extended to four and eight subscribers {{to reduce the number of}} disturbances. In several variations of divided ringing, also called grounded ringing, the bells were activated with polarized current, so that full selectivity was achieved for up to four parties.|$|E

5000|$|Although various {{systems were}} implemented, one that limited {{the number of}} <b>coded</b> <b>rings</b> but {{established}} a uniform and readily understood format, was to first give the subscriber number as individual digits, which could be from one to four digits long per exchange, separated by the instructional word [...] "ring" [...] followed by the two digits of the <b>ring</b> <b>code</b> where the first digit indicated the number of long rings, followed by the second digit indicating the number of short rings.

[...] Again, however, it should be noted, whilst this practice was common, it was not ubiquitous, since despite giving a standard configuration for terse, easily interpreted numbers with their respective <b>ring</b> <b>codes,</b> its chief functional drawback was with the first ring always being long and the second always being short, this limited the number of brief and thus practical ringing combinations {{that could be used}} on single multiparty subscriber numbers.|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{in this thesis}} is linear <b>codes</b> over <b>rings.</b> In the first part, we look at linear <b>codes</b> over Galois <b>rings,</b> and using the {{homogeneous}} weight, we improve upon Wilson's results about the prime power that divides the coefficients of the homogeneous weight enumerators of these codes. We also prove that our results are best possible. Our results about homogeneous weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over Galois <b>rings</b> generalize the results that we have for the Lee weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over the <b>ring</b> of integers modulo 4. We also consider other weight enumerators, in particular the complete weight enumerators of linear codes and we obtain MacWilliams-like identities for these weight enumerators considering different rings. These MacWilliams-like identities lead to MacWilliams identities for the Hamming weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over <b>rings.</b> We also give a counter-example {{to show that we}} cannot have MacWilliams-like identities for the Euclidean weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over the <b>ring</b> of integers modulo 4. We also look at Gray maps from Galois rings to the finite field of prime size. We first give an application of the distance preserving Gray maps to obtain good ternary codes, and then we give an inductive algebraic construction of a distance preserving Gray map from Galois rings with the homogeneous distance to the field of prime size with the Hamming distance as well as a combinatorial construction. By using the Gray maps, we obtain some results about the weight enumerators of linear <b>codes</b> over the <b>ring</b> of dual numbers. In the last part of this work, we consider the permutation invariance of binary codes and the connection with linearity over certain rings. Among the rings considered, we have different variations and extensions of the ring of dual numbers. In this context we consider the Reed-Muller codes and answer questions about permutation invariance of Reed-Muller codes under certain permutation groups and the linearity of Reed-Muller codes over these aforementioned rings...|$|R
