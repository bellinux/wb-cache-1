60|$|Just {{then out}} of {{a cloud of dust}} in the {{distance}} the king saw Moti approaching at a hard gallop, looking indeed like a giant compared with the little beast he rode, whirling his <b>castor-oil</b> <b>plant,</b> which in the distance might have been an oak tree, and the sound of his revilings and shoutings came down upon the breeze! Behind him the dust cloud moved {{to the sound of the}} thunder of hoofs, whilst here and there flashed the glitter of steel. The sight and the sound struck terror into the king, and, turning his horse, he fled at top speed, thinking that a regiment of yelling giants was upon him; and all his force followed him as fast as they might go. One fat officer alone could not keep up on foot with that mad rush, and as Moti came galloping up he flung himself on the ground in abject fear. This was too much for Moti's excited pony, who shied so suddenly that Moti went flying over his head like a sky rocket, and alighted right on the top of his fat foe.|$|E
60|$|Near this coast nothing grows; farther inland an {{occasional}} green <b>castor-oil</b> <b>plant,</b> {{and a few}} grasshoppers, true friends of the desert, may be met with. Some grass is scattered {{over the surface of}} the central elevated region, and the whole much resembles the worse parts of the Welsh mountains. But, scanty as the pasture appears, about six hundred sheep, many goats, a few cows and horses, all thrive well on it. Of native animals, land-crabs and rats swarm in numbers. Whether the rat is really indigenous may well be doubted; there are two varieties as described by Mr. Waterhouse; one is of a black colour, with fine glossy fur, and lives on the grassy summit, the other is brown-coloured and less glossy, with longer hairs, and lives near the settlement on the coast. Both these varieties are one-third smaller than the common black rat (M. rattus); and they differ from it both in the colour and character of their fur, but in no other essential respect. I can hardly doubt that these rats (like the common mouse, which has also run wild) have been imported, and, as at the Galapagos, have varied from the effect of the new conditions to which they have been exposed: hence the variety on the summit of the island differs from that on the coast. Of native birds there are none; but the guinea-fowl, imported from the Cape de Verd Islands, is abundant, and the common fowl has likewise run wild. Some cats which were originally turned out to destroy the rats and mice, have increased, so as to become a great plague. The island is entirely without trees, in which, and in every other respect, it is very far inferior to St. Helena.|$|E
60|$|The {{neighbourhood}} of Porto Praya, {{viewed from}} the sea, wears a desolate aspect. The volcanic fires of a past age, and the scorching heat of a tropical sun, have in most places rendered the soil unfit for vegetation. The country rises in successive steps of table-land, interspersed with some truncate conical hills, and the horizon is bounded by an irregular chain of more lofty mountains. The scene, as beheld through the hazy atmosphere of this climate, is one of great interest; if, indeed, a person, fresh from sea, and who has just walked, for the first time, in a grove of cocoa-nut trees, can be a judge of anything but his own happiness. The island would generally be considered as very uninteresting, but to any one accustomed only to an English landscape, the novel aspect of an utterly sterile land possesses a grandeur which more vegetation might spoil. A single green leaf can scarcely be discovered over wide tracts of the lava plains; yet flocks of goats, together with a few cows, contrive to exist. It rains very seldom, but during a short portion of the year heavy torrents fall, and immediately afterwards a light vegetation springs out of every crevice. This soon withers; and upon such naturally formed hay the animals live. It had not now rained for an entire year. When the island was discovered, the immediate neighbourhood of Porto Praya was clothed with trees (1/1. I state this on the authority of Dr. E. Dieffenbach, in his German translation of {{the first edition of}} this Journal.), the reckless destruction of which has caused here, as at St. Helena, and at some of the Canary islands, almost entire sterility. The broad, flat-bottomed valleys, many of which serve during a few days only in the season as watercourses, are clothed with thickets of leafless bushes. Few living creatures inhabit these valleys. The commonest bird is a kingfisher (Dacelo Iagoensis), which tamely sits on the branches of the <b>castor-oil</b> <b>plant,</b> and thence darts on grasshoppers and lizards. It is brightly coloured, but not so beautiful as the European species: in its flight, manners, and place of habitation, which is generally in the driest valley, there is also a wide difference.|$|E

50|$|Improved communications, roads with {{motorised}} traffic, {{and more}} frequent government intervention figured in the increased contact that tribal peoples had with outsiders. Commercial highways and cash crops frequently drew non-tribal people into remote areas. By the 1960s and 1970s, the resident nontribal shopkeeper was a permanent feature of many tribal villages. Since shopkeepers often sell goods on credit (demanding high interest), many tribal {{members have been}} drawn deeply into debt or mortgaged their land. Merchants also encourage tribals to grow cash crops (such as cotton or <b>castor-oil</b> <b>plants),</b> which increases tribal dependence {{on the market for}} necessities. Indebtedness is so extensive that although such transactions are illegal, traders sometimes 'sell' their debtors to other merchants, much like indentured peons.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} if {{concentrations of}} abscisic acid (ABA) and other solutes {{measured in the}} first few droplets of xylem sap from detopped root systems, are good estimates of those in the transpiration stream as it enters the shoot-base of whole plants. Xylem sap from root systems of pot-grown tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Ailsa Craig), at the seven-leaf stage, was obtained by placing root systems in chambers pressurized to 0. 3 MPa with air. The first sample was taken from the cut-surface of the hypo-cotyl stump within 30 s of removing the shoot. ABA, sucrose and other osmolytes were more concentrated in the initial 100 – 200 mm 3 of xylem sap than in subsequent samples. This suggested the sap was contaminated and not unchanged transpiration fluid. The effect was reproduced on the same plant, several times, by recutting the hypocotyl prior to reassembling the sap collecting set-up and repressurizing. Similar results were found with <b>castor-oil</b> <b>plants</b> (Ricinus communis L., cv. Gibsonii). However, neither release of ABA from the cut surface of the hypocotyl stump, nor the effects of pressure to the roots caused the contamination. Instead, small radial pressures exerted by a rubber sleeve attached to the hypocotyl stump, for collecting the sap, were responsible. The effect was reproduced by lightly squeezing the hypocotyl by hand. The possibility was examined that reliable estimates of ABA concentrations in transpiration stream fluid may be obtained from sap samples taken immediately after rejecting the initial, contaminated 200 mm 3. However, ABA concentrations in these later samples were also unsatisfactory since they changed with rate of sap flow. The problem may be overcome by analysing sap induced to flow through detached root systems at rates close to those of whole-plant transpiration...|$|R

5000|$|In {{both the}} Captivity and the Jerusalem Talmud, the hero escapes the {{destruction}} of Jerusalem and deportation by falling asleep under [...] "a rocky overhang" [...] or in a cave (a detail modified in 4 Baruch), his sleep has a duration of 70 years (not 66 years), and his awakening coincides with the return from exile and the rebuilding of the Temple. As Piovanelli observes: [...] "It seems clear {{that the story of}} the History and the legend of the Jerusalem Talmud go back to a time when you could still expect a benevolent repetition of history and the rebuilding of a third temple in about 140 years." [...] The priority of the version in 4 Baruch has previously been argued for {{on the basis of its}} attention to geography and its odd selection of 66 years for the duration of Ebedmelech's slumber. [...] However, most of these analyses have relied on the later and more unreliable Arabic version. For example, Herzer writes that [...] "the 'vineyard of Agrippa' becomes 'the garden of his master', probably because the connotations of the former were no longer comprehensible to the author of Apocryphon of Jeremiah." [...] However, the Coptic version in fact reads [...] "the garden of Agrippa." [...] As for the change of the sleep period to 66 years, Piovanelli explains that this alteration was made [...] "in order to better highlight the futility of such hopes, which had resulted in the defeat of Bar Kochba and the proclamation of the Edict of Hadrian in 136 (= 70 + 66)", which barred Jews from entering Jerusalem on pain of death. [...] The change of the place of repose to the shade of a tree in 4 Baruch is unique among the ancient sleep narratives and reminiscent of the iconography of Jonah under the <b>castor-oil</b> <b>plant</b> (cf. Jonah 4:5-11) found on Christian sarcophagi after the fourth century CE. [...] Finally, the change of a basket full of figs, grapes, and other fruit becomes solely figs in 4 Baruch, which are portrayed with [...] "salvific symbolism." [...] As Herzer explains, [...] "Baruch understands the fresh figs from Abimelech's basket as a symbol of the reward of the pious, or the 'holy ones,' in the time of salvation, specifically the hope of resurrection." [...] All these changes in 4 Baruch have a decidedly later and Christian tone.|$|E

It is an exclusive preserve of the Mishing woman, who starts her training in the craft even before she reaches her teens. For the male, she weaves cotton jackets, light cotton towels, endi shawls, thick loin cloths, and, occasionally, even shirtings. For women she weaves a variety of clothes, such as ege [...] "the lower garment of Mishing women", rihbi (a sheet with narrow stripes, wrapped to cover the lower garment and the blouse), gaseng (used for the same purpose {{as that of a}} rihbi, but having, unlike a rihbi, broad stripes of contrastive colours), gero (a sheet, usually off-white, wrapped round the waist to cover {{the lower part of the}} body, or round the chest to cover the body down to the knees or so), seleng gasor (a light cotton sheet, worn occasionally instead of a rihbi or a gaseng), riya (a long, comparatively narrow, sheet, wrapped, a bit tightly, round the chest), segrek (a loose piece of cloth, wrapped round the waist by married women to cover the eagey down to the knees), a pohtub (a scarf used to protect the head from the sun, dirt, etc.), and nisek (a piece of cloth to carry a baby with). Before yarn, produced by modern textile factories, was available in the market, Misings used to grow cotton and obtain cotton yarn by spinning. The use of endi yarn, obtained from worms fed on leaves of <b>castor-oil</b> <b>plants,</b> was probably common amongst them. However, they learnt the use of muga (silk obtained from silkworms fed on a kind of tall tree, called som in Assamese) and of paat (silk obtained from silkworms fed mulberry leaves) from their neighbours in the valley. Even now Mishing women weave cloths, using muga and paat silk, very sparingly. Thus weaving cotton clothes is the principal domain of the Mishing weaver. She has good traditional knowledge of natural dyes.|$|R

Castor oil is of continuing importance to the global specialty chemical industry {{because it is the}} only commercial source of a hydroxylated fatty acid. Castor also has tremendous future potential as an industrial oilseed crop because of its high seed oil content, unique fatty acid composition, potentially high oil yields and ability to be grown under drought and saline conditions. Knowledge of genetic variability is important for breeding programs to provide the basis for developing desirable genotypes. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess genetic diversity within the set of 60 ricin genotypes using 10 SSR primers. Ten SSR primers revealed a total of 67 alleles ranging from 4 to 9 alleles per locus with a mean value of 6. 70 alleles per locus. The PIC values ranged from 0. 719 to 0. 860 with an average value of 0. 813 and the DI value ranged from 0. 745 to 0. 862 with an average value of 0. 821. Probability of identity (PI) was low ranged from 0. 004 to 0. 018 with an average of 0. 008. A dendrogram was constructed from a genetic distance matrix based on profiles of the 10 SSR loci using the unweighted pair-group method with the arithmetic average (UPGMA). According to analysis, the collection of 60 diverse accessions of castor bean was clustered into six clusters. We could not distinguish 2 genotypes grouped in cluster 1, RM- 96 and RM- 98, which are genetically the closest.
