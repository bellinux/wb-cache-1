40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{occurrence}} of <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis</b> {{is well known}} in immunosuppressed patients, such as neoplastic patients following chemotherapy, although its exact etiology remains unclear. Case presentation We present a case of <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis</b> occurring in a 77 -year-old man with vomiting and diarrhea 2 weeks after initial systemic chemotherapy consisting of 5 -fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan for a recurrent colorectal cancer. Initial colonoscopy revealed multiple punched-out ulcers in the transverse colon and the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus was based on positive cytomegalovirus antigen detected by indirect enzyme antibody method, although immunohistological examination of tissues biopsied at colonoscopy was negative. The symptoms ceased under ganciclovir and octreotide treatment, and the patient recovered gradually. Conclusion The most probable cause of the <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis</b> in this case was impaired immunity following chemotherapy. Cytomegalovirus infection {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease in colorectal cancer patients after chemotherapy and, when suspected, the clinician should pursue appropriate diagnostic interventions including colonoscopy. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Diarrhea in {{seropositive}} {{human immunodeficiency}} virus patients {{is one of the}} most important and disabling symptoms, and often decreases their quality of life. <b>Cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis</b> is among the principal causes of this symptom and colonoscopy is the gold standard examination to diagnose it. AIM: To define the main endoscopic findings in seropositive {{human immunodeficiency virus}} patients with <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis.</b> METHODS: Two hundred and forty-three colonoscopies were performed in 200 seropositive human immunodeficiency virus patients with diarrhea associated or not to abdominal pain or gastrointestinal bleeding, over 10 -year period, whom 51 patients were diagnosed with <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis.</b> Full length colonoscopy with ileum intubation was always tried and multiple biopsies of all segments examined, including endoscopically normal segments, were attempted. All diagnoses were confirmed by histologic and immunohistochemical studies. RESULTS: Total colonoscopy was possible in 98. 03 % and ileum intubation in 88. 23 % of these <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis</b> patients. At colonoscopy, a heterogeneous ulcerative pattern was presented in 72. 54 %, an inflammatory process of the mucosa in 21. 56 % and 5. 88 % of the patients mucosa was endoscopically normal. CONCLUSION: Full length colonoscopy with ileum intubation and multiples biopsies of all segments, even when they are endoscopically normal, have always to be attempted in cases of seropositive human immunodeficiency virus patient with diarrhea...|$|E

Her colonoscopic examination showed multiple longitudinal ulcers on the anastomosis. In addition to these endoscopic findings, her past medical history helped suggest CMV colitis. Because serological testing revealed positive CMV antigen, she was finally given a diagnosis of CMV colitis and received intravenous ganciclovir for the initial treatment.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} case of late-onset {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) complicated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia revealed by autopsy. A 77 -year-old woman had a diagnosis of UC, and received high-dose steroids and leukocytapheresis.

But ganciclovir was dis-continued because of thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction. After that she had interstitial pneumonia and died of a respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed CMV colitis based on UC, and CMV pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage.

The case of a 79 year old widower who was admitted to hospital with symptoms suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease is presented. Despite medical treatment his condition worsened and he developed toxic dilatation of the colon requiring colectomy. Histological examination showed a mild superficial pancolitis, with focal severe inflammation, deep fissuring ulceration, and pseudopolyposis. Abundant CMV inclusions were seen in cells associated with the ulcerating inflammatory tissue. A diagnosis of indeterminate colitis with CMV was made. The patient's condition worsened after surgery and he died {{a few days later}} despite intensive treatment, including antiviral chemotherapy directed against CMV.

40|$|Yumi Harano, Lisa Kotajima, Hiroko Arioka Department of General Internal Medicine, St Luke&# 39;s International Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis usually {{occurs in}} immunocompromised {{patients}} after undergoing organ transplantation or chemotherapy. We report {{the case of}} a 60 -year-old immunocompetent Japanese woman who presented with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. She was initially diagnosed as having ischemic colitis with pseudomembranous colitis on the basis of her symptoms, Clostridium difficile antigen positivity, and colonoscopic findings, which showed ulcer formation from the sigmoid colon to rectum. In spite of bowel rest and administration of metronidazole, her symptoms did not improve. On follow-up colonoscopy, ulcerations remained unchanged. Biopsy of the ulceration revealed CMV-infected cells leading to a diagnosis of CMV colitis. CMV colitis is a rare but possible differential diagnosis in immunocompetent patients. We recommend endoscopic biopsy in a case of refractory abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Keywords: <b>cytomegalovirus,</b> <b>colitis,</b> immunocompetent, enterocoliti...|$|E
40|$|Over a 30 -year period (1963 - 1993), 12 {{patients}} out of 2091 renal allograft recipients (0. 5 %) {{were identified}} for an acute colonic complication. They were 7 males and 5 females {{with a mean}} age of 43 years. The mean elapsed time from transplantation to symptoms was 55 months. Peritonitis was diagnosed in all cases, requiring an emergency laparotomy in 6 patients (50 %); delayed surgery was possible in 4 patients (33 %) after failure of conservative treatment. One patient (9 %) was operated electively later on while the last patient died before any surgery from sepsis after diffuse bowel ischaemia. Aetiology included complicated diverticulitis in 9 instances (75 %), one colon perforation caused by faecal impaction, one <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis</b> and one bowel ischaemia.

40|$|The {{pathological}} lesions {{found in}} 68 successfully engrafted patients with human leucocyte antigen-matched sibling-related bone marrow transplants werereviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six (38 %) patients had acute graft-versus-host disease, which was {{slightly less than}} that reported in Caucasians. Skin was a constant site of involvement (100 %), followed by the gastrointestinal tract (74 %) and liver (59 %). There was a 74 % correlation between the clinical and histological grading of cutaneous graft-versus-host disease, while that of the gastrointestinal tract was lower at 60 %. <b>Cytomegalovirus</b> <b>colitis</b> was found on histological examination of two patients clinically thought to have graft-versus-host disease.

40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this study is to re-evaluate our series of {{patients}} affected by a colonic non-neoplastic disease, in order to measure the percentage in whom we were unable to make a correct diagnosis after the first clinical and histological approach and to single-out the reasons for our inability to reach the correct diagnosis. Methods. During the period 1985 - 1999 we observed 1228 patients affected by chronic inflammatory colonic diseases. Results. In 859 patients (69. 9 %) an ulcerative colitis was diagnosed for the first time, and 248 patients (20. 1 %) were affected by Crohn's colitis. One hundred and twenty-one patients (9. 8 %) were defined as being affected by an undetermined colitis. Forty-three patients of these had a definite diagnosis, afterwards: 27 patients were affected by ulcerative colitis and 16 by Crohn's colitis. Differential diagnosis between inflammatory large bowel diseases (ILBD) and other forms of colitis was set out as follows: 62 cases out of 1228 were consequent on a bacterial infection or parasitosis; in 28 patients a colitis pseudomembranosus was diagnosed. Eighteen cases of ischemic colitis are reported and 14 patients were affected by NSAID-related colitis. In another 6 patients we diagnosed a postradiation colitis. In 22 cases mimicking a Crohn's colitis we ascertained 9 patients affected by intestinal lymphoma, 11 mycobacterium tuberculosis related intestinal infections and 2 <b>cytomegalovirus</b> related <b>colitis.</b> Conclusions.
