The Forel Ule scale, a color comparator scale, {{has been described by}} Wernand and van der Woerd (M. R. Wernand, H. J. van der Woerd, [...] "Spectral analysis of the Forel-Ule Ocean <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> scale.", J. Europ. Opt. Soc. Rap.

The Forel-Ule observations belong, besides temperature, salinity and Secchi depth, to the oldest oceanographic parameters dating back to 1890.|$|E

Salicylic acid configures an anionic chelate with arsenic(V) and then the dye in turn forms a toluene soluble ion-associate. Using standard <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> chart, semi-quantitative determination of arsenic has been carried out. The method has been successfully employed for the quantification of arsenic in real samples...|$|E
40|$|François Alphonse Forel (1890) and Willi Ule (1892) {{composed}} a <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> scale, with tints varying from indigo-blue to cola brown, {{to quantify the}} colour of natural waters, like seas, lakes and rivers. For each measurement, the observer compares the colour of the water above a submersed white disc (Secchi disc) with a hand-held scale of pre-defined colours. The scale can be well reproduced from a simple recipe for twenty-one coloured chemical solutions and because the ease of its use, the Forel-Ule (FU) scale has been applied globally and intensively by oceanographers and limnologists from the year 1890. Indeed, the archived FU data belong to the oldest oceanographic data sets and do contain information on the changes in geobiophysical properties of natural waters during the last century. In this article, we describe the optical properties of the FU scale {{and its ability to}} cover the colours of natural waters, as observed by the human eye. The recipe of the scale and its reproduction is described. The spectral transmission of the tubes and their respective chromaticity coordinates are presented. The FU scale, in all its simplicity, is found to be an adequate ocean <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> scale. The scale is well characterized, stable and observations are reproducible. Thus, the large historic data sets of FU measurements are coherent and well calibrated. Moreover, the scale can be coupled to contemporary multi-spectral observations with hand-held and satellite-based spectrometers. A reintroduction of the FU scale is recommended to expand the historical database and to facilitate a tie-in with present satellite ocean colour observations by tranforming MERIS normalized multi-band reflectance image into a FU indexed image...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{analysis}} of historical ocean colour data from the North Pacific Ocean. This colour is described by the Forel-Ule colour index, a sea <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> scale that is composed of 21 tube colours that is routinely measured since the year 1890. The main objective {{of this research is}} to characterise colour changes of the North Pacific Ocean at a timescale of lustums. Next to the seasonal colour changes, due to the yearly cycle of biological activity, this time series between 1930 and 1999 might contain information on global changes in climate conditions. From seasonal independent analyses of the long-term variations {{it was found that the}} greenest values, with mean Forel-Ule scale, FU, of 4. 1 were reached during the period of 1950 - 1954, with a second high (FU = 3) in the period 1980 - 1984. The bluest ocean was encountered during the years 1990 - 1994. The data indicate that after 1955 a remarkable long bluing took place till 1980...|$|E
40|$|The Forel-Ule <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> {{scale has}} been applied {{globally}} and intensively by oceanographers and limnologists since the 19 th century, providing {{one of the oldest}} oceanographic data sets. Present and future Forel-Ule classifications of global oceanic, coastal and continental waters can facilitate the interpretation of these long-term ocean colour data series and provide a connection between the present and the past that will be valuable for climate-related studies. Within the EC-funded project CITLOPS (Citizens' Observatory for Coast and Ocean Optical Monitoring), with its main goal to empower endusers, willing to employ community-based environmental monitoring, our aim is to digitalize the colours of the Forel-Ule scale to establish the colour of natural waters through smartphone imaging. The objective {{of this study was to}} reproduce the Forel-Ule scale following the original recipes, measure the transmission of the solutions and calculate the chromaticity coordinates of the scale as Wernand and Van der Woerd did in 2010, for the future development of a smartphone application. Some difficulties were encountered when producing the scale, so a protocol for its consistent reproduction was developed and is described in this study. Recalculated chromaticity coordinates are presented and compared to measurements conducted by former scientists. An error analysis of the spectral and colourimetric information shows negligible experimental errors...|$|E
40|$|The <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> Forel-Ule {{scale has}} been used to {{estimate}} the colour of natural waters since the 19 th century, resulting in one of the longest oceanographic data series. This colour index has been proven by previous research to be related to water quality indicators such as chlorophyll and coloured dissolved organic material. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an affordable, 'Do-it-Yourself' colour scale that matched the colours of the original Forel-Ule scale, to be used in water quality monitoring programs by citizens. This scale can be manufactured with high-quality lighting filters and a white frame, an improvement with respect to the materials employed to manufacture the original scale from the 19 th century, which required the mixing of noxious chemicals. The colours of the new scale were matched to the original colours using instrumental and visual measurements carried out under controlled lighting conditions, following the standard measurement protocols for colour. Moreover, the colours of the scale are expressed in Munsell notations, a standard colour system already successfully used in water quality monitoring. With the creation of this Modern Forel-Ule scale, as a 'Do-it-yourself' kit, the authors foresee a possible use of the Forel-Ule number as a water quality index that could be estimated by means of participatory science and used by environmental agencies in monitoring programs...|$|E
40|$|Multispectral {{information}} from satellite borne ocean colour sensors is at present used to characterize natural waters via the retrieval of {{concentration of the}} three dominant optical constituents; pigments of phytoplankton, non-algal particles and coloured dissolved organic matter. A limitation {{of this approach is}} that accurate retrieval of these constituents requires detailed local knowledge of the specific absorption and scattering properties. In addition, the retrieval algorithms generally use only a limited part of the collected spectral information. In this paper we present an additional new algorithm that has the merit to use the full spectral information in the visible domain to characterize natural waters in a simple and globally valid way. This Forel–Ule MERIS (FUME) algorithm converts the normalized multi-band reflectance information into a discrete set of numbers using uniform colourimetric functions. The Forel–Ule scale is a sea <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> scale that has been developed to cover all possible natural sea colours, ranging from indigo blue (the open ocean) to brownish-green (coastal water) and even brown (humic-acid dominated) waters. Data using this scale have been collected since the late nineteenth century, and therefore, this algorithm creates the possibility to compare historic ocean colour data with present-day satellite ocean colour observations. The FUME algorithm was tested by transforming a number of MERIS satellite images into Forel–Ule colour index images and comparing in situ observed FU numbers with FU numbers modelled from in situ radiometer measurements...|$|E
40|$|The Forel-Ule {{scale as}} a method of {{determining}} ocean colour has been in use for over 100 years. Ocean colour is a result of inherent optical properties (IOP) in the water, including phytoplankton biomass, coloured dissolved organic matter and total suspended particulate matter. The Forel-Ule ocean colour scale (a 21 <b>colour</b> <b>comparator</b> scale for categorising ocean colour) was used in conjunction with modern optical instruments and methods to detect apparent optical properties (AOP) and IOP of seawater through a spring bloom period. Measurements were also done in order to evaluate the Forel-Ule scale for use in modern science, both as a tool for scientists, and for citizen science. The spring bloom period for which measurements were done was found to have two separate phytoplankton blooms of different phytoplankton compositions. The two blooms were found using all modern methods, but the Forel-Ule numbers and Secchi depth showed no such trend. However, a way of isolating the part of the Forel-Ule number not determined by the Secchi depth was found by subtracting the Forel-Ule number and Secchi depth measured from the maximum Forel-Ule number, 21. This factor, named the Forel-Ule No Secchi (FUNS) factor, showed the two blooms found during the spring bloom period, indicating that it might be determined by the concentration of Chlorophyll a to a greater degree than is the Forel-Ule number. The Forel-Ule scale is found to be the most useful in the interpretation of large-scale observations of ocean colour, for example from remote sensing, for creating maps of oceanographic information, and in connecting historical ocean colour data with present-day ocean colour measurements. However, the scale was found to be of less use in citizen science due to variation in results recorded by different individuals. In addition there were large differences between results when using the plastic Forel-Ule scale and the smartphone applications intended for use in citizen science...|$|E
