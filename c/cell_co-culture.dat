40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> plays a {{key role}} in {{inducing}} the committed differentiation of stem cells in vitro, which mimics the specific tissue microenvironment in vivo by means of co-cultured inducing cells. However, the present <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> systems limit the application of differentiated cells due to the safety and the scale of these systems. This study established a novel microcapsule co-culture system and investigated the probable effect of microencapsulated co-cultured neural cells on neural differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) ex vivo. Mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs were co-cultured with SHSY 5 Y cells microencapsulated in alginate-polylysine-alginate (APA) microcapsules. The quantitative and qualitative analysis showed that the expression of Nestin (Nes) was significantly increased at both gene and protein levels in the microcapsule co-culture system compared with other systems without <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture,</b> which indicated that more neural progenitors were obtained from this novel microcapsule co-culture system. According to our results and the unique characteristics of microcapsules, it is possible that large-scale <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> system based on the combination of microcapsule and bioreactor technologies will be developed to generate numerous MSCs-derived neural progenitors for clinical applications in the future...|$|E
40|$|A triple <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> {{model was}} {{recently}} {{established by the}} authors, consisting of either A 549 or 16 HBE 14 o- epithelial cells, human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells, which offers the possibility to study the interaction of xenobiotics with those cells. The 16 HBE 14 o- containing co-culture model mimics the airway epithelial barrier, whereas the A 549 co-cultures mimic the alveolar type II-like epithelial barrier. The goal of the present work was {{to establish a new}} triple <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> model composed of primary alveolar type I-like cells isolated from human lung biopsies (hAEpC) representing a more realistic alveolar epithelial barrier wall, since type I epithelial cells cover > 93 % of the alveolar surface. Monocultures of A 549 and 16 HBE 14 o- were morphologically and functionally compared with the hAEpC using laser scanning microscopy, as well as transmission electron microscopy, and by determining the epithelial integrity. The triple cell co-cultures were characterized using the same methods. It could be shown that the epithelial integrity of hAEpC (mean ± SD, 1180 ± 188 Ω cm(2)) was higher than in A 549 (172 ± 59 Ω cm(2)) but similar to 16 HBE 14 o- cells (1469 ± 156 Ω cm(2)). The triple <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> model with hAEpC (1113 ± 30 Ω cm(2)) showed the highest integrity compared to the ones with A 549 (93 ± 14 Ω cm(2)) and 16 HBE 14 o- (558 ± 267 Ω cm(2)). The tight junction protein zonula occludens- 1 in hAEpC and 16 HBE 14 o- were more regularly expressed but not in A 549. The epithelial alveolar model with hAEpC combined with two immune cells (i. e. macrophages and dendritic cells) will offer a novel and more realistic <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> system to study possible cell interactions of inhaled xenobiotics and their toxic potential on the human alveolar type I epithelial wall...|$|E
40|$|Latently {{infected}} resting CD 4 (+) T {{cells are}} a major barrier to HIV cure. Understanding how latency is established, maintained and reversed is critical to identifying novel strategies to eliminate latently infected cells. We demonstrate here that co-culture of resting CD 4 (+) T cells and syngeneic myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) can dramatically increase the frequency of HIV DNA integration and latent HIV infection in non-proliferating memory, but not naive, CD 4 (+) T cells. Latency was eliminated when cell-to-cell contact was prevented in the mDC-T <b>cell</b> <b>co-cultures</b> and reduced when clustering was minimised in the mDC-T <b>cell</b> <b>co-cultures.</b> Supernatants from infected mDC-T <b>cell</b> <b>co-cultures</b> did not facilitate the establishment of latency, consistent with cell-cell contact and not a soluble factor being critical for mediating latent infection of resting CD 4 (+) T cells. Gene expression in non-proliferating CD 4 (+) T cells, enriched for latent infection, showed {{significant changes in the}} expression of genes involved in cellular activation and interferon regulated pathways, including the down-regulation of genes controlling both NF-kappa B and cell cycle. We conclude that mDC {{play a key role in}} the establishment of HIV latency in resting memory CD 4 (+) T cells, which is predominantly mediated through signalling during DC-T cell contact...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> assays are {{differentiation}} assays which {{simulate the}} formation of capillary-like tubules {{with the aid of}} a supportive cell layer. Different cell types have been employed as a supportive cell layer, including human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and human mammary fibroblasts. However, these sources of human tissue-derived cells are limited, and more readily accessible human or animal tissue-derived cell sources would simplify the endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> assay. In the present study, we investigated the potential use of alternative, accessible supportive cells for endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> assay, including human umbilical cord and ovine carotid artery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human umbilical artery SMCs (HUASMCs) and ovine carotid artery-derived cells were seeded into 96 -well plates, followed by addition of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Nine days after co-culture, cells were fixed, immunostained and analysed using an in vitro angiogenesis quantification tool. Capillary-like structures were detected on ovine carotid artery-derived supportive cell layers. The initial cell number, as well as pro- and anti-angiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF-BB and Bevacizumab), had a positive or negative influence on the number of capillary-like structures. Furthermore, HUVECs from different donors showed distinct levels of VEGF receptor- 2, which correlated with the amount of capillary-like structures. In the case of HUASMC supportive cell layers, HUVECs detached almost completely from the surface. CONCLUSIONS: Cells of different origin have a varying applicability regarding the endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> assay: under the conditions described here, ovine carotid artery-derived cells seem to be more suitable than HUASMCs for an endothelial co-culture assay. Furthermore, the ovine carotid artery-derived cells are easier to obtain and are in more abundant supply than the currently used dermal or breast tissue cells. The use of ovine carotid artery-derived cells simplifies the endothelial co-culture assay with respect to testing large amounts of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors...|$|E

Moreover, S. suis is a zoonotic pathogen, which can lead to meningitis in humans, mainly in adults. We assume that glial cells may play a crucial role in host-pathogen interactions during S. suis infection of the central nervous system. Glial cells are considered to possess important functions during inflammation and injury of the brain in bacterial meningitis. In the present study, we established primary astrocyte-microglial <b>cell</b> <b>co-cultures</b> to investigate interactions of S. suis with glial cells. For this purpose, microglial cells and astrocytes were isolated from new-born mouse brains and characterized by flow cytometry, followed by the establishment of astrocyte and microglial cell mono-cultures as well as astrocyte-microglial <b>cell</b> <b>co-cultures.</b> In addition, we prepared microglial cell mono-cultures co-incubated with uninfected astrocyte mono-culture supernatants and astrocyte mono-cultures co-incubated with uninfected microglial cell mono-culture supernatants. After infection of the different cell cultures with S. suis, bacteria-cell association was mainly observed with microglial cells and most prominently with a non-encapsulated mutant of S. suis. A time-dependent induction of NO release was found only in the co-cultures and after co-incubation of microglial cells with uninfected supernatants of astrocyte mono-cultures mainly after infection with the capsular mutant. Only moderate cytotoxic effects were found in co-cultured glial cells after infection with S. suis. Taken together, astrocytes and astrocyte supernatants increased interaction of microglial cells with S. suis. Astrocyte-microglial <b>cell</b> <b>co-cultures</b> are suitable to study S. suis infections and bacteria-cell association as well as NO release by microglial cells was enhanced in the presence of astrocytes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Alcohol {{consumption}} {{has been}} recognized as {{a risk factor for}} breast cancer. Experimental studies demonstrate that alcohol exposure promotes the progression of existing mammary tumors. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. In the present study, the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in alcohol promotion of breast cancer development was investigated using a mouse xenograft model of mammary tumors and a three-dimensional (3 D) tumor/endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> system. For the mouse xenograft model, mouse E 0771 breast cancer cells were implanted into the mammary fat pad of C 57 BL 6 mice. These mice were exposed to alcohol in their drinking water. For the 3 D co-culture system, E 0771 cells and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells were co-cultured with SVEC 4 - 10 EE 2 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, respectively. The results demonstrated that alcohol increased tumor angiogen-esis and accelerated tumor growth. Furthermore, it appeared that alcohol induced VEGF expression in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Blocking VEGF signaling by SU 5416 inhibited tumor angiogenesis in the 3 D tumor/endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> system. Furthermore, injection of SU 5416 into mice inhibited alcohol-promoted mammary tumor growth in vivo.

40|$|It {{has been}} proven that {{microglia}} are involved in both early and late stages of glioma progression and contribute substantially to the tumor mass of gliomas. Because no appropriate in vitro or in vivo investigative approach is available, the dynamic interaction between microglia and gliomas during tumor formation remains unclear. In this study, three types of microfluidic assay were developed to examine the outcomes of the dynamic interaction between microglia and gliomas. Co-migration assay and two-dimensional <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> assay {{have been used to}} show that microglial BV- 2 cells migrate toward C 6 glioma cells and inhibit tumor growth during the early stage of tumorigenesis. However, in three-dimensional cell spheres (three-dimensional <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> assay) that contain a large amount of glioma cells, mimicking the late stage of glioma growth, the phagocytosis of microglia was suppressed, which suggests that glioma cells could reeducate classically activated microglia into a tumor-promoting state at some point during tumor progression. Notably, we found that microglia could contribute to tumor invasion and acquisition of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype in the glioma microenvironment during the early stage and the late stage of tumor progression. In conclusion, we have developed a potential quantitative method for in vitro study of glioma immunity and provided evidence for the duality of glioma-associated microglia...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} highly {{parallel}} microfluidic approach for contacting single cell pairs. The approach combines a differential fluidic resistance trapping method {{with a novel}} cellular valving principle for homotypic and heterotypic single <b>cell</b> <b>co-culturing.</b> Differential fluidic resistance was used for sequential single cell arraying, with the adhesion and flattening of viable cells within the microstructured environment acting to produce valves in the open state.

Plasma stencilling, along the linear path of least resistance, was required to confine the cells within the trap regions. Prime flow conditions with minimal shear stress were identified for highly efficient cell arraying (similar to 99 %) and long term cell culture. Larger trap dimensions enabled the highest levels of cell pairing (similar to 70 %).

40|$|One- and two-cell ovine embryos were co-cultured on primary {{monolayer}} {{cultures of}} ovine oviductal cells (OM) and ovine embryonic fibroblasts (EF) or on monolayers of STO cells (STO), a permanent cell line, {{to determine whether}} a co-culture system could be developed for ovine embryos utilizing a well-characterized cell line. More than 65 % (n = 64) of embryos co-cultured on OM and STO for 5 days cleaved beyond the "in vitro " block whereas only 26 % (n = 35) of embryos co-cultured on EF cleaved to the same degree (p < 0. 05). Mitotic inactivation of the monolayer did not alter the response to each cell type. In a second experiment, development of embryos was similar after co-culture on OM or STO cells for both 3 and 6 days. Co-culture of zygotes on OM and STO cells produced 38 and 33 % blastocysts after 6 days of co-culture. After embryo transfer, only recipients receiving at least one blastocyst became pregnant. About 33 % of the transferred blastocysts produced fetuses.

T cells were activated polyclonally {{in the presence of}} immunosuppressive drugs in order to analyse the effect of these drugs on T cell proliferation, co-stimulatory ligand expression and cytokines. The impact of immunosuppressive drugs on T cell-dependent immunoglobulin production by B cells was addressed in T–B <b>cell</b> <b>co-cultures.</b> All drugs affected T cell proliferation and attenuated T cell co-stimulatory ligand (CD 154 and CD 278) expression when T cells were activated polyclonally.

Although melanoma cell lines cross endothelial cell barriers, they do not express LFA- 1. We therefore hypothesized that melanoma-endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> might induce the LFA- 1 /ICAM ligand/receptor couple during melanoma transmigration. Methods A transwell approach {{has been used as}} well as blocking antibodies against CD 11 a, CD 18 and ICAM- 1. Data were analyzed with an epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescence intensity was quantified with the ImageJ software. Results We show here that HUVEC-conditioned medium induce cell-surface expression of LFA- 1 on melanoma cell lines. Similarly melanoma-conditioned medium activates ICAM- 1 expression in endothelial cells. Accordingly blocking antibodies of ICAM- 1, CD 11 a or CD 18 strongly decrease melanoma transmigration. We therefore demonstrate that melanoma cells can cross endothelial monolayers in vitro due to the induction of ICAM- 1 and LFA- 1 occurring during the co-culture of melanoma and endothelial cells. Our data further suggest a role of LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1 in the formation of melanoma cell clumps enhancing tumor cell transmigration. Conclusion Melanoma-endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> induces LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1 expression, thereby favoring in vitro melanoma trans-migration. </p...|$|E
40|$|T Follicular {{helper cells}} (TFH) are {{considered}} critical for B cell antibody response, and recent efforts {{have focused on}} promoting TFH {{in order to enhance}} vaccine efficacy. We studied the frequency and function of TFH in nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT) from children and adults, and its role in anti-influenza antibody response following stimulation by a live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or an inactivated seasonal virus antigen (sH 1 N 1). We further studied whether CpG-DNA promotes TFH and by which enhances anti-influenza response. We showed NALT from children aged 1. 5 - 10 years contained abundant TFH, suggesting efficient priming of TFH during early childhood. Stimulation by LAIV induced a marked increase in TFH that correlated with a strong production of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) IgA/IgG/IgM antibodies in tonsillar cells. Stimulation by the inactivated sH 1 N 1 antigen induced a small increase in TFH which was markedly enhanced by CpG-DNA, accompanied by enhanced anti-HA antibody responses. In B <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> experiment, anti-HA responses were only seen in the presence of TFH, and addition of plasmacytoid dendritic cell to TFH-B <b>cell</b> <b>co-culture</b> enhanced the TFH-mediated antibody production following CpG-DNA and sH 1 N 1 antigen stimulation. Induction of TFH differentiation from naïve T cells was also shown following the stimulation. Our results support a critical role of TFH in human mucosal anti-influenza antibody response. Use of an adjuvant such as CpG-DNA that has the capacity to promote TFH by which to enhance antigen-induced antibody responses in NALT tissue may have important implications for future vaccination strategies against respiratory pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Modelling the {{situation}} observed in vivo, {{we examined the}} effects of thalidomide and its analogues in co-cultures of myeloma and endothelial cells. It was found that myeloma <b>cells</b> in <b>co-culture</b> had significantly lower levels of CC- 10004 - and CC- 1088 -induced apoptosis than those cultured alone. Interestingly, basal apoptosis was also lower in RPMI- 8226 /S co-cultured with endothelial cells compared to myeloma cell culture. Our data suggest that myeloma/endothelial <b>cell</b> interactions in <b>co-culture</b> have a significant protective effect on both basal and drug-induced levels of apoptosis in myeloma cells...|$|R
30|$|An {{efficient}} co-fermentation of glucose and xylose can {{be achieved}} by selecting a proper combination of <b>cell</b> ratio in <b>co-culture</b> system. Since the consumption of C 6 /C 5 sugar mixture depends on the composition of the two strains used in the culture, the optimal <b>cell</b> ratio of <b>co-culture</b> can be varied with varying composition of sugars available in different sources of biomass feedstock. A kinetic model is, therefore, a convenient tool for designing optimum <b>co-culture</b> <b>cell</b> fraction. In this study, a kinetic model for S. stipitis/S. cerevisiae co-culture has been developed and implemented to systematically design co-culture system capable of efficiently converting sugar mixture from rice straw or sugarcane bagasse feedstock into ethanol.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the proliferative activity, prostatic specific antigen (PSA) secretion, morphology and androgen response of human prostate tumour epithelial cells co-cultured with stromal cells in a bicameral system. Stromal and epithelial cells were isolated from prostate adenocarcinoma by enzyme digestion and cultured in defined media. Immunocytochemistry for prostate carcinoma tumour antigen (PCTA- 1) was performed for culture purity evaluation. Also, the morphology of the epithelial <b>cells</b> in <b>co-culture</b> was evaluated by electron microscopy. PSA {{was determined by}} microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) automatized protocol and the proliferation was evaluated by a commercial spectrophotometric kit, based on formazan salt formation. Both cell cultures showed more than 90 % of purity. The epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>co-cultures</b> showed marked membrane processes and cell interdigitations. The proliferative activity of the epithelial cells was increased in presence of stromal cells. Also, PSA secretion was significantly increased and maintained for at least 14 days, whereas the androgen response for PSA secretion was evidenced only in co-culture condition. Primary co-cultures of epithelial and stromal cells from human prostate carcinoma are able to maintain, for a prolonged time, proliferative and secretory properties as well hormone response, and represent a valuable tool for cellular and molecular studies on prostate cancer...|$|R
