Moreover, it granted its bearer the authority to sentence criminals and political rebels with execution without notifying the court first.|$|E

On what basis is police legitimacy established, maintained and undermined? What are the implications of the extant body of empirical evidence for policing policy and practice? We concentrate on Tyler’s procedural justice model. But we also consider the idea that police legitimacy is partly based on the strength of informal social control processes operating at the neighborhood level: citizens grant the police power in exchange for social order; they cede power and authority to the police in exchange for social regulation and justice; and this <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and consent to police authority may, to some degree, depend upon the strength of social order at a local level...|$|E

The article first examines which powers and thereafter how states may confer them on international organisations. The article brings examples of legislative, executive or judicial, exclusive or shared, express or implied, revocable, semi-revocable or non-revocable, specific or general, mere functional, specified, immediate or contingent, prior or ex post facto, clear or vague, and subsidiary powers. How powers are conferred depends on both the internal, as well as international constitutional guarantees. The bases of international obligation lie in ius cogens, erga omnes obligations, general principles of law, and treaties, from which most frequently for <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> are used the latter - divisible into "common" international treaties, and constituent international treaties that constitute a source of an independent category of international norms - legislation by international organisations. The main conclusion is that although the agreed norms may be construed in the application process, the formal determination <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> remains the formal basis of action...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction. The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> {{occupies a}} prominent place in the Lisbon Treaty. Not only is it stated as a fundamental and horizontal principle in the common provisions of the Treaty on the European Union (Art. 5 TEU). 2 For the first time utmost care {{has been given to}} lay down, in a Treaty text, also the modalities and the consequences of the application of this principle. 3 As such, a catalogue of competence is introduced in Articles 2 - 6 TFEU which lists the “categories and areas of union competence” (Title I TFEU) whilst spelling out the nature of the competences conferred to the Union in those fields, for instance exclusive, shared or complementary. Moreover, it is recurrently and firmly stated that powers which are not conferred to the Union by the Treaties are to remain with the Member States (a. o. Arts. 4 (1) & 5 (2) TEU). Especially those new additions in the Treaties are revealing of the currently prevailing political context whereby the Member States seek to get a renewed grasp on the formulation, interpretation and application of the Treaty principle <b>of</b> <b>conferral.</b> This can hardly be considered in isolation from the development of case law of the CJEU, who deftly asserts exclusive jurisdiction to interpret this key structural principle of EU law...|$|R
40|$|As {{the title}} itself reveals, {{the purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the general principles guiding the incriminating activity incumbent upon the European legislature. Thus, this study started in the first part to analyze the principle of legality which is found not only at the basis of the law itself – lato sensu – and specific to each member state of the European Union (but not exclusively), and which represents the fundamental principle of the European law also. Also, we shall also present a few important characteristics of other principles such as, subsidiarity and proportionality, ultima ratio principle, principle of guilt. Moreover, in the second part of this study we tried to analyze some procedural aspects regarding the <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> and the jurisdiction in criminal matters and the duty to cooperate in good faith as tools that the European legislature has used and is using in its standardization activity and, if we may say so, even in the development of a common legislation to all member states of the European Union, especially in criminal matters. Furthermore, in its’ third part, this study highlights the main changes brought by the Treaty of Lisbon regarding first and foremost the shared competence and also the new instruments used by the main Community actors...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{dissertation}} thesis is: The perspectives of harmonization of direct income taxes in the European Union. The reason for choosing this topic was firstly the current issue, which offers a wide scope for research and polemic over new approaches and solutions in the European and international tax law. The European Union is a supranational organization founded on the principle <b>of</b> <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> The ideas <b>of</b> the approximation of the laws are not only its own, but occur throughout the world community, because thanks to the harmonization of certain legislation the benefits of international trade can maximize. The idea of exclusion from economic cooperation today is practically unrealistic. In the European Union the harmonization of laws {{is directly related to}} the development of the internal market. The European Union has a long-term goal to create a market that acts as a market of one country. The instrument of harmonization seeks to eliminate differences in legal systems so as not to impede the implementation of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market. Taxation is a very specific and also sensitive area. The area of taxation is traditionally perceived as a sovereign expression of state sovereignty. The aim of this thesis is the attempt to find the best solutions how to [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The Military of Austria-Hungary, {{comprising}} the Armed Forces, War Office, and intelligence organisations of the Dual Monarchy served {{as one of}} the Empires core unifying institutions and primary instruments for defence as well as external power projection. The history of the Austro-Hungarian military begins when the Habsburgs established hereditary rule over Austrian lands in the 13th century and stretches until the fall of the Habsburgs, at the end of World War I, during which time their armies were among the largest and most significant in Europe. Though not as powerful as some of its contemporaries, the military of Austria-Hungarys scale, resources, organization, technology and training were one of the central factors determining <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> great <b>power</b> status on the empire for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
40|$|This article takes a {{fresh look}} at the issue of the {{delegation}} <b>of</b> legislative <b>powers</b> to the executive branch of government. The traditional view is that there are no constitutional limits deriving from the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> to the <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> unfettered legislative <b>power</b> on executive officials. The author argues that this approach needs re-evaluation in light of the contemporary focus on the purposes served by the separation <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> doctrine. Attention to the connection of the doctrine with the rule of law, as well as with fundamental democratic values, suggests that we should reject the traditional view that Parliament can delegate legislative power without indicating the standards which are to govern the making of the delegated legislation. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{consumers}} have {{no means of}} protecting themselves when {{they are looking for}} property investment advice in Australia. There is no uniform national or State regulation in the property investment advice and marketeering industry. The only protection and remedies currently available are those under the general consumer protection laws scattered in various Acts, and even so, these have numerous problems. This paper highlights what those problems are under the general consumer protection laws and suggests some changes to the current system. The paper also argues that a national co-operative approach {{is the only way to}} move forward in this area and suggests that the constitutional difficulty can be overcome by using the legislative <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> state <b>powers</b> provision, which has often been overlooked. The paper also argues that a new regulator be set up to administer and enforce the new proposed laws on property investment advice. <br /...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of truly politicised and geopolitically discoursed public and {{academic}} debates around the pioneering and, at the same time, revolutionary EU-Ukrainian association deal, this article seeks to present a pragmatic law and politics view {{on one of the}} cornerstone issues in the newly launched EU association policy towards Ukraine, i. e. the institutional and implementation framework. It therefore explores possible modalities and the actually arranged implementation model of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, and assesses the strengths and weaknesses thereof. The challenges posed by the recent unduly ‘flexibilisation’ and postponement of the agreement’s provisional application are analysed, and the procedural requirements for transitional implementation and full enactment are disclosed. Finally, the association’s institutional engineering is given thorough legal and political scrutiny, that allowed to contend that the truly empowered institutional framework and selected implementation model are deemed to gear the process of political association and economic integration, yet these heavily draw on explicit <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> dynamic <b>powers</b> and implicit integration-oriented functional rationale...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{arguments that}} the prerogative should be readily displaced by statute, where a statute {{deals with a}} subject matter similar to a prerogative. It does so by examining the leading cases on displacement of the prerogative in the United Kingdom and the Australian states, and displacement of the Australian Commonwealth 2 ̆ 7 s inherent executive power. The cases do not adopt a single rule {{but the question of}} whether a statute will be taken to displace a prerogative is highly dependent of the facts and the provisions of the particular staute. This article defends the current approach to displacement, for three reasons. First, the courts do not allow governments to subvert or ignore statutes by using the prerogative. Secondly, the courts have almost always decided in favour of liberty and against the <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> coercive <b>powers</b> on government. Thirdly, a single rule could not do justice to all the variables involved in displacement cases. Ordinary principles of statutory interpretation are sufficient to deal with questions of displacement. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The initial ‘framing’ (in {{the summer}} of 2012) of the ‘genuine EMU’ for the wider public {{suggested}} to design an entire series of ‘unions’. So many ‘unions’ are neither necessary nor desirable – only some are and their design matters. The paper critically discusses first the negative fall-out of the crisis for EMU, and subsequently assesses the fiscal and the banking unions as accomplished so far, without going into highly specific technical details. The assessment is moderately positive, although there is ample scope for further improvement and a risk for short-term turbulence once the ECB has finished its tests and reviews. What about the parade of other ’unions’ such as economic union, social union and political union? The macro-economic imbalances procedure (MIP) and possibly the ESRB have overcome the pre-crisis disregard of macro competitiveness. The three components of ‘economic union’ (single market, economic policy coordination and budgetary disciplines) have all been strengthened. The last two ‘unions’, on the other hand, would imply {{a fundamental change in}} the <b>conferral</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> to the EU/ Eurozone, with drastic and possibly very serious long-run implications, including a break-up of the Union, if such proposals would be pushed through. The cure is worse than the disease. Whereas social union is perhaps easier to dismiss as a ‘misfit’ in the EU, the recent popularity of suggesting a ‘political union’ is seen as worrisome. Probably, nobody knows what a ‘political union’ is, or, at best, it is a highly elastic notion: it might be thought necessary for reasons of domestic economic reforms in EU countries, for a larger common budget, for some EU tax power, for (greater) risk pooling, for ‘symmetric’ macro-economic adjustment and for some ultimate control of the ECB in times of crisis. Taking each one of these arguments separately, a range of more typical EU solutions might be found without suggesting a ‘political union’. Just as ‘fiscal capacity’ was long an all-or-nothing taboo for shifting bank resolution to the EU level, now solved with a modest common Fund and carefully confined but centralised powers, the author suggests that other carefully targeted responses can be designed for the various aspects where seen as indispensable, including the political say of a lender-of-last-resort function of the ECB. Hence, neither a social nor a political union worthy of the name ought to be pursued. Yet, political legitimacy matters, both with national parliaments and the grassroots. National parliaments will have to play a larger role...|$|R
