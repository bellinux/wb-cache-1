The complainant, a small UK-based online travel agent, Skoosh, claimed that the hotels it bought room bookings from were under pressure from other resellers to maintain minimum prices. On 31 July 2012 the OFT issued a Statement of Objections against Booking.com, Expedia and Intercontinental Hotels. In the OFT's provisional view the parties had infringed competition law. In January 2014 the OFT accepted <b>commitments</b> <b>proposal</b> from the defendant parties in lieu of any fines.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose an {{operational}} method for {{the definition of the}} semantics of Agent Communication Languages based on the notion of social <b>commitment.</b> Our <b>proposal</b> is suitable for open interaction frameworks where agents, designed by independent constructors, dynamically enter and leave different interaction systems. In this type of environments it is crucial to define a standard and commonly accepted semantics for the exchanged messages. We give an operational specification of commitment and introduce temporal propositions for the representation of the contents of commitments within an object-oriented paradigm. Then we use operations on commitments to define the meaning of a set of communicative acts that is complete with respect to Searle’s taxonomy of illocutionary acts, and give an example of the use of communicative acts in an interaction protocol. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) σ locus lies within the TCR α locus and is excised from the chromosome by Vα-Jα rearrangement. We show here that σ sequences persist {{in a large}} fraction of the DNA from mature CD 4 +CD 8 −αβ+ mouse thymocytes. Virtually all σ loci in these cells are rearranged and present in extrachromosomal DNA. In immature αβ lineage thymocytes (CD 3 −/loCD 4 +CD 8 +) and in CD 4 +CDS−αβ+ thymocytes expressing a transgene-encoded αβ receptor, rearranged σ genes are present both in chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA. Thus, contrary to earlier <b>proposals,</b> <b>commitment</b> to the αβ lineage does not require recombinational silencing of the σ locus or its deletion by a site-specific mechanism prior to Vα-Jα rearrangement...|$|R
40|$|Following various {{commitments}} made by South Africa {{in terms}} {{of global climate change}} initiatives, the Department of the National Treasury released a discussion paper in December 2010 proposing the introduction of a carbon tax. The research sought to assess whether a carbon tax is appropriate for South Africa considering the international adoption of similar policies and what the implications of a carbon tax would be on South Africa’s socio-economic development objectives. This report presents findings showing that South Africa’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emission <b>commitments</b> and <b>proposals</b> for a carbon tax are “out of step” with developing country peers, particularly leading countries such as China, India, Brazil and Russia. Further, the research demonstrates that the Treasury proposals will have a significantly detrimental impact on the South African economy and will result in employment reduction in the industrial sectors of the economy – mining, manufacturing, construction, trade and transport/communications. While existing macro-economic studies identified in the literature review reveal that a carbon tax will {{have a negative effect on}} the economy, these studies tend to understate the degree of the problem.

40|$|Abstract. Social Computing (SC) {{requires}} {{agents to}} reason seam-lessly both on their social relationships {{and on their}} goals, beliefs. We claim the need to explicitly represent the social state and social relationships as resources, available to agents. We built a framework, based on JaCaMo, where this vision is realized and SC is imple-mented through social commitments and <b>commitment</b> protocols. 1 <b>PROPOSAL</b> AND MOTIVATION Many systems, developed to support human users, require a transi-tion from an individualistic to a societal perspective. For instance, Socio-Technical Systems (STS) are large-scale, multi-party, cross-organizational systems, which help stakeholders to interact and to use shared resources [11]. Such systems perform a social computation which {{is the sum of}} the independent contributions of autonomous, and heterogeneous, parties [10].

40|$|The mixed {{record on}} the 2015 Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets and the focus on global public goods in post-MDG debates {{questions}} the future of traditional development co-operation (official development assistance, ODA). Meanwhile, international financial crisis and fiscal retrenchment have focussed policy makers on the international dimensions of income and asset taxation. This paper explores how these two currents of economic discourse can be combined, {{a decade after the}} Zedillo Commission proposed new forms of innovative development finance (IDF). Current IDF proposals involve new forms of hypothecated taxation (such as those on financial transactions or carbon pollution) and borrowing against future ODA <b>commitments.</b> These <b>proposals</b> have practical drawbacks, require new intergovernmental mechanisms and tend to perpetuate aid dependency. In contrast, greater international co-operation for direct tax collection (to which the G 20 is already committed) would allow developing countries to ensure full income tax collection from their residents (both corporate and personal) through information exchange and the resulting clearing mechanism for double taxation resolution would provide the basis for prior collection of agreed quotas to fund global public goods on an equitable basis. Based on an expanded global income tax base (not new taxes or increased rates) such co-operation represents a more sustainable and equitable system than forms of IDF based on traditional ODA relationships. While a decade ago such an outcome seemed extremely unlikely, recent changes in the global political economy mean that such a transformation of development assistance might now possibly be feasible...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since the early 1970 's, {{the federal government has}} provided a large share of the nation's capital investment in urban mass transportation. Much of this funding has come through the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) New Starts Program, which helps pay for rail, bus, and trolley projects. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century authorized about $ 6 billion in "guaranteed" funding for the New Starts program through fiscal year 2003. FTA's evaluation process assigns candidate projects individual ratings for project justification and local financial commitments. The process also assigns an overall rating intended to reflect the project's merit. FTA recommended four projects for funding commitments for fiscal year 2003 in its New Starts report and budget proposal. FTA evaluated 50 proposed projects for fiscal year 2003 and developed ratings for 31 of them. Twenty-seven of these projects were rated as "highly recommended" or "recommended. " Although FTA has faced transit budget crunches for years, the agency will end the act's authorization period with $ 310 million in unused <b>commitment</b> authority. <b>Proposals</b> to limit the amount of New Starts funds would allow more projects to receive such funding, but could harm specific projects being developed and the local transportation planning process. For example, limiting New Starts funds to 60 percent of a project's cost for the 49 projects now in final design or preliminary engineering would "free up" $ 500 million for additional projects. However, only 20 percent of these projects plan to use New Starts funds for more than 60 percent of projected costs and would be affected by such a cap. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{proposal}} of Elisa Marengo’s thesis is to extend commitment protocols to explicitly account for temporal regulations. This extension will satisfy two needs: (1) {{it will allow}} representing, in a flexible and modular way, temporal regulations with a normative force, posed on the interaction, so as to represent conventions, laws and suchlike; (2) it will allow committing to complex conditions, which describe not only what will be achieved but to some extent also how. These two aspects will be deeply investigated in the {{proposal of}} a unified framework, {{which is part of}} the ongoing work and will be included in the thesis. 1 Commitment-based Interaction Protocols The issues of communication and cooperation are crucial in the area of Multiagent systems (MAS). The common solution is to rely on agent interaction protocols. Among different <b>proposals,</b> <b>commitment</b> protocols [24] have been widely adopted. All agents, involved in an interaction ruled by a commitment protocol, share the semantics of a set of actions which affect the social state. This semantics is based on the notion of social commitment. The idea is that if an agent takes a commitment towards another agent t...|$|R

40|$|Response to {{environmental}} change {{is at the}} heart of firm sustainability. In the case of disruptive technology, previous research describes this challenge as a problem of <b>commitment.</b> Because disruptive <b>proposals</b> do not fit the criteria considered in the existing resource allocation process, they are denied organizational commitment. The following research seeks to address the phenomenon where incumbents do commit substantial resources, but then force those commitments around their existing business rather than find new markets. The analysis draws on extensive multi-level, longitudinal field data collected from a single revelatory case of a newspaper company as its management responded to the Internet. The conceptual framework for the study links the resource allocation and threat rigidity literatures. The data show that threat framing helps build impetus and commitment for disruptive projects that would otherwise stall. However, this same threat-induced action invokes a set of rigidities that prove maladaptive in the face of disruptive change. The research suggests that the role of structure goes beyond resource allocation. Structural independence creates strategic de-coupling of threat and opportunity framing, allowing the simultaneous management of otherwise inconsistent frames.

40|$|A key {{objective}} of Government policy for older people, {{children and adults}} with an illness or a disability is to support them to live in dignity and independence {{in their own homes}} and communities for as long as possible. Carers are vital to the achievement of this objective and are considered a backbone of care provision in Ireland. Every day in this country, tens of thousands (1) of family members, friends, partners, parents, children, or neighbours, provide care for someone who, through a variety of circumstances, needs it. These are Ireland’s carers and what they do not only makes a profound difference to the health, well-being and quality of life of those that they care for, but makes an important, often unacknowledged contribution to the economy. The context in which the Strategy has been developed This Strategy has been developed at a time of significant economic challenges and public financial constraints. The State already faces challenges in maintaining current levels of services from within existing resources. In addition, the significant demographic changes to the Irish population structure, which are expected to occur over the next number of years, will have major implications for publicly provided supports and services. Furthermore, the Programme for Government commits to key and fundamental reforms of both the structure and delivery model of our health system. In advance of the restructuring of this system, it is difficult at this point to develop longer-term <b>commitments</b> or <b>proposals</b> for the future. The Strategy, therefore, concentrates on Actions for the short to medium term, which can, to the greatest extent possible, be achieved on a cost neutral basis. That said, there is a wide range of existing Government commitments, which, in tandem with this Strategy, will improve the position of carers within our society. The National Carers’ Strategy does not sit in isolation but rather {{is an integral part of}} the Government’s broader social inclusion agenda. It sits alongside and complements the National Disability Strategy (2004), A Vision for Change (2006), the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability (2011 - 2016) and the forthcoming Children and Young People’s Policy Framework (2012 - 2017). It is also envisaged that there will be a high degree of commonality between this Strategy and the vision, principles and goals that will be articulated in the National Positive Ageing Strategy and the National Dementia Strategy when they are published. It is also important for this Strategy to have regard to the range of supports and services that are already available for carers so that proposals emerging from this Strategy build on, rather than duplicate, existing arrangements. Some supports are specifically targeted at carers but carers can also benefit from the supports aimed at those for whom they are caring. In addition, voluntary and community groups provide a range of supports for carers, much of which is State funded...|$|R
40|$|As Zika virus {{continues}} to spread, decisions regarding resource allocations {{to control the}} outbreak underscore {{the need for a}} tool to weigh policies according to their cost and the health burden they could avert. For example, to combat the current Zika outbreak the US President requested the allocation of $ 1. 8 billion from Congress in February 2016. Illustrated through an interactive tool, we evaluated how the number of Zika cases averted, the period during pregnancy in which Zika infection poses a risk of microcephaly, and probabilities of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) impact the cost at which an intervention is cost-effective. From Northeast Brazilian microcephaly incidence data, we estimated the probability of microcephaly in infants born to Zika-infected women (0. 49 % to 2. 10 %). We also estimated the probability of GBS arising from Zika infections in Brazil (0. 02 % to 0. 06 %) and Colombia (0. 08 %). We calculated that each microcephaly and GBS case incurs the loss of 29. 95 DALYs and 1. 25 DALYs per case, as well as direct medical costs for Latin America and the Caribbean of $ 91, 102 and $ 28, 818, respectively. We demonstrated the utility of our cost-effectiveness tool with examples evaluating funding commitments by Costa Rica and Brazil, the US presidential proposal, and the novel approach of genetically modified mosquitoes. Our analyses indicate that the <b>commitments</b> and the <b>proposal</b> are likely to be cost-effective, whereas the cost-effectiveness of genetically modified mosquitoes depends on the country of implementation. Current estimates from our tool suggest that the health burden from microcephaly and GBS warrants substantial expenditures focused on Zika virus control. Our results justify the funding committed in Costa Rica and Brazil and many aspects of the budget outlined in the US president's proposal. As data continue to be collected, new parameter estimates can be customized in real-time within our user-friendly tool to provide updated estimates on cost-effectiveness of interventions and inform policy decisions in country-specific settings...|$|R
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 657 - 702 In this paper, {{we offer}} an {{intermediate}} {{position in the}} multiculturalism/universalism debate, drawing upon Cobern and Loving’s epistemological pluralism, pragmatist philosophies, Southerland’s defense of instructional multicultural science education, and the conceptual profile model. An important element in this position is the proposal that understanding is the proper goal of science education. Our <b>commitment</b> to this <b>proposal</b> is {{explained in terms of}} a defense of an ethics of coexistence for dealing with cultural differences, according to which social argumentative processes—including those in science education—should be marked by dialogue and confrontation of arguments in the search of possible solutions, and an effort to (co-) live with differences if a negotiated solution is not reached. To understand the discourses at stake is, in our view, a key requirement for the coexistence of arguments and discourses, and the science classroom is the privileged space for promoting an understanding of the scientific discourse in particular. We argue for “inclusion” of students’ culturally grounded ideas in science education, but in a sense that avoids curricular multicultural science education, and, thus, any attempt to broaden the definition of “science” so that ideas from other ways of knowing might be simply treated as science contents. Science teachers should always take in due account the diversity of students’ worldviews, giving them room in argumentative processes in science classrooms, but should never lose from sight the necessity of stimulating students to understand scientific ideas. This view is grounded on a distinction between the goals of science education and the nature of science instruction, and demands a discussion about how learning is to take place in culturally sensitive science education, and about communicative approaches that might be more productive in science classrooms organized as we propose here. We employ the conceptual profile model to address both issues. We expect this paper can contribute to the elaboration of an instructional multicultural science education approach that eliminates the forced choice between the goals of promoting students’ understanding of scientific ideas and of empowering students through education...|$|R
