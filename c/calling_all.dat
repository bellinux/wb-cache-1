5|$|The 1961 {{season was}} typical on the field: Jim Brown {{led the league}} in rushing for the fifth {{straight}} season and the team ended with an 8–5–1 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship. During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown <b>calling</b> <b>all</b> the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown said on a weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence. They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.|$|E
5|$|The Class 93 was {{put into}} service {{as part of the}} Agenda {{regional}} train concept. Along with the Class 70 InterCity Express trains in Eastern Norway, the Class 93 would serve the regional services of NSB. Trains were initially put into service in 2000 on the Nordland Line, followed by the Rauma and Røros Line. The trains had several operational problems, some related to humidity, creating situations where the both engines would stop. This caused NSB in 2002 to demand an interior and technical reconfiguration by Bombardier. One year after delivery, six of eleven trains were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back. The brand name Agenda failed, since customers were dissatisfied with the new stock, and NSB chose to discontinue the branding, just <b>calling</b> <b>all</b> former Agenda and Signatur trains regional trains.|$|E

25|$|On 30 March, {{hoping to}} start a popular {{uprising}} against the Austrians, Murat gave the Rimini Proclamation <b>calling</b> <b>all</b> Italian nationalists to war. Although there were many Italians sympathetic to his cause, fearful of the increasing Austrian influence in Italy and longing for independence, most Italians saw Murat as someone trying to save his own crown rather than a figurehead for unification. The Austrians also quickly crushed any unrest {{and there would be}} no general insurrection so long as Austrian troops were stationed in Italy. Despite this, by early April, Murat has reached the Austrian border on the Po River. Across the border in Lombardy, there were reportedly around 40,000 Italian partisans, mostly veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, waiting to join Murat's army as soon he arrived in Milan.|$|E
25|$|A Turkish revival movement, the Young Turks {{took control}} of the {{government}} in 1913; they mobilized the country's society for war, employing numerous political and economic reforms. The Committee of Union and Progress, through its Committee of National Defense, fostered pan-Turkish nationalism based in Anatolia. The Young Turks created new organizations, such as the Ottoman Red Crescent Society, the Ottoman Navy League, and the Committee of National Defense, to extend their political influence to the middle class, to mobilize support for the war effort and to construct a Turkish identity. When the war broke out the sultan, in his capacity, as caliph, issued a jihad, <b>calling</b> <b>all</b> Muslims in Egypt, India and other Allied colonies to revolt against their Christian rulers. Very few listened. Meanwhile, many Arabs turned against the Turkish rulers of the Empire and collaborated with the British.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Banks and Rutherford {{decided to}} {{continue}} Genesis in 1996, {{they went to}} The Farm to start writing <b>Calling</b> <b>All</b> Stations. Rutherford initially found the sessions difficult as he saw Collins as [...] "the guy in the middle" [...] who made Banks and himself work better. Their best ideas developed in this period were put forward while they auditioned new singers, including Francis Dunnery and Nick Van Eede. The two main contenders, David Longdon of Big Big Train and Scottish singer Ray Wilson of Stiltskin, auditioned throughout 1996 which involved singing along to Genesis tracks with the lead vocals removed. Wilson was announced as the new Genesis singer in June 1997. Though much of the album was already written {{by the time he}} joined, Banks was pleased with his contributions to the album which included writing the lyrics to [...] "Small Talk" [...] and riffs on [...] "Not About Us" [...] and [...] "There Must Be Some Other Way". Banks and Rutherford opted for two drummers on <b>Calling</b> <b>All</b> Stations – Israeli session musician Nir Zidkyahu and Nick D'Virgilio of Spock's Beard.|$|E
