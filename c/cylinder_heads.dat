5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5000|$|A {{crossflow}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> {{that features}} the {{intake and exhaust}} ports on opposite sides. The gases can be thought to flow across the head. This {{is in contrast to}} reverse-flow <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> designs that have the ports on the same side.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a piezoelectric sensor {{to pick up}} compression oscillations from combustion engines and its force-fitted clamped arrangement {{in the region of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gasket between the cylinder block and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> characterized by the following features: the piezoelectric component (4) is secured permanently to a fixed axial housing wall (2 a) within a housing (2) whose thickness is definable; said housing wall (2 a) is located in a directly or indirectly elastic clamping arrangement against one of the sealing surfaces of the cylinder block (20) or <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> (21) adjacent to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gasket (11). The sensor (1) can be supported, preferably by its housing wall (2 a), in a recess (23) in one of the sealing surfaces of the cylinder block (20) or the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> (21) adjacent to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gasket (11) and is thus arranged extending through the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> gasket (11) and a groove (24) ...|$|R
5000|$|In engine technology, a {{reverse-flow}} or non-crossflow <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is {{one that}} locates the intake and exhaust ports {{on the same side}} of the engine. The gases can be thought to enter the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and then change direction in order to exit the head. This is in contrast to the crossflow <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> design.|$|R
25|$|Used {{primarily}} for testing the {{intake and exhaust}} ports of <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> of internal combustion engines. It {{is also used to}} test the flow capabilities of any component such as air filters, carburetors, manifolds or any other part that is required to flow gas. It is one of the primary tools of high performance engine builders and porting <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> would be strictly hit or miss without it.|$|E
25|$|The company's {{motorcycles}} {{are noted}} for their air-cooled 90° V-twin engines with a longitudinal crankshaft orientation where the engines' transverse <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> project prominently {{on either side}} of the motorcycle.|$|E
25|$|Full-mold casting {{is often}} used to produce <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> engine blocks, pump housings, {{automotive}} brake components, and manifolds. Commonly employed materials include aluminium, iron, steel, nickel alloys, and copper alloys.|$|E
50|$|Two plugs per cylinder, one {{centrally}} {{placed in}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> 10 degrees inclined to the vertical and the other placed nearside on the inlet side of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of modern automobile engines place the camshaft on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> in an overhead camshaft (OHC) design. There {{may be one}} or two camshafts in the cylinder head; a single camshaft design is called single overhead camshaft (SOHC). A design with two camshafts per <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is called double overhead camshaft (DOHC). Note that the camshafts are counted per <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> so a V engine with one camshaft in each of its two-cylinder heads is still an SOHC design, and a V engine with two camshafts per <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is DOHC, or informally a [...] "quad cam" [...] engine.|$|R
50|$|For {{high output}} and low fuel consumption, the MIVEC system and other {{measures}} (including optimized shaping of the intake and exhaust manifolds and <b>cylinder</b> <b>head)</b> were used to promote intake and exhaust efficiency. Optimally shaped cooling passages in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and optimal control {{of the flow of}} coolant into the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> help to suppress engine knocking. Comprehensive measures to engine components were taken to minimize friction.|$|R
25|$|The hottest {{points on}} any {{air-cooled}} engine are the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> located around {{the circumference of}} a radial engine. In order to provide sufficient air to cool the engine, airflow had to be maximized at this outer edge. This was normally accomplished by leaving {{the majority of the}} front face of the engine open to the air, causing considerable drag. During the late 1920s, NACA led development of a dramatic improvement by placing an airfoil-shaped ring around the outside of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> (the NACA cowling). The shaping accelerated the air as it entered the front of the cowl, increasing the total airflow, and allowing the opening in front of the engine to be made smaller.|$|E
25|$|AMC also {{introduced}} the Super Stock AMX. To maximize quarter-mile performance, the 390 engine {{was equipped with}} twin Holley carburetors and 12.3:1 compression-ratio <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> plus aftermarket Doug’s headers and exhaust system, and the tires were drag slicks. Hurst Performance carried out several additional modifications.|$|E
25|$|Shell mold casting {{allows the}} use of both ferrous and {{non-ferrous}} metals, most commonly using cast iron, carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel, aluminum alloys, and copper alloys. Typical parts are small-to-medium in size and require high accuracy, such as gear housings, <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> connecting rods, and lever arms.|$|E
50|$|The OM 138 has one <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> for {{all four}} cylinders. The main part are the pre{{combustion}} chambers. They are located in a 45° angle above the combustion chamber {{and placed in a}} bulge in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> Like other early OM diesel engines, the OM 138 has a sieve for fuel spraying purposes between the main combustion chamber and precombustion chamber. The injection nozzles inject fuel into the precombustion chambers, they are mounted on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and can be maintained with ease. The glowplugs are mounted underneath the injection nozzles and are easily accessible as well. On it′s precombustion chamber side, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> also has the pushrods necessary for the OHV valvetrain. The intake and outlet are at the opposite side; the intake manifold {{is a part of the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and located at it′s top.|$|R
40|$|Key words: {{abnormal}} noise; {{design of}} valve plunger; valve clearance Abstract: When designing motorcycle engine, engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> abnormal noise is common, {{and difficult to}} eliminate due to {{thermal expansion and contraction}} of the aluminum alloy <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> In this study, on the basis of dynamic change with the performance of 157 FMI engine in hot and cold, the reasons for engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> abnormal noise are analysed, and valve plunger with variable length is applied to minimize the valve clearance, and to make the valve clearance of engine in cold and hot zero, and thus the noise problem of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> with 157 FMI engine in hot is completely eliminated...|$|R

25|$|Fiat owns Teksid S.p.A., {{the largest}} iron foundry {{group in the}} world with a {{production}} capacity of approximately 600,000 tons annually. The company was established in December 1978, and designs and produces cylinder blocks, <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> exhaust manifolds, drive shafts, camshafts and other components for automobiles and commercial vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Lost-foam casting {{was invented}} in the early fifties by Canadian {{sculptor}} Armand Vaillancourt. Public recognition {{of the benefits of}} LFC was made by General Motors in the mid 1980s when it announced its new car line, Saturn, would utilize LFC for production of all engine blocks, <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> crankshafts, differential carriers, and transmission cases.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, the Testarossa used double {{wishbone}} {{front and rear}} suspension systems. Ferrari improved traction by adding 10-inch-wide alloy rear wheels. The Testarossa drivetrain was also an evolution of the BB 512i. Its engine used near identical displacement and compression ratio, but unlike the BB 512i had four-valve <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> that were finished in red.|$|E
50|$|For years, the 250-2V <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> {{was very}} popular for racing {{and many have}} been {{imported}} to North America, where owners of cars with the Falcon inline six have upgraded their engines with the better <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{start the}} Marshall a {{smouldering}} piece of special paper, containing saltpeter, is {{inserted into the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> {{by means of the}} special screw-in holder in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> (this smouldering paper acts as a glow plug).|$|R
50|$|A long-bolt or {{through-bolt}} {{engine is}} an internal combustion piston engine where, following usual practice, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is held down by bolts or studs. Conventionally the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is {{bolted to the}} cylinder block and the crankshaft main bearings are in turn bolted to the crankcase by separate bolts. In the long-bolt engine however, a single set of long bolts is used, spanning from the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> right through to the crankshaft bearing caps.|$|R
25|$|To {{deal with}} the {{enormous}} amount of mail he was receiving, in 1946 Edelbrock created the company's first catalog, Edelbrock Power and Speed Equipment, {{with the help of}} Pete Petersen. This hastened the transformation of the Edelbrock company from a repair garage into a performance parts manufacturer. Then, in 1947, Edelbrock produced the first <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> for the Ford flathead.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, it {{was decided}} that the new technologically {{advanced}} car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3L pushrod V6. The 3.3L engine's 60° block was bored out to 3.5L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5L V6.|$|E
25|$|The 618 {{features}} liquid-cooled <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> and cylinders with a {{rotary valve}} inlet and an exhaust valve. Cooling is via {{one or two}} externally mounted radiators. Lubrication is by use of pre-mixed fuel and oil at 50:1 or oil injection. The 618 has dual Ducati capacitor discharge ignition systems and is equipped with two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure.|$|E
50|$|The OPOC {{engine is}} an opposed-piston 2-stroke engine. The OPOC is a {{reciprocating}} {{internal combustion engine}} in which each cylinder has a piston at both ends, and no <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> There are no valves or a <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... {{to get rid}} of a heavy <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> as the {{opposing}} piston filled this role. <b>Cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and valvetrain systems are also among the most complex and costly elements of conventional engines, and primary contributors to heat and friction losses..|$|R
50|$|World's first <b>Cylinder</b> <b>Head</b> machine.|$|R
25|$|Douglas {{was more}} than a simple {{assembly}} plant for parts imported from Piaggio; many of the models made by Douglas had a high percentage of content manufactured by Douglas (eg <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> gear clusters, brake drums and other mechanical parts) or by UK supply companies (eg seats, carburetors, tyres, and some electrical components were made in the UK). Models made by Douglas were primarily the Vespa 125 and 150 (VBB).|$|E
25|$|The Green D.4 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the Green C.4, a 30-35hp engine used by some early aviators in the UK, such as Roe and the Short Brothers. It was an inline, water-cooled 4-cylinder piston engine with characteristic Green features: cast-steel single-piece cylinders and <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> two valves per cylinder driven by an overhead camshaft, white metal crankshaft bearings and copper water jackets, rubber-sealed to allow for differential expansion.|$|E
25|$|While {{powerful}} in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks. All used 2 bolt main bearing caps; the oiling system was undersized for high-rpm use (including Stage 1 engines) and thin {{walls in the}} lifter valleys promoted cracking. The magic of the Stage 1, it would seem, was primarily attributable to its advanced (for the period) <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> and the relatively high mid-range horsepower they produced.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The 3 D {{model of}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and cooling water channel is {{built in the}} Pro / E software, the channel model is trimmed and divided to get the grid {{correspond}} with the computational requirements in the ICEM CFD, the fluid solving parameters and boundary conditions and other related information {{is set in the}} CFX software, the solid domain and the coupling parameter is set in the ANSYS MFX module, then the temperature field of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> and waterways, wall convection heat transfer coefficient and other information is got. The overall design’s rationality can be known from the temperature field, but between two outlets of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> the highest temperature of the cooling water is 363 K, it can be known from the flow of the cooling water that this part is not easy to be cooled, further improvement of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> structure should be made to improve the cooling effect of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to predict the design {{performance}} based on the stress/strain and thermal stress behaviour of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> under various operating conditions. The effects of engine operating conditions such as combustion gas temperature and maximum internal pressure, components initial temperature and engine speed on the stress and thermal stress behaviour of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> have been analyzed. The analysis was carried out using a finite element analysis (FEA) software package, MSC. NASTRAN which is use to simulate and predict the von-Mises stress and strain pattern and thermal distribution of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> structure during the combustion process in the engine and the geometry modelling was carried out using a popular computeraided engineering tool, CATIA V 5. The result {{can be used to}} determine the quality of the design as well as identify areas which require further improvement. In this investigation, structural analyses of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> highlight several areas of interest. The maximum stress is found not exceeding the material strength of <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> and thus the basic design criteria, namely no yielding and no structural failure under firing load case, can be satisfied. In addition, the effect of thermal stress/strain provides a good indication on structural integrity and reliability of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head,</b> which can be improved {{in the early stages of}} design. This steadystate finite element method (FEM) stress analysis can play a very effective role in the rapid prototyping of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R
50|$|Valves {{are driven}} by roller-follower rocker arms with low {{friction}} roller bearings, and a unique, concave cam lobe design to increase valve lift over the traditional shimless lifter type system of the 1GR-FE. This increases overall <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> height to accommodate the slightly taller roller rocker system. Moreover, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is segmented into 3 parts: valve cover, camshaft sub-assembly housing, and <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> sub-assembly. As such, this valvetrain is used across all other GR engines with Dual VVT-i. Its service weight is 163 kg.|$|R
