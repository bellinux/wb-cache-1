25|$|The Do 32 was {{structurally}} very simple, with {{a square}} section, tapering fuselage behind the pilot. The BMW 6012L turbine and compressor {{were placed on}} top of the fuselage, immediately behind the rotor pylon. Its exhaust impinged upon a large rectangular rudder, built to resist thermal stresses, for yaw control. The horizontal tailplane was swept. The pilot sat in front of the rotor pylon, on a simple seat, carried on the lower longerons. He controlled the plane of the two-bladed rotor directly with a long curved hanging arm, and its pitch with a conventional <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>lever</b> by his left side. The rudder pedals were almost straight {{out in front of him}} on a strut that also carried, beyond his feet, some simple instruments. This member also formed part of the simple three-legged undercarriage, each strut ending with an unsprung foot.|$|E
50|$|For takeoff and landing, {{the rotor}} {{was driven by}} tip-jets. The air was {{produced}} by compressors driven through a clutch off the main engines. This was fed through ducting in {{the leading edge of}} the wings and up to the rotor head. Each engine supplied air for a pair of opposite rotors; the compressed air was mixed with fuel and burned. As a torqueless rotor system, no anti-torque correction system was required, though propeller pitch was controlled by the rudder pedals for low-speed yaw control. The propellers provided thrust for translational flight while the rotor autorotated. The cockpit controls included a cyclic and <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>lever,</b> as in a conventional helicopter.|$|E
50|$|The bladess of the three-bladed {{main rotor}} are {{attached}} to the rotor head via a lightweight and strong interleaving steel plates while tie-rods absorb direct centrifugal force under tension. The blade levers are connected via ball joints to the arms of a control spider, the cone of which being actuated up and down by the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>lever</b> in order to change to pitch of all of the blades; an irreversible mechanism is present to prevent blade loads being transferred back to the control stick. The blades are supported when still or at slow rotational speeds by droop stops, which serve to keep a level of clearance between the blades and the fuselage even under high wind conditions; these stops are withdrawn above 100 RPM so that full freedom of movement for effective flight is possible.|$|E
5000|$|The Norélic was a {{prototype}} two-seat, single rotor helicopter {{with an unusual}} anti-torque system, without a manual cyclic pitch control. Its two crew {{sat side by side}} with large, single curvature transparencies in front of them but with open cockpit sides. [...] The [...] Mathis G.7R seven-cylinder radial engine was immediately behind them, with its crankshaft vertical; the Norélic was the first French helicopter with its engine in this orientation. The driveshaft rose through the fuselage to the rotor hub, which was slightly offset forwards on a two side-by-side pillar, faired support. The Norélic had a two-blade articulated rotor with undamped flapping hinges; the blades had the same chord and aerofoil from hub to tip and were each built around a single solid spar with ribs and a thin metal skin, all clamped together. Blade pitch was automatically controlled by small servo or pilot airfoils mounted on rods at right-angles to the rotors. Though reminiscent of the servos on the Hiller 360, those on the Norélic were themselves flappable and were intended to control both cyclic pitch and the flapping amplitude of the main rotors. Thus the cockpit cyclic pitch control was absent, and instead roll was produced by sideways motion of the hub via its parallel support pillars, which separated the centres of lift and gravity. Effects due to variations in the position of the centre of gravity could be trimmed out by longitudinal movements of the hub. The servo blades also served as rotor speed governors; restrained by springs, they could slide outward as the rotor speed began to increase, increasing the pitch and the associated drag to decrease the speed. <b>Collective</b> <b>pitch</b> was thus primarily determined by throttle setting, though there was a <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> override <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} is used {{to provide}} the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most {{likely to occur in}} conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the [...] "dew point spread"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> control <b>lever.</b> Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).|$|R

50|$|The Sycamore {{is powered}} by a single Alvis Leonides piston engine, capable of {{outputting}} 550 hp of thrust. The engine is mounted on below and {{to the rear of the}} main rotor on a flexible mounting in order to reduce vibrations. It is isolated within a fireproof casing, the compartment is also fitted with fire extinguishing equipment that conformed with the relevant regulations of the era. Cooling is achieved via air drawn through a forward-set grill, actively cooling the gearbox prior to passing through the engine cowling and exiting the fuselage. Control of the engine is linked to the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>lever,</b> power being automatically controlled by the rotor pitch setting being commanded; fine adjustment of engine power is achieved via twisting actions on the pitch handle lever. The Sycamore had a relatively high rotor speed for the era, which was claimed to deliver increased smoothness during flight and provide for a safety advantage in the event of engine failure.|$|E
5000|$|The pod seats two {{side-by-side}} {{behind a}} full clear forward transparency. Its skin is carbon fibre over a titanium alloy tube frame. Tandem controls are fitted, with {{two sets of}} anti-torque pedals and a T-shaped cyclic control centrally mounted on a console; the single <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>lever</b> is placed between the seats. A governor sets the throttle {{in the absence of}} pilot input and trim is applied electrically. Small baggage can be stored in under seat lockers. Cabin access is through forward hinged doors in each side. [...] A [...] Rotax 914 turbocharged, liquid cooled, flat four piston engine with narrow rectangular cheek radiators is mounted behind the seats and partly exposed at the rear, driving a two blade main rotor. [...] The helicopter lands on skids, transversely braced by a pair of airfoil section struts and positioned below the pod on two pairs of similar outward leaning struts, producing a skid track of 1.585 m.|$|E

The aircraft was also stowed in a trailer, transported, unfolded and flown. The heavy rotor could be spun up before takeoff with zero pitch, containing enough energy for a rapid initial vertical climb or jump start, autogyro fashion. All three were eventually lost in accidents with different causes. Though Dornier had hopes of large Army orders, none followed. Agricultural applications were considered, and there was a design project for the Do 32Z, a two-seat version with a bigger engine, but no more manned Do 32s flew. The unflown fourth prototype is on display at the Deutsches Museum, painted as the first prototype D-HOPA. The Do 32U was a pilotless version of the Do 32E, very similar, apart from the missing seat. The Do 32K, developed into the Do 34, was also an unmanned drone with compressed air-driven rotors, but without a fuselage.|$|E

50|$|Coaxial rotors {{solve the}} problem of main rotor torque by turning each set of rotors in {{opposite}} directions. The opposite torques from the rotors cancel each other out. Rotational maneuvering, yaw control, is accomplished by increasing the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> of one rotor and decreasing the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> on the other. This causes a controlled dissymmetry of torque.|$|R
40|$|The X- 22 A {{has four}} ducted {{propellers}} and four engines. The engines {{are connected to}} a common system of rotating shafts which distribute propulsive power to the four propellers. Changes {{in the direction of}} the thrust vector are accomplished by rotating the ducts, which are interconnected so that all rotate through the same angle. Thrust magnitude is determined by a <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>lever,</b> very similar to a helicopter. There are four variable stability system (VSS) controllers: thrust, pitch, roll, and yaw, and three artificial feel servos for the evaluation pilot cockpit controls, each employing electrohydraulic servos. Longitudinal flying qualities for STOL landing approach, and lateral-directional flying qualities and control power requirements for STOL landing approach are discussed. Attention is given to the data acquisition and processing system...|$|E
50|$|For {{helicopters}} with contra-rotating rotors—also {{known as}} Coaxial mounted—one {{over the other}} on the same rotor shaft (Like a Kamov KA-50), helicopter control requires interaction between the two rotors. Howevererent rotor masts (Like a Boeing CH-47 Chinook) uses differential <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> to change the pitch attitude of the aircraft. To pitch nose down and accelerate forward, the pilot decreases <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> on the front rotor and increases <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> on the rear rotor proportionally. Conversely, the synchropter and transverse-mounted rotor counter rotating rotorcraft have two large horizontal rotor assemblies mounted side by side, (like a Bell/Boeing V-22 tilt rotor) helicopters use differential <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> to affect the roll of the aircraft. All of these configurations use differential cyclic pitch to control movement about the yaw axis, tilting the rotors in opposite directions to cause the aircraft to spin {{in the direction of the}} tilted rotors.|$|R

This was to reinforce this important step for trainee pilots.|$|R
25|$|Secondary flight {{controls}} include the rotor transmission clutch, {{also known as}} a pre-rotator, which when engaged drives the rotor to start it spinning before takeoff, and <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> to reduce blade pitch before driving the rotor. <b>Collective</b> <b>pitch</b> controls are not usually fitted to autogyros, but {{can be found on the}} Air & Space 18A and McCulloch J-2 and the Westermayr Tragschrauber and are capable of near VTOL performance. Unlike a helicopter, autogyros without <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> or another jump start facility need a runway to take off; however, they are capable of landing with a very short or zero ground roll. Like helicopters, each autogyro has a specific height–velocity diagram for safest operation, although the dangerous area is usually smaller than for helicopters.|$|R
50|$|The {{most visible}} {{characteristic}} of the W.9 was torque compensation and directional control by using blown air rather than a tail propeller. A variable pitch fan cooled the engine; the heated air and engine exhaust passed through the long hollow tailboom and exhausted to port. Foot pedals controlled the fan pitch. Of more importance, however, was the hydraulically-powered shaft-driven tilting rotor hub with rotational speed variation to give automatic <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> control. Development of the rotor system resulted in a tilting hub combined with cyclic pitch control of each blade to minimize control forces. Manual control of <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> {{was added to the}} automatic <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> change system to provide precise vertical control in hover and the ability to cushion a landing from an autorotative descent.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{nonlinear}} model predictive controller with individual pitch control for a floating {{offshore wind turbine}} is presented. An aerodynamic model of the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> control approach is extended by describing pitching and yawing moments based on rotor disk theory. This extension is implemented in a reduced nonlinear model of the floating wind turbine including disturbance preview of wind speed, linear vertical and horizontal wind shear, and wave height to compute optimal input trajectories for the individual pitch control inputs and the generator torque. An extended cost functional for individual pitch control is proposed based on the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> control approach. The controller is evaluated in aero-servo-hydro-elastic simulations of a 5 MW reference wind turbine disturbed by a three-dimensional stochastic turbulent wind field.
