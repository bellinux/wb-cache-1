5000|$|The Effects of <b>Cross</b> and Self <b>Fertilisation</b> in the Vegetable Kingdom {{is a book}} on {{evolution}} in plants by Charles Darwin, first published in 1876. In this book Darwin examines the effects of <b>cross</b> and self <b>fertilisation</b> of plants and provides experimental evidence for a hypothesis stated in his famed book of 1859, Origin of Species, that [...] "... in none plant ...can self-fertilisation go on for perpetuity" [...] (Origin, p. 101). He reports on experiments conducted on over 60 different species of plants, where he used controlled pollinations {{in order to produce}} self-fertilised and cross-fertilised descendants. Through growth experiments of this progeny, he concluded that self-fertilised progeny performed poorer in most species and for most traits measured. Thus he showed that inbreeding may have severe detrimental effects on progeny. While this idea was accepted by many, e.g. plant and animal breeders, Darwin's book provided overwhelming experimental support for this idea. This book has remained the starting point for the study of inbreeding and is cited in scientific papers to this effect to this day.|$|R

6000|$|So {{far back}} as 1793, the {{wonderful}} work of Sprengel had established, beyond any reasonable doubt, the fact that, in {{a large number of}} cases, a flower is a piece of mechanism the object of which is to convert insect visitors into agents of fertilisation. Sprengel's observations had been most undeservedly neglected and well-nigh forgotten; but Robert Brown having directed Darwin's attention to them in 1841, he was attracted towards the subject, and verified many of Sprengel's statements. (III, p. 258.) It may be doubted whether there was a living botanical specialist, except perhaps Brown, who had done as much. If, however, adaptations of this kind were to be explained by natural selection, it was necessary to show that the plants which were provided with mechanisms for ensuring the aid of insects as fertilisers, were by so much the better fitted to compete with their rivals. This Sprengel had not done. Darwin had been attending to <b>cross</b> <b>fertilisation</b> in plants so {{far back as}} 1839, from having arrived, {{in the course of his}} speculations on the origin of species, at the conviction [...] "that crossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant" [...] (I, p. 90). The further development of his views on the importance of <b>cross</b> <b>fertilisation</b> appears to have taken place between this time and 1857, when he published his first papers on the fertilisation of flowers in the [...] "Gardener's Chronicle." [...] If the conclusion at which he ultimately arrived, that <b>cross</b> <b>fertilisation</b> is favourable to the fertility of the parent and to the vigour of the offspring, is correct, then it follows that all those mechanisms which hinder self-fertilisation and favour crossing must be advantageous in the struggle for existence; and, the more perfect the action of the mechanism, the greater the advantage. Thus the way lay open for the operation of natural selection in gradually perfecting the flower as a fertilisation-trap. Analogous reasoning applies to the fertilising insect. The better its structure is adapted to that of the trap, the more will it be able to profit by the bait, whether of honey or of pollen, to the exclusion of its competitors. Thus, by a sort of action and reaction, a two-fold series of adaptive modifications will be brought about.|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{cultivated}} plants {{rarely or never}} intercross, for instance, the common pea and sweet-pea (Lathyrus odoratus); yet their flowers are certainly adapted for <b>cross</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> The varieties of the tomato and aubergine (Solanum) and the pimenta (Pimenta vulgaris?) are said (15/16. Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page 72.) never to cross, even when growing alongside one another. But it should be observed that these are all exotic plants, {{and we do not}} know how they would behave in their native country when visited by the proper insects. With respect to the common pea, I have ascertained that it is rarely crossed in this country owing to premature fertilisation. There exist, however, some plants which under their natural conditions appear to be always self-fertilised, such as the Bee Ophrys (Ophrys apifera) and a few other Orchids; yet these plants exhibit the plainest adaptations for cross-fertilisation. Again, some few plants are believed to produce only closed flowers, called cleistogene, which cannot possibly be crossed. This was long thought to be the case with the Leersia oryzoides (15/17. Duval Jouve 'Bull. Soc. Bot. de France' tome 10 1863 page 194. With respect to the perfect flowers setting seed see Dr. Ascherson in 'Bot.

His ideas on evolution were increasingly accepted in scientific circles despite some bitter disputes, and he received numerous honours.

5000|$|The {{major benefit}} of {{cross-fertilisation}} is generally {{thought to be}} the avoidance of inbreeding depression. Charles Darwin, in his 1876 book The Effects of <b>Cross</b> and Self <b>Fertilisation</b> in the Vegetable Kingdom (pages 466-467) summed up his findings in the following way.“It has been shown in the present volume that the offspring from the union of two distinct individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have an immense advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigour and fertility over the self-fertilised offspring from one of the same parents. And this fact is amply sufficient to account {{for the development of the}} sexual elements, that is, for the genesis of the two sexes.” ...|$|R

60|$|A year later, in 1876, {{came the}} 'Effects of <b>Cross</b> and Self <b>Fertilisation</b> in the Vegetable Kingdom.'

40|$|Historians {{of science}} have long {{recognized}} that agricultural institutions {{helped shape the}} first generation of geneticists, but the importance of academic biology to scientific agriculture has remained largely unexplored. This dissertation charts the relationship between evolutionary thought and industrial agriculture from Charles Darwin's research program of the nineteenth century through the development of professional genetics {{in the first quarter of}} the twentieth century. It does this by focusing on a single topic that was important simultaneously to evolutionary thinkers as a conceptual challenge and to agriculturalists as a technique for modifying organism populations: the intensive inbreeding of livestock and crops. Chapter One traces zoological inbreeding and botanical self-fertilization in Darwin's research from his articles published in The gardeners' chronicle in the 1840 s and 1850 s through his The effects of <b>cross</b> and self <b>fertilisation</b> in the vegetable kingdom of 1876. In doing so, it demonstrates how Darwin metaphorically linked natural selection to methodical selection in order to authorize the naturalist to become an experimental evolutionist. It also explores the potential of Darwin's program as an ideology for actors intent on transforming the political economy of agriculture. Chapter Two moves away from scholarly discussions of evolution to consider how intensive inbreeding was pioneered as a method for modifying crops by the Bureau of Plant Industry of the U. S. Department of Agriculture between 1897 and 1907, the decade following William Jennings Bryan's loss to William McKinley in the election of 1896. By analyzing both Robert Bakewell's livestock inbreeding system of the eighteenth century and Archibald Shamel's Connecticut River tobacco self-fertilization program of the early twentieth, the chapter explains the political economy of intensive inbreeding. It concludes by exploring the broader context of the experiments devoted to livestock inbreeding that George Rommel initiated at the Bureau of Animal Industry of the U. S. Department of Agriculture in the early 1900 s. Chapter Three combines the intellectual history of Chapter One with the political and economic history of Chapter Two by illustrating how the research program of experimental evolution that Darwin formulated in the nineteenth century mapped onto the large-scale industrial agriculture projects of the USDA between 1903 and 1925. The chapter follows ideas on inbreeding as they moved across various academic and professional communities, paying particular attention to institutional arrangements like the American Breeders' Association and the Bussey Institution of Harvard University that facilitated these transfers. It also examines various inbred organism populations that became prototypes for industrial production and the scientists who became their shepherds: the Wistar rats of Helen Dean King, the hybrid corn of Edward Murray East and Donald Forsha Jones, and the guinea pigs of Sewall Wright...|$|R
60|$|The lessened {{fertility}} of most {{of these}} illegitimate plants is in many respects a highly remarkable phenomenon. Thirty-three plants in the seven classes were subjected to various trials, and the seeds carefully counted. Some of them were artificially fertilised, but the far greater number were freely fertilised (and this is the better and natural plan) {{through the agency of}} insects, by other illegitimate plants. In the right hand, or percentage column, in Table 5.30, a wide difference in fertility between the plants in the first four and the last three classes may be perceived. In the first four classes the plants are descended from the three forms illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken from the same form, but only rarely from the same plant. It is necessary to observe this latter circumstance; for, as I have elsewhere shown, most plants, when fertilised with their own pollen, or that from the same plant, are in some degree sterile, and the seedlings raised from such unions are likewise in some degree sterile, dwarfed, and feeble. (5/3. 'The Effects of <b>Cross</b> and Self- <b>fertilisation</b> in the Vegetable Kingdom' 1876.) None of the nineteen illegitimate plants in the first four classes were completely fertile; one, however, was nearly so, yielding 96 per cent of the proper number of seeds. From this high degree of fertility we have many descending gradations, till we reach an absolute zero, when the plants, though bearing many flowers, did not produce, during successive years, a single seed or even seed-capsule. Some of the most sterile plants did not even yield a single seed when legitimately fertilised with pollen from legitimate plants. There is good {{reason to believe that the}} first seven plants in Class 1 and 2 were the offspring of a long-styled plant fertilised with pollen from its own-form shortest stamens, and these plants were the most sterile of all. The remaining plants in Class 1 and 2 were almost certainly the product of pollen from the mid-length stamens, and although very sterile, they were less so than the first set. None of the plants in the first four classes attained their full and proper stature; the first seven, which were the most sterile of all (as already stated), were by far the most dwarfed, several of them never reaching to half their proper height. These same plants did not flower at so early an age, or at so early a period in the season, as they ought to have done. The anthers in many of their flowers, and in the flowers of some other plants in the first six classes, were either contabescent or included numerous small and shrivelled pollen-grains. As the suspicion at one time occurred to me that the lessened fertility of the illegitimate plants might be due to the pollen alone having been affected, I may remark that this certainly was not the case; for several of them, when fertilised by sound pollen from legitimate plants, did not yield the full complement of seeds; hence it is certain that both the female and male reproductive organs were affected. In each of the seven classes, the plants, though descended from the same parents, sown at the same time and in the same soil, differed much in their average degree of fertility.|$|R

5000|$|FOR over 20 {{years the}} work of cross-fertilising crop plants, with the object of {{producing}} New and Improved Breeds, has been carried on at Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire. It has there {{for the first time}} been demonstrated to Scientific Botanists as well as to Agriculturists that all the corn crops (cereals) and nearly all the other common crops of the farm are self fertilising. In other words, each individual plant provides the pollen which is required in the process of producing seed, to fertilise the female organs of its own flowers. This natural process results in a perfect system of in-breeding which {{has been going on for}} an indefinite period, making it possible to grow the different varieties of crops of the same kind in close proximity to each other, and even as mixed crops without any danger of crosses being produced. If crossing could have occurred in nature it would have been quite impossible to maintain the purity of any variety of crop plant for more than a year or two. As in the Animal Kingdom, the in-breeding of plants tends to the decrease of constitutional vigour, consequently when cross-fertilisation is practised the size and vigour of the selected progeny are increased in a remarkable degree. Although the natural laws which govern the Animal and the Vegetable Kingdoms bear a very strong resemblance to each other, further points can be realised and greater progress can be made in a limited time with plants than with animals under a system of cross breeding. Not only have varieties of a given species, but what were formerly regarded as distinct species belonging to the same genus, been successfully mated. The tendency to sterility in their progeny is overcome by introducing pollen from one or other '01' the original plants, it being the male organs of reproduction that are liable to be absent or defective in the progeny of two extremely divergent parent plants. Many varieties as well as species can thus be blended in the formation of a new breed, but as it is necessary to secure fixity of type in every cross bred plant before it is again used for crossing, the labour and care involved are very considerable. Attempts at the production of first crosses are not new, as these have been practised for many years by experimenters in the same field, who however stopped short of the point at which the Garton System achieved its greatest results, viz. by compound or multiple crossing.

For example, an inferior variety of [...] "spelt" [...] wheat Triticum spelta from Southern Asia, has been employed with excellent results to introduce strength of gluten to the grain, and large yielding and standing power to the crop with immunity from shedding its seed during harvest. A wild naked Oat, Avena nuda, indigenous to China has been used to produce new breeds which yield in some instances 100 per cent. more than their cultivated parents. Four or five grains are suspended in each spikelet by a thread like filament about half-an-inch long. This peculiar habit of the plant 'has been extended in the progeny and an' accompanying illustration shows a spikelet with no fewer than 14 grains in it. The hardiness of constitution, standing power of straw, and remarkable fertility of the wild or land oat, Avena fatua, of Great Britain have been successfully introduced, but not without many difficulties, into some of the new breeds. Some progress has also been made with the improvement of existing varieties of Agricultural plants by introducing pollen from plants of the same variety to increase the vigour of the plant without materially altering its general characteristics.|$|E
