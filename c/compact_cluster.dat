40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{specific}} population of galactic PeVatrons {{which may be}} the main source of the galactic cosmic-ray (CR) component well above PeV energies. Supernovae in <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> of massive stars are proposed as powerful sources of CRs, neutrinos, and gamma-ray emission. Numerical simulations of non-linear Fermi acceleration at converging shock flows have revealed that these accelerators can provide very hard spectra of protons up to 10 ^ 16 - 10 ^ 17 eV which is well above the "knee" in the all-particle CR spectrum at about 3 × 10 ^ 15 eV. We suggest that known supernova remnants interacting with stellar winds in the <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> of young massive stars Westerlund I and Cl* 1806 - 20 can be associated with the sources of the TeV gamma-ray emission detected by H. E. S. S. and may be responsible for a fraction of the high-energy neutrinos detected with the IceCube observatory. A recent CR composition measurement with the LOFAR array has revealed a light-mass component possibly dominating the all-particle spectrum at energies around 10 ^ 17 eV. Such a strong light component (mainly protons and helium) may require specific galactic CR sources such as supernovae interacting with <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> of massive stars in addition to isolated supernova remnants.

40|$|Nearby dwarf {{irregular}} galaxies were {{searched for}} <b>compact</b> star <b>clusters</b> {{using data from}} the HST archives. Eight of the 22 galaxies in our sample were found to host <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> of some type. Three of these have populous clusters, with MV < − 9. 5 at a fiducial age of 10 Myr, and the same three also have superstar clusters, with MV < − 10. 5 at 10 Myr. Four other dwarf galaxies, two of which contain populous and super-star clusters, are also considered using data in the literature. The results suggest that galaxies fainter than MB = − 16 or with star formation rates less than 0. 003 M ⊙ yr− 1 kpc− 2 do not form populous or super-star clusters, and that even the brighter and more active dwarfs rarely form them. Yet when they do form, the associated star formation activity is very high, with numerous <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> of similar age in the same complex and evidence for a galaxy-wide perturbation as the trigger. This tendency to concentrate star formation in localized regions of high column density is consistent with previous suggestions that self-gravity must be strong and the pressure must be high t...|$|R

40|$|Starforming {{factories}} in galaxies produce <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> and loose associations of young massive stars. Fast radiation-driven winds and supernovae input their huge kinetic power into {{the interstellar medium}} {{in the form of}} highly supersonic and superalfvenic outflows. Apart from gas heating, collisionless relaxation of fast plasma outflows results in fluctuating magnetic fields and energetic particles. The energetic particles comprise a long-lived component which may contain a sizeable fraction of the kinetic energy released by the winds and supernova ejecta and thus modify the magnetohydrodynamic flows in the systems. We present a concise review of observational data and models of nonthermal emission from starburst galaxies, superbubbles, and <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> of massive stars. Efficient mechanisms of particle acceleration and amplification of fluctuating magnetic fields with a wide dynamical range in starburst regions are discussed. Sources of cosmic rays, neutrinos and multi-wavelength nonthermal emission associated with starburst regions including potential galactic "PeVatrons" are reviewed in the global galactic ecology context.

40|$|We use {{numerical}} simulations {{to investigate}} the interaction of an f-mode wave packet with small and large models of a sunspot in a stratified atmosphere. While a loose cluster model has been largely studied before, we focus in this study on the scattering from an ensemble of tightly compact tubes. We showed that the small <b>compact</b> <b>cluster</b> produces a slight distorted scattered wave field in the transverse direction, which {{can be attributed to}} the simultaneous oscillations of the pairs of tubes within the cluster aligned in a perpendicular direction to the incoming wave. However, no signature of a multiple-scattering regime has been observed from this model, while it has been clearly observable for the large <b>compact</b> <b>cluster</b> model. Furthermore, we pointed out the importance of the geometrical shape of the monolithic model on the interaction of f-mode waves with a sunspot in a high frequency range (ν = 5 mHz). These results are a contribution to the observational effort to distinguish seismically between different configurations of magnetic flux tubes within sunspots and plage.

40|$|Most stars form {{as part of}} a star cluster. The most massive {{clusters}} in the Milky Way {{exist in}} two groups - loose and <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> - with significantly different sizes {{at the end of the}} star formation process. After their formation both types of clusters expand up to a factor 10 - 20 within the first 20 Myr. Gas expulsion at the end of the star formation process is usually regarded as only possible process that can lead to such an expansion. We investigate the effect of gas expulsion by a direct comparison between numerical models and observed clusters concentrating on clusters with masses > 10 ^ 3 M(sun). For these clusters the initial conditions before gas expulsion, the characteristic cluster development, its dependence on cluster mass, and the star formation efficiency (SFE) are investigated. We perform N-body simulations of the cluster expansion process after gas expulsion and compare the results with observations. We find that the expansion processes of the observed loose and <b>compact</b> massive <b>clusters</b> are driven by completely different physical processes. As expected the expansion of loose massive clusters is largely driven by the gas loss due to the low SFE of ~ 30 %. One new revelation is that all the observed massive clusters of this group seem to have a very similar size of 1 - 3 pc at the onset of expansion. It is demonstrated that <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> have a much higher effective SFE of 60 - 70 % and are as a result much less affected by gas expulsion. Their expansion is mainly driven by stellar ejections caused by interactions between the cluster members. The reason why ejections are so efficient in driving cluster expansion is that they occur dominantly from the cluster centre and over an extended period of time. Thus during the first 10 Myr the internal dynamics of loose and <b>compact</b> <b>clusters</b> differ fundamentally. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures, accepted by A&...|$|R
