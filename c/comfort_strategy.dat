40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{thermal comfort}} for naturally ventilated housing in Iran with special reference to Ilam. An important {{aim was to}} establish the neutral temperature and the acceptable range of environmental conditions for Dam people in their houses. The methodology used for this aIm was field studies. These studies {{were divided into two}} parts- one in the hot season and the other in the cool season. The results showed a good relationship between neutral temperature and mean indoor temperature and also between outdoor temperature and neutral temperature. The indoor comfort temperature (Tn), which is dependent on outdoor temperature (Tom), could be found from the following equation: Tn = 17. 3 + 0. 36 Tom The findings of the study revealed that the Ilam people could achieve comfort at higher indoor air temperatures compared with the recommendations by international standards like ISO 7730. The results also showed that passive systems as a main <b>comfort</b> <b>strategy</b> could be applied to housing design in Ilam. By using the results of this study, strategies to minimise housing energy consumption, not only for Ilam but also for other regions, which have similar climates and cultures to Ilam, can be proposed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} proposed comfortable housing model as thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>strategy</b> in orang asli house in Malaysia. The Government has implemented specific development programmes for the indigenous community or the orang asli, which included {{economic and social}} programmes to improve their standard of living. One such special programme is called the Hard-Core Poor Development Programme (PPRT). The new PPRT house initiated by {{the government is not}} only small but has heat-trapping zinc roofs and concrete walls. This house indicated uncomfortable condition compare to the existing orang asli house. Unfortunately, the architectural design solutions do not permit good passive cooling for thermal comfort. This can be illustrated by the high indoor temperature experienced during the day time. In this research, Proposed Comfortable PPRT House Model has been suggested by adopting traditional orang asli house element and lifestyle as much as possible as alternative techniques for achieving passive cooling. The thermal comfort study in this research involved the use of computer simulation using Integrated Environment Solution (IES) technique. The specific software called Apache is used. Validation of IES Apache is done by comparing the computer simulation result with the field measurement result on existing house model. The result of the Proposed Comfortable PPRT House Model showed that the house model increased thermal comfort performance by reducing air temperature (until 2 Â°C) and PMV index (until 1). The other important factor is that it can continuously maintain the comfortable condition in mid day regardless of the available outside climate condition. This effect is significant toward improving the thermal comfort performance of PPRT house designed for orang asli through passive cooling, thus provide comfortable healthy and low energy house...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we tested whether children’s play with {{feminine}} toys {{is related to}} social abilities in which girls typically excel. We measured gender-typed toy play, empathy, and comforting skill in 80 Grade 1 children (about 6 years-old) in Hong Kong, China. Toy play was assessed with a standard observational paradigm; empathy, with the Empathy Quotient-Child questionnaire; and comforting skill, with an infant-cry paradigm requiring the generation of <b>comforting</b> <b>strategies.</b> As predicted, boys and girls differed in their preferences for play with masculine and feminine toys, but not for gender-neutral toys. Importantly, toy play was related to comforting skill. Girls scored higher on the comforting task, and girls who played more with feminine toys and boys who played more with gender-neutral toys generated more <b>comforting</b> <b>strategies.</b> Regression and mediational analyses also suggested a stronger role of gender-typed play on comforting {{than the other way}} round. Contrary to hypothesis, there was no gender difference in empathy, and no relationship between empathy and toy play. These results extend previous understandings of the link between play and development and suggest that early gender-typed experiences may have long-term consequences for the development of some social skills...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{improvement}} in {{the standard of living}} requires more detailed and sophisticated methods of evaluating comfort conditions. But, maintaining thermal comfort conditions in confined environments may require complex regulation procedures and the proper management of heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. In turn, the requirements for indoor thermal comfort do not necessarily coincide with those of energy saving purposes, which in the last years are becoming a crucial issue owing to the enactment of the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). The aim of this work is to compare different indoor control thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>strategies</b> in view of the evaluation of the energy cost of quality in buildings. In particular, a new PID-fuzzy controller is presented and compared with a classic ON-OFF controller. The performances of the two controllers are quantified and compared by means of two cost functions that are based on the quadratic forms of the overall energy required by the thermal fluid and of the deviation from the preferred set point of the predicted mean vote (PMV). It is found that the application of the PID-fuzzy controller results in lower costs of energy input and lower deviation from set point of PM...|$|R

40|$|The {{strategy}} for approaching a manual work position {{is an important}} reference for describing a goal-directed task. However, knowledge on this aspect of human behavior is scarce. The objectives {{of this study are}} twofold: (1) to describe and understand the strategy people tend to adopt for approaching a manual work position from different directions when their initial standing position is three meters away, and (2) to describe the working posture they tend to adopt when operating a pistol-grip hand tool at different heights. An experiment involving eight participants was conducted to measure the whole-body position and orientation when approaching a work position from five directions. The working posture adopted when operating a pistol-grip hand tool at six working heights was examined. The results indicate that the final whole-body position and orientation (while performing the operation) was affected significantly by the approach direction. A linear relationship between the approach direction and the final whole-body orientation was obtained. The participants adopted a strategy combining the work efficiency and <b>comfort</b> <b>strategies.</b> They deviated from the least-distance (straight line) walking path and re-oriented their whole body for the operation when approaching the work position. The working posture was significantly affected by the working height. The working postures at six working heights were established. The participants adopted a standing posture when the working height was between eye and hip height, and a stooping or squatting posture when operating at knee and ankle height. The results of this study can be used to enhance digital human modeling motion generated for human movement simulation. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Clinicians’ {{recognition}} of patients’ concerns {{is an important}} component of effective treatment and care. During a consultation, patients often do not express their concerns directly, but rather present them indirectly as hints or cues. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the types of concerns and cues patients expressed in an initial consultation with a nurse at a pain clinic, how and who initiated these cues and concerns, and predictors of these expressions. Methods: Initial consultations between patients with fibromyalgia [n= 58, 85 % female, duration 30 minutes, mean age 47. 8 y (SD 10. 7) ] and clinical nurse specialists (n= 5) were videotaped. Patients’ cues and concerns were coded using the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences. Nurses’ responses to patients’ cues and concerns were evaluated using the Hierarchical Coding Scheme of <b>Comforting</b> <b>Strategies.</b> In addition, pain intensity and duration, overall evaluation of health, affect at the start of the consultation, and psychological distress were evaluated. Results: Patients expressed more cues than concerns, mostly about pain, interpersonal relationships, and/or emotional reactions. Both the lack of empathic responding and unspecific empathic responding were associated with the expression of an increased number of cues in the consultation, whereas higher evaluation of health was associated with less cues. More concerns were expressed by patients when nurses exhibited a high level of empathic responding and when the patient entered the consultation with a higher level of negative effect. Discussion: Findings from this study highlight the importance of a patient centered communication style to facilitate the expression of cues and concerns.

40|$|The lack of seismic {{provisions}} for non‐engineered buildings {{in developing countries}} is corroborated by the high fatality rates during earthquakes and {{is a source of}} major concern. As a means for promoting seismic retrofitting among the low‐income population in India, this study investigates the integration of passive thermal comfort features with retrofitting techniques in order to provide day‐to‐day benefits in addition to the structural safety required for earthquakes. Three separate regions in India with the same level of seismic risk and differing climatic conditions are addressed in this study in order to consider the varying thermal comfort requirements within the same required level of seismic resistance. These are: Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, and Sikkim, which are typical of hot‐dry, composite and cold climates respectively, and are located in areas with high seismicity (Seismic zone IV by Indian seismic code standards). The development of suitable integrative techniques is not solely a structural challenge. A thorough understanding of the population and their needs, the climate and geographical landscape, and most importantly, of the previous research regarding thermal comfort and seismic retrofitting for developing countries is essential. This has been achieved through a literature review, which provides the theoretical framework and identifies which seismic and thermal <b>comfort</b> <b>strategies</b> are appropriate for which type of constructions and climates respectively. Following this, a research‐by‐design methodology is employed to formulate possible integrative solutions. The study finds that the possibilities of integrating passive thermal comfort features with seismic retrofitting for non‐engineered houses are limited. However, the few proposed integrative solutions do have the potential to improve thermal comfort inside the houses in an energy efficient manner if developed further. They are expected to be beneficial for many regions of the developing world which have similar seismic and climatic characteristics...|$|R

The first section of this chapter (written by Martincigh) deals with some essential indicators devised both for evaluating the current urban situation and for guiding choices {{to be made in the}} design of a pedestrian environment, meeting users’ needs and expectations as much as possible. After that explanation of the role of the indicators and the reason why it is worthwhile to make use of them, it is reported how the indicators for the walking environment can be connected to the Common European Indicators related to urban sustainability, and in particular to sustainable mobility. The core of this part of the essay concerns the choice of the specific aspects such indicators have to govern and the description of the proposed ones, that points out briefly only their most important features, as the definition and the meaning, the main goal and the reference values for the assessment. Five indicators have been chosen because these seem to be the most appropriate to the matter at hand; they are related to the basic requirements/performances of accessibility, safety and use. As an example of the catalogue that was developed in other research studies, the form related to one of them is reported. In the second section (written by Tonelli), the chapter deals with some measures devised for improving the walking environment as regards the accessibility and comfort requirements: the former has been chosen since it is the basic condition for enabling pedestrians to use the urban spaces, the latter has been chosen since it represents an ever-increasing exigency, consequent to urban pollution problems and to climatic changes.

A study was carried out in four typical mosques in Malaysia to investigate the thermal comfort level together with what and how the thermal comfort factors affecting the condition. They study also looks at the influence of roof design of the mosque in affecting thermal condition inside the prayer hall since the roof design is a significant feature of the building not only as a filter to the outdoor climate but also as the identity of the building and the society. From the investigation, it has been revealed that air temperature is the primary factor in affecting thermal comfort. When the air temperature is at neutral or comfort temperature, the presence of other factors can be ignored. However, when the primary factor is no longer at its neutral condition, the secondary factors which are air movement and humidity will play their roles in influencing thermal comfort in naturally ventilated mosques in Malaysia. In many cases, air movement is always desirable and able to improve the thermal comfort level. Therefore, the need for the availability of air movement should be particularly considered in designing a mosque to ensure that the mosque is thermally comfortable. The research has also discovered that the pitched and doomed roofs have different abilities to control the distribution of air, for examples, the pitch roof mosque has the ability to circulate the air inside the prayer hall to achieve the equilibrium state whereas the domed roof mosque has the ability to stratify the air according to the temperature where the coolest air located at the lowest level of the space. With the pitch roof, a mosque is able to create air movement inside the space whereas the dome roof mosque will provide stagnant but cooler air at the active level due to the stratification process. Due to these findings, the pitched roof mosque is considered a better option for this climate for its ability to provide natural air circulation inside the space which is desirable by the users. With the understanding on the ability of the roof designs namely, domed and pitched roof in controlling air movement of the interior and the interdependencies of the main factors affecting thermal <b>comfort,</b> <b>strategies</b> for improvement on the design of the mosque can be made to achieve better indoor thermal condition of the prayer hall...|$|R
