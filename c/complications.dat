5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, <b>complications</b> of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening <b>complications).</b> <b>Complications</b> of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from <b>complications</b> of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
40|$|Aorto-atrial fistula {{is a rare}} <b>complication</b> of {{prosthetic}} {{aortic valve}} replacement (AVR) {{and most of them}} have been diagnosed as a late <b>complication.</b> We present a case of this unusual <b>complication</b> after AVR.

25|$|Post {{operative}} {{sciatic nerve}} palsy is another possible <b>complication.</b> The incidence of this <b>complication</b> is low. Femoral nerve palsy is another {{but much more}} rare <b>complication.</b> Both of these will typically resolve over time, but the healing process is slow. Patients with pre-existing nerve injury {{are at greater risk}} of experiencing this <b>complication</b> and are also slower to recover.|$|R

5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term <b>complications</b> are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation. After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal ligation, <b>complications</b> occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious <b>complications</b> usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|<b>Complications</b> are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral <b>complications.</b> TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause <b>complications</b> including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. <b>Complications</b> involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion Our {{retrospective}} analysis confirms previously published results [1, 2] that patients presented {{a very low}} rate of <b>complication.</b> Serious <b>complication</b> occurred in < 10  % of patients and consisted in requirement of EVD. Perimesencephalic was never associated with early or late serious <b>complication.</b>|$|R
40|$|Therapy induced {{leukoencephalopathy}} is a known <b>complication</b> {{for children}} receiving high dose intravenous methotrexate. It may present as seizure or focal neurological deficit but fortunately the neurological deficits are often transient. We reported 2 local {{patients who had}} this <b>complication</b> and no gross persistent neurological <b>complication</b> were noted. From the literature and our experience, MRI is a more sensitive modality in picking up such <b>complication</b> and aminophylline may have a role as a prophylactic agent. A prospective study with appropriate neuropsychological assessment and long term follow-up on patients with this <b>complication</b> is needed to delineate the actual impact of this clinical phenomenon. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} codes {{can be described as}} both data reduction and data <b>complication.</b> Data <b>complication</b> can be described as going beyond the data and asking questions about the data to generate frameworks and theories. The <b>complication</b> of data is used to expand on data to create new questions and interpretation of the data. Researchers should make certain that the coding process does not lose more information than is gained. Tesch (1990) defines data <b>complication</b> as the process of reconceptualizing the data giving new contexts for the data segments. Data <b>complication</b> serves as a means of providing new contexts for the way data is viewed and analyzed.|$|R
5|$|<b>Complications</b> {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal <b>complications</b> more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant <b>complications</b> include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} <b>complications</b> from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>Complications</b> of {{smallpox}} arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia. Respiratory <b>complications</b> tend to develop {{on about the}} eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication {{of smallpox}}. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Complications</b> of {{spinal cord}} {{injuries}} include pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, neurogenic shock, and paralysis below the injury site.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we {{experienced}} three cases of a retrosternal hernia as a rare <b>complication</b> after MIE. Surgeons {{should be aware}} of this uncommon <b>complication</b> if retrosternal route reconstruction is used after MIE. As MIE is performed more frequently in the near future, retrosternal hernia may become an increasingly more common <b>complication.</b>|$|R
50|$|Penile {{fracture}} is {{a medical}} emergency, and emergency surgical repair is the usual treatment. Delay in seeking treatment increases the <b>complication</b> rate. Non-surgical approaches result in 10-50% <b>complication</b> rates including erectile dysfunction, permanent penile curvature, damage to the urethra and pain during sexual intercourse, while operatively treated patients experience an 11% <b>complication</b> rate.|$|R

5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam {{should not be used}} for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological <b>complications.</b> Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological <b>complications.</b>|$|E
5|$|Minor <b>complications</b> {{are common}} after {{laryngoscopy}} and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other <b>complications</b> which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Diabetic {{vascular}} <b>complication</b> is {{a leading}} cause of end-stage renal failure, acquired blindness, a variety of neuropathies and accelerated atherosclerosis, which could account for disabilities and high mortality rates in patients with diabetes. There is a growing body of evidence to conclude that intensive control of plasma glucose and blood pressure is crucial for effectively reducing diabetic vascular <b>complication.</b> So far, various molecular mechanisms have been proposed {{to play a role in}} the development and progression of diabetic vascular <b>complication.</b> In this paper, we review potential therapeutic strategies for the prevention of diabetic vascular <b>complication,</b> especially focusing on the signal transduction pathways activated under diabetes.

5|$|More serious <b>complications</b> include laryngospasm, {{perforation}} of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} <b>complications,</b> tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} <b>complications,</b> though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to <b>complications</b> such as {{pneumothorax}} and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious <b>complications</b> {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late <b>complications.</b> Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E

5|$|The {{risks and}} <b>complications</b> related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as {{excessive}} bleeding or nerve injury), those {{that occur in}} the first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth.
