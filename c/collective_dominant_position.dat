5000|$|Prior to the {{implementation}} of Regulation 139/2004 and the turn towards a more effects-based approach to EU competition law, EU merger control was governed by EEC Regulation 4064/89. Under EEC Regulation 4064/89 (the 'old' regulation), a merger or concentration was prohibited if it would"create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would significantly impeded".The old substantive test is said to have encouraged two alternative interpretations of how to apply the test. The alternative interpretations suggest that, the presence of dominance alone is a sufficient condition to satisfy the dominance test and that as part of a two-tier test dominance is a necessary condition to satisfy before considering the dynamics of competition between the parties merging and the competitive characteristics of the market following the notification of a merger. The effective of the old [...] "dominance test" [...] increasingly began to be called into question with concerns regarding the issues of overenforcement and the false positives. The case of Airtours v Commission in 2002 served as the case that ultimately urged the Commission to recommend a change in EU merger regulation. The Commission prohibited the merger of Airtours and First Choice on the basis that it would create a <b>collective</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> in the market since there would be an incentive for the remaining firms in an oligopolistic market to restrict market capacity, leading to higher prices and increased profits as a result of subsequent market conditions following the merger. The oligopolists need not always [...] "behave as if there were one or more explicit agreements between them." [...] The Commission believed it was [...] "sufficient that the merger makes it rational for the oligopolists...to act individually in ways which will substantially reduce competition between them." [...] In the case of Airtours v Commission, the Court of First Instance annulled the Commission's decision to prohibit the Airtours-First Choice merger {{on the grounds that the}} Commission's interpretation of collective dominance was not informed by the widely recognised indicator of anti-competitive behaviour in an oligopolistic market - tacit collusion. The Airtours legal action created a significant level of uncertainty in EU merger law as a perceived gap had arisen with the law at the time - the gap of the non-collusive oligopoly.|$|E

The second part of the article highlights in more detail some of the conditions between objectives and means of intervention of the antitrust and in particular between a) control of acquisitions and sanctions of collusive agreements; b) safeguard of competition in oligopoly and repression of collusion c) oligopolistic competition and abuse of the <b>collective</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The abuse {{use of a}} <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> {{constitutes}} an important form of manifestation of anti-competitive practices. Almost all competition laws have some provisions on the abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> Most European laws, including {{the one of the}} European Union, contain an express provision prohibiting the abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> However, they rarely include a definition of what constitutes abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position,</b> but most of them pass in review examples of behaviors that may be considered illegal. In countries with a developed market economy, the legal provisions regarding abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> were not so important and so widely used as the provisioning governing mergers and the cartel behavior. The explanation is that in a developed economy, the markets are larger, firms are more numerous, and the entry on the market is relatively easy. As a result, there are few markets where a firm with a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> can exercise its market influence for longer periods without new entries being attracted. For this study we decided to present the most famous cases involving the abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> registered on Romanian market of mobile phones in 2011 and sanctioned by the Romanian Competition Council...|$|R

40|$|Introduction An {{overview}} of media markets shows that rapid {{growth and the}} integration {{of some of the}} most dynamic market segments are characteristics of this fast-moving industry. The main players are the established incumbents upstream and the delivery segments of media downstream. The presence of incumbents, inheritors of previous public monopolies, has led Member States to use regulation in a complementary role with competition. In these markets, strategies to deliver new products and services and to serve new geographic markets focus less on organic growth than on alliances and mergers in order to create multi-media offshoots, bid for control of content rights, increase the diffusion of products and services, and develop technologies for conditional access and transmission standards to capture advantages through proprietary technology. As a result, vertically integrated dominant positions either upstream or downstream have tended to emerge. There is nothing wrong with vertical integration except when there is market power at one stage of the vertical chain. Indeed, as far as the media industry is concerned, there are some specific challenges at the European level. The new EU regulatory framework grants some specific competition principles which can be integrated into ex ante regulation. EU merger control may also prevent potential distortion of competition resulting from the creation or the strengthening of a single or <b>collective</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> in the media sector at a horizontal level, or from foreclosure effects at a vertical level.

40|$|On 13 July 2006, the European Court of First Instance (CFI) annulled the European Commission’s {{approval}} of the merger between the music units of Sony and Bertelsmann. In its Impala ruling, the CFI severely criticized the 2004 Commission decision because it found that the evidence relied upon by the Commission was not capable of substantiating its conclusion that the Sony BMG joint venture would not create or strengthen a <b>collective</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> This judgment is highly significant {{for at least two}} reasons. First of all, it has potential implications for the future shape of the music industry, since the already completed concentration, which reduced the major players from five to four, is now being re-examined by the Commission. Secondly, and more importantly, the CFI judgment raises fundamental questions about the standard of proof incumbent on the European Commission when dealing with merger cases. After the CFI’s annulment of three prohibition decisions in 2002 (Airtours, Schneider Electric and Tetra Laval), the Sony BMG decision could in fact be seen as an attempt by the Commission {{to take into account the}} high burden of proof imposed on it by the Community Courts. The fact that this decision was annulled for not meeting the requisite legal standard for authorizing a merger, is therefore both ironic and challenging because it puts the Commission on a knife-edge. This paper will address this issue by assessing (1) to what extent the Impala judgment has actually raised the standard of proof incumbent on the Commission and, subsequently, (2) whether or not Impala - seen together with other recent jurisprudence concerning the required standard of proof in merger control - is imposing a too heavy burden on the Commission. Or, to put it more colloquially, this paper will seek to find out whether or not the CFI is imposing a too high standard of proof that the Commission, due to lack of the necessary resources, perhaps cannot meet. First, the concept of collective dominance will be explained and an overview will be given of the case law on the assessment of collective dominant positions in EC merger control. Second, the Commission’s 2004 clearance decision will be discussed. Where relevant, references will be made to previous merger cases in the music industry. Third, the Impala judgment will be summarized. Fourth, the judgment will be analyzed, and this in light of the recent jurisprudence of the Community Courts concerning the standard of proof incumbent on the Commission. On the basis of these findings, an answer to the two research questions will be formulated...|$|E

40|$|Abuse of the <b>Dominant</b> <b>Position</b> by Prohibited Pricing Activities Abstract This thesis {{analyzes}} selected {{pricing practices}} of dominant undertakings namely predatory pricing, margin squeeze and excessive pricing. These practices may, under certain circumstances, constitute {{an abuse of}} the <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> The aim of the thesis {{is to focus on}} problematic aspects of each of these practices, on explanation of various legal and economic tests used to prove that certain pricing policy constitutes an abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> and on the description of conditions that have to be met in order to consider such practice contrary to the competition law of the Czech Republic and the European Union. The thesis is composed of four chapters. In Chapter One a brief introduction to the competition law itself and to the analyzed matter is given. Chapter Two describes basic terminology used when dealing with cases of abuse of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> such as basic legal concept of the abuse itself, definition of an undertaking and a competitor according to the EU law and the Czech law respectively, delimitation of a relevant market and finally definition of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> Chapter Three is oriented on the selected pricing practices of dominant undertakings.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to define the term "dominant position" of an {{undertaking}} under the EU Competition Law and to find out, what circumstances are decisive {{in order to be}} able to identify existence of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position.</b> The second part of the thesis focuses on actual problems connected with the dominant undertakings, namely the standardization and the effectiveness of the interventions of competition authorities into the actions of dominant undertakings on rapidly developing IT markets. The thesis deals with the concept of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> and does not address particular types of abusive behaviour enumerated in Article 102 (a) - (d) TFEU. The first chapter briefly describes the system of EU Competition Law. The focus is directed on agreements distorting competition (Art. 101 TFEU), abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> (Art. 102 TFEU) and control of concentrations between undertakings (Council Regulation No. 139 / 2004).

40|$|Ports {{facilitate}} a waterborne transport {{which is the}} backbone of international trade, and thereby the global economy. This vital position in the international trade coupled with their nature as a limited capacity infrastructure enabled ports {{to be a significant}} market actor that is susceptible to possess market power. Port operators may acquire a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> in the relevant markets concerned. The acquisition of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> may not be a concern in itself. However, this <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> may contain an inherent element of potential capacity of abusive behavior which may compromise effective competition in the port industry. Despite its obvious importance to the economy, the application of competition rules to port operators has always been complicated due to various factors. Considering the high significance of ports in facilitating the international trade of EU and the free movement of persons and goods within the Union, this study focuses on determining the extent of application of the EU competition rules for the sector of port operators. Under this general purpose, this thesis will analyze the rule prohibiting abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> in port operators; in particular, examining the core points of this rule such as ‘undertakings’, ‘relevant market’, ‘dominance’ and ‘abuse’; and finally, determining how and to what extent the rule against an abuse of <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> could be applicable to port operators...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the present {{investigation}} consists on an initial approach to the general aspects {{of the concept of}} <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> on the European Competition Law, 5 whose assumptions are gathered on the analysis of several criteria referred to in Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Such article declares that “any abuse by one or more undertakings of a <b>dominant</b> <b>position</b> within the internal market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market in so far as it may affect trade between Member States. ” However, it is not given, nor in this article nor in any other from the above Treaty, a definition of <b>dominant</b> <b>position,</b> which in fact constitutes a problem. Thus, one will approach the concept of abuse of this <b>dominant</b> <b>position,</b> which dissuades itself on the abusive practices that compromise the Member States structural balance, and which at the end affect the consumers as potential direct victims of the exercise of market power. Nonetheless, one can point out, {{from the point of view}} of the Treaty, that the notion of abuse is itself contrary to any idea of contribution to the economic progress, and that the body of the article does not prohibit the existence of <b>dominant</b> <b>positions,</b> but only its abusive exploitation, as one will verify...|$|R
