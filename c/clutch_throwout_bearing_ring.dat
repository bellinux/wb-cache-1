40|$|In Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) {{the clutch}} control {{strategies}} {{to manage the}} engagement operation and clutch vibrational behaviour are mutual interdependent and only an optimized mechatronic design could lead to an effective target from several points of view: passengers' comfort, fuel economy, system reliability, performance, driving feeling, etc. In fact, noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) phenomena are crucial subjects in the modern automotive industry. In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldn’t provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the flywheel, clutch and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers. In this paper, simulations of driveline vibrational behaviour have been performed by implementing a high-order multi-body model for the dry clutch mechanism {{with the purpose of}} studying the excitation of torsional vibration caused by frictional actions during the slip phase of the clutch engagement in manual or automated manual transmissions. The analysis aims at deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called “eek noise”, 250 - 500 Hz. The results of this work substantiate that enhancing of torsional motion in the characteristic frequency range of the eek effect occurs in vehicle launch and gear shifting operations regardless of the rigid wobbling motion of the pressure plate. Such outcomes underline the need to include the non-linear characteristic of the clutch cushion spring in the simulation frictional induced vibration originated at clutch level. Simulations of gear-shifting operations have been carried out by applying ramp profiles to the <b>clutch</b> <b>throwout</b> <b>bearing</b> according to the requirements of typical manoeuvres in passenger cars...|$|R

40|$|An Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) {{system is}} {{generally}} constituted by a dry or wet clutch assembly and a multi-speed gearbox, both equipped with electro-mechanical or electro-hydraulic actuators, which {{are driven by}} a control unit, the transmission control unit (TCU). The operating modes of AMTs are usually two: semiautomatic, with the driver requesting a sequential gear shift {{by means of a}} proper interface or fully automatic. In both cases, after the gear shift command, the TCU manages the shifting steps, through suitable signals to the engine, the clutch assembly and the gearbox, according to current engine regime, driving conditions and selected program. For market sectors such as large-series and ecological cars, AMT has the advantage of lower weight and higher efficiency with respect to other typologies of automatic transmissions. Furthermore, an AMT is directly derived from a manual one through the integration of actuators; then, development and production costs are generally lower than other automatic transmissions, while the reliability and durability are at highest level. For high class sport cars, vehicle dynamic performances and driving quality can further improve the results of the automatic transmissions [1]. This transmission type is also an affordable and robust solution, but the quality of the vehicle propulsion as perceived by the driver is largely dependent {{on the quality of the}} control strategies. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on control schemes for AMTs have shown that uncertainties in clutch torque characteristic can severely affect the performance of the clutch engagement: modelling in detail the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a crucial issue in order to design robust engagement control strategies [2, 3]. This paper aims at investigate the temperature influence on the dry clutch transmission characteristic through the study of physical models which separately taking into account the thermal effect on the frictional behaviour of the <b>clutch</b> facings, the <b>throwout</b> <b>bearing</b> characteristic positions, the cushion spring load-deflection curve. The outcome of this analysis could become a key element for designers of automated clutches and control engineers to recast the cushion spring conception to overcome the poor engagement performance exhibited by AMTs after repeated gear shifting...|$|R

40|$|Dry {{clutches}} {{are widely}} used in conventional and innovative automotive drivelines and represent a key element for automated manual transmissions (AMTs). In practical applications, it is fundamental to model the clutch behavior through its torque transmissibility characteristic, i. e., {{the relationship between the}} <b>throwout</b> <b>bearing</b> position (or the pressure applied by the clutch actuator) and the torque transmitted through the clutch during the engagement phase. In this paper, a new model for the torque transmissibility of dry clutches is proposed. It is analyzed how the transmissibility characteristic depends on: friction pads geometry, cushion spring compression, cushion spring load, and slip-speed-dependent friction. Corresponding functions are suitably composed determining the torque transmissibility expression. An experimental procedure for tuning the characteristic parameters is presented. The clutch-torque transmissibility model is tested on a detailed cosimulation model with a typical AMT controller...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{flexibility}} of <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> {{is very important}} to calculate the characteristics of rolling bearings in some rolling bearing applications such as planetary gear, rolling mill and aircraft. It may cause significant changes in dynamics characteristics, bearing deflections, contact stresses, and fatigue endurance, especially under heavy applied load, large size bearing, hollowed shaft and nonrigid bearing housing. The purpose in the work presented is to research a new approach and multibody model of <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> for MBS of mechanical system with rolling bearings. The flexibility and three-dimensional multibody model of <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> have been developed using equivalent rigid elements and curved Timoshenko beam elements. The simulation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>rings</b> vibration response will be presented. In addition to the presented multibody model, the FEM model and analytical model are also used to perform the vibration analyses of the <b>bearing</b> <b>ring.</b> An investigation of the actual static deformation field of the outer ring loaded by 5 balls has been carried out for the radial displacement field using the presented model. The total number of the discrete equivalent rigid elements and CTB elements has an important effect on the predicted frequencies, however the results will be minimal changes when the elements are achieved a certain number. In such situations, the presented approach can provide multibody rings model for contact dynamics of rolling bearings with acceptable accuracy and considerably less computational effort. The calculated radial static deformation is critical to load distribution, life fatigue and dynamics characteristics of rolling bearings.
