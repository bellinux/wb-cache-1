50|$|A <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> module (CAM) is an {{electronic}} device, usually incorporating a slot for a smart card, which equips an Integrated Digital Television or set-top {{box with the}} appropriate hardware facility to view <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> content that has been encrypted using a <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> system. They are normally used with direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) services, although digital terrestrial pay TV suppliers also use CAMs. PC Card form factor is used as the Common Interface form of <b>Conditional</b> <b>Access</b> Modules for DVB broadcasts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> encryption/scrambling {{methods include}} NDS, BISS, Conax, Digicipher, Irdeto, Cryptoworks, DG Crypt, Beta digital, SECA Mediaguard, Logiways, Nagravision, PowerVu, Viaccess, Videocipher, and VideoGuard.

50|$|Under the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard, <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> system (CAS) {{standards}} are {{defined in the}} specification documents for DVB-CA (<b>conditional</b> <b>access),</b> DVB-CSA (the common scrambling algorithm) and DVB-CI (the Common Interface). These standards define a method by which one can obfuscate a digital-television stream, with access provided only to those with valid decryption smart-cards. The DVB specifications for <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> {{are available from the}} standards page on the DVB website.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Conditional</b> <b>Access</b> Convention, {{formally}} the European Convention on the Legal Protection of Services based on, or consisting of, <b>Conditional</b> <b>Access</b> is {{a convention}} of the Council of Europe, which requires its parties to make pieces of software that circumvent paywalls for television and radio programmes as well as [...] "information society services".

50|$|The <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> system (DVB-CA) {{defines a}} Common Scrambling Algorithm (DVB-CSA) and a {{physical}} Common Interface (DVB-CI) for accessing scrambled content.

40|$|A {{protocol}} for secure communication between set-top box and smart card in <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> system is proposed. The proposed protocol uses the Schnorr identification scheme {{to achieve the}} authentication of smart card to settop box and uses an asymmetric cryptosystem to achieve the authentication of set-top box to smart card. Both security and performance of the proposed protocol are analyzed and a comparison between the proposed protocol and a previous protocol is provided. The result shows that the protocol is more secure {{at the cost of}} a little more computation spending and very applies to smart card with limited processing power. Moreover, the protocol makes it possible that various <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> systems use the same set-top box because it is not necessary for set-top box to store any secret proprietary data of <b>conditional</b> <b>access</b> system in advance in the protocol...|$|R
