40|$|Drawing {{from the}} {{varieties}} of capitalism theoretical framework, the study explores the home country influences of MNCs on their CSR practices when they operate outside their national/regional institutional contexts. The study focuses on a particular CSR practice (i. e. corporate code of conducts) of seven MNCs from Europe (4) and the USA (3) operating in {{the oil and gas}} sector of the Nigerian economy. The study concludes that the corporate codes of conduct of these MNCs operating in Nigeria, to a large extent, reflect the characteristics of their home <b>countries</b> <b>model</b> of capitalism, respectively. The home <b>countries</b> <b>model</b> of capitalism is also found to have implications for the degree of adaptability of these MNCs CSR practices to the Nigerian institutional context. It is anticipated that the study will contribute to the emerging literature on the institutional embeddedness of CSR practices in trans-national spaces and that of CSR in developing economies...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} the international diffusion of business cycle {{on the basis}} of a rigorous dynamic microeconomic foundation. The seminal work of Laursen and Metzler (1950) suggests that the employment-isolation effect under the flexible exchange rate system is imperfect even if international capital mobility is completely prohibited. Assuming a small <b>country</b> <b>model</b> instead of the two <b>country</b> <b>model</b> by Laursen and Metzler (1950), we obtain the following results: (i) The business fluctuation of the world economy diffuses to the small country through a change in the inflation rate resulting from the change in the real exchange rate. In this sense, the employment isolation is imperfect. (ii) Domestic monetary expansion does not necessarily improve the employment level. This is because the depreciation of the real exchange rate (worsened terms of trade) should always be compensated by the lowered inflation rate and thus reduces the consumption demand...|$|R

Use of multi <b>country</b> <b>model</b> allows us to study the country-wise vertical specialization association that is not possible with the single <b>country</b> <b>model.</b> More over, the multi country vertical specialization dependence modeling, {{a new approach to}} study the vertical specialization (imported intermediate goods to produce the export goods), enables us to explain the dependence on domestic intermediate goods and the dependence on other countries as well. The results show that the vertical specialization dependence on total import and group of USA, EU and ROW is high in general among the East Asian countries. However, {{it is also important to}} note that the vertical specialization dependence on 9 Asian countries and Hong Kong is relatively high as compared to non-regional countries.
