40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the collar graft (standard dacron graft with a customized flexible collar attached to the proximal rim) decreased anastomotic bleeding and the overall <b>clamp</b> <b>time.</b> DesignProspective randomised single center study. MethodsBetween November 2003 and January 2006, 21 patients were treated with a collar graft and 19 with a standard dacron graft. Routine endoaneurysmorraphy was used. Only infra-renal aneurysms between 5. 5 cm and 6. 5 cm were included. Aneurysms were diagnosed by CT scans. The total number of bleeding points, the total <b>clamp</b> <b>time,</b> and the number of teflon felt pledgets, was determined. ResultsThe total number of bleeding points; the number of aortic re-clamps and total <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> (minutes) per patient were all significantly lower in the collar graft group (1. 2 versus 2, p< 0. 04; 0. 5 versus 2. 0, p< 0. 001; 13. 6 versus 20. 1, p< 0. 003 respectively). The number of teflon felt pledgets and new sutures used was significantly lower in the collar graft group (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 003 respectively).

40|$|Introduction: Cardiac surgery-associated kidney injury (CSA-AKI) {{is common}} but {{relatively}} less {{is known about}} its progression. The present study is aimed at evaluating the incidence and course of CSA-AKI and {{its relationship with the}} different durations of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross clamp times. Materials and Methods : Occurrences of CSA-AKI are evaluated as per the Akin Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria over the course of 5 postoperative day (POD) in 100 patients. The relationship of different durations of CPB and aortic cross <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> with CSA-AKI is analyzed by Chi-squared test for trend and other appropriate tests using INSTAT software. Results: One hundred (43 male, 57 female; mean age of 37. 01 ± 12. 28 years, and baseline mean serum creatinine 0. 99 ± 0. 20 mg %) patients undergone mostly valve replacement, and congenital heart disease correction was evaluated. Nearly 49 % suffered CSA-AKI (81. 63 % AKIN Class I) with maximum numbers on 2 nd POD. Serum creatinine followed a falling trend 3 rd POD onward except in 8. 16 % cases of CSA-AKI. Oliguria was absent even in AKIN Class II. The CPB time > 70 min and cross <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> > 60 min increase CSA-AKI risk by an OR of 4. 76 and 2. 84, respectively (P < 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} whether {{the application of}} heparin treated circuits for elective coronary artery surgery improves postoperative recovery, a European multicenter randomised clinical trial was carried out. METHODS: In 11 European heart centers, 805 low-risk patients underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with either an untreated circuit (n = 407) or an identical but heparin treated circuit (n = 398, Duraflo II). RESULTS: Significant differences were found among participating centers with respect to patient characteristics, blood handling procedures and postoperative care. The use of heparin treated circuits revealed no overall changes in blood loss, blood use, time on ventilator, occurrence of adverse events, morbidity, mortality, and intensive care stay. These results did not change after adjustment for centers and (other) prognostic factors as analysed with logistic regression. In both groups no clinical or technical (patient or device related) side effects were reported. Because female gender and aortic cross <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> appeared as prognostic factors in the logistic regression analysis, a subgroup analysis with these variables was performed. In a subpopulation of females (n = 99), those receiving heparin treated circuits needed less blood products, had a lower incidence of rhythm disturbances and were extubated earlier than controls. In another subgroup of patients with aortic cross <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> exceeding 60 min (n = 197), the amount of patients requiring prolonged intensive care treatment (> 24 h) was significantly lower when they received heparin treated circuits versus controls. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that improved recovery can be expected with heparin treated circuits in specific higher risk patient populations (e. g. females) and when prolonged aortic cross <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> is anticipated. Further investigations are recommended to analyses the clinical benefit of heparin treated circuits in studies with patients in different well defined risk categories and under better standardised circumstances...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} independent {{predictors of}} renal failure after partial nephrectomy (PN) {{in patients with}} renal cell carcinoma (RCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were available for 166 patients with pathological T 1 - 3 N 0 M 0 RCC treated with PN. Renal failure after PN {{was defined as a}} decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of > 25 % (RIFLE criteria). The GFR before and after PN was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study group equation. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess a decrease of > 25 % in GFR from the preoperative level. Candidate predictor variables were age, gender, PN indication (absolute vs relative), preoperative GFR, tumour size, perioperative blood loss, surgery duration and <b>clamping</b> <b>time.</b> RESULTS: After PN, 22 (13. 3 %) patients had a decrease in GFR of > 25 %. The perioperative blood loss (P = 0. 02), <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> (P = 0. 04) and preoperative GFR (P = 0. 002) were independent predictors of a decrease in GFR of > 25 %.

40|$|Objectives. Combined {{coronary}} artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve repair (MVR) are associated with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and aortic <b>clamping</b> <b>time.</b> Off-pump CABG has been claimed to avoid physiologic derangements related to CPB and myocardial anoxia. However, the benefit of off-pump surgery during combined myocardial revascularization and MVR remains unclear. The objective of our {{study was to determine}} whether off-pump CABG could improve the results of CABG+MVR combination. Methods. This retrospective study includes 62 patients, who underwent CABG combined with mitral valve repair or replacement (MVR). Coronary surgery was performed before MVR. In 33 (53. 1 %) cases CABG was done off-pump on a beating heart, while in the remaining 29 (46. 9 %) cases on-pump surgery was performed. Results. The CPB time was significantly lower when we used the off-pump technique: 91. 0 vs. 141. 0 min in the on-pump group (p< 0. 001). The aortic <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> in the off-pump group decreased as well: 48. 0 min vs. 97. 0 min respectively (p< 0. 001). Hospital mortality for the entire cohort was 8. 1 %.

40|$|Purpose: Transperitoneal and retroperitoneal {{approaches}} to video-assisted aortofemoral bypass were developed and compared using gasless laparoscopic techniques in a porcine model. Methods: Ten pigs were randomized {{to either a}} transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. Aortic <b>clamp</b> <b>time,</b> total operative time, and complications were recorded. Both operations used an external lift device to maintain the working space. Retroperitoneal operations first used serial balloon inflation to dissect the retroperitoneum. After exposure of the infrarenal aorta, a graft was tunneled under endoscopic visualization. End-to-side aortic and femoral anastomoses were created with conventional instruments through 4 cm incisions. Results: Mean ± SEM aortic <b>clamp</b> <b>time,</b> operative duration, and graft patency rates were similar for both approaches (difference not significant by unpaired t test). Intraoperative complications related {{to the use of}} the laparoscopic technique included injury to the bladder and small bowel (n= 2) and occurred only in the transperitoneal group. Conclusions: The use of a gasless technique allowed direct visualization, standard instrumentation, and conventional anastomotic techniques. The retroperitoneal approach used the peritoneal sac to exclude the bowel, simplifying the aortic dissection. Gasless laparoscopic-assisted aortofemoral bypass can be performed by both transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches and holds promise as a minimally invasive treatment for aortoiliac occlusive disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that the liver parenchyma is more tolerant to intermittent pedicular clamping than to continuous pedicular clamping. However, the possibility of increased blood loss during intermittent reperfusion is a major concern. Design We retrospectively selected 34 {{cases in which the}} cumulative <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> was 90 minutes or longer during hepatectomy and the intermittent Pringle maneuver was applied rather than continuous inflow occlusion. Patients Resections were performed for metastatic carcinoma in 19 patients, hepatocellular carcinoma in 7 patients, hilar bile duct carcinoma in 3 patients, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in 1 patient, combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma in 1 patient, undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma in 1 patient, carcinoid tumor in 1 patient, and benign mucinous cystic tumor in 1 patient. Patients were categorized {{on the basis of the}} cumulative <b>clamping</b> <b>time,</b> with 25 patients in group 1 (120 minutes) and 9 patients in group 2 (> 120 minutes). In 2 patients in group 2, the cumulative <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> exceeded 240 minutes. Twenty-eight patients had histologically normal underlying liver parenchyma; 6 patients had chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Results: No red blood cell transfusions were required in group 1; blood transfusions were needed for only 3 patients in group 2. There was no postoperative mortality or major complications. The rate of minor postoperative complications was 36 % (9 patients) in group 1 and 22 % (2 patients) in group 2. Conclusions :Prolonged intermittent pedicular clamping is a useful maneuver in hepatectomy when resection is difficult or prolonged or when the liver parenchyma is abnormal.

40|$|Background: Severing the {{umbilical}} cord at birth is likely the oldest intervention, the timing of which remains fraught with controversy. Emerging evidence suggests benefit in delaying cord clamping for both term and preterm infants. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate actual cord <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> and circumstances at a large tertiary care center in Canada. Methods: We used a stopwatch to time the interval from the time the infant was born as far as the umbilicus until the time that {{the umbilical}} cord was clamped before cutting. We reported on timing of {{the umbilical cord}} clamping overall and by practitioner group (obstetrician, midwife, and family practitioner). Results: A total of 98 women and their practitioners consented to be observed at the British Columbia Women's Hospital and Health Center, Vancouver, Canada. More than one-half (56. 2 %) of all infants had their umbilical cord clamped within 15 seconds. The median (5 th, 95 th percentile) <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> in seconds for the full sample was 12 (4, 402) with practitioner subgroups as follows: obstetricians (12 [3, 107]), family physicians (19 [6, 325]), and midwives (81 [6, undefined]). The median <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> was likely to be longer when the birth occurred spontaneously, no umbilical cord blood was collected, and no birth or neonatal complications occurred. Conclusions: In our sample taken in 2006 to 2007, most infants had umbilical cords clamped immediately after the birth, with more than one-half clamped within 15 seconds of birth. Since the time of our study, delayed umbilical cord clamping for the healthy term newborn has become a part of recommended management of third stage of labor and resuscitation guidelines.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundValve sparing aortic root {{replacement}} (VSRR) {{had been}} popularized {{in the last}} decades because preservation of the native valve allows for better hemodynamics, better left ventricular performance, lesser risk of endocarditis and avoidance of lifelong anticoagulation. Two basic types of VSRR techniques are used: reimplantation of the aortic valve (Tirone David) and remodeling of the aortic root(Yacoub). We compared the David reimplantation technique versus one or two sinus replacement in repair of aortic root aneurysm or dissection associated with aortic regurge. Patients & MethodsFifty patients {{were divided into two}} groups: Group I (25 patients) undergone David reimplantation technique, Group II (25 patients) undergone supracoronary with one or two sinus replacement. ResultsThere were two deaths (8 %) within 30 days in each group. Postoperative significant regurge in Group I occurred in 1 case (4. 3 %) and in 2 cases (8. 6 %) in Group II with no significant difference. Cross <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> was significantly shorter in Group II; 137  ± 37. 0  min versus 177 ± 33. 0  min in Group I.

40|$|ObjectiveSuprarenal {{clamping}} in abdominal aortic {{surgery is}} associated with a significant risk of postoperative renal failure, general morbidity, and mortality. Arterial access for temporary shunting in these patients is difficult, and arterial perfusion techniques are typically complex. This study evaluated if renal perfusion with venous blood using a minimal pump setup and intermediate-level heparinization prevents a decline in postoperative renal function in patients requiring suprarenal clamping for aortic reconstructive surgery. MethodsRenal perfusion was achieved using a roller pump supplied with venous blood from a central venous catheter under medium-level heparinization to feed two perfusion balloon catheters. The calculated glomerular filtration rate was observed for 10 postoperative days and compared with the rate in patients with suprarenal clamping without renal perfusion. ResultsFrom 2001 to 2007, 158 patients underwent surgical reconstruction involving the pararenal aorta through a midline abdominal incision. Renal perfusion was started in 2006 and was always attempted if suprarenal clamping was anticipated preoperatively. Twenty-six patients received renal perfusion, and 132 also requiring suprarenal clamping did not. Of the latter, 109 were included in the control group. Five patients died ≤ 30 days (3. 7 %), one in the perfusion group. On average, there was a postoperative loss of renal performance in both groups. Dialysis was required postoperatively in 13 patients without renal perfusion, 4 of them long term (3. 7 %), but not in patients with renal perfusion. The reduction in glomerular filtration rate at 10 days in the nonperfused group was significantly higher than in the perfused group (7. 24 vs 0. 89 mL/min) despite a significantly longer suprarenal <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> in the latter (25. 5 vs 45. 5 minutes). Multivariate analysis showed a significant reduction in the loss of glomerular filtration rate with perfusion (P =. 007) if <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> and preoperative renal function were taken into account. Patients with preoperative renal impairment showed the greatest benefit from the perfusion. ConclusionThe setup for renal perfusion with venous blood during suprarenal clamping was simple and safe. Perfusion significantly reduced the reduction of renal function in the immediate postoperative period, suggesting that <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> may thus be safely be extended to allow for complex reconstruction of the pararenal aortic segment. The benefit was most marked for patients with preoperative renal impairment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives: We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} dextrorphan, an N -methyl-D -aspartate receptor antagonist, on the reduction of ischemic spinal cord injury and the safe <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> after various methods of administration. Methods: Spinal cord ischemia was induced in New Zealand White rabbits by infrarenal aortic clamping and animals were divided into 5 groups. Group A (n = 15) received simple clamping. Groups B (n = 20) and C (n = 35) received dextrorphan pretreatment (10 mg/kg), followed by continuous intravenous or intra-aortic infusion (1 mg/min), respectively. Group D (n = 25) received the same dextrorphan pretreatment and bolus intra-aortic injection at clamping (1 mg per minute of <b>clamping</b> <b>time).</b> Group E (n = 15) received bolus intrathecal injection of dextrorphan (0. 2 mg/kg). Each dextrorphan-treated group had {{a small group of}} control animals (n = 5). The neurologic status was assessed by the Johnson score (5 = normal, 0 = paraplegic) 48 hours after unclamping, and animals were put to death for histopathologic examination. Results: All dextrorphan-treated groups showed better neurologic function than the respective control animals (P ||. 001 vs groups B, C, and D; P =. 014 vs group E). The order of efficacy of dextrorphan (as revealed by the average of neurologic status) was as follows: group C > group D (P =. 017, after 50 minutes of clamping), group D > group B (P =. 014, after 45 minutes of clamping), and group B > group E (P ||. 001, after 40 minutes of clamping). Histopathologic findings did not necessarily correspond with hind-limb neurologic function. Conclusions: Dextrorphan reduced the physical findings associated with ischemic spinal cord injury, and continuous intra-aortic infusion prolonged the safe <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> significantly more than delivery by other routes.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{objective}} of this systematic review is to evaluate the results of clinical studies on laparoscopic surgery for aorto-iliac disease. MethodsA systematic {{review of the literature}} from 1966 to September 2006 on laparoscopic and robotic vascular surgery was performed. Only patient series containing more than 5 cases were included. Operative, <b>clamping</b> and anastomosis <b>times,</b> conversion, mortality and morbidity and hospital stay were evaluated. ResultsThirty studies were identified. These were all descriptive and included 9 comparative studies. Operative times varied widely, the shortest being for hand-assisted procedures (2. 5 – 4 hours) and the longest for totally laparoscopic procedures (4 – 6. 5 hours). <b>Clamping</b> <b>times</b> were all< 1 hour in hand-assisted procedures while in other techniques <b>clamping</b> <b>times</b> from 1 – 2. 5 hours were seen. The conversion rate varied from < 5 % up to 16 % in smaller series. The mortality rate was approximately 5 % and frequently caused by cardiac ischemia. A variety of problems ranging from minor local wound problems to cardiopulmonary- and renal insufficiency, bleeding, ureter lesions and graft thrombosis were described. Mean hospital stay for nearly all procedures was < 1 week. ConclusionsExperience of laparoscopic surgery for aorto-iliac disease is still limited. Most study results are biased by patient selection.

40|$|Background: Valve sparing aortic root {{replacement}} (VSRR) {{had been}} popularized {{in the last}} decades because preservation of the native valve allows for better hemodynamics, better left ventricular performance, lesser risk of endocarditis and avoidance of lifelong anticoagulation. Two basic types of VSRR techniques are used: reimplantation of the aortic valve (Tirone David) and remodeling of the aortic root(Yacoub). We compared the David reimplantation technique versus one or two sinus replacement in repair of aortic root aneurysm or dissection associated with aortic regurge. Patients & Methods: Fifty patients {{were divided into two}} groups: Group I (25 patients) undergone David reimplantation technique, Group II (25 patients) undergone supracoronary with one or two sinus replacement. Results: There were two deaths (8 %) within 30 days in each group. Postoperative significant regurge in Group I occurred in 1 case (4. 3 %) and in 2 cases (8. 6 %) in Group II with no significant difference. Cross <b>clamp</b> <b>time</b> was significantly shorter in Group II; 137  ± 37. 0  min versus 177 ± 33. 0  min in Group I. Significant bleeding occurred in 7 cases (28 %) in Group I which was significantly higher than Group II; 1 case (4 %). Conclusion: Replacement of one or two sinuses is not inferior to reimplantation technique regarding early survival and correction of aortic regurge. Noncoronary sinus replacement provided better results than reimplantation technique regarding postoperative bleeding and cross <b>clamp</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute {{renal failure}} {{requiring}} renal replacement therapy after cardiac surgery {{is still a}} cause of major morbidity and mortality worldwide. A number of risk factors {{for the development of}} acute renal injury after cardiac surgery have been previously described and based on these variables; several scoring algorithms were proposed. Predictive value of these algorithms in Iran is not described. This study investigates these risk factors among our patients in southern Iran. Methods: Two hundred and forty patients with normal kidney function who were candidates for cardiac surgery were enrolled and their baseline data were collected. Diabetes mellitus and age were selected as more contro-versial preoperative risk factors. Clamp and pump time were also selected as intra-operative risk factors and the type of operation was also considered as an independent risk factor. The patients were categorized in two groups including group 1 : Patients with post-operation normal kidney function and group 2 : Patients with post-operation ARF. All patients were followed with serial measurement of serum creatinine post-operation. Results: The incidence of acute renal failure was 11. 25 %. Mean age of the patients in group 1 was 54. 24 ± 15. 88 and in group 2 was 52. 85 ± 18. 20 years.

40|$|Background: The {{survival}} {{of patients with}} congenital heart disease has increased in the recent years, because of enhanced diagnostic capabilities, better surgical techniques and improved perioperative care. Many patients will require reoperations as part of staged procedures, or to treat grafts deterioration and residual or recurrent lesions. Reoperations favor the formation of cardiac adhesions and consequently increase surgery time, however, the impact on morbidity and operative mortality is certain. The objective {{of the study was}} to describe the risk factors for mortality in pediatric patients undergoing a reoperation for congenital heart disease. Methods: Historic cohort of patients who underwent reoperations after pediatric cardiac surgery from January 2009 to December 2015. Operations with previous surgical approach different to sternotomy were excluded from the analysis. Results: In seven years, 3. 086 surgeries were performed, 481 were reoperations and 238 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mean number of prior surgeries was 1. 4 ± 0. 6. Median age at the time of reoperation was 6. 4 years. The most common surgical procedures were staged palliation for functionally univentricular heart (17. 6 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{behavior}} of troponin (TROP I) and CKMB mass (CKMBm) {{in regards to the}} addition of magnesium in cardioplegic solutions; and also the influence of per-operative factors. METHOD: A total of 28 children with ages ranging from 3 to 108 months were studied. The mean weight was 11. 8 kg. Eighteen were male. The patients were divided into two groups. Sixteen children in group I (GI) and 12 in group II (GII). The patients in GI received cold blood cardioplegic solution with magnesium (12 mEq/L) and potassium chloride (20 mEq/L) at 20 mL/kg. The patients in GII received the same solution without magnesium. Six blood samples were collected for serum analysis of the concentration of TROP I and CKMBm. The blood samples were collected before clamping the aorta and at 1, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after aorta clamping termination. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in the TROP I and CKMBm levels between the two groups. Among the per-operative factors cyanosis influenced the TROP I and CKMBm levels. Additionally, the aorta <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> influenced the TROP I levels. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of magnesium in the cardioplegic solution was not associated with different levels of TROP I and CKMBm.

40|$|Background. This {{retrospective}} {{study was designed}} to investigate the efficacy and safety of intermittent portal triad clamping (PTC) with low central venous pressure (CVP) in liver resections. Methods. Between January 2007 and August 2013, 115 patients underwent liver resection with intermittent PTC. The patients’ data were retrospectively analyzed. Results. There were 58 males and 57 females {{with a mean age of}} 55 years (± 13. 7). Cirrhosis was found in 23 patients. Resections were performed for malignant disease in 62. 6 % (n= 72) and for benign disease in 37. 4 % (n= 43). Major hepatectomy was performed in 26 patients (22. 4 %). Mean liver ischemia period was 27. 1 [*]min (± 13. 9). The mortality rate was 1. 7 % and the morbidity rate was 22. 6 %. Cumulative <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> (t= 3. 61, P< 0. 001) and operation time (t= 2. 38, P< 0. 019) were significantly correlated with AST alterations (D-AST).

Intermittent PTC under low CVP was performed with low morbidity and mortality. Intermittent PTC can be safely applied up to 60 minutes in both normal and impaired livers...|$|R
40|$|The study aim was {{to compare}} maze {{outcomes}} using microwave ablation or cryoablation in patients with mitral disease and atrial fibrillation (AF). Between 1999 and 2005, 340 patients underwent mitral valve surgery and concomitant maze procedure involving either microwave ablation (n= 96, MW group) or cryoablation (n= 244, Cryo group). Mean age at operation was 50. 0 ± 12. 5 yr. Follow-up period was 46. 1 ± 28. 2 months. The Cryo group showed a longer aortic <b>clamping</b> <b>time</b> than the MW group (P= 0. 005). There were no differences in operative mortality and morbidity rates. The unadjusted 5 -yr AF free rate was 61. 3 ± 1. 2 % in the MW group and 79. 9 ± 3. 2 % in the Cryo group (P= 0. 089). After adjustment, the MW group only showed a tendency toward more frequent AF recurrence than the Cryo group (Hazard ration 1. 66, 95 % confidence interval 0. 89 to 3. 07). Multivariate analysis revealed that older patient age (P< 0. 001) and greater left atrial size (P< 0. 001) were independent risk factors for AF recurrence.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} of this systematic review is to evaluate the results of clinical studies on laparoscopic surgery for aorto-iliac disease. METHODS: A systematic {{review of the literature}} from 1966 to September 2006 on laparoscopic and robotic vascular surgery was performed. Only patient series containing more than 5 cases were included. Operative, <b>clamping</b> and anastomosis <b>times,</b> conversion, mortality and morbidity and hospital stay were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified. These were all descriptive and included 9 comparative studies. Operative times varied widely, the shortest being for hand-assisted procedures (2. 5 - 4 hours) and the longest for totally laparoscopic procedures (4 - 6. 5 hours). <b>Clamping</b> <b>times</b> were all < 1 hour in hand-assisted procedures while in other techniques <b>clamping</b> <b>times</b> from 1 - 2. 5 hours were seen. The conversion rate varied from < 5 % up to 16 % in smaller series. The mortality rate was approximately 5 % and frequently caused by cardiac ischemia. A variety of problems ranging from minor local wound problems to cardiopulmonary- and renal insufficiency, bleeding, ureter lesions and graft thrombosis were described. Mean hospital stay for nearly all procedures was < 1 week. CONCLUSIONS: Experience of laparoscopic surgery for aorto-iliac disease is still limited. Most study results are biased by patient selection. Only a few surgeons have mastered the required surgical technique and more data are needed to asses the clinical potential of this type of surgery, in comparison with the endovascular alternative.

40|$|To date, delaying cord {{clamping}} two {{to three}} minutes after birth is considered effective for newborn well-being. This time does not consider the newborn's breathing movements, which may also condition neonate well-being. To investigate the behaviour of neonatal weight loss and of some umbilical vein lab parameters, in relation to timing of newborn breathing and cord <b>clamping.</b> <b>Time</b> from birth to cord <b>clamping</b> and <b>time</b> from birth to first cry of the newborn were collected in 87 full-term healthy women. First cry {{is a sign of}} effective breathing. Birth weight loss at the first, second, and third day from birth and lab parameters were assessed in relation to: time from birth to cord <b>clamping,</b> <b>time</b> from birth to first cry, and cord clamping before or after the first cry. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) decreased if cord clamping was performed after first cry and increased if first cry occurred after cord clamping, independently from the time elapsed from birth to first cry (p = 0. 012). Calcium (Ca(2 +)) concentration decreased if cord clamping was performed after the first cry and increased if first cry of the baby after birth was delayed (p = 0. 021). Each second of delay from birth to cord clamping resulted in an increase in Cl- concentration (p < 0. 001). Each second of delay in cord clamping resulted in a reduction in the percentage of weight loss at the first day (p = 0. 024), at the second day (p = 0. 007), and at the third day (p = 0. 028) after birth. Neonate breathing after birth should induce umbilical vein flow from placenta to lungs, conditioning the reduction of birth weight loss after birth and umbilical lab parameters modifications...|$|R
