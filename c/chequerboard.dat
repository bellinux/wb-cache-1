5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated <b>chequerboard</b> pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E

25|$|Wesley Church {{is built}} of {{load-bearing}} brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall buttressing. The church {{has a strong}} verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a <b>chequerboard</b> effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to {{the walls of the}} building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the roof covering was originally shingles, but at some point the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles.|$|E

2500|$|An {{extremely}} rare group of carpets, [...] "chequerboard" [...] carpets were {{assumed to be}} a later and derivative continuum of the Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene group of carpets. Only about 30 of these carpets survived. They are distinguished by their design composed of rows of squares with triangles in each corner enclosing a star pattern. All [...] "chequerboard" [...] carpets have borders with cartouches and lobed medallions. Their attribution is still under debate. The colours and patterns resemble those seen in Mamluk carpets, however, they are [...] "S-spun" [...] and [...] "Z-twisted" [...] and thus similar to early anatolian and caucasian carpets. Since the early days of carpet science they are attributed to Damascus. Pinner and Franses champion this attribution because Syria was part first of the Mamluk, later of the Ottoman Empire at that time. This would explain the similarities with the colours and patterns of the Cairene carpets. The current dating of the <b>chequerboard</b> carpets is also consistent with European collection inventories from the early 17th century. Carpets of the [...] "chequerboard" [...] type are depicted on Pietro Paolinis (1603−1681) [...] "Self portrait", as well as on Gabriël Metsus painting [...] "The musical party".|$|E
40|$|Surface etching by ion {{sputtering}} {{can be used}} to pattern surfaces. Recent studies using the high-spatial-resolution capability of the scanning tunnelling microscope revealed in fact that ion bombardment produces repetitive structures at nanometre scale, creating peculiar surface morphologies ranging from self-affine patterns to 'fingerprint'-like and even regular structures, for instance waves (ripples), <b>chequerboards</b> or pyramids. The phenomenon is related to the interplay between ion erosion and diffusion of adatoms (vacancies), which induces surface re-organization. The paper reviews the use of sputter etching to modify 'in situ' surfaces and thin films, producing substrates with well defined vertical roughness, lateral periodicity and controlled step size and orientation...|$|R
40|$|A {{stimulus}} {{is described}} that demonstrates the spatial pooling of colour {{information in the}} visual system. <b>Chequerboards</b> (or gratings) consisting of alternating squares (or stripes) of complementary colours become achromatic at particular spatial scales; such stimuli have been named 'transchromatic' stimuli. Colour pools are {{much larger than the}} receptive fields that respond to luminance contrast. Some measurements are described which form the basis for estimates {{of the size of the}} colour pools. The size of colour pools varies according to the colours involved. For red-cyan and green-magenta complementary pairs colour is pooled at spatial frequencies above about 7 - 8 cycles deg- 1, implying pools whose diameter is around 8 min arc. For yellow-blue complementary pairs the corresponding figures are about 4 cycles deg- 1 and 15 min arc. Some phenomena of normal colour vision, colour blindness, and the development of infant vision are discussed in the light of these findings...|$|R
40|$|Brain {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) is {{an emerging}} neurophysiological tool that combines straightforward activity localization with cost-economy, portability and patient compatibility. NIRS is proving its empirical utility across specific cognitive and emotional paradigms. However, a potential limitation {{is that it}} is not only sensitive to haemodynamic changes taking place in the cortex, and task-related cardiovascular responses expressed in the perfusion of extracranial layers may be confounding. Existing literature reports correlations between brain NIRS and systemic blood pressure, yet it falls short of establishing whether in normal participants the blood pressure changes encountered in experimental settings can have confounding effects. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing two experimental manipulations while recording from superficial occipital cortex, encompassing striate and extrastriate regions. Visual stimulation with reversing <b>chequerboards</b> evoked cortical haemodynamic responses. Simultaneously and independently, transient systemic blood pressure changes were generated through rapid arm-raising. Shallow-penetration NIRS recordings, probing only extra-cerebral tissues, highlighted close haemodynamic coupling with blood pressure. A different coupling pattern was observed in deep-penetration recordings directed at haemodynamic signals from visual cortex. In absence of blood-pressure changes, NIRS signals tracked differences in visual stimulus duration. However when blood pressure was actively manipulated, this effect was absent and replaced by a very large pressure-related response. Our observations demonstrate that blood pressure fluctuations can exert confounding effects on brain NIRS, through expression in extracranial tissues and within the brain itself. We highlight the necessity for continuous blood pressure monitoring alongside brain NIRS, and for further research on methods to correct for physiological confounds...|$|R

2500|$|There is no {{standard}} {{design for the}} chequered flag. Although it nearly always consists of alternating black and white squares or rectangles arranged in a <b>chequerboard</b> pattern, the number, size, and length-width proportions of the rectangles vary from one flag to another. Also, the chequered flag typically has a black rectangle {{at the corner of}} the flag closest to the top of the flagpole. There have been instances of the black and white squares being painted onto a wooden board and simply held up for drivers to observe at the finish line. In events where Sunoco is the series fuel sponsor, the chequered flag often also has their logo emblazoned in the center of the flag, a practice that was used in NASCAR originally with Union 76, but is also used in IndyCar, since Sunoco's fuel sponsorship began. In NASCAR and F1 events, a single chequered flag is waved to signal the completion of a race. In IndyCar, two chequered flags are waved together, a tradition dating to the 1980 Indianapolis 500, but only if the race is under green conditions. [...] (The starter will wave both a chequered and yellow flag if safety car conditions occur at the end of the race, in a yellow-chequer finish.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The linear {{formation}} of the musketeer {{part of the company}} (the pike square remained in force) was just part of the total tactical reform. Older armies had divided the total force in three parts (hence the Spanish word [...] "tercio" [...] for each of these parts): a van, main, and rear, which in the Spanish conception were little differentiated, though the companies were deployed in a <b>chequerboard</b> formation for mutual support. The two stadtholders tried to improve on this by dividing their army into tactical units of around 900 men (6 companies), called [...] "battalions," [...] that could operate independently. They hoped in this way to gain flexibility and spread the risk of a rout when single units broke under attack. These battalion units were deployed chequerboard-like in three lines, again for mutual support. This method of deployment enabled the commander to rotate companies in a disciplined way, again to avoid confusion. Battalions were combined to brigades as fighting formations. To achieve this tactical flexibility companies had to drill in battalion formation. All units had to drill in the same way. Furthermore, before the campaign the commander-in-chief would communicate his preferences as to the battle formation to his officers by drawing up a battle sketched plan which gave the order of battle in a standardized notation. These methods were promoted by William Louis' brother John VII, Count of Nassau, who wrote several works about the techniques that received wide distribution in military circles in Europe. Later, drill manuals were published to illustrate the new tactics step by step, like the 1607 Wapenhandelinghe van Roers Musquetten ende Spiessen by Jacob de Gheyn II. This helped to engender a tactical military revolution in other countries also. The new tactics eventually even reached the English army, {{just in time for the}} Civil War.|$|E
40|$|Unsupervised {{exposure}} to confusable stimuli facilitates later discrimination between them. It {{is known that}} the schedule of exposure is critical to this perceptual learning effect, but several issues remain unresolved: I) {{it is not known}} whether a mechanism of mutual inhibition, taken by some to underpin perceptual learning in rats, is also evident in humans. II) Although simultaneous presentation of the to-be- discriminated stimuli has been suggested by some to be {{the most efficient way to}} promote perceptual learning, the associative mechanisms proposed by others (e. g., that of mutual inhibition) predict the opposite. Ill) Perceptual learning has been invoked as the process by which a face becomes familiar but surprisingly, this idea has received little empirical evaluation. The experimental work reported in this thesis addresses these three issues. Experiments 1 and 2, using flavours as stimuli, reveal that the inhibitory mechanisms that contribute to perceptual learning in rats also contribute to perceptual learning in humans. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrate a perceptual learning effect using visual stimuli, pictures of human faces and that these effects too, exhibit parallels with studies of perceptual learning with rats. In particular they demonstrate that intermixed exposure results in greater perceptual learning than does blocked exposure. Experiments 5 to 7 indicate that perceptual learning seen following simultaneous exposure is, in turn, superior to intermixed exposure - implicating a process of stimulus comparison. Experiment 8 confirms that this novel effect is also observed with other visual stimuli, <b>chequerboards,</b> while those of Experiments 9 and 10 indicate that the face stimuli used exhibit some of the hallmarks of face processing. These findings establish, along with Experiments 3 to 6, that perceptual learning contributes to the process by which a face becomes familiar...|$|R
