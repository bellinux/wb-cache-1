40|$|Background] Previous {{animal and}} {{clinical}} {{studies suggest that}} bystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation may be superior to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for out-of-hospital <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests.</b> Our hypothesis was that both cardiac-only bystander resuscitation and conventional bystander CPR would improve outcomes from out-of-hospital <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> of ≤ 15 minutes' duration, whereas the addition of rescue breathing would improve outcomes for <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> lasting > 15 minutes. [Methods and Results] We carried out a prospective, population-based, observational study involving consecutive patients with emergency responder resuscitation attempts from May 1, 1998, through April 30, 2003. The primary outcome measure was 1 -year survival with favorable neurological outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between type of CPR and outcomes. Among the 4902 witnessed <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests,</b> 783 received conventional CPR, and 544 received cardiac-only resuscitation. Excluding very-long-duration <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> (> 15 minutes), the cardiac-only resuscitation yielded {{a higher rate of}} 1 -year survival with favorable neurological outcome than no bystander CPR (4. 3 % versus 2. 5 %; odds ratio, 1. 72; 95 % CI, 1. 01 to 2. 95), and conventional CPR showed similar effectiveness (4. 1 %; odds ratio, 1. 57; 95 % CI, 0. 95 to 2. 60). For the very-long-duration arrests, neurologically favorable 1 -year survival was greater in the conventional CPR group, but there were few survivors regardless of the type of bystander CPR (0. 3 % [2 of 624], 0 % [0 of 92], and 2. 2 % [3 of 139] in the no bystander CPR, cardiac-only CPR, and conventional CPR groups, respectively; P< 0. 05). [Conclusions] Bystander-initiated cardiac-only resuscitation and conventional CPR are similarly effective for most adult out-of-hospital <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests.</b> For very prolonged <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests,</b> the addition of rescue breathing may be of some help...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} incidence, causes, and outcome of {{perioperative}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> in {{children at a}} university teaching hospital with an aim of improving quality of care. Analysis of anesthesia-related complications is routinely performed by most anesthesia departments to make prevention strategies. All perioperative <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> in children up to 18 years from induction of anesthesia to postanesthesia care unit discharge or ICU admission during noncardiac surgery from January 1992 to December 2006 were analyzed. Outcome variable was noted as survival to discharge. Anesthesia-related <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> were identified and their causes analyzed. Ten <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> occurred among 20216 Patients. Overall incidence was 4. 95 per 10000 (95 % CI: 1. 88 - 8. 01). Six (6. 53 / 10000) were females. Seven (19. 44 / 10000) Patients belonged to the classification III-IV of ASA physical status, eight (18. 28 / 10000) were below 1 year, and two (1. 26 / 10000) above 1 year. Three Patients (6. 53 / 10000) were undergoing emergency surgery. Anesthesia was primarily responsible in four cases. The causes of anesthesia-related arrests were medication-related (two), airway-related (one), and under-replacement of fluids (one). Seven Patients died during the arrest and three were discharged home. The event was considered avoidable in seven (70 %) cases. Perioperative <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> were higher in Patients with poor physical status, in those under 1 year of age, and in female Patients. Anesthesia-related <b>cardiac</b> <b>arrests</b> were mainly due to medication- or airway-related causes.
