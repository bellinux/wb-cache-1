2500|$|Upset forging {{is usually}} done in special {{high-speed}} machines called crank presses. The machines are usually {{set up to}} work in the horizontal plane, to facilitate the quick exchange of workpieces from one station to the next, but upsetting can also be done in a vertical <b>crank</b> <b>press</b> or a hydraulic press. The initial workpiece is usually wire or rod, but some machines can accept bars up to [...] in diameter and a capacity of over 1000 tons. The standard upsetting machine employs split dies that contain multiple cavities. The dies open enough to allow the workpiece to move from one cavity to the next; the dies then close and the heading tool, or ram, then moves longitudinally against the bar, upsetting it into the cavity. If all of the cavities are utilized on every cycle, then a finished part will be produced with every cycle, which makes this process advantageous for mass production.|$|E
5000|$|The {{economic}} {{boom of the}} late 19th century, propelled by the increase {{of the value of}} the cattle markets and, in particular, development of the horse market, allowed Appingedam to thrive again. Even though the importance of the waterways decreased after the Groningen-Delfzijl railway line opened, at the beginning of the 20th century thus diminishing Appingedam’s profits on water transportation, the former trade hub reinvented itself as a major industrial centre in the region of Fivelingo. In 1870, C. Roggenkamp implemented the first steam-engine in Appingedam and founded the first steam-propelled sawmill timber in the Netherlands. Soon thereafter, other steam-run machines were implemented in Appingedam factories, further increasing the wealth of the city: a threshing machine and a <b>crank</b> <b>press.</b> At the beginning of the 20th century, the City already boasted a dairy factory, a flax factory, a cardboard manufacture, gasworks, a trailer factory, as well as the plants of busbuilders Medema and Smit. The [...] "Bronsmotorenfabriek" [...] (Brons Engine Factory), Ter Borg & Mensinga, an Appingedam-based mechanical plant named after its founder Jan Brons, gained international fame when its foundry produced the first Brons engine, catering for the needs of modern shipping, enjoying world-wide sales. The huge crankshaft of the first “Source” model may be admired today at the corner of the Kniestraat and Dijkstraat, as an industrial monument. Another mechanical plant with worldwide sales was Ter Borg & Mensinga.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{parameterized}} dynamic {{simulation model}} for a multi-link high precision press {{has been established in}} the ADAMS software environment based on the displacement equations. The press being developed is taken as an example to study the slider’s displacement curves, velocity curves and acceleration curves under different crank radius in practice as well as the working angle curves and torque curves. With the crank radius increasing, the started punching angle comes early and the slider’s velocity and acceleration at bottom dead center (B. D. C) decreases significantly which help to improve the accuracy of B. D. C and to lower the torque consumption during stamping. Meanwhile, the increasing of working angle helps to reduce the lateral force acting on the slider, such as the torque required to overcome the inertial forces increases rapidly, the torque needed to overcome the nominal force decreases and the peak of nominal force shifts to the lower left gradually. Results of the research mentioned above are helpful to develop the multi-link high-speed press.

In the Jawor Forge flanges with a neck are manufactured by hot forging in <b>crank</b> <b>presses</b> with a maximum load of 25 MN. The input material, {{in the form of a}} square bar, is heated up to a temperature of 1150 °C and then formed in three operations: upsetting, preliminary die forging and finishing die forging. The main aim of the studies and the numerical analyses, in which the geometry of the tools would be modified, was to maximally reduce the amount of the input material taking into account the capabilities of the Jawor Forge, and consequently to significantly reduce the production costs. Besides the Forge’s equipment resources, the main constraint for modifications was the flange-with-neck forging standard which explicitely defines the tolerances for this element. The studies, which included numerical modelling, infrared measurements and technological tests, consisted in changing the geometry of the tools and that of the forging preform. As a result, the optimum direction for modifications aimed at reducing the mass of the input material was determined. The best of the solutions, making it possible to produce a correct forging in the Jawor Forge operating conditions, were adopted whereby the weight of the preform was reduced by 6. 11 %.
