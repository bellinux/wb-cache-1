500|$|On March 16, 1999, Briarcliff was {{operating}} its mayoral election, and incumbent mayor Keith Austin ran unopposed. Write-ins supporting lawyer Richard Mattiaccio prompted a conflict involving hundreds of residents, {{which led to}} one arrest. The event took place near the polls at the Village Hall; Mattiaccio had gained supporters by criticizing Austin's weak opposition to Trump's club reconstruction plans. Many residents believed a large project would <b>congest</b> streets with construction vehicles and rip up the landscape. In redesigning the club and its course, Trump hired golf course architect Jim Fazio, brother of Tom Fazio in the same profession. Around the same time, the workmen resodded a village soccer field and assisted in constructing a new veterans' memorial in Briarcliff. He also had the current [...] white clapboard and fieldstone clubhouse built on the property. At one time, due to residents' criticism, the clubhouse was reduced to , eliminating guest rooms and special event halls. It was designed by Robert Lamb Hart Planners & Architects, and included three stories with lockers, a 150-seat restaurant, and top-floor lounge. Other difficulties with the club's plans arose; the village planning board recognized villager concerns over golf tournaments, membership requirements, and pesticide use. And {{at the time of}} the club's reconstruction, Trump had three other golf clubs planned, including one in Seven Springs, an area within three towns which would require approval from all three, and one in the French Hill section of Yorktown. Trump later dropped all of the plans, calling Westchester County [...] "the toughest place to build on the planet".|$|E

As known, when the downstream section is free flow, the congestion for every bottleneck section starts from the bottleneck cell, and then gradually propagates towards its upstream.

Three cases have been studied: free-flow downstream, middle-state downstream, and the most <b>congested</b> downstream, and the different convergence states. The results show that 1) if the downstream of the bottleneck is the most <b>congested,</b> the upstream bottleneck section converges to the most <b>congested</b> state no matter what the initial state is; 2) if the downstream is <b>congested,</b> the upstream section converges to <b>congested</b> states, and the degree of congestion in the upstream section increases with; 3) the larger the density in the <b>congested</b> downstream is, the more <b>congested</b> the final state of the ramp system is...|$|R

The expected duration of this state is computed using a probabilistic model of a switching module feeding the <b>congested</b> queue.

The new analysis technique is novel in its modeling the higher arrival rate to a <b>congested</b> queue and a lower arrival rate to an empty queue. Comparison of queue state distributions obtained with the analysis and simulation show that an important feature of congestion is modeled. ...|$|R
