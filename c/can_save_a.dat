25|$|However, EMTs {{were neither}} trained nor {{authorised}} to provide definitive care for cardiac arrest. They {{could not provide}} defibrillation; intravenous medications; or advanced airway control, such as endotracheal intubation. EMTs saved few, if any, victims of sudden cardiac arrest, largely because cardiac arrest occurred mostly in people's homes. The time required for EMTs to arrive and transport the patient to the closest emergency department was too long for resuscitation to be successful. Not even letter-perfect CPR <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>a</b> life if it takes too long for defibrillation and other advanced procedures to occur.|$|E
25|$|Aerobraking {{allows a}} {{spacecraft}} {{to reduce the}} high point of an elliptical orbit by repeated brushes with the atmosphere at the low point of the orbit. This <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of fuel because it takes much less delta-V to enter an elliptical orbit compared to a low circular orbit. Because the braking is done over the course of many orbits, heating is comparatively minor, and a heat shield is not required. This has been done on several Mars missions such as Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and at least one Venus mission, Magellan.|$|E
500|$|According to Jainism, karmic {{consequences}} are unerringly certain and inescapable. No divine grace <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>a</b> person from experiencing them. Only {{the practice of}} austerities and self-control can modify or alleviate the consequences of karma. Even then, in some cases, there is {{no option but to}} accept karma with equanimity. The second-century Jain text, Bhagavatī Ārādhanā (verse no. 1616) sums up the predominance of karma in Jain doctrine: [...] This predominance of karma is a theme often explored by Jain ascetics in the literature they have produced, throughout all centuries. Paul Dundas notes that the ascetics often used cautionary tales to underline the full karmic implications of morally incorrect modes of life, or excessively intense emotional relationships. However, he notes that such narratives were often softened by concluding statements about the transforming effects of the protagonists' pious actions, and their eventual attainment of liberation.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Race Time Trial" [...] is a single-player mode {{where the}} player {{attempts}} {{to set the}} best time {{on any of the}} tracks in the game. There are no other racers to hinder the player, but no item-bearing crates are present to aid the player. When the three-lap race is finished, the player <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>a</b> [...] "ghost", a replay of that race. The next time that track is accessed in this mode, the player can load the ghost, allowing the player or others to compete with the ghost in a race. If the player finishes each of the tracks in a set time, the player will be able to compete against the ghosts of the game's boss characters. The [...] "Lap Time Trial" [...] plays like the Race Time Trial except that the player races to get the best time for a single lap around the track. When one lap is finished, the player's [...] "ghost" [...] (a replay of the lap that was just completed) will appear. Whenever a better time on the lap is accomplished, the old ghost will be replaced by the faster one. In the [...] "Quick Race", the player selects a character, a track and races. The player can adjust the computer's skill level and the number of laps.|$|E

Along with saving the player, Elika can perform many acrobatic feats or combat feats in tandem with the player. The downloadable content Epilogue added a new magic plate that allows Elika to recreate destroyed objects. A new combat maneuver for the player was also added.|$|E

It {{serves as the}} 11th episode of the ninth season and the 189th overall episode. The animation directors were the supervising director, Alan Smart and Tom Yasumi, and was written by Marc Ceccarelli, Luke Brookshier, and Mr. Lawrence. Ceccarelli and Brookshier also served as storyboard directors. The episode originally aired in Greece on July 3, 2013. In the United States, it aired on Nickelodeon on November 11. In this episode of the series, which follows the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob gets fired from the Krusty Krab after Mr. Krabs discovers he <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>a</b> nickel by eliminating him.

SpongeBob offers to work for free, but Mr. Krabs said that he {{considered}} that, but learned that it would be illegal and that he could lose his vending license. Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's apathetic co-worker, asks if he can be fired as well, but Mr. Krabs refuses, because Squidward has more seniority. SpongeBob cries in depression all the way home. Squidward, although gleeful over SpongeBob not working at the Krusty Krab anymore, asks Mr. Krabs who will be the new fry cook. His boss informs him that to save money, he'll take over the kitchen—much to Squidward's dismay.|$|E
