In May 1995, he and Rice visited Lloyd Webber {{at his home in}} France, where Parker tried to bring them to work on the film. Rice and Lloyd Webber had not worked together for many years, and the script for Evita required that they compose new music. In June 1995, with assistance from the United States Department of State and senator <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd,</b> Parker arranged a private meeting with Menem in Argentina to discuss the film's production and request permission to film at the Casa Rosada, the executive mansion. Although he expressed his discontent with the production, Menem granted the filmmakers creative freedom to shoot in Argentina, but not in the Casa Rosada. He also advised Parker to be prepared to face protests against the film. Parker had the film's production designer Brian Morris take photographs of the Casa Rosada, so that the production could construct a replica at Shepperton Studios in England. The director visited seven other countries before deciding to film on location in Buenos Aires and Budapest.|$|E

25|$|The {{race for}} the 2008 presidential {{nomination}} began in earnest after the 2006 midterm elections.

Potential candidates John Kerry, Al Gore, Russ Feingold, Evan Bayh, Tom Daschle, Wesley Clark, Mark Warner, and Al Sharpton reportedly considered running but ultimately declined to seek the nomination. Vilsack dropped out in February 2007.|$|E
25|$|While the 2008 Iowa Caucuses saw {{a record}} turnout for both parties, the Democratic caucus drew more than 239,000 voters, {{almost double the}} Republican total. Entrance polling {{indicated}} that {{a significant portion of}} the turnout came from first-time caucus attendees, as well as attendees under the age of 30; two groups of voters that primarily lent their support to Barack Obama. Women, previously expected to largely back Hillary Clinton, split their vote between Clinton and Obama, the latter of whom actually received slightly more support. In the aftermath of the results from the Iowa Caucuses, <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> and Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.|$|E
25|$|Blumenthal {{announced}} his 2010 run for U.S. Senate after incumbent Democratic Sen. <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> {{announced his}} retirement.

25|$|This {{observation}} is being {{shared by many}} Americans today and {{is considered by many}} experts to be indicative of the current climate. However, the U.S. Labor Department is examining regulations that give workers unpaid leave to deal with family or medical emergencies (a review that supporters of the FMLA worry might be a prelude to scaling back these protections, as requested by some business groups). Senator <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> from Connecticut proposed legislation that would enable workers to take six weeks of paid leave. Congress was also expected to reconsider the Healthy Families Act, {{a bill that would have}} required employers with at least fifteen employees to provide seven paid sick days per year.|$|E
500|$|The men's trials {{took place}} along The Championship Course on 11 December 2014, and {{according}} to the author <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd,</b> were held in conditions [...] "perfect ... for coaches in the process of testing their men and trying to seat people in the right order."

500|$|Lamont {{was one of}} the key {{supporters}} in Connecticut for the <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> presidential campaign. After Dodd dropped out of the race, Lamont became the Connecticut campaign co-chair for Barack Obama's presidential campaign.

In March 2008, Lamont was elected as a Congressional district-level delegate from Connecticut to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, pledged to Barack Obama.|$|E
500|$|<b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> {{entered the}} race on January 11, 2007 after making his {{announcement}} on the Imus in the Morning show. He cited his qualifications {{of experience and}} background as the strengths needed to lead the nation as President. A critic of the Iraq War, Dodd stated that his candidacy [...] "...isn't just [...] Iraq -- there are problems here at home that are huge." [...] He decided not to file with the FEC under an exploratory committee but instead filed as a full-fledged candidate. He began campaigning {{in the state of}} South Carolina on January 15, 2007 and hit the trails to New Hampshire on January 20.|$|E
500|$|The {{ruling was}} praised by {{the video game}} industry, which had {{expected}} the law to be ruled unconstitutional, but sought affirmation by the Court. ESA's CEO, Michael Gallagher, responded that [...] "The Court declared forcefully that content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, {{have the right to}} decide what is appropriate for their children." [...] Bo Anderson of the EMA stated that [...] "there now can be no argument whether video games are entitled to the same protection as books, movies, music, and other expressive entertainment," [...] while Electronic Arts' (former) CEO John Riccitiello asserted that the decision [...] "affirmed the constitutional rights of game developers." [...] Other entertainment industries, such as the Motion Picture Association of America, also showed support for the Court's decision. [...] Former U.S. Senator and current head of the Association <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> recognized that the motion picture industry has seen similar attempts to limit its freedom of expression, and that [...] "We applaud the Supreme Court for recognizing the far-reaching First-Amendment implications posed by the California law." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{stated that}} he would support John Kerry again should he {{run for president in}} 2008, but in January 2007, Kerry said he would not seek a second attempt for the White House. Kennedy then remained neutral as the 2008 Democratic nomination battle between Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama intensified, as his friend <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> was also running. After the initial caucuses and primaries had been split between the two and Dodd had withdrawn, Kennedy became dissatisfied with the tone of the Clinton campaign and what he saw as racially tinged remarks by Bill Clinton. Kennedy gave an endorsement to Obama on January 28, 2008, despite appeals by both Clintons not to do so. In a move that was seen as a symbolic passing of the torch, Kennedy said that it was [...] "time again {{for a new generation of}} leadership," [...] and compared Obama's ability to inspire with that of his fallen brothers. In return, Kennedy gained a commitment from Obama to make universal health care a top priority of his administration if elected. Kennedy's endorsement was considered among the most influential that any Democrat could get, and raised the possibility of improving Obama's vote-getting among unions, Hispanics, and traditional base Democrats. It dominated the political news, and gave national exposure to a candidate who was still not well known in much of the country, as the Super Tuesday primaries across the nation approached.|$|E
500|$|However, {{by spring}} 2009, Kennedy's tumor had spread and {{treatments}} for it {{were no longer}} effective, although this was not disclosed to the public. By June 2009 Kennedy had not cast a Senate vote in three months, and his health had forced him to retreat to Massachusetts, where he was undergoing another round of chemotherapy. In his absence, premature release of his health committee's expansive plan resulted in a poor public reception. Kennedy's friend <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> had taken over his role on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, but Republican senators and other observers said {{that the lack of}} Kennedy's physical presence had resulted in less consultation with them and was making successful negotiation more difficult. Democrats also missed Kennedy's ability to smooth divisions on the health proposals. Kennedy did cut a television commercial for Dodd, who was struggling early on in his 2010 re-election bid. In July, HBO began showing a documentary tribute to Kennedy's life, Teddy: In His Own Words. A health care reform bill was voted out of the committee with content Kennedy favored, but still faced a long, difficult process before having a chance at becoming law. At the end of July 2009, Kennedy was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He could not attend the ceremony to receive this medal, and attended a private service but not the public funeral when his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver died at age 88 in mid-August. By the end, Kennedy was in a wheelchair and had difficulty speaking, but consistently said that [...] "I've had a wonderful life." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 11, 2007, Sen. <b>Chris</b> <b>Dodd</b> (D-CT), an {{occasional}} guest on Imus in the Morning, announced his candidacy in the 2008 Presidential Election while speaking with Imus on the latter's daily program. Less {{than three months}} later, Dodd publicly chastised Imus during the Rutgers controversy. Dodd later returned and appeared on-air for Imus' first broadcast following his return on WABC, though nothing was mentioned of his prior criticism of Imus.|$|E
