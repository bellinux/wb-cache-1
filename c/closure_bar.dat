40|$|Five {{improvements}} {{are reported in}} cold-plate fabrication. This cold plate {{is part of a}} thermal control system designed to serve on space missions. The first improvement is the merging of the end sheets of the cold plate with the face sheets of the structural honeycomb panel. The cold plate, which can be a brazed assembly, uses the honeycomb face sheet as its end sheet. Thus, when the honeycomb panel is fabricated, the face sheet that is used is already part of the cold plate. In addition to reducing weight, costs, and steps, the main benefit of this invention is that it creates a more structurally sound assembly. The second improvement involves incorporation of the header into the <b>closure</b> <b>bar</b> to pass the fluid to a lower layer. Conventional designs have used a separate header, which increases the geometry of the system. The improvement reduces the geometry, thus allowing the cold plate to fit into smaller area. The third improvement eliminates the need of hose, tube, or manifold to supply the cooling fluid externally. The external arrangement can be easily damaged and is vulnerable to leakage. The new arrangement incorporates an internal fluid transfer tube. This allows the fluid to pass from one cold plate to the other without any exposed external features. The fourth improvement eliminates separate fabrication of cold plate(s) and structural members followed by a process of attaching them to each other. Here, the structural member is made of material that can be brazed just as that of the cold plate. Now the structural member and the cold plate can be brazed at the same time, creating a monolithic unit, and thus a more structurally sound assembly. Finally, the fifth improvement is the elimination of an additional welding step that can damage the braze joints. A tube section, which is usually welded on after the braze process, is replaced with a more structurally sound configuration that can be brazed {{at the same time as}} the rest of the cold plate...|$|E

40|$|Let R be a local {{one-dimensional}} domain. We investigate {{when the}} class semigroup s(R) of R is a Clifford semigroup. We {{make use of}} the Archimedean valuation domains which dominate R, as a main tool to study its class semigroup. We prove that if s(R) is Clifford, then every element of the integral <b>closure</b> (R) over <b>bar</b> of R is quadratic. As a consequence, such an R maybe dominated by at most two distinct Archimedean valuation domains, and (R) over bar coincides with their intersection. When s(R) is Clifford, we find conditions for s(R) to be a Boolean semigroup. We derive that R is almost perfect with Boolean class semigroup if, and only if R is stable. We also find results on s(R), through examination of [V/P : R/m] and v(m) where V dominates R, and P, m are the respective maximal ideals. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to verify {{hydrological}} and hydrochemical changes in the Iquiparí Lagoon water column, during three months, as related to an artificial sand bar opening. A drastic reduction in water volume occurred 28 hours after the sand bar opening, exposing the bottom sediment. This was densely colonized by submerged aquatic plants, which were dominant in the ecosystem metabolism, specially near the sand bar. An increase in salinity values, and dissolved and total nutrient concentrations, was observed during the sand bar opening period. In contrast, chlorophyll a concentration decreased. These changes were associated with: 1) mix of remained brackish and marine waters; 2) nutrient release from sediments by physical processes; and 3) submerged plant death. After the sand <b>bar</b> <b>closure,</b> lagoon metabolism was completely regulated by a dense phytoplankton community. We observed that the sand bar opening resulted in an extensile replacement of the lagoon's water and a change in the community mainly responsible for the ecosystem metabolism...|$|R
