5|$|Although {{not part}} of the {{official}} programme, curling was contested as a demonstration sport in 1932, 1988 and 1992. Curling was re-added as a demonstration event in 1988 because the Olympics were being held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where the sport has a strong following. In November 1992, the Nagano Winter Olympic Organizing Committee and IOC <b>Coordination</b> <b>Committee</b> reached an agreement to include curling in the official programme of the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan.

5|$|For the 2013 general election, Dar {{was made}} part of PML-N's central {{parliamentary}} board tasked with selecting {{candidates for the}} election. Upon the victory of PML (N) in the 2013 national election, Dar {{was inducted into the}} cabinet of Nawaz Sharif and was made the Minister for Finance with the status of a federal minister {{for the third time in}} June 2013. In 2014, Dar was made the chairman of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Election Reforms. He was also made the chairman of Economic <b>Coordination</b> <b>Committee</b> by Nawaz Sharif. During the third premiership of Nawaz Sharif, Dar was considered so powerful person in the government after Prime Minister that he was dubbed as de facto Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan. He was serving as chairman of over 45 committees at one time. In 2016, Dar looked after important government matters when Nawaz Sharif underwent heart surgery in the United Kingdom.|$|E

On the same day, he had ceased to hold ministerial office when the federal cabinet was disbanded after Nawaz Sharif resigned as Prime Minister. Following the election of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as new Prime Minister in early August 2017, Dar {{was inducted into the}} federal cabinet of Abbasi despite his disqualification and an investigation was ordered against him by the Supreme Court and was re-appointed as the Minister for Finance for the fourth time After assuming the office of Prime Minister, Abbasi divided the Finance Ministry into separate entities thus minimizing the role of Dar in the federal government affairs. On 11 August 2017, he was removed as chairman of Economic <b>Coordination</b> <b>Committee</b> by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. On 20 August 2017, he was removed from the chairmanship of some 35 National Assembly committees by Shahid Khaqan Abbasi thus further reducing Dar's influence. Pakistan Today reported that the reason of confining Dar to Ministry of Finance only is on direction of the Sharif family. In September 2017, a NAB court in Pakistan indicted Dar in Panama Papers corruption case.|$|E

25|$|In a state heavily {{reliant on}} {{continuous}} supply of gas for industrial processing, manufacturing, residential use and electricity generation, the sudden loss of almost 35% of gas supply had immediate social impacts, and significant {{short and long-term}} economic effects. Many businesses were forced to curtail or cease operations, resulting in workers being stood down or forced to take annual leave, and the government requested that businesses and householders conserve energy usage. An emergency <b>coordination</b> <b>committee</b> of government and industry representatives rationed and redirected remaining gas supply sources. When many large gas users switched to diesel for power generation, {{the risk of a}} shortfall in transport fuel led to the federal government authorising the release of emergency fuel reserves stored at the Garden Island naval facility.|$|E

25|$|Between 1945 and 2005, the {{economic}} structure of Luxembourg changed significantly. The {{crisis of the}} metallurgy sector, {{which began in the}} mid-1970s and lasted till the late 1980s, nearly pushed the country into economic recession, given the monolithic dominance of that sector. The Tripartite <b>Coordination</b> <b>Committee,</b> consisting of members of the government, management representatives, and trade union leaders, succeeded in preventing major social unrest during those years, thus creating the myth of a “Luxembourg model” characterised by social peace. Although {{in the early years of}} the 21st century Luxembourg enjoyed one of the highest GNP per capita in the world, this was mainly due to the strength of its financial sector, which gained importance at the end of the 1960s. Thirty-five years later, one-third of the tax proceeds originated from that sector. The harmonisation of the tax system across Europe could, however, seriously undermine the financial situation of the grand duchy.|$|E
25|$|International NGOs (INGOs) {{have found}} {{operating}} in Iraq highly dangerous to their staff, as between March 2003 and March 2008 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted. This {{has led to}} INGOs to either completely unwind their operations, or else go undercover {{and try to make}} their activities as low profile as possible. INGOs are not treated as neutral parties by large sections of the population due to their beginning operations alongside the invasion and receiving security and funding from the multinational force and the governments that it consists of. The security situation has also led to much of the management of aid programmes to take place abroad, thus lowering the effectiveness of the programmes and creating a fragmented response. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have discussed the importance of using local organisations and also understanding the violence not a single insurmountable challenge, but understanding various acts of violence more individually, sharing the knowledge between agencies and responding more appropriately - the formation of the NGO <b>Coordination</b> <b>Committee</b> in Iraq is a step in this direction.|$|E
