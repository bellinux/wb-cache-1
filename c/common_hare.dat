As illustrations we may refer to the wolf, ranging over Europe and Northern Asia, while the jackal inhabits Southern Asia and Northern Africa; the tree-porcupines, of which there are two closely allied species, one inhabiting the eastern, the other the western half of North America; the <b>common</b> <b>hare</b> (Lepus timidus) in Central and Southern Europe, while all Northern Europe is inhabited by the variable hare (Lepus variabilis); the common jay (Garrulus glandarius) inhabiting all Europe, while another species (Garrulus Brandti) is found all across Asia from the Urals to Japan; and many species of birds in the Eastern United States are replaced by closely allied species in the west. Of course there are also numbers of closely related species in the same country, but it will almost always be found that they frequent different stations and have somewhat different habits, and so do not come into direct competition with each other; just as closely allied plants may inhabit the same districts, when one prefers meadows the other woods, one a chalky soil the other sand, one a damp situation the other a dry one. With plants, fixed as they are to the earth, we easily note these peculiarities of station; but with wild animals, which we see only on rare occasions, it requires close and long-continued observation to detect the peculiarities in their mode of life which may prevent all direct competition between closely allied species dwelling in the same area.|$|E
6000|$|Looking to {{the lower}} half of Table 3, which gives the {{measurements}} of domesticated rabbits, we see that in all the capacity of the skull is less, but in very various degrees, than might have been anticipated according to the length of their skulls, relatively to that of the wild rabbit No. 1. In line 22 the average measurements of seven large lop-eared rabbits are given. Now the question arises, has the average capacity of the skull in these seven large rabbits increased as much as might have been expected from the greatly increased size of body. We may endeavour to answer this question in two ways: in the upper half of the Table we have measurements of the skulls of six small wild rabbits (Nos. 5 to 10), and we find that on an average the skulls are [...] .18 of an inch shorter, and in capacity 91 grains less, than the average length and capacity of the three first wild rabbits on the list. The seven large lop-eared rabbits, on an average, have skulls 4.11 inches in length, and 1136 grains in capacity; so that these skulls have increased in length more than five times as much as the skulls of the six small wild rabbits have decreased in length; hence we might have expected that the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits would have increased in capacity five times as much as the skulls of the six small rabbits have decreased in capacity; and this would have given an average increased capacity of 455 grains, whilst the real average increase is only 155 grains. Again, the large lop-eared rabbits have bodies of nearly the same weight and size as the <b>common</b> <b>hare,</b> but their heads are longer; consequently, if the lop-eared rabbits had been wild, it might have been expected that their skulls would have had nearly the same capacity as that of the skull of the hare. But this is far from being the case; for the average capacity of the two hare-skulls (Nos. 23, 24) is so much larger than the average capacity of the seven lop-eared skulls, that the latter would have to be increased 21 per cent to come up to the standard of the hare. (4/23. This standard is apparently considerably too low, for Dr. Crisp ('Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1861 page 86) gives 210 grains as the actual weight of the brain of a hare which weighed 7 pounds, and 125 grains as the weight of the brain of a rabbit which weighed 3 pounds 5 ounces, that is, the same weight as the rabbit No. 1 in my list. Now the contents of the skull of rabbit No. 1 in shot is in my table 972 grains; and according to Dr. Crisp's ratio of 125 to 210, the skull of the hare ought to have contained 1632 grains of shot, instead of only (in the largest hare in my table) 1455 grains.) ...|$|E
6000|$|As domesticated rabbits, guinea-pigs, {{and white}} mice breed so abundantly when closely {{confined}} under various climates, {{it might have}} been thought that most other members of the Rodent order would have bred in captivity, {{but this is not the}} case. It deserves notice, as showing how the capacity to breed sometimes goes by affinity, that the one native rodent of Paraguay, which there breeds FREELY and has yielded successive generations, is the Cavia aperea; and this animal is so closely allied to the guinea-pig, that it has been erroneously thought to be the parent form. (18/20. Rengger 'Saugethiere' etc. s. 276. On the parentage of the guinea-pig, see also Isid. Geoffroy St.- Hilaire 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' I sent to Mr. H. Denny of Leeds the lice which I collected from the wild aperea in La Plata, and he informs me that they belong to a genus distinct from those found on the guinea-pig. This is important evidence that the aperea is not the parent of the guinea-pig; and is worth giving, as some authors erroneously suppose that the guinea-pig since being domesticated has become sterile when crossed with the aperea.) In the Zoological Gardens, some rodents have coupled, but have never produced young; some have neither coupled nor bred; but a few have bred, as the porcupine more than once, the Barbary mouse, lemming, chinchilla, and agouti (Dasyprocta aguti) several times. This latter animal has also produced young in Paraguay, though they were born dead and ill-formed; but in Amazonia, according to Mr. Bates, it never breeds, though often kept tame about the houses. Nor does the paca (Coelogenys paca) breed there. The <b>common</b> <b>hare</b> when confined has, I believe, never bred in Europe; though, according to a recent statement, it has crossed with the rabbit. (18/21. Although the existence of the Leporides, as described by Dr. Broca ('Journal de Phys.' tome 2 page 370), has been positively denied, yet Dr. Pigeaux ('Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.' volume 20 1867 page 75) affirms that the hare and rabbit have produced hybrids.) I have never heard of the dormouse breeding in confinement. But squirrels offer a more curious case: with one exception, no species has bred in the Zoological Gardens, yet as many as fourteen individuals of S. palmarum were kept together during several years. The S. cinera has been seen to couple, but it did not produce young; nor has this species, when rendered extremely tame in its native country, North America, been ever known to breed. (18/22. 'Quadrupeds of North America' by Audubon and Bachman 1846 page 268.) At Lord Derby's menagerie squirrels of many kinds were kept in numbers, but Mr. Thompson, the superintendent, told me that none had ever bred there, or elsewhere as far as he knew. I have never heard of the English squirrel breeding in confinement. But the species which has bred more than once in the Zoological Gardens is the one which perhaps might have been least expected, namely, the flying squirrel (Sciuropterus volucella): it has, also, bred several times near Birmingham; but the female never produced more than two young at a birth, whereas in its native American home she bears from three to six young.

Reaching a length around 2 ft, and a weight from 3 to 6 lb, the black-tailed jackrabbit is the third-largest North American hare. Black-tailed jackrabbits occupy mixed shrub-grassland terrains. Their breeding depends on the location; it typically peaks in spring, but may continue all year round in warm climates. Young are born fully furred with eyes open; they are well camouflaged and are mobile within minutes of birth, thus females do not protect or even stay with the young except during nursing. The average litter size is around four, but may be as low as two and as high as seven in warm regions.|$|E

40|$|The {{researches}} of naturalists hitherto made {{in order}} to ascertain the geographical range of the hare-tribe {{have led to the}} conclusion, that these animals, spread over the whole of America and Europe, over Northern and South-Africa, as well as over a great part of Asia, are not found in the neighbouring islands of the Philippines, in the whole Malayan Archipelago, and as appears are more-over wanting in the Malayan Peninsula. Of the two genera composing the hare-tribe, the one, that of Lagomys, characterized by the entire want of tail, is confined to Northern Asia and the Rocky-Mountains of North-America. The other genus, that of Lepus, is represented in all the regions inhabited by the hare-tribe in general. An attempt to subdivide this genus in minor groups is attended with numerous difficulties. European sportsmen are in the habit of designing under the name of „rabbits” the species having the ears, legs and tail shorter than the true hares, and commonly making burrows for their residence; but the variability of these characteristics in the different species does not allow a strict application of them. In comparing, for instance, the mountain-hare of South-Africa (Lepus saxatilis) and the Japanese species (Lepus brachyurus) to the <b>common</b> <b>hare</b> (Lepus timidus) we are obliged to range all the three species under the true hares with long legs; although we find, that the mountain-hare has the tail and ears considerably longer than our <b>common</b> <b>hare,</b> whereas the Japanese hare has the tail and ears as short as our common rabbit. The same variability not coinciding with other characteristics, exists with respect {{to the nature of the}} fur. We know that in the majority of species the wool viz: the imperfect hairs, grows at the expense of the true or perfectly developed hairs, and that such is in a great measure the case in some species during the cold season. In the Chinese hare (Lepus sinensis), for instance the hairs are developed at the expense of the wool, which is somewhat longer and coarser than in most of the other species, and in the small hare of Assam and Butan (Lepus hispidus), the hair is stiffened even to rigidness...|$|E
