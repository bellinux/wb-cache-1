In order to create sufficient auto-reactive killer T cells, interleukin-2 must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells can also stimulate cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages via cytokines such as interferon-gamma, encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{specific}} for the hematopoietic system-restricted minor histocompatibility antigens HA- 1 and HA- 2 {{are potential}} tools {{for the treatment}} of relapsed leukemia after minor histocompatibility antigen mismatched bone marrow transplantation. HA- 1 /HA- 2 -specific <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> with strong <b>cytotoxic</b> activity against HA- 1 /HA- 2 positive target cells can be generated in vitro using HA- 1 and HA- 2 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells as antigen presenting cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used HLA-A 2 HA- 1 /HA- 2 tetramers (HA- 1 (A 2) /HA- 2 (A 2) tetramers) to monitor the in vitro generation of HA- 1 - or HA- 2 -specific <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> RESULTS: We show that the intensity of the tetramer-staining of the HA- 1 /HA- 2 -specific <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> strongly correlates with their capability to recognize mHag positive target cells. The bright tetramer-staining <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> lyse target cells expressing the natural ligand. The dim tetramer-staining <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> fail to lyse natural ligand positive target cells and lyse peptide-pulsed target cells only. The frequency of bright tetramer-staining, high avidity minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CTLs increases significantly upon appropriate antigen-specific restimulations. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that HLA class I-minor histocompatibility antigen tetramers are useful tools for monitoring and selection of high avidity HA- 1 - and HA- 2 -specific <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> for adoptive immunotherapy...|$|R

Although rare, reactivation is seen most often following alcohol or drug use, or in people with impaired immunity. HBV goes through cycles of replication and non-replication. Approximately 50% of overt carriers experience acute reactivation. Males with baseline ALT of 200 UL/L are {{three times more likely}} to develop a reactivation than people with lower levels. Although reactivation can occur spontaneously, people who undergo chemotherapy have a higher risk. [...] Immunosuppressive drugs favor increased HBV replication while inhibiting <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> function in the liver. The risk of reactivation varies depending on the serological profile; those with detectable HBsAg in their blood are at the greatest risk, but those with only antibodies to the core antigen are also at risk. The presence of antibodies to the surface antigen, which are considered to be a marker of immunity, does not preclude reactivation. [...] Treatment with prophylactic antiviral drugs can prevent the serious morbidity associated with HBV disease reactivation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{generated}} {{in the course of}} viral infection of mice show two types of specificity. <b>Cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> specific to one virus group will not lyse target cells infected with unrelated viruses (1). Furthermore, for lytic interactions to occur, the virus-infected targets must either share the H- 2 K ~ and/or H- 2 D region of the major histocompatibility complex with the <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (1) or, in the case of radiation chimeras (2), must share H- 2 K or H- 2 D products with the chimeric environment in which the <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> were sensitized. In a previous report 2 we demonstrated a further level of specificity of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> that is, the presence of two distinct subpopulations of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the primary and secondary response to type A influenza viruses of the A (H 0 /N 1) and A (H 2 / N 2) subtype. One subpopulation is specific for the immunizing virus. The other subpepulation exhibits a high degree of cross-reactivity between virus subtypes. This report investigates the possibility that distinct viral antigens, expressed {{on the surface of the}} infected cell, are recognized by the two different subpopulations of influenza-specific <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Since influenza viruses of the A (H 0 /N 1) and A (H 2 /N 2) subtypes have serologically distinct hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens, one or both of thes...|$|R

40|$|The {{exceptional}} antigenicity of {{the major}} hlstocompatibility antigens suggests {{that they may be}} directly involved in the mechanisms of immunity.
