40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on {{a representative sample of}} 243 users of vocational rehabilitation in Slovenia in order to explore the importance of disability for career planning and development among people with disabilities. We analysed the association of disability with demographic characteristics, <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> and employment barriers. The prevailing <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> belong to elementary occupations, even though the majority of participants had completed secondary school. <b>Career</b> <b>choices</b> were mostly based on the participants’ own interest {{but at the same time}} constrained by disability. The majority of participants changed their <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> during unemployment, the most common reason being their disability and the employer’s attitude towards disability. Disability was identified as the main barrier for <b>career</b> <b>choices,</b> employment and <b>career</b> development. The findings highlight the importance of considering disability in the process of career planning and development, and the importance of appropriate career planning as a critical factor for successful employment...|$|R

For example, males feel they can make their <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> independent of their parents while females on the other hand rely on parents for career support. The study also shows that salary is a major issue to consider. Males consider salary to be very important in choosing an occupation and females consider job status in society as most important...|$|R

40|$|Student career {{decision-making}} {{has attracted}} research {{attention in the}} last two decades especially when it comes to choosing tertiary education. Despite the importance of decision-making skills, there are still limited studies exploring this phenomenon in practice. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential role of three different platforms including family, learning, and technological environments on the career decisions of university students. A survey about <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> was designed in order to identify the agreement levels of university students in Bosnian higher institutions. The study findings for students' <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> indicate a positive overall picture. Both family and technological environments were found to be influential on students' <b>career</b> <b>choices.</b> However, no impact from learning environment was identified. In order to generalize the findings, further research is required involving other contexts and subject groups. Only by systematically investigating fundamental aspects of students' <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> and by critically examining alternative theoretical decision-making models can further studies continue to progress on this subject matter...|$|R
40|$|In the {{contemporary}} society <b>choice</b> of <b>career</b> is sex-stereotyped. There are more females in educational and nursing careers, {{and there are}} more males in engineering and science careers. Females and males perceive their roles in the society in a sex-stereotyped way and they try to fit into culturally appropriate sex-roles. People make causal attributions for different situations in life and think and behave according to the causal attributions they make. The research question of this dissertation asks if sex-role and attributional style affect <b>career</b> <b>choices,</b> and if the answer is different across cultures. Two studies were concerned with the relationship between sex-role, attributional style, and <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> at college and high school levels in two different cultures (the United States and Romania). Comparisons were made also between females in single-sex high school and coeducational high schools. A third study determined the changes in <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> following attributional retraining. Results from the studies show that <b>career</b> <b>choices</b> are sex-stereotyped and sex-roles influence <b>choice</b> of <b>career</b> in both cultures. The sex-stereotypical <b>choice</b> of <b>careers</b> is more evident in Romania. Females in single-sex education schools report more adaptive sex-roles and attributional styles, and they choose more diverse career fields than females in coeducational schools. Attributional retraining is related to changes in <b>career</b> <b>choices...</b>|$|R

25|$|Japan's society prepares {{its people}} to work {{primarily}} {{for the good of}} the whole society rather than just the individual, and the salaryman is a part of that. Salarymen are expected to work long hours, additional overtime, to participate in after-work leisure activities such as drinking and visiting hostess bars with colleagues, and to value work over all else. The salaryman typically enters a company after graduating college and stays with that corporation his whole career. Other popular notions surrounding salarymen include karōshi, or death from overwork. In conservative Japanese culture, becoming a salaryman is the expected <b>career</b> <b>choice</b> for young men and those who do not take this career path are regarded as living with a stigma and less prestige. On the other hand, the word salaryman is sometimes used with derogatory connotation for his total dependence on his employer and lack of individuality.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s {{a large number}} of Cangaço bandit groups were in existence. When Lampião became a cangaceiro, joining the Cangaço was almost the {{equivalent}} of a <b>career</b> <b>choice.</b> At the time of Lampião's death, he was the only independent bandit leader remaining. However, his major subordinates, such as Ângelo Roque and Corisco, often led bandits in semi-independent operations at a considerable distance from the main camp, sometimes across state borders. It was Lampião's intelligence and charisma that ensured that large-scale banditry remained viable in the changing environment of late 1930s Brazil. Within two years of his death Cangaço was a thing of the past. A number of potential bandit leaders, such as Corisco, and lesser bandits were killed; many more, like Ângelo Roque, gave themselves up to the authorities on assurance of escaping the death penalty and leniency. Some bandits even turned on colleagues, killing and decapitating them; they then reported to the police with the severed head to show that their renunciation of banditry was sincere.|$|E

That season was highlighted by winning Night Before the 500 midget car race on the day before the Indianapolis 500. During the decade, Gordon also ran sprint cars in Australia and New Zealand. In 1990, Gordon won his second consecutive Night Before the 500, the Hut Hundred, and the Belleville Midget Nationals on his way to winning the USAC national Midget title. In 1991, Gordon captured the USAC Silver Crown, and at the age of 20 became the youngest driver to win the season championship. He also won the 4 Crown Nationals midget car race that season. In his midget car career between 1989 and 1992, he finished in the Top 3 in 22 of 40 USAC midget car events. In 1992, Gordon competed in the Slim Jim All Pro Series' Winchester 400, but finished 24th after crashing on lap 172.
