5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success.

The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the workforce managed by the encomienda system.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.|$|E
5|$|The German High Command fully {{expected}} Italy to surrender and, in preparation, had secretly established a new Army group headquarters commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel at Munich. Rommel would have six divisions {{transferred from the}} Eastern Front, two divisions from France that had just been reformed, and two parachute divisions based in Germany in his new command. However, a Russian offensive in the east prevented the release of all the units promised. Adolf Hitler <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that,</b> without {{the backing of the}} Italian Army, it would be impossible for the Germans to defend the whole of Italy.|$|E

5|$|Within the Lithostrotia, Opisthocoelicaudia {{has been}} found to be closely related to the genera Alamosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Rocasaurus and Saltasaurus, {{together}} forming the family Saltasauridae. Interrelationships of these genera are contested. Many scientists considered Opisthocoelicaudia to be most closely related to Alamosaurus, with both genera forming a monophyletic group, the Opisthocoelicaudiinae. Other scientists <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the Opisthocoelicaudiinae is paraphyletic (not forming a natural group). Contradicting most other studies, Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that Alamosaurus has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of Pellegrinisaurus, and therefore is not related to Opisthocoelicaudia at al.|$|E
5|$|A copy of The Times {{informed}} von Reuter {{that the}} Armistice was to expire {{at noon on}} 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiser sank at 13:24; the ship was raised in 1929 and broken up for scrap in Rosyth starting in 1930.|$|E

5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} a search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-19thcentury, manor {{owners in}} Estonia found the native Estonian Horse {{too small for}} their {{agricultural}} needs, and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the population would benefit from crossbreeding. Finnish horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten Finnish mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T.|$|E

5|$|Orr {{signed with}} Chicago, but his {{injuries}} limited him to only 26 games {{over the next}} three seasons. He sat out the entire 1977–78 season. By 1978, Orr had undergone over a dozen knee surgeries, was having trouble walking and barely skated anymore. However, in the summer of 1978, he decided to make a comeback. He played six games of the 1978–79 season and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> he could no longer play and informed the Black Hawks that he was retiring. He started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford. He scored his last NHL goal and point against Detroit on October 28, 1978, at Detroit's Olympia Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{formed the}} Jazztet in 1959, with the {{composer}} and tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, after each man independently <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the other {{should be a}} member of his new sextet. The Jazztet lasted until 1962, recorded several albums for Argo and Mercury Records, and assisted in the early careers of pianist McCoy Tyner and trombonist Grachan Moncur III. In the early 1960s Farmer established a trio with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Steve Swallow; his relationship with Hall lasted from 1962 to 1964, and included two tours of Europe, one of which had concerts recorded for the BBC's Jazz 625 programme, which were later released on DVD. Hall left the second tour while the quartet, which included Swallow and drummer Pete La Roca, was engaged in Berlin, and a pianist replaced him; this was ultimately Steve Kuhn. In 1964, this new quartet recorded the album Sing Me Softly of the Blues for the Atlantic label. These bands played laid back, melodious music during a period when avant-garde jazz was becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow according to the terms of the Armistice. Rheinland and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained in German ports. However, a copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E

5|$|Four {{weeks into}} the campaign, the Germans {{realized}} they had grossly underestimated Soviet strength. The German troops had used their initial supplies and General Bock quickly <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> not only had the Red Army offered stiff opposition, but German difficulties were also due to the logistical problems with reinforcements and provisions. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the delay was {{to be used to}} adapt strategy to the new situation. Hitler by now had lost faith in battles of encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the pincers. He now believed he could defeat the Soviet state by economic means, depriving them of the industrial capacity to continue the war. That meant seizing the industrial center of Kharkov, the Donbass and the oil fields of the Caucasus in the south and the speedy capture of Leningrad, a major center of military production, in the north.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, {{benefiting from}} much more {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, {{more closely related to}} each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>that</b> insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data {{on the size of}} the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E
