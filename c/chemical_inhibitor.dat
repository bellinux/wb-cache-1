50|$|A working {{system should}} not {{generate}} further trapped gas. Air may be drawn in {{if there is}} a small leak, or dissolved air in make-up water may come out of solution, but this generally indicates a system leak if new water is needing to be added. The most likely cause of continual gas bleeding is hydrogen, rather than air. If there is corrosion or rusting of internal metal components, this releases hydrogen gas. The appropriate cure here though is the use of a <b>chemical</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> rather than continual bleeding. The valves are normally installed with the first installation of a system, then remain in place {{for the life of the}} system. They are generally reliable and require no maintenance.

Aqueous extracts of cigarette and cigarette smoke contain <b>chemical</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to NO-synthases, a heme-containing cytochrome P 450 enzymes. More recently, it was shown that freshly harvested leaves from the tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum, Solanaceae) also contain <b>chemical</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to neuronal NO-synthase (nNOS). Examination of leaves from 32 other plants representing diverse members of the plant kingdom showed that 17 other plants, besides tobacco, contain these <b>chemical</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Of all these plants, 16 are members of the core asterids flowering plant group and 6 are members of the Solanaceae family. Although the identity of the chemicals is not known, perhaps the closely related plants contain the same or similar compounds that inhibit nNOS. The inhibitory effects are not attributable to nicotine. The discovery of these chemicals and their further characterization may help to explain the loss of nNOS in smokers. In this addendum, we discuss these results in light of the effect of tobacco-derived chemicals in inhibiting P 450 cytochromes, as well as our thoughts on how the inactivation of nNOS leads to its selective downregulation through proteolytic degradation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRadiation therapy plays {{a central}} role in the {{treatment}} of glioblastoma, but it is not curative due to the high tumor radioresistance. Phosphatidyl-inositol 3 -kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) and Janus kinase (JAK) /signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) pathways serve to block the apoptosis process, keeping cells alive in very toxic environments such as chemotherapy or ionizing radiation. In the present study, from a panel of 8 human malignant glioma cell lines, investigations on the relationship between intrinsic radioresistance and Akt or STAT 3 basal activation were done. Secondly, the impact of down-modulation of Akt or STAT 3 signaling on in vitro intrinsic radiosensitivity was evaluated. Using a clonogenic cell survival assay, our results revealed a significant correlation between the basal Akt activation and the surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF 2). In contrast, no correlation was found between STAT 3 activation and SF 2. According to this, down-modulation of Akt with a specific <b>chemical</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (Akt inhibitor IV) demonstrated a significant enhancement of radiation sensitivity on glioma cells in a clonogenic survival assay. On the contrary, down-modulation of STAT 3 signaling with a specific <b>chemical</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (JSI- 124) or a neutralizing gp 130 antibody failed to radiosensitize glioma cells.
