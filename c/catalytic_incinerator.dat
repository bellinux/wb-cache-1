The combined system was a modified draft tube spouted bed reactor loaded with Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The annular region {{was divided into}} two sectons, the “hot ” section contained about 7 % of catalyst and it behaved as a desorber and <b>catalytic</b> <b>incinerator,</b> while the “cold ” section, {{with the rest of}} the catalyst, behaved as a sorber. The catalyst particles were circulated between the two sections by use of a draft tube riser. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program package FLUENT was used for simulations of the operation of the combined system. In addition, a one-dimensional numerical model for the operation of the packed bed reactor was compared with the corresponding FLUENT calculations. The results of the FLUENT simulations are in very good agreement with the experimental observations, as well as with the results of the one-dimensional numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|As space {{missions}} become {{longer in}} duration and {{reach out to}} more distant locations such as Mars, solids waste processing progresses from storage technologies to reclamation technologies. Current low Earth orbit technologies consist of store-and dispose to space or return to Earth. Fully regenerative technologies recycle wastes. The materials reclaimed from waste {{can be used to}} provide the basic materials to support plant growth for food including carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients. Other products can also be reclaimed from waste such as hydrocarbons and activated carbon. This poster describes development at Ames Research Center of a process to make activated carbon from space mission wastes and to make an incineration system that produces clean flue gas. Inedible biomass and feces contain hydrocarbons in a form that can be pyrolyzed and converted to activated carbon. The activated carbon can then be used to clean up contaminants from various other life support systems; in particular, the activated carbon can be used regeneratively to remove NOx from incinerator flue gas. Incinerator flue gas can also be cleaned up by the use of reductive and oxidative catalysts. A <b>catalytic</b> <b>incinerator</b> flue gas cleanup system has been developed at ARC that produces flue gas clean enough (with the exception of carbon dioxide) to meet the Space Minimum Allowable Concentration limits for human exposure...|$|E
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOC) and {{many types of}} particulate matter (PM). In the past, <b>catalytic</b> <b>incinerators</b> were not recommended as a control device for PM, since the PM, unless removed prior to incineration, often coated (or “blinded”) the catalyst so that the catalyst’s active sites were prevented from aiding in the oxidation of pollutants in the gas stream (EPA, 1998). Examples are gases containing chlorine, sulfur, and other atoms, such as phosphorous, bismuth, lead, arsenic, antimony, mercury, iron oxide, tin, and zinc that may deactivate the supported noble metal catalysts (EPA, 1991). However, catalysts have been recently developed that can tolerate almost any compound. Most of these catalysts are single or mixed metal oxides, often supported by a mechanically strong carrier such as various types of alumina. Catalysts such as chromia/alumina, cobalt oxide, and copper oxide/manganese oxide {{have been used for}} oxidation of gases containing chlorinated compounds. Platinum-based catalysts are active for oxidation of sulfur containing VOC, although they are rapidly deactivated by the presence of chlorine (EPA, 1996 a). 4.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} efforts made on {{the development}} of an existing <b>catalytic</b> <b>incinerator.</b> The development work, called process characterization, consists of four general parts. These are the development of measurement methodology, the studying of construction materials, the selection of suitable catalysts and the testing of the effects of process operation conditions. The two application areas for catalytic incineration considered in this thesis are solvent emission abatement (VOC, volatile organic compounds) and chip bin emission abatement (SVOC, sulphur-containing volatile organic compounds). As a baseline, the process characterization is started with the development of measurement methodology. In general, the methodology will decrease costs and simplify the carrying out of the actual measurements and thereby make the measurement time more effective. In the methodology it is proposed that continuous total concentration measurement should be used in connection with qualitative sampling to obtain reliable measurement data. The selection of suitable construction materials for the application is very important. As shown in this thesis, the end conversions in solvent emission abatement may even be improved through the selection of the proper construction materials. In chip bin emission abatement, the problem arises from corrosive oxidation products that set limits on the construction materials used as well as on oxidation conditions. Catalyst selection is based on the following catalytic properties: activity, selectivity and durability. These catalytic properties are studied either at the laboratory or on an industrial scale. The catalytic materials tested are Pt, Pd, Pt-Pd, Cu-Mn oxides, MnO 2 -MgO, CuxMg(1 -x) Cr 2 O 4 and CuxCr 2 O 4. The most important selection criteria in solvent emission abatement are proposed to be activity and selectivity. In the case of chip bin-SVOC-abatement, these are selectivity and durability. Based on these criteria, catalysts containing Cu-Mn oxides and Pt were demonstrated to be the best catalysts in VOC oxidation, and catalyst containing MnO 2 -MgO was shown to be best catalyst in SVOC oxidation. A study on the effect of process operation parameters (temperature, concentration and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)) and moisture was carried out with the aid of factorial design. In VOC (n-butyl acetate) oxidation, the most influential process parameter was GHSV, which decreased the end conversion when it was increased. In SVOC (DMDS) oxidation, the effect of temperature was most significant. The end conversions increased as the temperature increased. Moisture slightly decreased the formation of by-products in n-butyl acetate oxidation. In DMDS oxidation, moisture slightly increased the end conversions at a lower temperature level (300 °C). At the end of the thesis, these process parameters are also discussed {{from the standpoint of the}} catalysts' activity, selectivity and durability. Finally, proposals for process improvements are suggested...|$|E
40|$|One {{possibility}} {{for the removal}} of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is catalytic oxidation. For the removal of VOCs in low concentration (&# 8818; 3000 ppmv for propane) {{it is not possible to}} sustain the required oxidation temperature over the catalyst without external heating. An approach to overcome this problem is to concentrate the VOC by adsorption, in a "two-step adsorption-incineration" process. This is an unsteady state process in which the VOC laden effluent gas is cleaned by passing it through an adsorber. Once the adsorber is saturated the VOC is desorbed by heating and purging. The concentrated VOC from the desorber can then be oxidized over the catalyst, producing enough heat to sustain the oxidation temperature. Conventional adsorbents have some drawbacks such as tailing during desorption due to the large particle size, high pressure drop and hot-spot formation. The objective of this work was to develop, characterize and test the adsorbent and catalyst, with low resistance to mass transfer resulting from thin films of active material, for the two-step adsorption-incineration process. Both the adsorbent and the oxidation catalysts were supported on sintered metal fibers (SMF). This is a novel, structured support offering several advantages over conventional randomly packed beds: Low pressure drop, due to the high porosity of the SMF, which is important where large flow rates and/or high quantities of gas must be treated. High thermal conductivity, due to the metallic nature, leading to smaller temperature gradients in the fixed-bed. A very high geometric surface area, due to the small fiber size. On the order of 200, 000 m 2 /m 3 with a fiber diameter of 20 µm. Furthermore, a mathematical model was developed to show the feasibility of the coupling of the two steps in the process. The adsorber was made from a thin, homogeneous film of MFI-type zeolite covering the fibers of the SMF. The film was grown by the seed-film method by hydrothermal treatment. A 3 µm film was obtained with 10 wt. % zeolite on the fiber after 24 h synthesis at 125 °C. This material had a specific surface area of 30 m 2 /g. The adsorption equilibrium of propane was described well by the Langmuir isotherm and the heat of adsorption was found to be ΔH 0 ads = - 43. 1 kJ/mol. Isothermal breakthrough curves were measured as a function of temperature and film thickness. A mathematical model, comprised of a tanks-in-series model with a linear driving force (LDF) mass transfer description, successfully described the breakthrough behavior. The overall mass transfer was found to be solely due to diffusion in the zeolite film. However, the thin films show very low resistance to mass transfer leading to low internal concentration gradients and efficient utilization of the adsorbent. The pressure drop was measured and compared to that of a randomly packed fixed-bed of spheres. The equivalent diameter for a constant volumetric flow rate and superficial cross sectional area was dp = 180 µm, for a fiber diameter of df = 26 µm at 10 wt. % zeolite loading. The oxidation catalysts were all supported on SMF and cobalt oxide was used as the active phase. Three different groups of catalysts were developed. The support was modified by coating the fibers either with a thin film of fine powder (alumina or catalyst powder) or with a MFI-type zeolite film identical to the adsorbent. The third group was made from cobalt oxide impregnated directly on the oxidized fibers. The latter type of catalyst was found to be the most active during the screening experiments. The base support composition was varied (stainless steel (SS), FeCrAlloy and inconel) to investigate the support effect on the kinetics. The stainless steel and FeCrAlloy supports had similar activities, surpassing that of the inconel supported catalyst, which might be attributed to a Co 3 O 4 surface enriched with iron from the support. Between the 1. 1 wt. %Co 3 O 4 /SMFSS and 1. 5 wt. %Co 3 O 4 /SMFFeCrAlloy catalyst the FeCrAlloy based had the highest normalized activity at low temperature (< 310 °C), low propane mole fraction (0. 13 %) and high oxygen mole fraction (16. 7 %). The chemical kinetics were determined from a novel and efficient experimental design. The apparent activation energy for this catalyst was found to be 87. 5 ± 2. 6 kJ/mol, with reaction orders in propane of 0. 38 ± 0. 04 and in oxygen of 0. 30 ± 0. 08. The catalysts were tested up to 350 °C. Mass transfer limitations were absent and the kinetics was described well with the power rate law as compared to the Mars-van Krevelen model. Catalysts based on Co 3 O 4, supported directly on oxidized SMF, are very active catalysts, simple to prepare, withstand deactivation due to hot-spot formation and show great potential in comparison to the industrial reference catalyst (copper and manganese oxide supported on alumina). The adiabatic desorption process was investigated by mathematical modeling. Simply purging the adsorption bed with the hot exhaust gas from the reactor cannot result in the concentration of the VOC due to the high heat capacity of the fixed-bed. Hence, it will be necessary to use either a high heat carrier like steam, with the adverse effects of drying and separation of water and VOC, or an approach in which the desorber is heated prior to purging the bed, changing the adsorption equilibrium in favor of high gas concentrations. For the latter method, the minimum theoretical propane mole fraction for an autothermal process was found to be 350 ppmv to sustain a <b>catalytic</b> <b>incinerator</b> at 250 °C. Finally, it can be concluded that for the first time zeolite films on SMF were used as structured adsorbents, leading to very low internal mass transfer and increased process efficiency. Furthermore, the advantages of the SMF can be exploited in a catalytic oxidizer, which can be combined with the adsorber to annihilate VOCs in low concentrations. A novel method for the deposition of fine powder catalyst on SMF was also developed for the first time...|$|E
