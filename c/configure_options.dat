40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the evaluation of egg quality of 30 to 45 -week-old brown layers, raised in cages or on floor, supplemented with amino acids, using the ideal protein concept with levels of 14, 15, 16, and 18 % crude protein. A total of 400 birds (Hy-sex Brown) were used, distributed into two breeding systems (conventional cage or floor). The evaluated variables were the yolk relative weight, yolk height, albumen relative weight, albumen height, specific gravity, eggshell thickness, and eggshell weight. Treatments consisted of reduced levels of crude protein and were provided to both groups equally. We adopted a completely randomized design, in a factorial scheme, composed of two breeding systems and four levels of crude protein, totaling eight treatments. Five replicates per treatment and 10 birds per experimental unit were used. The breeding system on floor was <b>configured</b> as an <b>option</b> in the breeding of brown layers, of Hy-sex Brown commercial lineage, in the period between the 30 th and the 45 th week of age, since it presents results equivalent to the ones obtained in the breeding system in cages, having the egg quality as parameter.

50|$|Models can {{be created}} and managed by one of several means. Oracle Data Miner {{provides}} a graphical user interface that steps the user {{through the process of}} creating, testing, and applying models (e.g. {{along the lines of the}} CRISP-DM methodology). Application- and tools-developers can embed predictive and descriptive mining capabilities using PL/SQL or Java APIs. Business analysts can quickly experiment with, or demonstrate the power of, predictive analytics using Oracle Spreadsheet Add-In for Predictive Analytics, a dedicated Microsoft Excel adaptor interface. ODM offers a choice of well-known machine-learning approaches such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support vector machines, Generalized linear model (GLM) for predictive mining, Association rules, K-means and Orthogonal PartitioningClustering, and Non-negative matrix factorization for descriptive mining. A minimum description length based technique to grade the relative importance of input mining attributes for a given problem is also provided. Most Oracle Data Mining functions also allow text mining by accepting text (unstructured data) attributes as input. Users do not need to <b>configure</b> text-mining <b>options</b> - the Database_options database option handles this behind the scenes.|$|R

40|$|A common {{practice}} in real estate markets is the sale of housing development units before completion, {{and in some cases}} even before beginning of the actual construction, known as presale. Developers that choose to presell units are subject to default {{on the part of the}} buyers if market conditions become unfavorable. In recent years, court rulings in Brazil have established that developers must refund 70 % to 90 % of payments made if the buyer chooses to opt out of the sales contract. This <b>configures</b> an abandon <b>option</b> for the buyer and creates a contingent liability for the real estate developer. We determine the value of the option to abandon in the Brazilian real estate market and model this flexibility to opt out of the sales contract as an American type option. Our results indicate that the option value is substantial and can have important impacts on the profitability and exposure to risk of the real estate developer with potential consequences to the Brazilian real estate market...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBacterial {{cellulose}} (BC) {{and silk}} fibroin (SF) are natural biopolymers successfully applied in tissue engineering and biomedical fields. In this work nanocomposites based on BC and SF were prepared and characterized by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In addition, the investigation of cytocompatibility was done by MTT, XTT and Trypan Blue dye technique. Cellular adhesion and proliferation were detected additionally. The evaluation of genotoxicity was realized by micronucleus assay. In vitro tests showed that the material is non-cytotoxic or genotoxic. SEM images revealed {{a greater number of}} cells attached at the BC/SF: 50 % scaffold surface than the pure BC one, suggesting that the presence of fibroin improved cell attachment. This could be related to the SF amino acid sequence that acts as cell receptors facilitating cell adhesion and growth.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{architecture}} and design principles that underpin {{the latest version}} of SKIRT, a state-of-the-art open source code for simulating continuum radiation transfer in dusty astrophysical systems, such as spiral galaxies and accretion disks. SKIRT employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical processes including scattering, absorption and emission by the dust. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries, radiation source spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids, and detectors, in addition to various mechanisms for importing snapshots generated by hydrodynamical simulations. The configuration for a particular simulation is defined at run-time through a user-friendly interface suitable for both occasional and power users. These capabilities are enabled by careful C++ code design. The programming interfaces between components are well defined and narrow. Adding a new feature is usually as simple as adding another class; the user interface automatically adjusts to allow <b>configuring</b> the new <b>options.</b> We argue that many scientific codes, like SKIRT, can benefit from careful object-oriented design and from a friendly user interface, even if it is not a graphical user interface.

40|$|The {{throughput}} {{results for}} file transfers using file sizes ranging from 1 Kbyte through 1 Mbyte using both the standard TCP/IP and SCPS protocol stacks are reported here. The file transfers are performed {{at a range}} of balanced and unbalanced link speeds and channel error rates. The host computers used in the simulations are using standard Linux operating system configurations on PC platforms. The PPP {{is used as a}} framing protocol to support communications between the computers. The file-transfer throughput results will show the effects of link configuration and channel error rate on the necessary time to transfer a file. Because the operating system can be <b>configured</b> with different <b>options</b> for the protocols, for example enabling packet header compression, these options need to be factored into the comparison. As part of the throughput reporting, we will show the effects of header compression and selection of congestion algorithm upon the results. The TCP/IP ftp and SCPS-FP using VJ congestion control algorithm results give similar results and better results than SCPS-FP with the Vegas congestion control algorithm in these experiments. No noticeable delay effects were noted with links delays corresponding to GEO orbits with file transfers of 1 Mbyte...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) technology has undergone exponential growth and gained {{more and more}} importance in the recent research, mainly due to the freedom of creating sophisticated geometries that are impossible to produce using either one {{or a combination of}} several alternative production techniques. AM technology has mostly been used for prototyping application during the product design and development phase in many different industrial sectors. However, 3 D printed prototypes have limited mechanical properties and the printed parts usually cannot fulfil mechanical requirements for functional applications. As a consequence, this problem has given rise to a new concept of 3 D printing technique based on adding fibers to the polymeric material matrix. By means of this technique, the mechanical properties of the printed parts can be enhanced. The current thesis has researched in carbon fiber reinforcement for nylon specimens printed by the Mark One printer from Markforged. The carbon reinforced specimens were compared with pure nylon specimens by means of the results obtained from tensile and flexural tests. Nylon and carbon reinforced nylon specimens were printed for both tensile and flexural tests. The methodology consisted of obtaining the specimens by 3 D printer, do the mechanical characterization and treat the data obtained. In order to print the specimens and <b>configure</b> the printing <b>options,</b> a software named Eiger was used. The results of the mechanical characterization of carbon reinforced nylon and pure nylon specimens were compared and thoroughly discussed, so as to assess the improvement of the carbon reinforced nylon specimens’ mechanical properties...|$|R
30|$|Intuitively, two trainings a and b are “very similar” to {{each other}} if (i) they {{belong to the same}} subject (i.e. to the same {{technology}} group in our setting); and (ii) a is replaceable by b and vice versa. Informally, replaceability means that employees in the same context have no particular preference for a over b or vice versa. We formalize the concept of replaceability as follows. We say that a training a is replaceable by b and vice versa if: (i) the trainings that people take before a and the trainings that people take before b are the same; and (ii) the trainings that people take after a and the trainings that people take after b are the same; and (iii) not many people take both a and b, i.e. a and b are independent of each other. Given a training c and the set of all trainings C, we obtain a probability distribution P_past,c(x) over C, where P_past,c(x) gives the probability that a training x ∈ C occurs before the training c. This probability distribution can be easily estimated from the set of sequences of trainings of all employees. In a similar manner, we can estimate the probability distribution P_future,c(x), which gives the probability that a training x ∈ C occurs after the training c. Note that both these are discrete probability distributions, since C is a finite set. We compute Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) between P_past,a(x) and P_past,b(x) as well as P_future,a(x) and P_future,b(x) for any two given trainings a and b. If the average of the these two JSD values is below a user-specified threshold h_ 0, we say that a and b are similar. We use the χ ^ 2 -test to test whether the occurrences of a and b are independent. Thus, a and b are replaceable if a and b are similar and independent. We now use Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD) between probability distributions P_past,c(a) and P_past,c(b) to measure the similarity between the past contexts of the trainings a and b. We measure the similarity between P_future,c(a) and P_future,c(b) in a similar manner. We define the overall JSD value between a and b to be the average of the two JSD values: one between past distributions and the other between the future distributions. Given a user-specified threshold h_ 0, we say that a and b are similar if the overall JSD value for a and b is less than h_ 0. Note that the probability distribution P_past,c(a) (P_future,c(a)) ignores the order of trainings that occur before (after) a. Finally, we use the χ ^ 2 -test to test whether the occurrences of a and b are independent. Thus, the formal definition that a and b are replaceable is that: (i) a and b are similar (as defined above); and (ii) occurrences of a and b are independent, as per χ ^ 2 -test. As an example, overall JSD value for trainings Formatting E-mail and <b>Configuring</b> Message <b>Options</b> in Outlook 2013 and Mail Automation, Cleanup, and Storage in Outlook 2013 is 0.0067, whereas for Managing E-mail in Outlook 2013 and Working with Meetings in Outlook 2013 it is 0.0109, indicating that the latter pair of trainings has less similarity with each other.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} online social networks (OSNs) has led themto {{become an important}} part of people's everyday communication. With millions of individuals who use OSNs to share all kinds of contents, privacy concerns of how all this content is managed have arisen. Social networks are used to share a variety of information, ranging from trivial messages to compromising pictures, music recommendations or information about the status of the public transport. Regardless of the specificpiece of information shared, users expect to control how and where thisinformation is disclosed by <b>configuring</b> the privacy <b>options</b> of their profile within the social network. OSNs are characterized for allowing users to create explicit relationships between them. For this reason, apart from all personal data that users share in the network, user connections are added to the set of sensitive information that OSNs contain. These relationships can be considered sensitive data by themselves. However, these relationships are extremely important not only for the direct information they disclose but also for the structural information they provide. Relationships can be used to infer information about users byanalyzing the network structure they form. The main objective ofthe proposed dissertation is to improve the current situation of onlinesocial network users as to the preservation of their privacy concerns. We will focus on the privacy of the relationships between users, that isthe structural information of these networks, since it is a newly established field in which there is still much work to do. We aim to address the general goal by approaching two different data collection scenarios: obtaining data using web crawlers, and acquiring it directly from the OSN provider. In this line, we concrete the general goal in the following sub-objectives: 1. To study the techniques that allow to infer private information about users from the relationships that they form in OSNs. 2. To examine the techniques and algorithms that allow to obtain OSN relationships from data publicly available on the Internet. 3. To propose local mechanisms that users can put in practice to minimize the information that can be obtained from their relationships in OSNs. 4. To analyze the existing techniques for network data anonymization and its effectiveness in different scenarios. 5. To propose new graph anonymization mechanisms that improve the existing proposals.

40|$|O cultivo {{de flores}} tropicais vem se destacando em muitas regiões do país como uma importante alternativa para diversificação da produção, uma vez que atende às necessidades das pequenas propriedades rurais com bom aproveitamento da mão-de-obra familiar. Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o cultivo de bastão do imperador em diferentes espaçamentos de plantio no Norte do Paraná. O experimento foi realizado no Centro de Ciências Agrárias da Universidade Estadual de Londrina. Foram utilizadas plantas de bastão do imperador "pink torch", obtidas a partir de propagação in vitro. O plantio foi efetuado com mudas de aproximadamente 18 meses de idade e altura média de 80 cm. Os espaçamentos utilizados para o plantio foram: 2, 0 x 2, 0 m; 2, 5 x 2, 0 m e 3, 0 x 2, 0 m, que constituíram três tratamentos em delineamento de blocos ao acaso. Após 16 meses do plantio, iniciaram-se as colheitas quinzenalmente, sendo avaliados os seguintes parâmetros: número de inflorescências, comprimento e diâmetro da haste floral, diâmetro total e do botão central da inflorescência e comprimento da inflorescência. Além destas avaliações, em novembro de 2008 / 2009 foi realizada a contagem do número de hastes vegetativas por touceira e em novembro de 2009 foi avaliada a medição da área de ocupação da touceira e a altura máxima atingida pelas hastes vegetativas. Os dados foram submetidos à análise de variância e as médias, comparadas pelo teste de Tukey a 5 % de probabilidade e os dados de produção pelo teste de Scott- Knott a 5 %. Após dois anos de avaliação, foi observado que não houve influência dos diferentes espaçamentos de plantio nas características morfológicas da inflorescência, exceto para diâmetro da haste floral, que no primeiro ano de colheita apresentou médias superiores nas plantas espaçadas em 3 m, e para a área de ocupação da touceira que foi maior no espaçamento de 3 m em relação às plantas espaçadas de 2 metros. No segundo ano o diâmetro das hastes florais não apresentaram diferenças entre as plantas dos espaçamentos 2 e 3 m, sendo no entanto, superiores em relação as inflorescências produzidas no espaçamento de 2, 5 m. Nos três espaçamentos avaliados houve um aumento da produção entre o primeiro e segundo ano de colheita, com maior produção observada no espaçamento de 3 m entre plantas. As inflorescências se apresentaram com padrão {{comercial}} e ainda que tenha ocorrido uma redução na produção durante os meses mais frios, trata-se de uma opção que não exige grandes investimentos em estrutura, podendo ser conduzida a céu aberto desde que irrigada, e também complementada com a produção de outras espécies ornamentais na época de baixa produção. The cultivation of tropical flowers is being highlighted {{in many areas}} of the country, recognized as an important alternative to the diversification of the production, once assists to the needs of the small rural properties with a good use of the familiar labor. The objective of this work was to evaluate the cultivation of the torch ginger in different planting distances in the North of Paraná State. The experiment was accomplished at the Centro de Ciências Agrárias of the Universidade Estadual de Londrina. Plants of the pink torch ginger were used, obtained from in vitro propagation. The planting was made with seedlings with 18 months of age and medium height of 80 cm. The distances measures used for the planting were: 2. 0 x 2. 0 m; 2. 5 x 2. 0 m and 3. 0 x 2. 0 m, that constituted three treatments in randomized blocks. Sixteen months after the planting, the evaluations began through biweekly crops, being appraised the following parameters: number of inflorescences, length and diameter of the floral stem, total diameter and diameter of the central button of the inflorescences and length of the inflorescences. Besides these evaluations, in November of 2008 / 2009, the counting of the number of vegetative stems was accomplished by clump and in November of 2009, it was evaluated the measurement of the area per clump and the maximum height reached by the vegetative stems. The data were submitted to the analysis of variance and the averages, compared by the test of Tukey to 5 % of probability. The production data were compared by test of Scott- Knott to 5 % of probability. After two years of evaluation, it was observed that there was not influence of the different planting distances in the morphologic characteristics of the inflorescence, except for the diameter of the floral stem, that presented in the first year of crop superior averages in the plants far 3. 0 meters each other and for the area of occupation of the clumps that was larger in the spacing of 3. 0 meters in relation to the plants with 2 meters of distance. In the second year, the diameter of the floral stems didn't present differences between the plants with 2. 0 and 3 meters of distance, being however, superiors in relationship to the inflorescences produced in the spacing of 2. 5 meters. In the three evaluated distances, there was an increase of the production between the first and second year of crop, with larger production observed in the plants distant 3. 0 meters each other. The inflorescences achieved a commercial pattern and although a reduction in the production has happened during the coldest months, it <b>configures</b> an <b>option</b> that doesn't demand great investments in structure, that can be done under open sky, inasmuch as irrigated and complemented with the production of other ornamental species in the period of low production...|$|R
