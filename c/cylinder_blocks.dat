40|$|Abstract. The {{discharge}} flow ripple {{is a crucial}} criterion for evaluating the piston pump. This research examines the {{discharge flow}} ripple of axial piston pump with conical <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> by developing a comprehensive mathematical model based upon the Bernoulli equation and the continuity equation. The novel aspect {{of this research is}} that it includes the analysis of <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> cone angle. From the results of this research, it can be concluded that <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> cone angle has {{a significant impact on the}} discharge flow ripple, and utilizing a conical <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> design is more feasible than cylindrical <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> from a flow ripple point of view.

The T-1 of 1921 had a power output of 500hp (373kW), and went into production as the T-2 in 1922 with an increase in power to 525hp (391kW). The T-3 and T-3A appeared from 1923 producing 575hp (429kW) with the final development, the T-4, producing 675hp (503kW) by December of that year. Wright attempted to build a racing version of the T rated at 700hp (522kW) to rival the Curtiss D-12, but this was not pursued.|$|E
25|$|An intercooler, was {{required}} to stop the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders (pre-ignition knocking) or creating a condition known as knocking or detonation. The intercooler, which was separate from the engine cooling system, with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the <b>cylinder</b> <b>blocks.</b> The hot air-fuel mixture from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main induction manifold, through which it was fed into the cylinders. The intercooler also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers. Finally, an extra radiator (mounted in the starboard radiator duct under the wing of the Spitfire) was used to dissipate the intercooler's excess charge heat.|$|E

The use of carbon-carbon over conventional materials, such as cast iron or aluminum, reduces {{the weight of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> and improves thermal efficiency of the internal combustion reciprocating engine.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The knock sensor is {{provided}} on an engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> to detect abnormal engine combustion (knocking) {{and to provide}} feedback to engine control unit (ECU). The ECU then modifies the engine input and avoids knocking. A commonly used knock sensor is an accelerometer that detects cylinder wall vibration and estimates knocking of the engine. Selecting {{the location of a}} knock sensor in many cases involves a challenging trial and error approach that depends upon the measurement of the knock signal at many locations on engine structure. However, a <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> exhibits many structural resonances. Thus, a large vibration signal at the surface of <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> can be either due to knocking of the engine or due to the resonances of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> structure because of normal excitation forces. Hence, this conventional method does not always yield reliable results. The aim of the work reported in this paper is to experimentally determine the inherent dynamic characteristics of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> and to combine this with a calculation of the fundamental knock frequency and, thus, to identify the optimum location for the knock sensor...|$|R

Aluminum alloys are selected as a <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> materials. The fatigue life predicted utilizing the finite element based fatigue analysis code. The structural model of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> was utilizing the solidworks. The finite element model and analysis were performed utilizing the finite element analysis code. In addition, the fatigue life was predicted using the strain-life approach subjected to variable amplitude loading.

From the fatigue analysis, Smith-Watson-Topper mean stress correction method was conservative life subjected to SAETRN loading.
