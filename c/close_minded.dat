Prominent academic archaeologist Colin Renfrew stated his opinion that it was appalling that pseudoarchaeologists treated archaeological evidence in such a [...] "frivolous and self-serving way", something he believed trivialised the [...] "serious matter" [...] of the study of human origins. Academics like John R. Cole, Garrett G. Fagan and Kenneth L. Feder have argued that pseudoarchaeological interpretations of the past were based upon sensationalism, self-contradiction, fallacious logic, manufactured or misinterpreted evidence, quotes taken out of context and incorrect information. Fagan and Feder characterised such interpretations of the past as being [...] "anti-reason and anti-science" [...] with some being [...] "hyper-nationalistic, racist and hateful". In turn, many pseudoarchaeologists have dismissed academics as being <b>close</b> <b>minded</b> and not willing to consider theories other than their own.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to explore the phenomenon of open minded and close-minded attitudes (OCA) as related to gender difference among three occupational generations in the context of Bangladesh. A total of 360 Ss equally divided into younger, middle aged and older occupational generations were utilized as the sample of the study. Again each occupational generation was subdivided into male and female. It was predicted that the older occupational generation would differ significantly from younger and middle aged occupational generation on OCA factor causing intergenerational differences. Two hypotheses were formulated: 1) The youngest occupational generations would have significantly lowest scores on the attitudinal variables of OCA as compared to the middle and older occupational generations of Bangladesh. 2) Male individuals of all three occupational generations would possess significantly lower scores on OCA as compared to their female counterpart. The results revealed that the younger and middle-aged occupational generation exhibited more open-minded attitudes as compared to older occupational generations. The result also revealed that the male occupational generation is more open minded as compared to their female counterpart.

This project examines the current literature regarding the above problem and then suggests an alternative exploration of the concept of reification as closed-mindedness. Reification will be defined in its traditional sense with the addition that it implies a statization of concepts or interpretations. It will be argued that such reified interpretations are in effect cognitive closures.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} commented on my reductionist account of spirituality in nursing, {{describing}} it variously as naïve, disrespectful, demeaning, paternalistic, arrogant, reifying, {{indicative of a}} <b>closed</b> <b>mind,</b> akin to positivism, a procrustean bed, a perpetuation of fraud, a matter of faith, an attempt to secure ideological power, and a perspective that puritanically forbids interesting philosophical topics.

40|$|There’s no {{question}} but {{that many people}} have <b>closed</b> <b>minds</b> regarding the claims of parapsychology. There’s also {{no question}} but {{that this is a}} sad and – when the <b>closed</b> <b>minds</b> belong to philosophers and scientists – a shameful fact. While a case might be made for the necessity of a certain degree of closed-mindedness for scientists (for if you treat everything as equally possible, your investigation is unlikely ever to get off the ground), there’s no such excuse for philosophers. The philosopher should be unrestricted by fashions in thought, including the unquestioning acceptance of whatever scientific theories are currently dominant. The fact is, however, that in this field and in the philosophy of mind, many if not most philosophers fall short of the philosophical ideal. Unfortunately, those who approach the field of parapsychology with any seriousness tend to reach a galling conclusion: an open mind reaches much the same conclusions as does a closed one. Not precisely the same conclusions; the central difference is that the open mind concludes that some of the subject matter of parapsychology – the phenomena discovered through experiment, semi-experiment, and anecdote 1 – genuinely stands in need of investigation and explanation; the <b>closed</b> <b>mind</b> tends to reject the whole boiling, thus throwing out the baby with the bath water. Of course, the open mind makes no commitment to the paranormal nature of the phenomena, only to their occurrence and to the need for explanation. So, if there really is something for parapsychologists to do, what’s wrong with the way that they do it? In an article of this length, I have a limited number of options: I could gesture in a journalistic way at all the grounds for my criticisms of parapsychology; I could do the same sort of thing, but try to be more balanced; I could choose a few issues and deal with them more fully. Intellectual integrity dictates the third option...|$|R
