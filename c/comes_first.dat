Thus, if a fusion between two proteins occurs twice in evolution (either between paralogues within the same species or between orthologues in different species) but in a different order, the resulting fusion proteins will be related by a circular permutation.|$|E

The film is now considered lost, with the last-known copy having been destroyed in 1940.

Later that month he returned to England and raced for Lord Derby at his Newmarket stables. Formby continued as a jockey until 1921, although he never won a race.|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always <b>comes</b> <b>first.</b>|$|E

We derive conditions under which providing a nonpreemptive priority allows both classes of users to use the facility and get a higher expected public net benefit than the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. The class that is provided the higher priority may or not be the class that dominates in the public optimum under the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. That means that introducing a priority scheme may switch the class that is given preference in the public optimum. It is shown that there exist situations where the class that is granted the higher priority for service could be levied a lower price than the class that is granted the lower priority. In the case where the users alone have perfect information on the value from using the facility, we derive conditions under which a non preemptive priority is superior to the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue. The preemptive priority resume queue is not necessarily always superior to the <b>first</b> <b>come</b> <b>first</b> serve queue.
