5|$|Whether <b>counsel</b> <b>is</b> {{retained}} or appointed, {{the defendant}} {{has a right}} to counsel without a conflict of interest. If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal. The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived, but some conflicts are un-waiveable.|$|E

Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice.

5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary.

It became the standard means to recognise a barrister as {{a senior member of}} the profession, and the numbers multiplied accordingly. It became of greater professional importance to become a KC, and the serjeants gradually declined. The KCs inherited the prestige of the serjeants and their priority before the courts. The earliest English law list, published in 1775, lists 165 members of the Bar, of whom 14 <b>were</b> King's <b>Counsel,</b> a proportion of about 8.5%. [...] roughly the same proportion existed, though the number of barristers had increased to about 12,250 in independent practice (i.e., excluding pupil barristers and employed barristers). In 1839 the number of Queen's <b>Counsel</b> <b>was</b> seventy. In 1882, the number of Queen's <b>Counsel</b> <b>was</b> 187. The list of Queen's Counsel in the Law List of 1897 gave the names of 238, of whom hardly one-third appeared to be in actual practice.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} changes which neoliberal ideologies {{have triggered}} in counselling. Meeting {{the demands of}} liberalism in <b>counselling</b> <b>is</b> a challenge both to organisation and to people. As far as people are concerned, the argument is driven by such questions as: What is the human being of this system (homo consultans) like? What is his world? How does he relate to this world? The questions about counselling as organisation pertain to its objectives and goals. In the industrial era, <b>counselling</b> goals <b>were</b> of paternalistic nature, but in economy-dominated neoliberalism they are certainly different. At a time of neoliberalism, the counsellor faces the following dilemmas: How to gain the client? How to satisfy the client? How to reconcile ethical demands inscribed in the counselling mission with the economic preoccupations of neo-positivist ideologies? In response, three kinds of counselling emerge. Rehabilitative <b>counselling</b> <b>is</b> organised for people severely damaged by adversity. Existential <b>counselling</b> <b>is</b> organised for people whose biographical trajectory is disturbed by temporary problems. Career <b>counselling</b> <b>is</b> organised for people who chose their life-paths in the neoliberal realities. 3871825 Studia Edukacyjn...|$|R

50|$|The Supreme Court, by a 6-3 decision, {{supported}} Betts' conviction. Supreme Court Justice Roberts, {{the writer}} of the Supreme Court's opinion on this case, stated that the precedent set from Powell v.

He argued that in Powell v. Alabama, the legal <b>counsel</b> <b>was</b> necessary because the trial itself was prejudiced. Roberts also stated that the concept of appointing <b>counsel</b> <b>was</b> not required for every case by the states. The Court argued that the right to <b>counsel</b> <b>was</b> not one of the fundamental rights protected by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

The implications of the Supreme Court's decision of this case would last until the Supreme Court case Gideon v. Wainwright in 1963.|$|R
