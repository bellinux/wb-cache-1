The mills had a total <b>cutting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 50000 ft per day, and produced longleaf yellow pine timber and lumber, dressed and rough. In 1903, the company sold the sawmills and nearly 1600 acre of timber, to William F. Green of Bay Minette, Alabama. Green operated the mill under the named W.F. Green Lumber Company. The sawmill was destroyed by fire in 1906, at a loss of $20,000. The mill was rebuilt, but its operations ceased in 1909 when W.F. Green moved to Hattiesburg, Mississippi.|$|E

In 1915, the Finkbine-Guild Lumber Company began {{construction}} of an all-electric sawmill at the town of D'Lo in Simpson County, Mississippi. When operations began in 1916, the D'Lo sawmill had a <b>cutting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 200,000 board feet every 10 hours. Logs for the D'Lo sawmill were derived from Simpson, Rankin, Smith, and Scott counties in Mississippi. In 1918, Finkbine-Guild moved their offices from Wiggins to Jackson, Mississippi.To facilitate harvesting, Finkbine-Guild Lumber Company constructed their own rail lines, often called dummy lines, into their timberlands. One of their forest railroads extended 24 miles (39 kilometers) southeast from Wiggins. [...] The Finkbine-Guild Lumber Company used a Clyde steam skidder which could pull in all logs on 4 acres (1.6 hectares) at one setting, and each pull could bring in 5 to 15 logs to the dummy rail line for loading. At peak production, Finkbine-Guild operated 5 locomotives out of Wiggins and D'Lo. [...] But, the use of steam skidders resulted in complete destruction of young trees, leaving a bare, open landscape.|$|E
50|$|During {{the boom}} years, the Kiln {{was home to}} many timber mills. On December 7, 1908, the W. W. Carre Company, Ltd., from New Orleans {{purchased}} the Herlihy and Haas Mill and built a railroad track to {{the northern end of}} Hancock County to facilitate the flow of raw lumber. The sawmill burned in 1912, and in December of that year the logging railroad and equipment were sold to the Stern Foundry & Machinery Company of New Orleans. In January 1913, the remaining property at Kiln was sold to the Edward Hines Lumber Company of Chicago, and the operation was reorganized as the Jourdan River Lumber Company. The original mill was replaced in 1914 with a new mill with a <b>cutting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 150000 ft per day. To accommodate all of the workers at the mill, around 200 mill houses were built. A school building was also built in the area. To support the number of workers coming into the area, other businesses began to establish themselves. These local businesses included a company store, a 50-room hotel with a restaurant, a small hospital with round-the-clock physician and nurse, a movie theater, and a drug store. In addition, there was a secondary school, several churches, and a semi-pro baseball team. According to historian Samuel Grady Thigpen, for a time the Kiln was the busiest town between Hattiesburg and New Orleans.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: To {{report the}} {{feasibility}} {{and safety of}} the use of a novel energy source that uses an electrically neutral beam of pure argon plasma for the laparoscopic management of endometriosis. Methods: In this prospective pilot study, 20 patients undergoing laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis were included. Characteristic endometriotic lesions throughout the pelvis were vaporized or resected using neutral argon plasma. Specimens were evaluated for the presence of endometriosis and thermal effects on tissue. The bases of the treated lesions were biopsied to determine whether residual endometriosis was present. Results: Neutral argon plasma was used in 18 of the 20 patients for laparoscopic treatment of pelvic endometriosis. All biopsies confirmed complete vaporization or resection with no residual endometriosis at the base. Endometriosis was identified on pathology in all lesions excised. Thermal effects did not interfere with histologic analysis in any of the lesions. No complications occurred. Conclusion: Neutral argon plasma can be utilized as a multi-functional device that has vaporization, coagulation, and superficial <b>cutting</b> <b>capacities</b> with minimal thermal spread and acceptable outcomes.

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} the <b>cutting</b> <b>capacity</b> of carbide burs sterilized with microwaves and traditional sterilization methods. Material and Methods: Sixty burs {{were divided into}} 5 groups according to the sterilization methods: dry heat (G 1), autoclave (G 2), microwave irradiation (G 3), glutaraldehyde (G 4) or control - no sterilization (G 5). The burs were used to cut glass plates in a cutting machine set for twelve 2. 5 -min periods and, after each period, they were sterilized (except G 5) following the protocol established for each group. The <b>cutting</b> <b>capacity</b> of the burs was determined by a weight-loss method. Data were analyzed statistically by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's test. Results: The means of the cutting amount performed by each group after the 12 periods were G 1 = 0. 2167 +/- 0. 0627 g; G 2 = 0. 2077 +/- 0. 0231 g; G 3 = 0. 1980 +/- 0. 0326 g; G 4 = 0. 1203 +/- 0. 0459 g; G 5 = 0. 2642 +/- 0. 0359 g.

Polymers are widely utilized to control filtration, improve rheological parameters, enhance <b>cutting</b> transport <b>capacity,</b> and improve shale recovery (Halali et al. 2016). PAC, xanthan gum (XGD), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), starch, and partially-hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPA) are the most commonplace polymers in drilling industry (Thomas 1982; Plank and Gossen 1991; Oswald et al. 2006; Balestrini et al. 2009; Kelessidis et al. 2013; Toka and Toka 2015; Villada et al. 2017).
