50|$|Colchicum stevenii, Steven's <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron,</b> is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Colchicaceae.|$|R
50|$|The meadows {{support a}} show of {{thousands}} (estimated at 45,000) of green-winged orchid in May, a colony of some size {{in this part of}} Gloucestershire. Also flowering in the late spring are common twayblade, adder's-tongue, cowslip, bluebell, and pignut. Taller grass and flowers develop over the summer and produce a haycrop at that time. Recordings include quaking-grass, <b>common</b> knapweed, <b>meadow</b> vetchling, downy oat-grass, field scabious, meadow buttercup, yellow-rattle, oxeye daisy, common bird's-foot trefoil, goat's-beard, fairy flax and Devil's-bit scabious. <b>Meadow</b> <b>saffron</b> flowers following the hay cut.|$|R
50|$|Colchicum cupani is a {{widespread}} species, known as the Mediterranean <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron,</b> which grows around much of the central Mediterranean Basin, reported from France, Sardinia, Italy, Albania, Greece, Montenegro, Croatia, Sicily, Algeria, Malta and Tunisia.|$|R
50|$|The {{steep slopes}} support bramble and dog's mercury. At {{the base of}} the slope <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron</b> and herb paris may be found, for example. There are {{recorded}} rare plants which include angular Solomon's seal and lily-of-the-valley.|$|R
50|$|These {{calcareous}} meadows {{are traditionally}} cut for hay. They have diverse flora, with many green-winged orchids {{and one of}} the largest populations in the county of <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron.</b> Other species include ox-eye daisy and cuckoo flower.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron</b> is {{dedicated}} to C. von Steven, author of various transactions of the Imperial Society of Naturalists of Moscow published since 1838. Its pretty violet-pink flowers will cover the burnt-out vegetation overnight after the very first rain. Colchicum species contain colchicine, a substance capable of doubling the chromosome numbers of young dividing cells thus causing genetical changes in the tissues which {{may be useful in}} agriculture. <b>Meadow</b> <b>saffrons</b> were known to the ancients as a dangerous poison ( [...] see Colchicum brachyphyllum), and they are presently used as medicinal plants for the treatment of the gout, the active agent being the colchicine they contain.|$|R

5000|$|Colchicine an {{alkaloid}} prepared {{from the}} dried corns and {{seeds of the}} <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron,</b> Colchicum autumnale, is an anti-inflammatory drug {{that has been in}} continuous use for more than 3000 years. Colchicine is an oral drug, known to be used for treating acute gout and preventing acute attacks of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). However, the use of colchicine is limited by its high toxicity in other therapies. Colchicine is known to inhibit cell division and proliferation. Early study demonstrated that colchicine disrupts the mitotic spindle. Dissolution of microtubules subsequently was shown to be responsible for the effect of colchicine on the mitotic spindle and cellular proliferation.|$|R

40|$|L. (<b>meadow</b> <b>saffron)</b> {{from plants}} growing on soils {{developed}} from five parent materials (melaphire, serpentine, sandstones, limestone and marls) were collected and analysed {{to evaluate their}} colchicine content as well as metal levels (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, Co, Cd, Ni and Cr). For all locations, (moun-tainous regions in SW Poland far from pollution sources) where corms were collected, soil samples were taken. In the soil samples, the concentration of elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Pb, Co, Cd, Ni and Cr) was analyzed and also soil pH, organic mat-ter content and sand, silt and clay content were determined. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the concentrations of metals in melaphire (except Cr), sandstone and serpentine soils were higher than those in limestone and marl soils. <b>Meadow</b> <b>saffron</b> corms tended {{to take up a}} higher amount of Fe and a lower amount of Co and contained in their tis-sues a higher amount of colchicine in melaphire soil and some sandstone soils than those in lime-stone and some marl soils.

40|$|The {{ingestion}} of 3 hay types by growing rabbits {{and the consequences}} on animal performance were studied in a first part. Two kinds of hay from high nature value grasslands [CFP (Colchico-Festucetum pratensis) and SBR (Senecioni-Brometum racemosi) ] differentiated by their botanical composition were compared to a classical agricultural hay (control). The 3 hays, offered ad libitum, were ingested at 30. 6, 34. 8 and 36. 1 g/kg body weight (BW) respectively for SBR, CFP and the control, where the consumption of SBR hay was significantly lower. (P< 0. 01). The type of hay distributed {{did not affect the}} consumption of commercial feed or growth (44 g/kg BW and 36 g/d, respectively). The effect of <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron</b> concentration (Colchicum autumnale) in CFP hay was tested at 3 doses (absence, 2. 75 and 15 % of the distributed hay mass) with respect to their effect on ingestion and animal health. Again, no effect of the presence of <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron</b> (MeS) in the hay on these parameters was observed, even at the highest dose. However, during this second part, rabbits preferred to consume <b>meadow</b> <b>saffron</b> instead {{of the rest of the}} distributed hay (hardly any MeS was refused by rabbits at the representative dose, whereas 12 % of the rest of the hay was refused, and 3. 4 and 20 % respectively at the maximal dose). The intake of the toxic alkaloid colchicine corresponded to 30 to 44 % of the median lethal doses (LD 50) at the representative and maximal doses respectively. The real exposure of the rabbits was probably lower, as the absorption of ingested colchicine is reported to be around 50 % of the LD 50 values which are established after an intravenous injection. Nevertheless, the absence of any effect should be interpreted with caution. The colchicine content of MeS varied greatly depending on the time of harvest and the parts of the plant taken into consideration. A late harvest (mid-June or later) would ensure (very) low concentrations of colchicine in the aerial parts of MeS. The presence of cloves on this plant should be completely avoided, due to the very high concentration of colchicine in the seeds. Moreover, long term exposure of the animals to this toxic plant may increase the risk of adverse effects. The study shows that hay distribution can aid digestion without altering the animal's performance. Moreover, the valorisation of hay from high nature value grasslands would not only add real value to the commercialisation of rabbit meat by commercial breeders, but also to pet owners on the condition that hay quality would be guaranteed...|$|R
