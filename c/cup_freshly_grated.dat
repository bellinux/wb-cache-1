40|$|Armoracia rusticana (Horseradish, Brassica family) is a root {{characterized}} by a pungent taste and smell that is released from glucosinolates (GLSs) hydrolysis. GLSs are hydrolyzed by the endogenous enzyme myrosinase (MYR) upon cells damage, producing volatile breakdown products, such as isothiocyanates (ITCs) [1]. ITCs are also known to have anticarcinogenic properties, thus their formation has a health benefit for consumers [2]. Horseradish is widely consumed <b>freshly</b> <b>grated</b> or mixed with vinegar as sauce. Due to its very long growing season, horseradish is only available for few months a year, and the storage affects pungency of horseradish. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate how different horseradish preparations and storage temperatures affect the GLSs, MYR and ITCs levels. Horseradish was collected from Basilicata (Italy) and investigated as (1) grated and (2) grated with vinegar and olive oil (sauce). Both products were stored for 2 months at 4 ˚C and - 20 ˚C. GLSs, MYR and ITCs were measured in the untreated, fresh prepared and stored samples. No MYR activity was detected in the sauce, probably due to the low pH of vinegar (pH = 2. 8).

40|$|The {{effect of}} iron {{fortified}} ‘gari’, a cassava fermented meal on serum iron, hemoglobin concentration and total iron binding capacity on Albino Wistar rats were investigated. The prevalence of Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) among the low income house-hold {{is high in}} developing countries due to low intake of dietary iron. Developing an intervention strategy for IDA {{is a major concern}} and food fortification is considered the sustainable strategy to alleviate IDA. <b>Freshly</b> <b>grated</b> cassava tubers were divided into four subsamples; A-C and then mixed with Ferrous Sulphate (FS), Iron (III) sulphate (F 3) and Ferric Alum (FA), respectively in ratio 1 : 5000 (0. 2 g fortificant kg - 1 mash). The samples along with the Control (D) were each fermented in a solid state for 24 h and stir-fried to obtain gari granules. The gari samples were fed to rats divided into four groups of five for fourteen days and the serum, then analyzed for serum iron concentration, Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) and hemoglobin concentration. The results showed significant increase (p - 1) and hemoglobin (13. 63 ± 2. 8 g dL - 1) and significantly lower level (55. 5 ± 2. 2 μmol L - 1) of TIBC(p< 0. 05), indicating a better iron bioavailabilty.

Method: Ten subjects (8 male, 2 female; 20. 9 ± 1. 7 y; 178. 1 ± 10. 4 cm; 71. 8 ± 12. 1 kg) underwent two testing sessions administered in a randomized and double-blind fashion. During each session, subjects reported to the Human Performance Laboratory after at least 3 -h post-absorptive state and were provided either 354 ml (1. 5 <b>cups)</b> of <b>freshly</b> brewed JF or commercially available caffeinated coffee (P). Subjects then rested in a semi-recumbent position for three hours. VO 2 and HR were determined every 5 min during the first 30 min and every 10 min during the next 150 min.

Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was computed for VO 2, whereas a session-average was calculated for RER, HR and BP. Results: Initial analysis revealed no significant differences. However, seven of the ten subjects were considered responders to JF (had a higher AUC for VO 2 during JF than P). Statistical analysis showed the difference between JF and P (12 %) to be significantly different in these responders. In addition, the average systolic B...|$|R
