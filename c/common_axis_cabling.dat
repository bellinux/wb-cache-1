The collimator {{consists of a}} plurality of plates, {{all of which are}} pierced with an identical random array of apertures. The plates are mounted perpendicular to a <b>common</b> <b>axis,</b> with like apertures on consecutive plates axially aligned so as to form radiation channels parallel to the <b>common</b> <b>axis.</b> For near sources, the collimator is interposed between the source and a radiation detector and is translated perpendicular to the <b>common</b> <b>axis</b> so as to project radiation traveling parallel to the <b>common</b> <b>axis</b> incident to the detector.
