40|$|Weak and <b>collapsed</b> <b>states</b> {{are portrayed}} as the primary global threat to {{security}} so frequently by the politicians, journalists and policy makers that it has almoste become a reality. Yet, this seemingly universalized and undertheorized concept bears a different meaning to each actors and demands critical examination. From an international relations perspective, this paper examines {{the extent to which}} the weak and <b>collapsed</b> <b>states</b> challenges the Realist account of maintaining world order. Conceptualizing state wekness, this paper outlines the key Realist assumptions to contrast those in weak states’ context. Highlighting the Realists underpinning that the structure of international system is resilient, the paper concludes that the concept of weak and <b>collapsed</b> <b>states</b> is a political construction and such states do not constitute a critical mass challenging the essential continuity of international order. International system is still dominated by powerful states and the opportunity for weak states to graduate upward under a resilient international system tends to outweigh the forces of weak and <b>collapsed</b> <b>states,</b> keeping the Realist account of world order undaunted...|$|R

Indeed I think that she herself did not enlighten me fully. There must have been things not fit for a man to hear. But shortly, and as far as my bewilderment allowed me to grasp its naive atrociousness, it was something like this: that no consideration, no delicacy, no tenderness, no scruples should {{stand in the way of}} a woman (who by the mere fact of her sex was the predestined victim of conditions created by men's selfish passions, their vices and their abominable tyranny) from taking the shortest cut towards securing for herself the easiest possible existence. She had even the right to go out of existence without considering anyone's feelings or convenience since some women's existences were made impossible by the shortsighted baseness of men.|$|E

Jos went in a <b>collapsed</b> <b>state</b> to an inn, while Captain Dobbin escorted the ladies, and then busied himself in freeing Jos's carriage and luggage from the ship and the custom-house, for Mr. Jos was at present without a servant, Osborne's man and his own pampered menial having conspired together at Chatham, and refused point-blank to cross the water. This revolt, which came very suddenly, and on the last day, so alarmed Mr. Sedley, junior, that he was on the point of giving up the expedition, but Captain Dobbin (who made himself immensely officious in the business, Jos said), rated him and laughed at him soundly: the mustachios were grown in advance, and Jos finally was persuaded to embark. In place of the well-bred and well-fed London domestics, who could only speak English, Dobbin procured for Jos's party a swarthy little Belgian servant who could speak no language at all; but who, by his bustling behaviour, and by invariably addressing Mr. Sedley as [...] "My lord," [...] speedily acquired that gentleman's favour. Times are altered at Ostend now; of the Britons who go thither, very few look like lords, or act like those members of our hereditary aristocracy. They seem for the most part shabby in attire, dingy of linen, lovers of billiards and brandy, and cigars and greasy ordinaries.|$|E

40|$|Scholarship on how {{to rebuild}} failed or <b>collapsed</b> <b>states</b> {{provides}} scant theoretical guidance {{in the search for}} specific warning signs or mechanisms of <b>collapsing</b> <b>states.</b> This thesis argues that <b>state</b> <b>collapse</b> is a societal response to an identity crisis politicized by the state apparatus in response to a legitimation crisis. As regime legitimacy deteriorates, identity politics are deployed to build support for the regime, but typically at the cost of increasing other forces of internal conflict. Absent a mediating force to suppress internal conflict, the <b>state</b> <b>collapses</b> once the regime has been removed. Somalia and Sudan proceeded through this trajectory during their civil wars, though with different outcomes. Somalia fragmented into clan and subclan groups that continued their inimical relationship perpetuating the war following Siyad Barre 2 ̆ 7 s coup. Sudan maintained two core identity groups separated by the implementation of sharia that survived each state legitimation crisis, though the state 2 ̆ 7 s physical solidity endured. ...|$|R

50|$|If the {{external}} process which presents the two potential states to awareness is interrupted (by means of removing the stimulus), {{the state of}} potential consciousness will remain on the most recently collapsed visual percept. Furthermore, since {{the external}} stimulation of the rival state has been halted, alterations of the perceptual states should not occur since the likelihood associated with the other percept has been removed. Thus, once a new stimulation where both states are reintroduced to awareness, evolution {{of the state of}} potential consciousness begins with the most previously <b>collapsed</b> <b>state.</b> In effect, the state of potential consciousness will collapse again in the previously <b>collapsed</b> <b>state</b> with a higher probability. It can be therefore deduced that when the process of introducing a stimulus to awareness is interrupted, the time evolution of the state of potential consciousness is halted, and the frequency of switching states after presenting the stimuli again is significantly reduced. These predications are consistent with the previous works of Brascamp et al., where it was shown that the reversal frequency of rival states decreases by increasing blank (stimulus removal) intervals.|$|E

40|$|For {{societies}} {{emerging from}} repressive regimes or violent conflict, finding an appropriate approach {{to deal with}} past gross and flagrant abuses of human rights have been dauntingly challenging. Undoubtedly, the situation is much more precarious and complex in totally <b>collapsed</b> <b>states</b> {{where there is no}} functioning central authority. By and large, most studies on accountability mechanisms for past human rights violations focus on the situations of transition from repressive regimes to democracy. In consequence, the questions and different challenges emanating from on-going violent conflicts in <b>collapsed</b> <b>States,</b> and the role of criminal accountability in those situations are not sufficiently examined. In view of that, the focus {{of this article is to}} investigate the role that transitional justice can play in the protection and promotion of human rights in <b>collapsed</b> <b>states</b> like Somalia. Furthermore, this article also examines the intrinsic interplay between politics, human rights, peace, justice and reconciliation in such situations. Finally, the article suggests that instead of a haphazard application of accountability mechanisms that often exacerbate the situation, what is imperative is a policy that takes past atrocities into account and devises mechanisms geared towards both dealing with the past and preparing for future stability...|$|R

50|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of cylinder deactivation used today, {{depending on the}} type of engine. The first is for the pushrod design which uses solenoids to alter the oil pressure delivered to the lifters. In their <b>collapsed</b> <b>state,</b> the lifters are unable to elevate their companion pushrods under the valve rocker arms, resulting in valves that cannot be actuated and remain closed. The second is used for overhead cam engines, and uses a pair of locked-together rocker arms that are employed for each valve. One rocker follows the cam profile, while the other actuates the valve. When a cylinder is deactivated, solenoid-controlled oil pressure releases a locking pin between the two rocker arms. While one arm still follows the camshaft, the unlocked arm remains motionless and unable to activate the valve.|$|E
