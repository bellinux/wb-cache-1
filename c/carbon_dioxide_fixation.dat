5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use {{inorganic}} electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>fixation),</b> whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E

In these systems, Fe can limit the growth of phytoplankton and atmospheric <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> biological <b>fixation.</b> Indeed Fe limitation exerts a global impact on the carbon cycle and the imprint of aquatic systems on our climate. In order to understand how aquatic systems function and increase our ability to predict their response to changing conditions, it is therefore paramount to understand when and how Fe controls operate. This review presents the complex relationship between Fe chemistry and the biology of surface waters to highlight the parameters defining the forms of Fe that are accessible for phytoplankton growth (or bioavailable).

For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the [...] "open" [...] acetyl-CoA pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>fixation</b> in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase, harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centres and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step. There are increasing concerns, however, that prebiotic thiolated and Thioester compounds are thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable to accumulate in presumed prebiotic conditions (i.e. hydrothermal vents).|$|E
2500|$|Anammox {{stands for}} {{anaerobic}} ammonia oxidation and the organisms responsible were relatively recently discovered, {{in the late}} 1990s. [...] This form of metabolism occurs in members of the Planctomycetes (e.g. Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans) and involves the coupling of ammonia oxidation to nitrite reduction. [...] As oxygen is not required for this process, these organisms are strict anaerobes. [...] Amazingly, hydrazine ( [...] – rocket fuel) is produced as an intermediate during anammox metabolism. [...] To deal with the high toxicity of hydrazine, anammox bacteria contain a hydrazine-containing intracellular organelle called the anammoxasome, surrounded by highly compact (and unusual) ladderane lipid membrane.

5000|$|Other organisms, {{including}} halobacteria and flavobacteria and vibrios have purple-rhodopsin-based proton pumps that {{supplement their}} energy supply. The archaeal version is called bacteriorhodopsin, while the eubacterial version is called proteorhodopsin. The pump {{consists of a}} single protein bound to a Vitamin A derivative, retinal. The pump may have accessory pigments (e.g., carotenoids) associated with the protein. When light is absorbed by the retinal molecule, the molecule isomerises.

50|$|The Hill {{reaction}} of photosynthesis {{was discovered by}} Robin Hill (1937). He found that isolated chloroplasts from plants can release oxygen when they are illuminated by sunlight {{in the presence of}} a suitable electron acceptor such as ferricyanide. To demonstrate the Hill reaction in the laboratory dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) was used as the terminal electron acceptor, replacing NADP which was not available due to the extraction of the chloroplasts from the plant cellular environment. The ferrocyanide is reduced (just as NADP is when the chloroplast is in vivo) while water (H2O) is oxidized into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen cations during the reaction. By using this technique to observe the reaction, Hill revealed a variety of valuable facts about photosynthesis. The Hill reaction confirms that oxygen (O2) is produced by a reaction that is separate from <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO2) <b>fixation.</b> The reaction in which oxygen is released requires light; therefore the Hill reaction can be described as the light dependent {{reaction of}} photosynthesis. The reaction in which oxygen is released takes place within the chloroplast of plants and the Hill reaction demonstrated that the release of oxygen (O2) is only a partial reaction which requires one step of photosynthesis.|$|R
2500|$|When {{molecular}} oxygen is the substrate, {{the products of}} the oxygenase reaction are phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycolate is recycled through a sequence of reactions called photorespiration, which involves enzymes and cytochromes located in the mitochondria and peroxisomes (this is a case of metabolite repair). In this process, two molecules of phosphoglycolate are converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, which can reenter the Calvin cycle. Some of the phosphoglycolate entering this pathway can be retained by plants to produce other molecules such as glycine. At ambient levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the ratio of the reactions is about 4 to 1, which results in a net <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>fixation</b> of only 3.5. [...] Thus, the inability of the enzyme to prevent the reaction with oxygen greatly reduces the photosynthetic capacity of many plants. Some plants, many algae, and photosynthetic bacteria have overcome this limitation by devising means to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide around the enzyme, including [...] carbon fixation, crassulacean acid metabolism, and the use of pyrenoid.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfur {{oxidation}} {{involves the}} oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide [...] ), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate (...) to form sulfuric acid (...) [...] [...] A {{classic example of}} a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is Beggiatoa, a microbe originally described by Sergei Winogradsky, {{one of the founders}} of environmental microbiology. Another example is Paracoccus. Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed. [...] This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane. [...] Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>fixation</b> via the Calvin cycle using reverse electron flow, an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their thermodynamic gradient to produce NADH. [...] Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite (...) and subsequently converted to sulfate (...) by the enzyme sulfite oxidase. [...] Some organisms, however, accomplish the same oxidation using a reversal of the APS reductase system used by sulfate-reducing bacteria (see above). [...] In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production. [...] In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. Thiobacillus denitrificans) use nitrate (...) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.|$|E

The latter 800 -kilodalton apparatus consists of four peripheral catalytic sections and an electron-supplying core with 46 electronically coupled [4 Fe- 4 S] clusters. Catalysis is separately performed by subunits FwdBD (FwdB and FwdD), which are related to tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase, and subunit FwdA, a binuclear metal center carrying amidohydrolase. CO 2 is first reduced to formate in FwdBD, which then diffuses through a 43 -angstrom-long tunnel to FwdA, where it condenses with methanofuran to formyl-methanofuran.

30|$|There {{are many}} {{potential}} options for <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> capture from petrochemical industry and its utilization as a C 1 feedstock {{for the production}} of petrochemical intermediates and/or products. However, as the capture and the transformation of CO 2 by itself requires energy input and CO 2 gives no enthalpy contribution to the final product, the contribution to net CO 2 emission could not be significant unless more effective techniques and renewable energy (or hydrogen) source are available. Consequently, the product demand, the source of energy and overall net carbon emissions have to be taken into consideration. Large impact of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> capture and <b>fixation</b> on global CO 2 emissions could be realized only if bulk chemicals are the target of conversion. Several potential utilization routes are possible for the petrochemical industry. Based on the above discussions on CO 2 separation methods, it can be concluded that flue gases properties (mainly concentration of CO 2, temperature and pressure) are the most effective factors for selection of suitable process for CO 2 separation. Catalytic CO 2 hydrogenation seems to have the highest potential for implementation in petrochemical industry. Further R&D is needed on catalysis and hydrogen (energy) source. Electrochemical or photo-electrochemical CO 2 conversion is promising, but technology is still in its infancy.|$|R

30|$|Because ethanol-fermenting {{microorganisms}} preferentially metabolise glucose, {{an increase}} in content of biomass polysaccharides, especially cellulose, should lead to {{an increase in}} glucose for improved microbial utilisation. The targeting of cellulose biosynthesis is one means of increasing cellulose concentration. Cellulose is synthesised at the plasma membrane by a cellulose synthase (CESA) complex, which has been identified in rice. The distribution and movement of CESA complexes in the plasma membrane is related to cellulose length [19]; cellulose content can perhaps be increased by controlling these factors. The sucrose synthase-encoding gene Susy is a potential alternative for increasing cellulose content, as its overexpression in poplar has been found to increase cellulose content by 2 – 6 % without triggering any adverse effects on plant growth [20]. Enhanced photosynthesis can also increase cellulose production. Photosynthetic rate is positively linked to canopy <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO 2) <b>fixation</b> rate and productivity [1]. For example, the cultivation of rice under elevated CO 2 levels results in higher yields of biomass [21]. These approaches can provide fermentable sugar-rich biomass for ethanol production.|$|R
