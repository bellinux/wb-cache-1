40|$|Nanocomposite {{thin films}} {{comprised}} of metastable metal-carbides in a carbon matrix {{have a wide}} variety of applications ranging from hard coatings to magnetics and energy storage and conversion. While their deposition using non-equilibrium techniques is established, the understanding of the dynamic evolution of such metastable nanocomposites under thermal equilibrium conditions at elevated temperatures during processing and during device operation remains limited. Here, we investigate sputter deposited nanocomposites of metastable Ni carbide (Ni 3 C) nanocrystals in an amorphous carbon (a-C) matrix during thermal post-deposition processing via complementary in-situ X-ray diffractometry, in-situ Raman spectroscopy and in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. At low annealing temperatures (300 °C) we observe isothermal Ni 3 C decomposition into face-centered-cubic Ni and amorphous carbon, however, without changes to the initial finely structured nanocomposite morphology. Only for higher temperatures (400 - 800 °C) Ni-catalyzed isothermal graphitization of the amorphous carbon matrix sets in, which we link to bulk-diffusion-mediated phase separation of the nanocomposite into <b>coarser</b> <b>Ni</b> and graphite <b>grains.</b> Upon natural cooling, only minimal precipitation of additional carbon from the Ni is observed, showing that even for highly carbon saturated systems precipitation upon cooling can be kinetically quenched. Our findings demonstrate that phase transformations of the filler and morphology modifications of the nanocomposite can be decoupled which is advantageous from a manufacturing perspective. Our in-situ study also identifies the high carbon content of the Ni filler crystallites at all stages of processing as the key hallmark feature of such metal-carbon nanocomposites that governs their entire thermal evolution. In a wider context, we also discuss our findings with regard to the much debated potential role of metastable Ni 3 C as a catalyst phase in graphene and carbon nanotube growth...|$|R

The electrodeposited nanocoatings (ENCs) were prepared, separately from a nickel sulphate electrolyte bath with addition of Cr nanoparticles {{in an average}} size of 39 nm, or with Al nanoparticles in an average size of 75 nm.

It is proposed that the dispersion of the Cr or Al nanoparticles among the nanocrystalline <b>Ni</b> <b>grains</b> greatly increased the surface density of the nucleation sites for Cr 2 O 3 or Al 2 O 3; simultaneously, the nanostructured coatings favored rapid healing of the narrowed Cr 2 O 3 or Al 2 O 3 nuclei during a very short transient period, which consequently led to the suppression of NiO growth...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHere we {{demonstrate}} {{the growth of}} transfer-free graphene on SiO 2 insulator substrates from sputtered carbon and metal layers with rapid thermal processing in the same evacuation. It was found that graphene always grows atop the stack and {{in close contact with}} the Ni. Raman spectra typical of high quality exfoliated monolayer graphene were obtained for samples under optimised conditions with monolayer surface coverage of up to 40 % and overall graphene surface coverage of over 90 %. Transfer-free graphene is produced on SiO 2 substrates with the removal of Ni in acid when Ni thickness is below 100 nm, which effectively eliminates the need to transfer graphene from metal to insulator substrates and paves the way to mass production of graphene directly on insulator substrates. The characteristics of Raman spectrum depend on the size of <b>Ni</b> <b>grains,</b> which in turn depend on the thickness of Ni, layer deposition sequence of the stack and RTP temperature. The mechanism of the transfer-free growth process was studied by AFM in combination with Raman. A model is proposed to depict the graphene growth process.

40|$|Stabilization of nanocrystalline grain sizes by {{second phase}} {{particles}} can facilitate superplasticity at high strain rates and/or low temperatures. A metastable single phase nano-Ni-P alloy prepared by electrodeposition, {{with a grain}} size of similar to 6 nm, transforms to a nanoduplex structure at T> 673 K, with similar to 4 vol. % Ni 3 P particles at triple junctions and within <b>Ni</b> <b>grains.</b> The nanoduplex microstructure is reasonably stable up to 777 K, {{and the growth of}} <b>Ni</b> <b>grains</b> occurs in a coupled manner with the growth of Ni 3 P particles such that the ratio of the two mean sizes (Z) is essentially constant. High temperature tests for a grain size of 290 nm reveal superplastic behavior with an optimum elongation to failure of 810 % at a strain rate of 7 x 10 (- 4) s(- 1) and a relatively low temperature of 777 K. Superplastic deformation enhances both grain growth and the ratio Z, implying that grain boundary sliding (GBS) significantly influences the microstructural dynamics. Analysis of the deformation processes suggests that superplasticity is associated with GBS controlled by the overcoming of intragranular particles by dislocations, so that deformation is independent of the grain size. The nano-Ni-P alloy exhibits lower ductility than nano-Ni due to concurrent cavitation caused by higher stresses. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The composite coatings were tested and compared to pure nickel deposits regarding the microstructure, microhardness and wear resistance under high load at both room temperature and 300 oC. The codeposition of the SiC particles changed the microstructure of the nickel matrix and the preferential orientation of the <b>Ni</b> <b>grains</b> leading to a noticeable improvement on both microhardness and wear resistance. The pure nickel deposit present a pseudocolumnar structure and a preferential [100] orientation.
