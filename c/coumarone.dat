30|$|Various zirconia-based {{catalysts}} {{were reported}} for the synthesis of coumarin through Pechmann reaction. Coumarin belongs to a class of flavonoids and a type of benzo- 2 -pyrone, which is a plant secondary metabolite isolated from natural plants and some microorganisms. For instance, the antibiotic novobiocin, coumermycin A 1, and chlorobiocin were isolated from microorganisms [1, 2]. Coumarin acts as a safeguard against viral, bacterial, and fungal attacks, wounds, and stress by a process called phytoalexins [3, 4]. The potential biological applications of coumarin were reported as platelet aggregation inhibition, antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant [7, 8]. Coumarin and its derivatives are widely used in synthetic, pharmaceutical, and agrochemicals industries and also used as optical brightening agents, insecticidal, additive in perfumes, and cosmetics [5, 6]. Coumarine serves as an intermediate in the synthesis of several organic reactions, i.e., furocoumarins, chromenes, <b>coumarones,</b> and 2 -acylresorcinols [9]. Calanolides, a polycyclic coumarin, exhibited potent anti-HIV (NNRTI) activity and was isolated from genus Calophyllum [10].|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to find rubber compound adhesive formula for preparing leather shoes of direct vulcanizing process. Leather shoes manufactured by vulcanizing process need a suitable rubber compound adhesive for joining the leather uppers and unvulcanized rubber compound soles. The amount of tackifier in rubber compound adhesive influence the adhesive bonding strength. In preparing the adhesive formula, the effect of <b>coumarone</b> resin addition as tackifier were varies in the mount of 5, 10 and 15 phr respectively. Rubber compound adhesive was produced by two roll mill machine, after that compound were dissolved in wash benzene with ratio 1 : 10. The prepared adhesive then was applied to manufacture leather shoes using vulcanization moulding at temperature 1700 C and 150 kg/cm 2 pressure for 8 minutes. The best adhesive formula could be as the following : natural rubber 100 phr, calcium silicate 5 phr, <b>coumarone</b> resin 10 phr, zinc oxide 10 phr, stearic acid 2 phr, AOSP 2 phr, MBTS 0, 8 phr; TMTD 0, 2 phr and sulphur 2 phr. The best formula had the peeling strength of the outsole 65, 25 kg, peeling strength of the insole 1553 g/cm, and could meet the requirements of JIS 5050, 1984 for Leather shoes. Viscosity of the formula was 2250 cp. ...|$|E

40|$|Anticoagulation {{treatment}} is an inevitable part of complex {{approach to a}} number of cardiovascular diseases. From {{the point of view of}} nurse?s participation in treatment and nursing process in these diseases/nosological units treatment with oral anticoagulants is the biggest task and challenge. This is mostly provided on out-patient basis, so the immediate monitoring by medical staff, which is commonplace in hospitalized patients, cannot be ensured. The more important is to achieve optimum cooperation and participation of a patient in the treatment process by means of educational process. So education, its evaluation and continuous improvement has key importance here. Anticoagulation treatment of course brings patients big benefit, it prevents thrombotic and embolic complications, however itself it is a potential source of important and dangerous side effects. Education thus has to prevent insufficient treatment (i. e. underdosage) as well as excess treatment (i. e. overdosage). To achieve the optimum anticoagulation treatment, which is easy to check by adherence to the contractual desirable therapeutic INR values (or by conventional Quick Test) patients have to be educated particularly in relation to adherence to the dosage scheme of particular medicines, then to the same extent in relation to specific dietetic measures in treatment by oral <b>coumarone</b> anticoagulants. The aim of our work is to find and quantify the extent to which patients adhere to the principles achieved through education, to compare the results in men and women, and finally to find if dependence between the extent of adherence to the principles achieved through education and anticoagulation treatment efficiency (INR values within required limits) exists. We collected data for this work by means of quantitative research strategy where we used the questionnaire method. The patient questionnaire includes closed questions related to 7 regime areas (movement, diet, smoking, alcohol, antistress mode, drug dosage, specific dietetic measure in warfarin treatment) and one open question aimed at patient?s knowledge of type of food relevant for specific dietetic measure in warfarin treatment. The collected data and results are elaborated in graphic form. Three hypotheses were set: 1. Patients treated with warfarin adhere to the principles achieved by education. 2. Women adhere to the principles achieved by education more than men. 3. Direct dependence between the education success rate and the coagulation treatment success exists. The research showed that patients adhere to the principles inculcated in them by education process. The first hypothesis was confirmed. Comparison of the results showed that women adhere to the principles more than men. The second hypothesis was confirmed as well. Comparison of the results of the success rate in achieving the target therapeutic INR values with the education success rate showed that anticoagulation treatment success rate rises with education success rate. The higher the education success rate the higher the rate of INR reading within the target therapeutic range. The third hypothesis was also confirmed. The results also showed that while the education success rate in relation to adherence to treatment scheme is practically 99 %, the success rate of education in relation to special dietetic measures in warfarin {{treatment is}} about 80 %. Here we can see an area for improvement of the education process. The results of our findings within this Thesis were used as inputs for elaboration of a paradigm for education activities of nurses towards patients on oral coagulation treatment. The paradigm forms an annex to the Thesis. This may improve the educational activity of nurses in this sphere and reduce the risk of both, insufficient and excessive anticoagulation treatment...|$|E
