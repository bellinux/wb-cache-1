40|$|We {{examine the}} {{evolutionary}} dynamics of gametic and genotypic disequilibria between a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> and a nuclear gene under two mating system models relevant to hybrid zones. In the first model, in which female mating preference {{is determined by}} an epistatic interaction between the two loci, permanent nonzero cytonuclear disequilibria are possible {{for a variety of}} initial genotype frequencies, particularly when rates of assortative mating for the two parental species are high. In contrast, when mating preference is effectively determined by interaction between a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> and the multilocus nuclear genotypes characteristic of the parental species, all cytonuclear disequilibria, as well as frequencies of pure parentals, rapidly decay to zero unless assortative mating is nearly perfect.

40|$|Post-transcriptional {{control of}} gene {{expression}} is {{mediated by the}} interaction of RNA-binding proteins with their cognate mRNAs that specifically regulate their stability, localization and translation. mRNA-binding proteins are multifunctional {{and it has been}} proposed therefore that a combinatorial RNA-binding protein code exists that allows specific protein sub-complexes to control <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression under a range of pathophysiological conditions. We show that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is central to one such complex that forms in apoptotic cells. Thus, during apoptosis initiated by TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand there is a change in the repertoire of RNA-binding proteins with which PTB interacts. We show that altering the cellular levels of PTB and its binding partners, either singly or in combination, is sufficient to directly change the rates of apoptosis with increased expression of PTB, YBX 1, PSF and NONO/p 54 (nrb) accelerating this process. Mechanistically, we show that these proteins post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression, and therefore apoptotic rates, by interacting with and stimulating the activity of RNA elements (internal ribosome entry segments) found in mRNAs that are translated during apoptosis. Taken together, our data show that PTB function is controlled by a set of co-recruited proteins and importantly provide further evidence {{that it is possible to}} dictate cell fate by modulating <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression pathways alone.

40|$|A novel <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression}} {{system has been}} developed. This system differs from other {{expression system}}s in that it relies on the co-delivery of plasmid DNA and T 7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) during trans-fection. The plasmid contains a T 7 RNAP gene driven by the T 7 promoter (T 7 autogene) and a functional/ reporter gene driven by another T 7 promoter (T 7 T 7 / T 7 -gene construct). Once this DNA- enzyme complex is introduced into eukaryotic cells, the transcription of the T 7 RNAP and the functional/reporter genes is initiated by the co-delivered T 7 RNAP. The T 7 RNAP, {{which is responsible for}} the initiation and maintenance of expression of both T 7 and functional/reporter genes, is replenished by translation of newly synthesized T 7 mRNA. This T 7 system was designed in such a manner that the expression of the functional/reporter genes can occur in the cytoplasm and does not require any nuclear involvement. When transfected by either a pT 7 T 7 /T 7 Luc or a pT 7 T 7 /T 7 hGH plasmids with the co-introduced T 7 RNAP, mouse L cells were found to express high levels of luciferase immediately after transfection, apparently due to the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression; the expression of human growth hormone (hGH) could be sustained for at least 6 days. Both T 7 and hGH mRNA were expressed by the cells trans-fected with pT 7 T 7 /T 7 hGH.

50|$|Gynodioecy is {{determined}} {{as a result}} of a genetic mutation that stops a plant from producing pollen, but still allows normal female reproductive features. In plants, nuclear genes are inherited from both parents, but all the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> come from the mother.

50|$|The first {{documentation}} of male sterility was by Joseph Gottlieb KÃ¶lreuter, who observed anther abortion within species and specific hybrids. Cytoplasmic male sterility {{has now been}} identified in over 150 plant species. It is more prevalent than female sterility, either because the male sporophyte and gametophyte are less protected from the environment than the ovule and embryo sac, or because it results from natural selection on mitochondrial genes which are maternally inherited and are thus not concerned with pollen production. Male sterility is easy to detect because {{a large number of}} pollen grains are produced and are easily studied. Male sterility is assayed through staining techniques (carmine, lactophenol or iodine), while detection of female sterility is by the absence of seeds. Male-sterile plants may be propagated, since they can still set seed, while female-sterile plants cannot. Male sterility can arise spontaneously via mutations in nuclear and/or <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes.</b>|$|E

More recent observations in Neurospora have suggested that a cytoplasmic, presumably mitochondrial, genetic determinant controls the structural proteins of different membrane systems (mitochondria, microsomes, nuclear membrane) [8, 9]; these structural proteins, from their amino acid composition, fingerprinting pattern, and immunological behavior, appear to be identical or to have a common component.

This survey revealed {{a high level of}} polymorphism, with an average number of alleles per locus of 23. 59 and 5. 29 and an average PIC-value of 0. 83 and 0. 54 for nuclear SSR markers and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> markers, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 16. 27 and 16. 53 % of the total variation was due to differences among species, with the remaining 56. 35 and 83. 47 % due to differences within species and 27. 39 and 0 % due to differences within individuals in 32 nuclear SSR markers set and 6 chloroplast gene markers set, respectively. The 32 nuclear SSR markers detected three subpopulations among 357 individuals, whereas the 6 chloroplast gene markers revealed three subpopulations among 160 accessions in the STRUCTURE analysis. In the clustering analysis, the three inbred species clustered into a single group, whereas the outbreeding species were clearly divided, especially according to nuclear SSR markers. In addition, almost all Lolium multiflorum populations were clustered into group C 4, which could be further divided into three subgroups, whereas Lolium perenne populations primarily clustered into two groups (C 2 and C 3), with a few lines that instead grouped with L. multiflorum (C 4) or Lolium rigidum (C 6).

Moench and Sorghum sudanense (Piper) Stapf. {{were found to}} be multigenic and complex. Generation means analysis from both the Gardner and Eberhart, and Mather and Jinks methods, indicated that additive genetic effects were the most important for seed weight, HCN-p, and A(, 330), while both additive and dominance genetic effects were important for leaf weight and seedling height. A highly positive correlation between seed weight and HCN-p was found across all entries, suggesting that large-seeded entries had greater HCN-p. ^ A seed-parent effect was found for all traits in the F(, 1) and backcross generations. No evidence of this reciprocal effect was found in the F(, 2), suggesting that <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> were not involved. The reciprocal effects for seed weight were probably due to gene dosage in the triploid endosperm. Larger seeds produced larger and taller seedlings, but seed size seemed to have little if any influence on HCN-p of the seedlings.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{uncovered}} {{an abundance of}} non-neutral cytoplasmic genetic variation within species, which suggests that we should no longer consider the cytoplasm an idle intermediary of evolutionary change. Nonneutrality of cytoplasmic genomes is particularly intriguing, given that these genomes are maternally transmitted. This means that the fate of any given cytoplasmic genetic mutation is directly tied to its performance when expressed in females. For this reason, it has been hypothesized that <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> will coevolve via a sexually antagonistic arms race with the biparentally transmitted nuclear genes with which they interact. We assess this prediction, examining the intergenomic contributions to {{the costs and benefits}} of mating in Callosobruchus maculatus females subjected to a mating treatment with three classes (kept virgin, mated once, or forced to cohabit with a male). We find no evidence that the economics of mating are determined by interactions between <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> expressed in females and nuclear genes expressed in males and, therefore, no support for a sexually antagonistic intergenomic arms race. The cost of mating to females was, however, shaped by an interaction between the cytoplasmic and nuclear genes expressed within females. Thus, cytonuclear interactions are embroiled in the economics of mating...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{regulation}} of gene expression in trypanosomatids is predominantly post-transcriptional.

However, the processed mRNAs are not necessarily functionally related, suggesting the existence of mechanisms for the degradation or storage of untrans-latable mRNAs. Determination of the TriTryps (Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi) genome sequences has allowed the identification of genes encoding potential regulatory proteins. This review discusses some of the mechanisms and regulatory elements involved in <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression regulation in Trypanosoma cruzi. We also discuss how functional genomic tools have contributed toward determining the role played by RNA binding protein complexes, supporting the concept of âpost-transcriptional RNA operons â or âRNA regulonsâ.

These vectors allow long-term expression at moderate levels and complement previous vectors designed for short-term high-level expression.

Chloroplast DNAs from the two parents followed different paths in the zygote, but nuclear DNAs showed no differences. Chloroplast DNA from the female parent persists in the zygote, but undergoes a density shift of 0. 003 - 0. 005 g/cm 3 to a lighter buoyant density, whereas that from the male disappears soon after zygote formation.

Based on the effects of mutations in the peptide-binding pocket of the PDZ domain and elsewhere, we suggest an allosteric pathway that links peptide binding to DegS activation. These results explain fast responses to envelope stress; demonstrate that the protein-unfolding response, even under catastrophic conditions, can be tailored by the peptide sequences that become accessible to DegS; and suggest strategies for control of related PDZ proteases by allosteric effectors.

40|$|Summary. Nucleocytoplasmic {{determination}} ofmale ste-rility in Thymus vulgaris L. {{has been}} assumed in all pa-pers attempting {{to explain the}} remarkably high frequen-cies of male steriles found in natural populations of this species.

Interpopulation and intrapopulation crosses have shown that the ratio of females versus hermaphrodites among offsprings varied widely from 1 : 0 to 1 : 1. Furthermore, interpopulation crosses consistently yielded a higher frequency of females than intrapopula-tion crosses. Nucleocytoplasmic inheritance was demon-strated by an absence of male fertiles in backcrosses and asymmetrical segregation i reciprocal crosses.

40|$|International audienceA {{model of}} {{evolution}} of reproductive systems, when sex {{is determined by}} both nuclear and <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes,</b> is presented. Such a control of sex is known to facilitate the occurrence of female individuals in hermaphroditic populations, thus leading to gynodioecy. A two-cytotypes two-nuclear loci (two alleles at each nuclear locus) model for gynodioecy has been developed previously. Such gynodioecious systems are usually considered as stable, i. e. not leading to dioecy. In order {{to find out if}} the presence of females can select for male individuals when sex determination is nuclear-cytoplasmic, we followed the evolution of alleles responsible for female sterility. These alleles can be at the preceding loci or at a third locus. We show that male individuals can be selected. Dioecy evolves in less restrictive conditions than under nuclear sex determination. The same also holds for trioecy (coexistence of females, hermaphrodites and males). Nuclear-cytoplasmic polymorphism can be maintained in these reproductive systems...|$|E
40|$|Few {{aspects of}} biology {{are linked to}} so many {{evolutionary}} conflicts as sperm production and fertilization. Segregation distortion and maternal inheritance of <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes,</b> causing maladapted males, are common sources of variation in the competitive ability of sperm, leading males to vary in their intrinsic fertility. Here, I theoretically analyze the effect of such variation in male intrinsic fertility on ejaculate investment. The model reveals that with increasing variation in male fertility, males should overall spend less resources on their ejaculates. Furthermore, if males differing in intrinsic fertility are able to invest differently in sperm production, there are two contrasting outcomes. Typically, less fertile males should invest more. However, if female mating frequency is relatively low and differences between males relatively large, the most common male genotype should invest more. These results have important consequences both for the understanding of sperm competition strategies {{as well as for}} the evolution of female polyandry and female mating preferences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Gene delivery/expression vectors {{have been}} used as {{fundamental}} technologies in gene therapy since the 1980 s. These technologies are also being applied in regenerative medicine as tools to reprogram cell genomes to a pluripotent state and to other cell lineages. Rapid progress in these new research areas and expectations for their translation into clini-cal applications have facilitated the development of more sophisticated gene delivery/expression technologies. Since its isolation in 1953 in Japan, Sendai virus (SeV) has been widely used as a research tool in cell biology and in industry, but the application of SeV as a recombinant viral vector has been investigated only recently. Recombinant SeV vectors have various unique characteristics, such as low pathogenicity, powerful capacity for gene expression and a wide host range. In addition, the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> expression mediated by this vector is advantageous for applications, in that chromosomal integration of exogenous genes can be undesirable. In this review, we introduce a brief historical background on the de-velopment of recombinant SeV vectors and describe their current applications in gene therapy.

A positive hybrid-selection translation assay using the subcloned gene and RNA from non-muscle cell sources yielded a protein with a size (Mr, 31, 000) and isoelectric point (5. 0) similar to vertebrate cytoplasmic tropomyosin. A modified protocol for the purification of vertebrate cytoplasmic tropomyosin was used to partially purify cytoplasmic tropomyosin from the Drosophila Kc cell line. The Kc cell protein was identified as a cytoplasmic form of tropomyosin {{on the basis of its}} size, isoelectric point, and crossreactivity with a polyclonal vertebrate antitropomyosin antibody in a two-step binding assay. The Kc cell cytoplasmic tropomyosin comigrates in two dimensions with the hybrid-selected in vitro translation product of the region 3 gene, and both proteins show a mobility shift in NaDodSO 4 /urea/polyacrylamide gels that is characteristic of vertebrate tropomyosins. The <b>cytoplasmic</b> tropomyosin <b>gene</b> hybridizes to both Drosophila muscle tropomyosin genes under decreased stringency conditions.

While this increase was seen with BHK and Neuro- 2 a cells, further studies revealed that some cell lines, such as COS- 7, demonstrated relatively poor levels of cytoplasmic expression. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine what factors were responsible for the different expression levels between BHK (a high expressing cell line) and COS- 7 (a low expressing cell line). Results The main findings of this work are that the individual elements of the cytoplasmic expression system (such as the T 7 RNAP gene and Internal Ribosome Entry Sequence) are functioning similarly in both cell types. Both cell types were found to have the same amount of cytosolic nuclease activity, and that the cells appeared to have differences in the intra-cellular processing of DNA -cationic lipid complexes.

The effect of the car mutation on chloroplast ribosome function was demonstrated with an in vitro system incorporating amino acids especially developed to assess activity of 70 S chloroplast ribosomes. In an S- 30 extract containing both 70 S chloroplast and 80 S cytoplasmic ribosomes, low concentrations of Mg++ and spermidine favored 80 S ribosome activity, and high concentrations activated 70 S ribosomes and reversibly inactivated the 80 S component. Under conditions favoring chloroplast ribosome activity, carbomycin inhibited incorporation by an S- 30 extract, and by purified 70 S ribosomes from wild-type but not from car cells. These results show that <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>genes</b> are directly involved in chloroplast ribosome function and they suggest that the car gene product is a ribosomal protein; the results further strengthen {{the evidence that the}} cytoplasmic linkage group is located in chloroplast DNA...|$|E

Previous investigators suggested that all-female clonal reproduction and interspecific hybridization may occur in this complex.

The multi-locus allozyme data clearly revealed the hybrid nature of all polyploid forms of this fish and some diploid forms as well. Diagnostic markers identified fish from the genus Leuciscus as the paternal ancestor of hybrids in the Duero and Guadiana River Basins. Additionally, analysis of nuclear markers revealed that hybridogenetic reproduction occurs in the diploid and triploid hybrids. The hybrids fully express the paternal Leuciscus genome and then discard it during oogenesis. Hybridogenetic ova contain only maternal nuclear genes and mtDNA from a non-hybrid T. alburnoides ancestor. Apparently diploid and triploid hybrids of T. alburnoides persist as sperm parasites on males of a sexually reproducing Leuciscus host species...|$|E

40|$|With rare exceptions, {{mammalian}} mitochondria are inherited {{through the}} female. This probably serves to minimize lethal <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>gene</b> competition {{and to prevent}} the inheritance of sperm mitochondrial DNA that has been subject to degradation by free radicals. In general, organisms are intolerant of mitochondrial heteroplasmy and, when this occurs in humans, it frequently presents as progressive and lethal bioenergetic or neurological disease. The mitochondria of spermatozoa are specifically destroyed by proteolysis in early embryonic development, in mice at the 4 -to 8 -cell transition. While there are concerns in human assisted reproduction that microinjection of abnormal or immature sperm cells could lead to lasting harm in the offspring through transmission of abnormal mitochondria, there is no clinical evidence to support this. There is more potential for harm through attempts to ârescueâ poor quality oocytes by cytoplasmic or nuclear transfer, as it is not currently possible to control the final fate of the donated mitochondria in relation to nuclear-mitochondrial interactions or the embryonic axes.

Patients and methods: This study was conducted on 40 Egyptian children with newly diagnosed AML who were subjected to full history taking, clinical examination and laboratory investigations including: complete blood count, LDH, bone marrow aspiration, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and assessment of BAALC Gene by real time PCR in bone marrow aspirate mononuclear cells {{before the start of}} chemotherapy. Results: Positive BAALC gene expression was found in 24 cases (60 %) and negative expression in 16 cases (40 %). Positive BAALC gene expression group includes 14 males and 10 females with mean age at presentation of 8. 35 Â± 2. 63 while negative BAALC gene expression includes 10 males and 6 females with mean age at presentation of 7. 74 Â± 3. 23 with no statistically significant differences between patients with positive and negative BAALC gene expression regarding age, sex and clinical presentations at time of diagnosis including pallor, purpura, splenomegaly...|$|R
