He {{made his}} debut for the {{promotion}} wrestling Spike Dudley in back-to-back appearances in Hamburg and Downingtown, Pennsylvania from February 8–9, 1997. On March 1, at an ECW house show held in Scranton, McDevitt wrestled Sabu at the Catholic Youth Center in front of 1,590 fans. The following night, this time for an MEWF event, he faced Big Stevie <b>Cool</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Blue World Order in Baltimore. He similarly faced Chris Candido in his home promotion several days later and, a few years afterwards met Candido again in Doug Flex's International Pro Wrestling.|$|E

Walls not only provided privacy but protected against the sun. Large areas of glass that let in the light, {{a key element of}} the Bauhaus style in Europe, were replaced with small recessed windows that limited the heat and glare. Long narrow balconies, each shaded by the balcony above it, allowed residents to catch the breeze blowing in from the sea to the west. Slanted roofs were replaced with flat ones, providing a common area where residents could socialize in the <b>cool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening.|$|E

At seventeen, he left school and became a pianist at a Coney Island dance hall {{for two years before}} {{becoming}} a [...] "song-plugger" [...] for publisher F. A. Mills. Stamper was twenty when he met singer Nora Bayes and her husband Jack Norworth becoming her accompanist and touring widely for the next four years. After Stamper left Bayes' employment, he resumed working as a song-plugger and vaudeville pianist. In 1910 he met Gene Buck, an artist who painted cover images for sheet music. The two started collaborating, with Buck providing lyrics for Stamper's melodies. Their first published songs were In the <b>Cool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Evening, Daddy Has a Sweetheart (and Mother Is Her Name) and Some Boy.|$|E
500|$|She {{followed}} {{this with a}} performance as Sybil Logan in In the <b>Cool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Day (1963) – a film she renounced as awful – before appearing as wealthy Isabel Boyd in The World of Henry Orient (1964) and the widow Phyllis in Dear Heart (1964). Her first appearance in a theatrical musical was the short-lived Anyone Can Whistle, written by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim. An experimental work, it opened at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway in April 1964, but was critically panned and closed after nine performances. Lansbury had {{played the role of}} crooked mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, and although she loved Sondheim's score she faced personal differences with Laurents and was glad when the show closed. She appeared in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), a cinematic biopic of Jesus, but was cut almost entirely from the final edit. She {{followed this}} with an appearance as Mama Jean Bello in Harlow (1965), as Lady Blystone in The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders (1965), and as Gloria in Mister Buddwing (1966). Despite her well-received performances in a number of films, [...] "celluloid superstardom" [...] evaded her, and she became increasingly dissatisfied with these minor roles, feeling that none allowed her to explore her potential as an actress.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Alice wrote a {{much shorter}} letter to Louis {{in which she}} looked forward to their meeting, and hoped that [...] "my letter did not distress you – but {{it is better to}} be quite honest about all one's feelings". Despite marital problems, Alice remained a strong supporter of her husband, being highly critical when his abilities or talents were not fully recognised. On 20 March 1877, Louis' father Prince Charles died, making Louis heir apparent. On 13 June the same year, Charles' older brother Grand Duke Louis III died, and Louis and Alice became the Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse. Her continued unpopularity in Darmstadt, however, coupled with her mother not wanting her in England, caused strain, and she and her children spent July and August in Houlgate, Normandy, where Louis often visited them. She was hurt by her reputation in Darmstadt, and she became increasingly bitter towards it; Louis wrote in August 1877 expressing the hope that [...] "bitterness of the salt water will drive away the bitterness that you still feel against Darmstadt. Please my darling, don't speak so harshly of it when I come to join you – it would quite spoil my happiness at seeing you again." [...] Alice took Louis's letter to heart, responding: [...] "I shall certainly say nothing to you about Darmstadt when you come...I have no intention of saying anything unpleasant, least of all to you. You shake off anything unpleasant like a poodle shaking off the water {{when it comes to the}} sea – natures like yours are the happiest in themselves, but they are not made to help, comfort and advise others, nor to share with others the heat of life's noon-day or the <b>cool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, with insight, understanding and sympathy." [...] In response, Louis sent a letter that [...] "made [...] cry", and after this letter, Alice's letters to Louis were more encouraging, assuring him of his ability to make decisions by himself.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{compared}} the metabolic responses to selective <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervical (Cp-Thj) and the thoracic (Thi-Ths) parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord <b>of</b> pigeons. To obtain selective <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two parts, two thermodes (4. 5 cm) were inserted into the vertebral canal through an aperture in the first thoracic vertebra. During <b>the</b> experiments, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two thermodes was perfused with water at a constant temperature for periods <b>of</b> 15 min. <b>The</b> thermosensitivity was denned as the relationship between <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> extra heat produced and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> heat extracted from <b>the</b> stimulated area. <b>Cooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thoracic part resulted in a substantially higher increase in metabolic heat production and body temperature (Tb) than did <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervical part. It is concluded that <b>the</b> thoracic part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord has a greater thermosensitivity than the cervical part. In addition, {{it was found that}} the difference in elevation <b>of</b> Tb during <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two parts was not simply a result <b>of</b> differences in <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> heat produced. When the changes in Tb were related to the difference between the extra heat produced and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> heat extracted, <b>the</b> increase in Tb during thoracic cooling was greater than that recorded during cervical cooling. This indicates that <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord also had different effects on the thermoregulatory effector mechanisms that influence thermal conductance.

2500|$|The most {{cost-effective}} {{steps toward}} {{a reduction in}} a building's energy consumption usually occur during the design process. [...] To achieve efficient energy use, zero energy design departs significantly from conventional construction practice. Successful zero energy building designers typically combine time tested passive solar, or artificial/fake conditioning, principles that work with the on-site assets. Sunlight and solar heat, prevailing breezes, and the <b>cool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth below a building, can provide daylighting and stable indoor temperatures with minimum mechanical means. ZEBs are normally optimized to use passive solar heat gain and shading, combined with thermal mass to stabilize diurnal temperature variations throughout the day, and in most climates are superinsulated. All the technologies needed to create zero energy buildings are available off-the-shelf today.|$|E
2500|$|Carmichael {{composed}} {{several hundred}} songs, including fifty that achieved hit record status.

2500|$|Carmichael's eulogy for [...] "hot" [...] jazz, however, was premature. Big-band swing {{was just}} around the corner, and jazz would soon turn in another {{direction}} with new bandleaders, such as the Dorseys and Benny Goodman, and new singers, such as Bing Crosby, leading the way. Carmichael's output followed the changing trend. In 1933 he began a long-lasting collaboration with lyricist Johnny Mercer, newly arrived in New York, on [...] "Lazybones", which became a hit. Southern Music published the sheet music in 1933; more than 350,000 copies of it were sold in three months. [...] Carmichael collaborated with Mercer on nearly three dozen songs, including [...] "Thanksgiving," [...] "Moon Country," [...] and the 1951 Academy Award-winner for best song, [...] "In the Cool, Cool, <b>Cool,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Evening." [...] Carmichael's financial condition improved dramatically when royalties started to pour in, affording him a comfortable apartment and dapper clothes. His social life was also on the upswing, finding him hobnobbing with George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Duke Ellington, and other music giants in the New York entertainment scene.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s the public's musical {{preferences}} shifted toward toward {{rhythm and}} blues and rock and roll, ending the careers of most older artists. Carmichael's songwriting career also slowed down, but he continued to perform. He appeared in the motion picture Young Man with a Horn (1950), based on friend Bix Beiderbecke's life, with Bacall and Kirk Douglas. [...] "In the Cool, Cool, <b>Cool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Evening", with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, was featured in the 1951 film Here Comes the Groom and won Carmichael his first Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Mercer his second of four Academy Awards. In 1952 Carmichael played his composition [...] "My Resistance Is Low" [...] in the Howard Hughes film The Las Vegas Story. The lyrics were written by Harold Adamson. Although the song did not catch fire in the United States, it was a hit in Great Britain. Carmichael also composed seven songs for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), but only two made the final cut: [...] "Ain't There Anyone Here for Love", sung by Jane Russell, and [...] "When Love Goes Wrong (Nothing Goes Right)". Harold Campbell Adamson wrote the lyrics or both songs.|$|E
