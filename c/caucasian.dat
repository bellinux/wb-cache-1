Although disparate, literature suggests inequalities in obesity risk within and among ethnic {{minority groups}} relative to <b>Caucasians</b> in the UK. We summarize and appraise the existing peer-reviewed literature about the prevalence and determinants of obesity among ethnic minority groups relative to <b>Caucasians</b> among children and adults in the UK. There was no consensus about obesity prevalence relative to <b>Caucasians</b> among South Asian or Black children or among South Asian adults relative to <b>Caucasians.</b> Black adults generally had higher risk for obesity than <b>Caucasians.</b> Both Chinese children and adults had lower risk for obesity than <b>Caucasians.</b> Few studies have considered differences in the aetiology of obesity by ethnicity. The lack of consensus regarding obesity risk among large ethnic minority groups relative to <b>Caucasians</b> in the UK, and the paucity of studies concerned with differences in obesity aetiology by ethnicity warrant further research in this area.

40|$|Hypertensive nephrosclerosis in African Americans versus <b>Caucasians.</b> BackgroundExtensive global {{glomerulosclerosis}} (GS) {{has been}} reported in African Americans with hypertension and renal insufficiency, far exceeding that in <b>Caucasians.</b> To assess and compare severity and phenotype of injury in biopsied African Americans and <b>Caucasians</b> who morphologically had hypertensive nephrosclerosis, we performed a retrospective biopsy study. MethodsAll renal biopsies with a histological diagnosis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis from the last 11 years were identified from our clinical files. Lesions of global and segmental sclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and vascular sclerosis were semiquantitatively analyzed as percent involved, or on a 0 to 3 scale, respectively. The phenotypes of global glomerulosclerosis also were categorized as either the solidified (that is, the entire tuft is solidified) or the obsolescent type (that is, Bowman's space is occupied by collagenous material and the tuft is retracted). ResultsSixty-two patients (19 African Americans, 43 <b>Caucasians)</b> were included in the study. At biopsy, African Americans were younger than <b>Caucasians</b> with higher serum creatinine, but no difference in proteinuria or mean arterial pressure (MAP). African Americans had a marked increase in the solidified form of GS (25 ± 6 in African Americans vs. 8 ± 2 % in <b>Caucasians,</b> P < 0. 01). This extensive solidification of glomeruli was associated with segmental sclerosis in African Americans (38 ± 10 %), contrasting low prevalence of solidified GS in <b>Caucasians</b> with segmental sclerosis (10 ± 3 %, P < 0. 05) and in African Americans without segmental sclerosis (10 ± 4 %, P < 0. 05). African Americans with segmental sclerosis were younger and clinically expressed a more severe renal disease than <b>Caucasians</b> with this lesion. Interstitial fibrosis was greater in African Americans than in <b>Caucasians</b> (54 ± 6 vs. 33 ± 3 %, P < 0. 01) and correlated with proteinuria and serum creatinine levels, especially in African Americans, and also with GS. Vascular sclerosis was worse in African Americans than in <b>Caucasians</b> (0. 96 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 77 ± 0. 08 score, P < 0. 05) and did not correlate with GS. By modeling, neither MAP nor age was useful in predicting any morphological lesions and proteinuria accounted only minimally for the variability of GS. ConclusionsBlood pressure levels and proteinuria did not account for morphological lesions, suggesting other factors (such as genetic factors, microvascular disease) may play a role. The phenotype of GS differs in biopsied African Americans versus <b>Caucasians</b> with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, with a marked increase in the solidified form of GS in African Americans. The association of extensive solidified GS with segmental sclerosis lesions in African Americans, but not in <b>Caucasians,</b> suggests different mechanisms may contribute to the development and progression of sclerosis in these two patient groups...|$|R

On 31 July when it came under Stalingrad Front control it was so worn down by its previous rough handling that it was only 3,000 men strong. It was attacked on the same day by the 4th Panzer Army, which was able to break through. During Operation Uranus, the counterattack from Stalingrad, the 4th Mechanized Corps began its attack from the 51st Army's sector. In early December, 51st Army was deployed to cover the Kotelnikovo approaches against German relief attempts by the LVII. Panzerkorps. On 24–25 December 1942, the commander of 51st Army, Major-General N.I.
