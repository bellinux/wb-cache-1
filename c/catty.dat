[...] The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature.

[...] In contrast, the adult storylines were generally poorly received. Zoller Seitz branded Will and Emma's relationship boring, and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly disliked the fact the season began with them in an established relationship: [...] "I feel like I missed a huge leap for Emma and we need to have it acknowledged." [...] Fallon disparaged Will as being [...] "insufferable", and attributed this to [...] "Morrison's wooden characterization, the stilted writing [...] the flat purpose that the character serves on the show". Sue's storyline was described as nonsensical by VanDerWerff, who wrote that she [...] "has decided to take her crusade against the glee club to a congressional district-wide audience, because, well, she was the most popular character in season one, and she will be again, via blunt force, if necessary." [...] Reiter, however, found Sue to be [...] "in perfect form in this episode, neither too mean nor too misty", and enjoyed her storyline.|$|E

50|$|Although {{sugar cane}} {{was a native}} crop of Taiwan, the {{indigenous}} people {{had never been able}} to make sugar granules from the raw sugar.

The sugar produced in Taiwan made far higher profit than the sugar produced in Java. About 300,000 <b>catties</b> of sugar, which was one third of the total production, were carreid to Persia in 1645.

2500|$|Tsai's {{music has}} been the subject of music {{analysis}} and scrutiny. China Times commented that what has brought Tsai success is [...] "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist or dancer, Tsai's talents seem modest." [...] It asserts Tsai's success is mostly due to her effort and diligence. Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images. Grant concluded that having established herself as the [...] "Queen of C-pop", Tsai did not stop there, but continued re-inventing. Before emerging as a dance-pop star, Tsai began her career as a teen idol. Since the release of her debut album, 1019 (1999), which foreshadowed several trends in her later works, Tsai has spent her early years in teen pop that mainly appealed to teenagers. Her early dance-pop roots can be found on her second studio album, Don't Stop (2000). Tsai moved to dance-pop direction with Magic (2003), mixing nu-disco and hip hop music with dance tunes. The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, and she continued to make dance songs for Castle (2004) and J-game (2005). Her mature artistic statement was visible in Dancing Diva (2006) and Agent J (2007). With Dancing Diva, Tsai began as a dance music diva, in an era that did not have any such Chinese singers to speak of, and she had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music in Greater China. Myself (2010) and Muse (2012) largely focused in electronic dance music, which she has embraced since Dancing Diva. Myself is considered among her most adventurous, with almost all tracks are pure dance songs, which had never previously attempted by any Chinese singer. Muse incorporated different genres of music, including progressive house, trance, and techno music. Tsai experimented with more dubstep and trap music in Play (2014). According to Today newspaper, the album [...] "melds dance hall with bubblegum pop, breathtaking love songs with hilariously <b>catty</b> weirdness and euphorically catchy melodies with propulsive rhythms." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. <b>Catty</b> dedicates {{his book}} {{to the memory of}} Wordsworth, Shelley, Coleridge and Keats--a {{somewhat}} pompous signboard for such very ordinary wine--and an inscription in golden letters on the cover informs us that his poems are 'addressed to the rising generation,' whom, he tells us elsewhere, he is anxious to initiate into the great comprehensive truth that 'Virtue is no other than self-interest, deeply understood.' In order to further this laudable aim he has written a very tedious blank verse poem which he calls The Secret of Content, but it certainly does not convey that secret to the reader. It is heavy, abstract and prosaic, and shows how intolerably dull a man can be who has the best intentions and the most earnest beliefs.
