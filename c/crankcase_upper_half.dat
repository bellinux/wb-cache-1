40|$|AbstractFinite <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> planes {{have been}} studied by Terras, Poulos, Celniker, Trimble, and Velasquez. Motivated by Stark'sp-adic <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> plane as ap-adic analog of the Poincaré <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> plane, a finite field of odd {{characteristic}} {{was used as the}} finite analog of the real line. The analog of the <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> plane was constructed by adjoining the square root of a non-square to the finite field. Since this is not possible with a finite field of even characteristic, this paper will introduce a modification which will enable all finite fields to be considered. After constructing the finite <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> planes, graphs on these planes will be considered. We are interested in the spectrum, girth, diameter, and other combinatorial properties of these graphs...|$|R
