5|$|Chester Cathedral is a Church of England cathedral and {{the mother}} church of the Diocese of Chester. It {{is located in the}} city of Chester, Cheshire, England.

5|$|A high flying {{flagpole}} {{was presented}} to the oval by Alcoa. The American flag was hoisted on {{it for the first time}} by Joseph Iozzi, who was a disabled veteran of World War II. Nearly all of the fraternal organizations of the New Kensington community were represented at the dedication ceremony. The Reverend Monsignor Giustino Meniconzi, who was the Vicar-General of the Diocese of Ferentino, Italy, blessed the statue of <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> American flag.|$|E
5|$|As {{bishop of}} Turin, Claudius {{found that men}} were often {{directed}} to go on pilgrimage to Rome for penance and that worshippers were accustomed to venerate <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> saints by bowing before images and relics. Claudius, coming from an educated background, was not greatly exposed to such provincial modes of worship. He made attacks {{on the use of}} images, relics, and crosses, he opposed pilgrimages to obtain absolution, and he had little regard for the authority of the pope due to his belief that all bishops were equal.|$|E

5|$|Many {{existing}} Wesleyan-holiness denominations {{adopted the}} Pentecostal message, {{such as the}} Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), the Church of God in <b>Christ,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Pentecostal Holiness Church. The formation of new denominations also occurred, motivated by doctrinal differences between Wesleyan Pentecostals and their Finished Work counterparts, such as the Assemblies of God formed in 1914 and the Pentecostal Church of God formed in 1919. An early doctrinal controversy led to a split between Trinitarian and Oneness Pentecostals, the latter founded the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Onion domes {{often appear}} {{in groups of}} three, {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Four Evangelists. Domes standing alone represent Jesus. Vasily Tatischev, the first to record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically. He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by Patriarch Nikon, who liked to compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral domes with four other patriarchs of the Orthodox world. There is no other evidence that Nikon ever held such a view.|$|E
5|$|Ordained Catholics, as well {{as members}} of the laity, may enter into consecrated life either on an {{individual}} basis, as a hermit or consecrated virgin, or by joining an institute of consecrated life (a religious institute or a secular institute) in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines, the Carmelites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Legionaries of <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sisters of Mercy.|$|E

5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the Baroque styled tabernacle is almost entirely adorned with decorations, such as curiously shaped niche shelves, floating drapes and many cherubs. Carvings of fruits such as grapes and pomegranates have been created to {{in the shape of}} ritual offerings, symbolizing the Blood of <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Church. Among the floral elements, roses, daisies, and various types of four-petalled flowers can be found, including the indigenous chalchihuite.|$|E
5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.|$|E

5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of <b>Christ,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|In 1093 a Benedictine abbey was {{established}} {{on the site}} by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, {{with the assistance of}} StAnselm and other monks from Bec in Normandy. The earliest surviving parts of the structure date from that time. The abbey church was not at that time the cathedral of Chester; from 1075 to 1082 the cathedral of the diocese was the nearby church of StJohn the Baptist, after which the see was transferred to Coventry. In 1538, during the dissolution of the monasteries, the monastery was disbanded and the shrine of SaintWerburgh was desecrated. In 1541 StWerburgh's abbey became a cathedral of the Church of England, by order of HenryVIII. At the same time, the dedication was changed to <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Virgin. The last abbot of StWerburgh’s Abbey, Thomas Clarke, became the first dean of the new cathedral, {{at the head of a}} secular chapter.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with his RGS duties Markham served {{as secretary of}} the Hakluyt Society until 1886, subsequently becoming that society's president. As part of his work for this body, Markham was responsible for many translations from Spanish into English of rare accounts of travel, in particular those relating to Peru. In time scholars would express doubts about the quality of some of these translations, finding them prepared in haste and lacking in rigour. Nevertheless, this work ran to 22volumes in the society's publications. In 1873 Markham had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in subsequent years received several overseas honours, including the Portuguese Order of <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Order of the Rose of Brazil. He briefly considered, but did not pursue, the idea of a parliamentary career.|$|E
5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community of <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations by use of commonly understood names such as Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E
5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
