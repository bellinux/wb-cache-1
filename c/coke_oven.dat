The function of the [...] "beehive" [...] <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> was to purify coal {{and turn it into}} coke. The coke was burned in furnaces that produced iron and steel.|$|R
25|$|Corby {{became a}} {{steelmaking}} centre through {{the establishment of}} the Stewarts & Lloyds production site in the 1930s, and by 1960 had grown {{to become one of the}} most heavily industrialised areas in the Midlands. In 1981 however the plant had become unprofitable and owners British Steel Corporation closed the site. By then it was one of the largest steelmaking operations in Western Europe, covering , with four blast furnaces, two <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> complexes and associated facilities. During its operation a huge quantity of industrial waste, including toxic waste, had been deposited there.|$|E
25|$|Directed to {{investigate}} the fractionation of <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> gas, Freeth was inspired by Onnes' low-temperature work; at his instigation, Brunner Mond {{set up a new}} low-temperature laboratory in Winnington in 1931 with a number of talented Dutch assistants, where polythene was later discovered. A number of Brunner Mond (and Imperial Chemical Industries) recruits went the other way, to the Netherlands to work with Onnes and increase the fruitful cross-pollination. Freeth was awarded a doctorate of the University of Leiden in 1924—only possible thanks to a special decree of the Dutch Parliament—and joined the Royal Society in 1926 on the recommendation of Donnan and Lord Moulton.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Brussels, Belgium (though {{the family moved to}} Antwerp soon after his birth), the son of a judge, and {{developed}} an interest in travel and the natural world as a child. He fought in the First World War before escaping to England, where he read chemistry at Oxford University. He worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough on lubricating oils, and then in Belgium on <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> technology, before moving to the USA. There, in 1926, he invented a system of automatic volume control for radio, and the royalties he received allowed him to indulge his love of travel and movie-making.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} {{increased pressure}} {{to close the}} decrepit <b>coke</b> <b>ovens,</b> which finally ceased production in 1988. Underneath the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> site were approximately one hundred and sixty one kilometres of underground pipes. These pipes were used to move chemicals throughout the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> and steel plant site. Despite {{the fact that these}} pipes contained a mixture of dangerous, toxic and potentially explosive substances, many were never purged of their contents when the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> operations ceased. SYSCO converted to an electric arc manufacturing process in 1990, and stopped production altogether in 2000. The mill is now dismantled.|$|R

500|$|Little {{damage was}} caused by the raid on Yawata. On 18June a USAAF Fourteenth Air Force {{aircraft}} overflew the city and photographed the target area. These photos showed that only a single bomb had landed within the Imperial Iron and Steel Works complex, and it had hit a power house [...] from the nearest <b>coke</b> <b>oven.</b> Light damage had also been inflicted on Kokura Arsenal and other industrial and civilian buildings in the area. Despite a USAAF policy of encouraging factual reportage of B-29 operations, the raid's results were overstated in the U.S. media. The light combat losses suffered by the raiders and electronic intelligence collected by the B-29s revealed the ineffectiveness of Japanese radar and air defenses. As a result, the USAAF dispatched a single photo reconnaissance B-29 to overfly much of Japan and Korea on 21June. This sortie was successful, and greatly improved U.S. intelligence holdings on these areas.|$|E
2500|$|Gasification [...] of coal or lignite or {{pet coke}} {{produces}} syngas or coal gas or <b>coke</b> <b>oven</b> gas {{which is a}} mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases. Coal gas can be converted into synthetic natural gas (SNG) by using Fischer–Tropsch process at low pressure and high temperature. Coal gas can also be produced by underground coal gasification where the coal deposits are located deep in the ground or uneconomical to mine the coal. [...] CNG and LNG are emerging as economical alternatives to diesel oil with the escalation in international crude oil prices. Synthetic natural gas production technologies have tremendous scope to meet the transport sector requirements fully using the locally available coal in India. Dankuni coal complex is producing syngas which is piped to the industrial users in Calcutta. Many coal based fertiliser plants which are shut down can also be retrofitted economically to produce SNG as LNG and CNG fetch good price by substituting imports. Recently, Indian government fixed the natural gas price at producer end as 5.61 US$ per mmbtu on net calorific value (NCV) basis which is at par with the estimated SNG price from coal.|$|E

50|$|The Bee-Hive <b>Coke</b> <b>Ovens,</b> born in 1865, was {{the main}} {{operation}} of the company. Leetonia Coal & Iron would mine the surrounding areas around Leetonia for coal and then cart coal by the tons into the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> on rails above the ovens. The workers would then shovel the coal into the <b>coke</b> <b>ovens</b> to cook. This would purify the coal into a purer product of coal called coke which was then shipped off to the iron mills {{to be used in}} smelting iron. Coke has a much higher temperature point than regular coal so it was preferred for use in the mills.|$|R
