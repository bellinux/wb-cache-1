5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> been subsequently refuted.|$|E

5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal {{and others}} have critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped provide {{a better understanding of}} intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence is lacking, but most historians believe he was heterosexual. There {{is at least one}} claim that Hitler had an illegitimate child (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, dismiss this as unlikely or impossible.|$|E
5|$|The <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> {{been criticized}} for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones {{to the north of}} the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian troops {{suffered}} 126 {{dead and}} 241 wounded during the sporadic fighting, and killed between 1,122 and 3,500 civilians, including some Volksdeutsche. Many civilians {{were arrested and}} tortured. On 14 April 1941, around 500 Jews and Serbs were bayoneted to death, probably {{as a warning to}} others not to resist. During post-war questioning, Horthy insisted that he had not wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Bačka, but these <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> been dismissed by Tomasevich.|$|E

5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced the counterculture views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E
5|$|Outside of China, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} texts to mention gunpowder is Roger Bacon's Opus Majus (1267) and Opus Tertium in what has been interpreted as a reference to firecrackers. In the early 20th century, a British artillery officer proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae, also known as Opus Minor, dated to 1247, contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. These <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> been disputed by science historians. The formula itself, claimed to have been hidden within the text through encryption, is not useful for firearm or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, a {{few people}} have {{questioned}} this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only {{that there had been}} a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing. Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.|$|E

5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E
5|$|The {{society has}} been {{influential}} {{in the history of}} Georgia Tech. ANAK {{played a major role in}} establishing several of Georgia Tech's most active student organizations – including its yearbook, the Blueprint; its student newspaper, the Technique; and its Student Government Association – as well as several lasting Georgia Tech traditions. The society also claims involvement in a number of civil rights projects, most notably in peacefully integrating Georgia Tech's first African American students and preventing the Ku Klux Klan from setting up a student chapter at Georgia Tech. These <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> yet to be substantiated by independent sources.|$|E
5|$|Idris' {{government}} was increasingly unpopular {{by the latter}} 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system {{in order to take}} advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the Western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, Biko {{broke his}} banning order by {{travelling}} to Cape Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader Neville Alexander {{and deal with}} growing dissent in the Western Cape branch of the BCM, which was dominated by Marxists like Johnny Issel. Biko drove to the city with his Coloured friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing {{that he was being}} monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police roadblock near Grahamstown. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. Unsubstantiated <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> been made that the security services were aware of Biko's trip to Cape Town and that the road block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently held without trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanians were {{generally}} less hospitable to Jews {{than their counterparts}} in Albania. Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire, they tended to be more unfriendly towards local non-Albanians. Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result. <b>Claims</b> <b>have</b> been made that Kosovo Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war, but the protection that Jews received in Kosovo {{in the early years of}} the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population. It is estimated that 210 Jews from Kosovo perished during the war. An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania, Kosovo and other Albanian-controlled territories during the war. A somewhat greater number, as well as several hundred refugees, hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population.|$|E
5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, <b>claims</b> <b>have</b> been denied because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt}} to conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E
