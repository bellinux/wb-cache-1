40|$|Currently, {{a lot of}} {{research}} is devoted to system design, and little work is done on requirements analysis. Besides going from specification to design, one of our main objectives is to show how an application problem can be transformed into specifications. Working from the hardwaresoftware codesign perspective, a system is designed starting from an application problem itself, rather than the detailed behavioral specifications. Given an application problem specified as a directed acyclic graph of elementary problems, a hardware-software solution is derived such that the synthesized software, a parallel pseudoprogram, can be scheduled and executed on the synthesized hardware, a set of system-level parallel <b>computer</b> <b>specifications,</b> with heuristically optimal performance.

40|$|This thesis Is {{concerned}} with {{the application of a}} small general purpose digital computer to the protection of transmission lines in modern high voltage substations. A model transmission line and data handling system have been built to enable fault waveforms to be analysed by computer in real time; the computer used was the DEC PDP- 8. Using impedance-type relaying principles, two techniques have been developed for the protection of transmission lines. The first method utilizes "table look-up" principles. This enables a fast calculation of impedance, however accuracy is not adequate. The second method, "peak-determination", uses a predictive calculation of peak fault current and voltage from a small number of samples. The accuracies are ± 10 $ for impedance modulus, ± 15 ° for impedance phase; these values are available 5 msec, after fault occurrence. The latter method has been extended to protect a three phase transmission line. The programme used to perform this detects the presence of a disturbance, derives an equivalent single phase relaying quantity dependent on fault type, and finally calculates the positive sequence impedance of the line. The method is shown to be suitable for extension to use in a multi-line situation. Some <b>computer</b> <b>specifications</b> are outlined for this task...|$|E
