ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) forcasts 4 % traffic growth over the coming 15 years. Due to this evolution, the data exchange between the planes and the infrastructure increases more and more resulting in a saturation of the frequency bands allocated to this service. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe Power Amplifier (PA) conception challenges. Distant noise (to carrier) issue is resolved by the right PA's structure choice.

40|$|International audienceThe Marine Strategy Framework Directive imposes to European {{governments to}} monitor ambient noise. There are {{multiple}} ways of monitoring the ambient noise. Although certainly economical considerations {{have to be}} taken into considerations, {{there is a need to}} discuss the representativeness of ambient noise measurement by the only means of hydrophones. A hydrophone will only give a local and punctual knowledge. As long as the measurement is not contaminated with self-noise, mechanical noise from the mooring itself or the water flow around the sensor, measurement present the great advantage of providing a ground truth. However, for ambient noise being stochastic by essence, masking effects between numbers of anthropic sources are likely to occur for significant period of times. Hydrophones therefore measure the <b>closest</b> <b>noise</b> events. An ambient noise experiment done in the western part of the British Channel in 2010 has demonstrated such effects, and serves questioning the representativeness of noise monitoring exclusively based on measurement. The choice of the metric and the influence of the geographical configuration of the monitoring scheme on noise characterization will be discussed. Coupling measurement with modeling is foreseen as a solution to bring more representativeness to ocean noise assessment...|$|R

40|$|Statistical pass-by and <b>close</b> {{proximity}} <b>noise</b> {{levels are}} two important indexes {{which can be}} used to evaluate the noise generated by traffic, particularly in the range of speeds where the contribution due to interaction between vehicle tyres and road surface becomes meaningful and predominant respect to the engine’s one. In recent works and in international projects (SILVIA), many efforts have been attempted to provide relationships between statistical pass-by and <b>close</b> proximity <b>noise</b> level, as different methods to measure the noise in running conditions. Several data sources are in fact available in which SPB and CPX results at the same road surfaces have been combined; however, based on a comparison between the results of different databases, the conclusion is that CPX-SPB relation is not reproducible. In this paper we show the relationship and the statistical correlation between SPB and CPX levels estimated by carrying out a series of measurements on several sites all over Tuscany Region, characterized by typical conditions of Italian collector roads. The aim of this work is to show that a good local correlation factor can be found even in a typical Italian context and to give some interesting results obtained by measuring test car passages, comparing them with CPX levels...|$|R

A <b>close</b> proximity <b>noise</b> map of streets with low speed limits is presented for a reference speed of 50 km/h. Different pavements and pavement conditions, common in urban streets, are analyzed: dense and semidense asphalt concrete, with Spanish denomination D- 8 and S- 12, respectively, {{and on the other}} hand, dense pavement {{at the end of its}} service life D- 8 *. From the acoustics point of view, the most favorable surface, by more than 4 dB A compared with the S- 12 mix, is the smoothest surface, i. e., the D- 8 mix, even though it presents a minor absorption coefficient in normal incidence. Noise levels from dense surfaces D- 8 increase significantly over time, principally due to the appearance of surface defects such as cracks and ruts. Longitudinal variability of the close proximity tire/ pavement noise emission and surface homogeneity are also analyzed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} phase-referenced 23 GHz Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry (VLBI) {{observations}} of the type IIb supernova SN 2008 ax, made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) on 2 April 2008 (33 days after explosion). These observations resulted in a marginal detection of the supernova. The total flux density recovered from our VLBI image is 0. 8 ± 0. 3 mJy (one standard deviation). As it appears, the structure may be interpreted as either a core-jet or a double source. However, the supernova structure could be somewhat confused with a possible <b>close</b> by <b>noise</b> peak. In such a case, the recovered flux density would decrease to 0. 48 ± 0. 12 mJy, compatible with the flux densities measured with the VLA at epochs close in time to our VLBI observations. The lowest average expansion velocities derived from our observations are (1. 90 ± 0. 30) × 10 ^ 5 km s^- 1 (case of a double source) and (5. 2 ± 1. 3) × 10 ^ 4 km s^- 1 (taking the weaker source component as a spurious, <b>close</b> by, <b>noise</b> peak, which is the more likely interpretation). These velocities are 7. 3 and 2 times higher, respectively, than the maximum ejecta velocity inferred from optical-line observations. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} study of dynamical tyre/road contact for noise prediction. In situ measurements of contact forces and <b>close</b> proximity <b>noise</b> levels were carried out for a slick tyre rolling on six different road surfaces between 30 and 50 km/h. Additional texture profiles of the tested surfaces were taken on the wheel track. Normal contact stresses were measured at a sampling frequency of 10752 Hz using a line of pressure sensitive cells placed both along and perpendicular to the rolling direction. The contact areas obtained during rolling were smaller than in static conditions. This is mainly explained by the dynamical properties of tyre compounds, like the viscoelastic behaviou of the rubber. Additionally the root-mean-square of the resutlant contact forces at various speeds {{was in the same}} order for a given road surface, while their spectra were quite different. This is certainly due to a spectral influence of bending waves propagating in the tyre during rolling, especially when the wavelength is small in comparison with the size of the contact patch. Finally, the levels of contact forces and <b>close</b> proximity <b>noise</b> measured at 30 km/h were correlated. Additional correlations with texture levels were performed. The results show that the macro-texture generates contact forces linearly around 800 Hz and consequently noise levels between 500 and 1000 Hz via the vibrations transmitted to the tyre...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A message-passing decoder for GF (q) low-density parity-check codes is defined, {{which uses}} {{discrete}} messages from {{a subset of}} all possible binary vectors of length q. The proposed algorithm is a generalization to GF (q) of Richardson and Urbanke’s decoding “Algorithm E ” for binary codes. Density evolution requires a mapping between the probability distribution spaces for the channel, variable and check messages, and under the proposed algorithm, exact density evolution is possible. Symmetries in the message densities permit reduction {{in the size of}} the probability distribution space. Noise thresholds are obtained for LDPC codes on discrete memoryless channels, and as with Algorithm E, are remarkably <b>close</b> to <b>noise</b> thresholds under more complex belief propagation decoding.

The basic idea is the close relation between identification quality and command insensitivity. The advantage of this method is that the full order model of the system is directly considered in association with its reduced controller. In this way, it is useless to compute a reduced model before adjustment : the result of the adjustment can be immediatly applied to the system. The method consists in defining <b>closed</b> loop <b>noises</b> in order to identify fictitiously modal characteristics of the controlled plant via a bayesian identification algorithm...|$|R
