30|$|A {{major concern}} {{with regard to}} laparoscopic {{procedures}} during pregnancy is the initial insertion of the Veress needle and the first trocar. In contrast to general surgery [12], in gynaecology no official guidelines are available concerning the laparoscopic approach during pregnancy. General surgeons’ published {{data suggest that the}} open laparoscopic entry technique is preferred in pregnancy so that entry-related complications may be avoided [12]. Although the <b>closed</b> <b>entry</b> technique in gynaecology should not be abandoned [24], in the case of pregnancy we advocate the use of the open entry technique. Although our series do not give enough evidence to support the abandoning of the <b>closed</b> <b>entry</b> technique in pregnancy, we have to bear in mind that an ovarian cyst, when located in the pouch of Douglas, can lift the uterus and increase the chance of injury by the sharp instruments. In addition, the risk of penetration of the adnexal mass during the <b>closed</b> <b>entry</b> technique is possible, with the adverse effect of spillage of cystic content [25]. However, a <b>closed</b> <b>entry</b> technique can be considered when the size of the pelvic mass is less than 12 weeks of gestation. In our series no entry-related complications for either entry technique was experienced.|$|R

40|$|Understanding and {{learning}} accounting {{should be done}} in a systematic, gradual, perseverant and precision way, because accounting consists of complex concept, analysis and skills. Accounting should be studied systematically because it has the sequential inter-related material i. e. started from the identification of the account name of an existing transaction which {{can be seen in the}} transaction, journal, general ledger, balance sheet, adjustment, work sheets, preparation of financial statements, <b>closing</b> <b>entry,</b> posting adjustment and closing journals to ledgers, trial balance after closing, and  ended with the journal inverting. To obtain the optimal learning achievement of accounting, accounting students must study thoroughly about the concepts of accounting, as well as trying to understand the relationships among the concepts of accounting, because accounting concepts are related to each other. This research would test the use of maps concept as an alternative media to learn the basic concepts, especially on accounting classification account. The population was also the subject of this research,  they were the 1 st semester students  of S 1 Accounting Program, Economics Faculty, UNNES in the academic year of  2010 / 2011. There were 2 classes, the first class was the control class and second class was the experimental class. The control class used the conventional methods in the learning process on the other hand; the experiment class used maps concept in the learning process. The results showed that in experimental class which used maps concept as the media to learn the accounting classification of accounts proved to be more effective than the control class that did not use maps concept as the media in the learning process.  </em...|$|E

30|$|This {{study is}} one of the largest {{prospective}} audits of laparoscopic entry in the medical literature. It studies laparoscopic entry across a range of gynaecologists working in a large gynaecological unit and our results should therefore be applicable to other gynaecological units of similar size. Our study showed Veres (<b>closed)</b> <b>entry</b> to be highly favoured over Hasson (open) laparoscopic entry. Commonly used entry tests are specific but not sensitive for correct placement of the Veres needle. Multiple non-confirmatory entry tests are linked with initial misplacement of the Veres needle; therefore, we recommend that gynaecological surgeons continue to use a range of <b>entry</b> tests during <b>closed</b> laparoscopic <b>entry.</b>|$|R
