2500|$|At St Paul's, {{the coffin}} was carried into the Cathedral {{by members of}} the British Armed Forces and borne down the nave preceded by her grandchildren, Michael and Amanda, who <b>carried</b> <b>cushions</b> bearing Thatcher's {{insignia}} of the Order of the Garter and the Order of Merit ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jim," [...] I cried, [...] "I {{believe it}} is my uncle!" [...] and taking to my heels I ran for home {{at the top of}} my speed. At the door was {{standing}} the dark-faced servant. He <b>carried</b> a <b>cushion,</b> upon which lay a small and fluffy lapdog.|$|R
5|$|During the {{funerals}} of Soviet leaders {{there was a}} custom of displaying their decorations on velvet <b>cushions,</b> which were <b>carried</b> in the procession behind the coffin. This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each <b>carrying</b> a <b>cushion</b> with one decoration on it. However, as Brezhnev had {{more than two hundred}} decorations, several were placed on each cushion. Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons.|$|R
6000|$|We stepped {{quickly to}} the spot where I had <b>carried</b> the <b>cushions.</b> The gentleman stood and silently gazed first at the blocked-up roadway, then at the long, smooth slope of the mountain-side {{directly}} beneath us, and then at the verdure of the plain below, which had grown greener under the increasing brightness of the day. [...] "Sir," [...] said he, turning to me, [...] "there is nothing to be done but to adopt your plan, or to remain here and die. We will accompany you in the descent, and I place myself under your orders." ...|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the above}} funeral {{practices}} persisted well into the nineteenth century. At the funeral of William IV (the last monarch to die before Queen Victoria) the chief mourner and his attendants still wore black mourning cloaks, black drapes were hung along {{the route of the}} procession and a black canopy was borne over the coffin. The coffin itself was covered with a purple velvet pall, embroidered with the Royal arms. The crowns of the United Kingdom and of Hanover were <b>carried</b> on <b>cushions</b> in the procession, and placed on the coffin for the service, and behind the coffin heraldic banners were carried: the banner of the royal arms and banners of the Union, of England, Ireland and Scotland, and also of Hanover and Brunswick.|$|R
60|$|Brinkley {{generally}} {{took the}} girl's part against his wife, {{and in a}} heavy jocose way tried to cheer her up. He did little things for her; fetched and <b>carried</b> chairs and <b>cushions</b> and rugs, and gave his attentions the air of pleasantries. One of his offices {{was to get the}} ladies' letters for them in the evening, and one night he came in beaming with a letter for each of them where they sat together in the parlour. He distributed them into their laps.|$|R
50|$|Air {{bearings}} {{belong to}} slide bearings. Pressurized air {{acts as a}} lubricant in the gap between bearing moving parts. The air <b>cushion</b> <b>carries</b> the load without any contact between the moving parts. Normally, the compressed air is supplied by a compressor. A key goal of supplying the air pressure in the gap is that the stiffness and damping of the air cushion reaches the highest possible level. In addition, air consumption and uniformity of air supply into the gap are crucial for the behaviors of air bearings.|$|R
25|$|The {{boundary}} is {{the edge}} of the playing field, or the physical object marking {{the edge of}} the field, such as a rope or fence. In low-level matches, a series of plastic cones are often used. Since the early 2000s the boundaries at professional matches are often a series of padded <b>cushions</b> <b>carrying</b> sponsors' logos strung along a rope. If it is moved during play (such as by a fielder sliding into the rope) the boundary is considered to remain at the point where that object first stood.|$|R
60|$|It is {{the evening}} of the 21st of June 1788. The day has been bright and sultry, and the sun will still be more than an hour above the horizon, but his rays, broken by the leafy fretwork of the elms that border the park, no longer prevent two ladies from <b>carrying</b> out their <b>cushions</b> and embroidery, and seating {{themselves}} to work on the lawn in front of Cheverel Manor. The soft turf gives way even under the fairy tread of the younger lady, whose small stature and slim figure rest on the tiniest of full-grown feet. She trips along before the elder, <b>carrying</b> the <b>cushions,</b> which she places in the favourite spot, just on the slope by a clump of laurels, where they can see the sunbeams sparkling among the water-lilies, and can be themselves seen from the dining-room windows. She has deposited the cushions, and now turns round, so that you may have a full view of her as she stands waiting the slower advance of the elder lady. You are at once arrested by her large dark eyes, which, in their inexpressive unconscious beauty, resemble the eyes of a fawn, and it is only by an effort of attention that you notice the absence of bloom on her young cheek, and the southern yellowish tint of her small neck and face, rising above the little black lace kerchief which prevents the too immediate comparison of her skin with her white muslin gown. Her large eyes seem all the more striking because the dark hair is gathered away from her face, under a little cap set {{at the top of her}} head, with a cherry-coloured bow on one side.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} after the war, Schoenebeck gave his own account: [...] "One day we flew {{both to the}} front. That was done often because a flight of 2 is harder to spot than a whole squadron. If one {{was smart enough to}} use the sun in one's back, the enemy could be easily surprised. Wolff was a smart leader and from the sun we attacked an enemy flight. Wolff was shooting brilliantly but got caught in a dogfight. I flew behind him, as suddenly another Englishman appeared behind me. I only was able {{to get rid of him}} with great difficulty. While I was busy shaking off the Englishman, another machine attacked Wolff from behind and before I could help I saw how Wolff was going down into a spin and hit the ground. So was Lt. Wolff, who had me for covering him and who had to protect myself, falling in front of my very eyes. I was deeply shocked. At his funeral I had to <b>carry</b> his <b>cushion</b> of decorations." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{church was}} founded by seven gentlemen of Florence, who formed {{themselves}} into a religious order called [...] "Servants of Mary." [...] Many miraculous cures were wrought here; and the church, in consequence, was so thickly hung with votive offerings of legs, arms, and other things in wax, {{that they used to}} tumble upon people's heads, so that finally they were all cleared out as rubbish. The church is still, I should imagine, looked upon as a place of peculiar sanctity; for while we were there it had an unusual number of kneeling worshippers, and persons were passing from shrine to shrine all round the nave and choir, praying awhile at each, and thus performing a pilgrimage at little cost of time and labor. One old gentleman, I observed, <b>carried</b> a <b>cushion</b> or pad, just big enough for one knee, on which he carefully adjusted his genuflexions before each altar. An old woman in the choir prayed alternately to us and to the saints, with most success, I hope, in her petitions to the latter, though certainly her prayers to ourselves seemed the more fervent of the two.|$|R
60|$|He found a {{monoplane}} {{in charge}} of an aeronaut awaiting him on the westward stage. Seen close this mechanism was no longer small. As it lay on its launching carrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage, its aluminum body skeleton was {{as big as the}} hull of a twenty-ton yacht. Its lateral supporting sails braced and stayed with metal nerves almost like the nerves of a bee's wing, and made of some sort of glassy artificial membrane, cast their shadow over many hundreds of square yards. The chairs for the engineer and his passenger hung free to swing by a complex tackle, within the protecting ribs of the frame and well abaft the middle. The passenger's chair was protected by a wind-guard and guarded about with metallic rods <b>carrying</b> air <b>cushions.</b> It could, if desired, be completely closed in, but Graham was anxious for novel experiences, and desired that it should be left open. The aeronaut sat behind a glass that sheltered his face. The passenger could secure himself firmly in his seat, and this was almost unavoidable on landing, or he could move along by means of a little rail and rod to a locker at the stem of the machine, where his personal luggage, his wraps and restoratives were placed, and which also with the seats, served as a makeweight to the parts of the central engine that projected to the propeller at the stern.|$|R
60|$|The {{first evening}} that Lancelot came downstairs, Honoria {{clapped her hands}} {{outright}} for joy as he entered, and ran up and down for ten minutes, fetching and <b>carrying</b> endless unnecessary <b>cushions</b> and footstools; while Argemone greeted him with a cold distant bow, and a fine-lady drawl of carefully commonplace congratulations. Her heart smote her though, as she saw the wan face and the wild, melancholy, moonstruck eyes once more glaring through and through her; she found a comfort in thinking his stare impertinent, drew herself up, and turned away; once, indeed, she could not help listening, as Lancelot thanked Mrs. Lavington for all the pious and edifying books with which the good lady had kept his room rather than his brain furnished {{for the last six}} weeks; {{he was going to say}} more, but he saw the colonel's quaint foxy eye peering at him, remembered St. Francis de Sales, and held his tongue.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the dynamic modelling and motion {{control of a}} Surface Effect Ship (SES) for safer transfer of personnel and equipment from vessel to-and-from an offshore wind-turbine. Such a vessel is a key enabling factor for operation and maintenance (O&M) of offshore wind-energy infrastructure. The control system designed {{is referred to as}} Boarding Control System (BCS). We investigate the performance of this system for a specific wind-farm service vessel-The Wave Craft. A two-modality vessel model is presented to account for the vessel free motion and motion whilst in contact with a wind-turbine. On a SES, the pressurized air <b>cushion</b> <b>carries</b> the majority of the vessel mass. The control problem considered relates to the actuation of the pressure such that wave-induced vessel motions are minimized. This leads to a safer personnel transfer in developed sea-states than what is possible today. Results for the BCS is presented through simulation and model-scale craft testing...|$|R
60|$|He {{went down}} to breakfast and {{afterwards}} strolled aimlessly about the deck. His sense of enjoyment was so extraordinarily keen that he {{found it hard to}} settle down to any of the usual light occupations of idle travellers. He was content to stand by the rail and gaze across the sea, a new wonder to him; or to lie about in his steamer chair and listen, with half-closed eyes, to the hissing of the spray and the faint music of the wind. His mind turned by chance to one of those stories of which he had spoken. A sudden new vigour of thought seemed to rend it inside out almost in those first few seconds. He thought of the garret in which it had been written, the wretched surroundings, the odoriferous food, the thick crockery, the smoke-palled vista of roofs and chimneys. The genius of a Stevenson would have become dwarfed in such surroundings. A phrase, a happy idea, suddenly caught his fancy. He itched for a pencil and paper. Then he looked up to find the one thing wanting. Elizabeth Dalstan, followed by a maid <b>carrying</b> rugs and <b>cushions,</b> had paused, smiling, by his side.|$|R
50|$|The {{boundary}} is {{the edge}} of the playing field, or the physical object marking {{the edge of}} the field, such as a rope or fence. In low-level matches, a series of plastic cones are often used. Since the early 2000s the boundaries at professional matches are often a series of padded <b>cushions</b> <b>carrying</b> sponsors' logos strung along a rope. If it is moved during play (such as by a fielder sliding into the rope) the boundary is considered to remain at the point where that object first stood.When the cricket ball is inside the boundary, it is live. When the ball is touching the boundary, grounded beyond the boundary, or being touched by a fielder who is himself either touching the boundary or grounded beyond it, it is dead and the batting side usually scores 4 or 6 runs for hitting the ball over the boundary. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball while running or diving, often flick the ball back in to the field of play rather than pick it up directly, because their momentum could carry them beyond the rope while holding the ball. They then return to the field to pick the ball up and throw it back to the bowler.|$|R
5000|$|On {{his death}} the {{following}} was noted:His funeral {{took place in}} the presence of nineteen Victoria Cross recipients, eight of which were Yorkshire VC. Holders. The Yorkshire VC’s were; Captain George Sanders, Lieutenant Wilfred Edwards, Sergeant Fred McNess, Sergeant Charles Smith Hull, Sergeant Albert Mountain, Lance Corporal Frederick W Dobson, Private Arthur Poulter, Private William Boynton Butler who were acting as pallbearers. The 71st Field Brigade Royal Artillery provided the gun carriage that carried the coffin of Mr Raynes, followed by the chairman of the LEEDS “Old Contemptibles Association”, Captain W.E. Gage, <b>carrying</b> a purple <b>cushion</b> with JCR’s medals upon it a wreath of Flanders poppies and evergreen {{in the shape of a}} Victoria Cross was carried by Lieutenant Edwards.The wreath was intended as a souvenir for JCR from the VC Dinner at the House of Lords. The wreath bore the message “In affectionate memory from brother VC’s of Leeds, who sorely missed their comrade at the Prince of Wales’s dinner, whence this emblem was brought for him.” Mr Raynes was intended to go to the dinner but he had to give his apologies, he asked if his son John Kenneth, age 18 would be able to take his place.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Wood {{worked in}} the parishes of St Ebbe's, Oxford (1947-1952) and St Mary's, Islington (1952-1961) both known for their strong Evangelical traditions. Following that he became Principal of Oak Hill Theological College in Southgate, London. In 1971 was {{appointed}} the 69th Bishop of Norwich, serving in this post for 14 years before retiring in 1985. He espoused conventional Evangelical views - for example on women's ordination and supported Mary Whitehouse in her campaigns. He was also innovative - for example he bought a fleet of 36 mopeds to enable his clergy to get around their parishes - and a media friendly communicator. Wood was a supporter of evangelism and helped to organise Billy Graham's UK crusades. He was also a regular speaker at the annual Keswick Convention and served on the council for many years. Nonetheless, {{he was the first}} Bishop of Norwich to pay a formal visit to the (Church of England) Shrine of our Lady of Walsingham. His contradictory nature surfaced after his consecration as a bishop when he would happily wear a golden cope and was reputed to take a case of ostentatious episcopal jewelled rings to functions but would not wear a mitre. Bizarrely, he sometimes permitted a mitre to be <b>carried</b> on a <b>cushion</b> before him. Diocesan clergy soon learned of his alcoholic abstinence when only fruit juice was offered. Waggishly, his crypto Latin title as Maurice Norvic was parodied as Maurice Britvic.|$|R
