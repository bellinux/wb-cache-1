2500|$|Visual Studio {{supports}} running {{multiple instances}} {{of the environment}} (each with {{its own set of}} VSPackages). The instances use different registry hives (see MSDN's [...] of the term [...] "registry hive" [...] in the sense used here) to store their <b>configuration</b> <b>state</b> and are differentiated by their AppId (Application ID). The instances are launched by an AppId-specific [...]exe that selects the AppId, sets the root hive and launches the IDE. VSPackages registered for one AppId are integrated with other VSPackages for that AppId. The various product editions of Visual Studio are created using the different AppIds. The Visual Studio Express edition products are installed with their own AppIds, but the Standard, Professional and Team Suite products share the same AppId. Consequently, one can install the Express editions side-by-side with other editions, unlike the other editions which update the same installation. The professional edition includes a superset of the VSPackages in the standard edition and the team suite includes a superset of the VSPackages in both other editions. The AppId system is leveraged by the Visual Studio Shell in Visual Studio 2008.|$|E

In this position paper, we consider the requirements for a solution to these challenges which entail a shift in philosophy from imperative to declarative models for data centres. An important aspect of such a shift is the replacement of workflow as a mechanism for automation. In its place, we propose a declarative approach based on modelling individual components of a system together with their possible <b>configuration</b> <b>states.</b> Dependencies may be specified between components which guard how components may change <b>configuration</b> <b>states.</b> We determine the actions that may be performed to dynamically achieve target states for the system from these models.

In terms of a specification of orbital occupation (for instance, (1s)2(2s)2(2p)1...), interaction means the mixing (interaction) of different electronic <b>configurations</b> (<b>states).</b> Due to the long CPU time and large memory required for CI calculations, the method is limited to relatively small systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{experimental}} <b>configurations</b> (<b>state</b> preparations and measurements) required for full quantum process tomography grows exponentially {{with the number}} of constituent particles of a system. Consequently, in general, QPT is an impossible task for large-scale quantum systems. However, under weak decoherence assumption, a quantum dynamical map can find a sparse representation. The method of compressed quantum process tomography (CQPT) uses the compressed sensing technique and applies the sparsity assumption to reconstruct a quantum dynamical map from an incomplete set of measurements or test state preparations.|$|R

In the context of tracking human pose through image features in video sequences, the number of degree-of-freedom (DOFs) of the human body forces the search to be done using an exponentially large number of possible <b>configuration</b> <b>states.</b> In this dissertation, we stated that the computational complexity of this search can be greatly reduced by the introduction of a hierarchical model for the propagation of the state variable and by the efficient selection and synthesis of <b>configuration</b> <b>states</b> through this hierarchy.
