25|$|<b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive PS. There are three types of CS, distinguished by severity and age of onset. It occurs {{at a rate of}} about 1 in 300,000-500,000 in the United States and Europe.|$|E
40|$|Two {{patients}} with early onset <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> are presented. In each case {{there was a}} striking failure of growth and developmental deterioration around six months of age. It {{has been suggested that}} early onset <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a <b>syndrome</b> distinct from <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but when the first patient died aged two years 10 months, examination of the brain showed a leucodystrohy with 'tigroid' demyelination similar to that reported in later onset cases of <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Studies of the effects of UV irradiation on cultured fibroblasts from patients showed similar levels of inhibition of RNA synthesis to those seen in a control with <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This evidence suggests it is appropriate to classify early onset <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> with <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Since there is a phenotypic overlap between early onset <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and COFS syndrome, they may both be classified within the same diagnostic group, but as yet no cellular studies with UV irradiation have been performed in COFS syndrome...|$|R

25|$|Some {{segmental}} progeroid syndromes, such as Werner syndrome (WS), Bloom syndrome (BS), Rothmund-Thomson syndromes (RTS) {{and combined}} xeroderma pigmentosa-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS), {{are associated with}} an increased risk of developing cancer in the affected individual; two exceptions are Hutchinson–Gilford progeria (HGPS) and <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thirteen other syndromes may exhibit signs {{similar to}} Usher syndrome, {{including}} Alport syndrome, Alstrom syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome,</b> spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Flynn-Aird syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Hurler syndrome (MPS-1), Kearns-Sayre syndrome (CPEO), Norrie syndrome, osteopetrosis (Albers-Schonberg disease), Refsum's disease (phytanic acid storage disease), and Zellweger syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome).|$|E
25|$|Examples of PS include Werner {{syndrome}} (WS), Bloom syndrome (BS), Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (RTS), <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CS), {{xeroderma pigmentosum}} (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), combined xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS), restrictive dermopathy (RD), and Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Individuals with these disorders {{tend to have}} a reduced lifespan. Progeroid syndromes have been widely studied in the fields of aging, regeneration, stem cells, and cancer. The most widely studied of the progeroid syndromes are Werner syndrome and Hutchinson–Gilford progeria, as they are seen to most resemble natural aging.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in XPB {{and other}} related {{complementation}} groups, XPA-XPG, leads {{to a number of}} genetic disorders such as Xeroderma pigmentosum, <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and trichothiodystrophy.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{is a form}} of cachectic {{dwarfism}} {{characterized by}} acute sun sensitivity and numerous other abnormalities of many organ systems. We studied fibroblasts from 9 <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients to determine if their fibroblasts had abnormal post-ultraviolet light colony-for using ability or abnormal ultraviolet light-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis. The fibroblast strains from all the patients had markedly decreased post-ultraviolet light colony-forming ability in comparison with fibroblasts from control donors. Since this increased ultraviolet light sensitivity is propagable in vitro, it may be a manifestation of, or be closely associated with, the inherited genetic defect of this autosomal recessive disease. However, the patients' fibroblasts had normal rates of ultraviolet light-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis. Thus, unlike the UV sensitivity of DNA excision repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum strains, the UV sensitivity of <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> strains is not related to abnormal DNA excision repair, at least to the extent that this repair process is reflected by rates of ultraviolet light-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis...|$|R
50|$|The {{importance}} of NER {{is evidenced by}} the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins. Xeroderma pigmentosum and <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> are two examples of NER associated diseases.|$|R
25|$|If DNA {{damage is}} the {{underlying}} cause of aging, it would be expected that humans with inherited defects {{in the ability to}} repair DNA damages should age at a faster pace than persons without such a defect. Numerous examples of rare inherited conditions with DNA repair defects are known. Several of these show multiple striking features of premature aging, and others have fewer such features. Perhaps the most striking premature aging conditions are Werner syndrome (mean lifespan 47 years), Huchinson-Gilford Progeria (mean lifespan 13 years), and <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome</b> (mean lifespan 13 years).|$|E
25|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{excision repair}} (NER) pathway is {{a mechanism to}} repair damage to DNA. ERCC2 is involved in transcription-coupled NER and is an integral member of the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH complex. ERCC3 is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that functions in NER. It also is a subunit of basal transcription factor 2 (TFIIH) and, thus, functions in class II transcription. XPG (ERCC5) forms a stable complex with TFIIH, which is active in transcription and NER. ERCC6 encodes a DNA-binding protein that is important in transcription-coupled excision repair. ERCC8 interacts with <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome</b> type B (CSB) protein, with p44 (GTF2H2), a subunit of the RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH, and ERCC6. It is involved in transcription-coupled excision repair.|$|E
25|$|Type I and II {{are known}} to be caused by {{mutation}} of a specific gene. CSA is caused by mutations in the cross-complementing gene 8 (ERCC8), which encodes for the CSA protein. These mutations are thought to cause alternate splicing of the pre-mRNA which leads to an abnormal protein. CSB is caused by mutations in the ERCC6 gene, which encodes the CSB protein. CSA and CSB are involved in transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), which is involved in repairing DNA; they ubiquitinate RNA polymerase II, halting its progress thus allowing the TC-NER mechanism to be carried out. The ubiquitinated RNAP II then dissociates and is degraded via the proteasome. Mutations in ERCC8, ERCC6, or both mean DNA is no longer repaired through TC-NER, and the accumulation of mutations leads to cell death, which may contribute to the symptoms of <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} for defective DNA repair in xeroderma pigmentosum, <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and trichothiodystrophy, but for increased cancer risk only in xeroderma pigmentosum. Natural and adaptive immune surveillance and mutant frequency to 6 -thioguanine resistance in circulating T-lymphocytes were studied in five patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, two with <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{and one with}} trichothiodystrophy. Forty-eight-hour cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to recall antigens excluded anergy and circulating CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 8 +, and CD 16 + cell numbers were within normal limits in all patients tested, as were proliferative lymphocyte responses to PHA, except in the trichothiodystrophy patient. Proliferative responses to recall antigens (PPD, SKSD, and Candida) showed that all patients responded {{to one or more}} antigens. Direct natural killer cytotoxicity measured against the human erythromyeloid leukaemia cell line K 562 using a 4 -h 51 Cr release assay was significantly reduced in xeroderma pigmentosum (specific cytotoxicity 17. 4 ± 9. 4 per cent, with effector: target cell ratio of 50 : 1) compared to normal controls (45. 8 ± 17. 8), but normal in <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and trichothiodystrophy. Generation of lymphokine activated killer cell activity was normal in the two xeroderma pigmentosum lines tested. The mutant frequency in the xeroderma pigmentosum donors was significantly increased (p < 0. 01) and was elevated in the two <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> donors, taking age into account. No mutants were observed from the single trichothiodystrophy donor. These findings suggest that reduced natural killer cell activity may contribute to the greatly increased susceptibility to skin cancer in xeroderma pigmentosum...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> cells lack transcription-coupled {{nucleotide}} {{excision repair}} (TCR) and ubiquitylation of RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNA pol II LS), suggesting that ubiquitylation of RNA pol II LS {{may be necessary}} for TCR in eukaryotes. Rsp 5 is the sole yeast ubiquitin-protein ligase that ubiquitylates RNA pol II LS in cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents. In yeast lacking functional Rsp 5, there is no ubiquitylation of RNA pol II LS. We show here that removal, repression, or over-expression of Rsp 5 {{has no effect on}} TCR, demonstrating that ubiquitylation of the RNA pol II LS is not required for TCR. We infer that the lack of ubiquitylation of RNA pol II LS in <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> cells does not cause their defect in TCR...|$|R

2500|$|Hutchinson–Gilford {{progeria}} syndrome, Werner syndrome, and <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome</b> are {{the three}} genetic disorders in which patients have premature aging features. Premature aging also develops on some animal models which have genetic alterations. Although the patients with these syndromes and the animal models with premature aging symptoms have different genetic backgrounds, they all have abnormal structures of tissues/organs {{as a result of}} defective development. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory [...] suggests that the abnormality of tissue structure is the common point between premature aging and normal aging.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mean age}} of death is ~12 years, {{although}} the different forms differ significantly. Individuals with the type I (or classical) form of the disorder usually first show symptoms between one and three years and have lifespans of between 20 and 40 years. Type II <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CSB) is more severe: symptoms present at birth and individuals live to approximately 6–7 years of age. Type III has the mildest symptoms, first presents later in childhood, {{and the cause of}} death is often severe nervous system deterioration and respiratory tract infections.|$|E
2500|$|Cells with {{disabling}} {{mutations in}} [...] ERCC4 {{are more sensitive}} than normal to particular DNA damaging agents, including ultraviolet radiation and to chemicals that cause crosslinking between DNA strands. Genetically engineered mice with disabling mutations in ERCC4 also have defects in DNA repair, accompanied by metabolic stress-induced changes in physiology that result in premature aging. Complete deletion of ERCC4 is incompatible with viability of mice, and no human individuals have been found with complete (homozygous) deletion of ERCC4. Rare individuals in the human population harbor inherited mutations that impair the function of ERCC4. When the normal genes are absent, these mutations can lead to human syndromes, including xeroderma pigmentosum, <b>Cockayne</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Fanconi anemia.|$|E
40|$|The human CSB gene, mutated in <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> group B (partially {{defective}} in both {{repair and}} transcription) was previously cloned {{by virtue of}} its ability to correct the moderate UV sensitivity of the CHO mutant UV 61. To determine whether the defect in UV 61 is the hamster equivalent of <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> the RNA polymerase II transcription and DNA repair characteristics of a repair-proficient CHO cell line (AA 8), UV 61 and a CSB transfectant of UV 61 were compared. In each cell line, formation and removal of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) were measured in the individual strands of the actively transcribed DHFR gene and in a transcriptionally inactive region downstream of DHFR. AA 8 cells efficiently remove CPDs from the transcribed strand, but not from either the non-transcribed strand or the inactive region. There was no detectable repair of CPDs in any region of the genome in UV 61. Transfection of the human CSB gene into UV 61 restores the normal repair pattern (CPD removal in only the transcribed strand), demonstrating that the DNA repair defect in UV 61 is homologous to that in <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (complementation group B) cells. However, we observe no significant deficiency in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in UV 61, suggesting that the CSB protein has independent roles in DNA repair and RNA transcription pathways...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{addressed}} the questions as to whether repair is confined to the nuclear matrix compartment, analogous to replication and transcription and how repair events are distributed in DNA loops associated with the nuclear matrix. Pulse labelling of ultraviolet (254 nm) irradiated confluent human fibroblasts revealed that repair was preferentially located in nuclear matrix associated DNA in cells exposed to 5 J/m 2. However, in cells exposed to 30 J/m 2 repair approached a random distribution. The non-random distribution of repair label at 5 J/m 2 was most pronounced directly after irradiation and gradually changed to a more random distribution within two hours after treatment. The results of pulse-chase experiments exclude the possibility of transient binding of repair sites to the matrix and favour the model of preferential repair of DNA sequences permanently associated with the nuclear matrix. Pronounced differences in distribution pattern of repair events in DNA loops were found among normal and UV-sensitive cell lines exposed to 5 J/m 2. Repair in nuclear matrix associated DNA was 1. 7 fold more efficient than in loop DNA in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group D cells and over 3 fold in xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells. In <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> fibroblasts repair in nuclear matrix DNA {{was found to be}} 2 fold less efficient than in loop DNA. This heterogeneity in distribution of repair correlates well with preferential removal of pyrimidine dimers from transcriptionally active DNA in normal and xeroderma pigmentosum group C cells and its absence in <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> cells as recently reported by Mayne et al., 1988. The results suggest that <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> cells have a defect in excision of UV-damage from transcriptionally active genes located proximal to the nuclear matrix.

40|$|The {{phenotypic}} {{consequences of}} a nucleotide excision repair (NER) defect in man are apparent from three distinct inborn diseases characterized by hypersensitivity of the skin to ultraviolet light and a remarkable clinical and genetic heterogeneity. These are the prototype repair syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) (seven genetic complementation groups, designated XP-A to XP-G), <b>Cockayne's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (two groups: CS-A and CS-B) and PIBIDS, a peculiar photosensitive form of the brittle hair disease trichothiodystrophy (TTD, at least two groups of which one equivalent to XP-D).
