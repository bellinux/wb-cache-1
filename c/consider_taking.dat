5|$|Laevinus {{had begun}} {{exploring}} {{the possibility of}} an alliance with the Aetolian League, as early as 212 BC. The Aetolians, war weary, had made peace with Philip at Naupactus in 217 BC. However five years later the pendulum had swung in the other direction, the war faction was on the ascendency, and the Aetolians were once again ready to <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> up arms against their traditional enemy, Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Coyle cold called Kristin Chenoweth's {{agent and}} {{proposed}} the part, which {{is different from}} her usual roles, and her agent {{said it was the}} exact part the actress was seeking. In order to film Into Temptation, Chenoweth took a five-day hiatus from her supporting role on the ABC television series Pushing Daisies. Brian Baumgartner, best known for his supporting role as Kevin Malone in the NBC comedy series The Office, was a regular theater performer in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area before joining that show. While visiting New York City in May 2008 for an upfront presentation, shortly after having finished filming the fourth season of The Office, Baumgartner was offered the Into Temptation script by Coyle, who asked him to <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> the role of Father Ralph O'Brien. Baumgartner said he enjoyed the script and agreed to the part.|$|E
5|$|Football {{had been}} played at St James' Park {{as early as}} 1880, the ground being {{occupied}} by Newcastle Rangers, before becoming the home of Newcastle West End F.C. in 1886. Its lease was then bought by Newcastle East End F.C. in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At {{the turn of the}} 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, {{and the rest of the}} ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity all-seater stadium. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,420. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,420 people, but club owner Mike Ashley would <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.|$|E

25|$|From 2013, South Korea banned all seafood {{products}} {{imported from}} Japan, due to concerns on the radioactive contamination from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

The Japanese government strongly opposes to South Korea's decision on placing the ban, insisting that the country's fisheries exports are safe for consumption, with stringent inspection procedures in place. The ban has led Japan to <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> the issue to the WTO dispute settlement process.|$|E
25|$|Walter Pincus of the Washington Post {{has written}} that Israel's stance on nuclear arms complicates efforts against Iran. Gawdat Bahgat of the National Defense University {{believes}} Iran's nuclear program is partially formed on the potential threat of a nuclear Israel. Iran and the Arab League have proposed that the Middle East be established as a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone. Israel said in May 2010 it would not <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> part in nuclear weapon-free zone discussions or joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty until a lasting peace was achieved with its neighbors.|$|E
25|$|The {{automaticity}} model, {{which became}} widespread following exposition by John Bargh {{and others in}} the 1980s, describes sophisticated processes for executing goals which can be selected and performed over an extended duration without conscious awareness. Some experimental data suggests that the brain begins to <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> actions before the mind becomes aware of them. This influence of unconscious forces on people's choices naturally bears on philosophical questions free will. John Bargh, Daniel Wegner, and Ellen Langer are some prominent contemporary psychologists who describe free will as an illusion.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not simply}} a more {{powerful}} calculating instrument that placed the reality of white flight beyond a high hurdle of proof seemingly required for policy makers to <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> action. Also instrumental were new statistical methods developed by Emerson Seim for disentangling deceptive counter-effects that had resulted when numerous cities reacted to departures of a wealthier tax base by annexation. In other words, central cities had been bringing back their new suburbs, such that families that had departed from inner cities were not even being counted as having moved from the cities.|$|E

25|$|In May 1941, {{to add to}} British {{troubles}} in the area, there was a coup d'état against the pro-British government in Iraq. A pro-German ruler took power in the coup and ordered British forces out of Iraq. There were two main British bases in Iraq, around Basra and at Habbaniya north east of Baghdad. Basra was too well defended for the Iraqis to <b>consider</b> <b>taking.</b> However, Habbaniya was a poorly defended air base, situated {{in the middle of}} enemy territory. It had no regular air forces, being only a training centre. Nonetheless, the RAF personnel at the base converted as many of the training aircraft as possible to carry weapons.|$|E
25|$|In a February 23, 2004 speech, Greenspan {{suggested}} that more homeowners should <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> out adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) where {{the interest rate}} adjusts itself to the current interest in the market. The Fed's own funds rate was at a then all-time-low of 1%. A few months after his recommendation, Greenspan began raising interest rates, {{in a series of}} rate hikes that would bring the funds rate to 5.25% about two years later. A triggering factor in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis {{is believed to be the}} many subprime ARMs that reset at much higher interest rates than what the borrower paid during the first few years of the mortgage.|$|E

500|$|In 1974 the Imperial War Museum was {{approached}} {{by the government and}} asked to <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> over the administration of the site. A feasibility study was prepared but came to nothing, the museum feeling it did not have sufficient resources to commit to the War Rooms. In 1981 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, known as an admirer of Winston Churchill, expressed the hope that the Rooms could be opened before the next general election. The Imperial War Museum was again approached. Initially still reluctant, the museum's trustees decided in January 1982 that the museum would take over the site, on the understanding that the government would make the necessary resources available. The initial costs were to be met by the Department for the Environment, and the War Rooms intended to be self-supporting thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure.

I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else {{is going to have to}} have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Vick was mentored by former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy. The {{prospect}} of his return to professional football {{was the subject of}} much conjecture as his suspension and incarceration continued. In 2007, ESPN's John Clayton said few general managers were in a strong enough position to <b>consider</b> <b>taking</b> a chance on Vick, and even then most NFL owners would be concerned about a fan and media backlash. There was also no chance of Vick resurrecting his career in the Canadian Football League, he said. Following a furor in 2007 over Ricky Williams playing there while serving a suspension, the CFL banned players currently suspended by the NFL. In any case, Clayton said it would be nearly impossible for a convicted felon to get a Canadian work visa. He did think, however, that Vick would be [...] "unstoppable" [...] if he decided to play in the Arena Football League.|$|E
