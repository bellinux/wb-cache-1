40|$|<b>Compensation</b> <b>measures</b> are a {{new method}} for {{handling}} impact on cultural heritage in land use planning. The idea with <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> {{can be understood as}} an extension of the polluter pays principle. Today, <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> are mainly used when natural environments are damaged by development, but it is also possible to use <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> when a project results in negative impact on cultural heritage. However, there is a lack of experience in using compensation when it comes to the latter.   In our work as heritage consultants, we have experienced difficulties in implementing compensa-tion measures in projects and assignments. Since 2013, we have organised a research project dealing with <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> and cultural heritage; aiming towards a new practice and better use of planning instruments. With this paper, we want to share our results from four case studies where development impact on cultural heritage has led to discussions about, and imple-mentation of, <b>compensation</b> <b>measures.</b>   By using case studies from four different types of development, we wanted to find patterns in the use of <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> in planning processes. The results show an uncertainty in understanding compensation as a concept. This is due to an absence of practice dealing with compensation measures; cultural heritage values are not addressed in a proper way in negotia-tions over land access.   Several instruments for <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> in planning processes can actually be found in the law and land use of the Swedish planning system, but they are not being used properly, which results in a negative impact on the cultural heritage. After two years of analysing and discussing our case studies in workshops and conferences, we have concluded that there is a strong need for clarifying planning instruments and for developing a professional practice dealing with compensa-tion measures.

30|$|The {{conventional}} endpoints {{used for}} hazard assessment are selected {{with respect to}} the protection of populations and cover parameters such as reproduction, mortality, growth. Effects on individuals are not considered. The results on alternative parameters reviewed in the literature usually address less complex and sub lethal reactions (e.g. determination of specific enzymes or gene activities) at a level of a single or some individuals, often resulting in an increased sensitivity. It is not always obvious whether an effect detected by a sensitive additional endpoint (e.g. indicators for oxygen stress) has an impact on the population level or indicates a <b>compensation</b> <b>measure</b> of the organism. Based on the literature review, it can be concluded that the advantage of considering alternative endpoints as additional input for a regulatory hazard assessment specific for ENMs is limited so far. Nevertheless, every additional parameter can provide additional information on ecotoxicity of ENMs and can support the assessment. In any case, in research, alternative endpoints play a major role by increasing the knowledge on the mode of action of ENMs.|$|E

40|$|Negative {{consequences}} of human activities for biodiversity may be mitigated by <b>compensation</b> <b>measures.</b> Although {{the interest in}} applying <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> is generally increasing, such measures have rarely been applied in forestry. Many boreal forests are managed by clear felling and used for timber and pulp production. There is an increasing interest in intensifying forestry by also harvesting slash and stumps for biofuel at felling. We evaluated the efficiency of combining intensified forestry production with <b>compensation</b> <b>measures,</b> by estimating the net revenue from slash and stump harvest, the cost of high stump creation, and simulating habitat amount for 680 bark- and wood-living species (fungi, beetles, lichens, and bryophytes) in Norway spruce forests in Sweden under different scenarios of biofuel harvest and compensation. We show that the harvest of slash and stumps has a clear {{negative effect on the}} habitat amount available for many species, especially for many fungi and beetles. Combining slash harvesting with the creation of high stumps results in an economic surplus {{and at the same time}} provides significantly more habitat in comparison with no slash harvesting and no high stump creation. When undertaking stump harvesting it is currently impossible to achieve such positive effects. Thus, our analyses show that compensation can sometimes be a useful tool when both economic and biodiversity goals must be achieved in forestry, but in other cases it is a better alternative to avoid the activity that causes the negative effects...|$|R

40|$|We wish {{to thank}} Juan Ayuso, Fernando Restoy and {{participants}} in the seminar held at the Banco de España, especially Inflation-indexed bonds are fixed-income securities whose nominal cash flows are adjusted to an inflation index. In countries where these securities exist, inflation expectations are sometimes estimated as the spread between the nominal yield on a conventional bond and the real yield on an indexed bond with a similar maturity and issued in the same currency and by the same issuer. However, this indicator, known as the break-even rate, may estimate inflation expectations with some biases. In this paper, we discuss, and quantify where possible, the size of such biases. Then, focusing on the 10 -year French indexed bond, we compute an alternative indicator, called the inflation <b>compensation</b> <b>measure,</b> which corrects some of these biases and find very few differences between both indicators in our sample period. Finally, the comparison with other indicators of long-term inflation expectations shows that measures based on indexed-bond prices are more time-varying than non-financial indicators, but less variable than other financial indicators.

40|$|Environmental {{compensation}} includes {{a range of}} activities intended to counterbalance such negative impacts of development projects that remain in the environment after all preventive and corrective measures have been fully implemented. Sweden, being a member state of the European Union (EU), must implement environmental compensation under EU directives such as the Habitat Directive. However, like in other countries, implementation is not yet widespread in Sweden, and new practices and guidelines remain to be developed both nationally and at European level. This need {{is all the more}} urgent considering that the European Commission estimates that, within the EU, about 100, 000 hectares of land is converted from its natural state each year. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe current environmental-compensation practices in Swedish road and railway projects and to discuss issues of vital importance to the development of compensation policy, such as what to compensate for, how much, and how. A national inventory was performed, for the first time in Sweden, to identify <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> in road and railway projects. Data were collected from a national mailing list including 141 officials at county administrative boards (CABs), internal e-mail correspondence within the Swedish Transport Administration and databases of court decisions. The inventory focused on <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> ordered by virtue of the Swedish Environmental Code. In addition, two case studies were carried out to investigate the planning of <b>compensation</b> <b>measures.</b> The results showed that CABs and courts rarely order compensation in infrastructure projects, even though this is possible under Swedish law. Between 1999 and 2012, 37 cases (i. e. permits issued) were found for which compensation was ordered. Of these cases, 76 % concerned compensation for encroachments on minor habitats such as small ponds and cairns. No CAB ordered compensation for non-protected areas. Compensation ratios were never explicitly mentioned in permits, but in practice a ratio of 1 : 1 (often measured as area or length) was usually applied. The <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> typically consisted in recreating the same kind of natural asset that was affected, in a location close to the damaged area. In the two cases specially studied, the road and railway planning processes were not properly adjusted to integrate compensation issues, resulting in unnecessary bureaucracy and insufficient co-ordination between different projects, such as between the environmental-impact assessment process and the compensation process or between closely related sub-projects in the same region. To meet the EU’s goal of no net loss of biodiversity, we suggest that policy requirements should be made stricter and that incentives for voluntary compensation should be created. In line with the goals of Swedish national transport policy and the European Landscape Convention, account should be taken of social and cultural aspects, and there should be a shift from a narrow focus on individual projects to a broader planning approach, since this would allow <b>compensation</b> <b>measures</b> to be taken where they can deliver the greatest environmental benefits...|$|R

Here, we evaluate if, {{and to what}} extend, dual-purpose wetlands benefit local and regional diversity of agricultural landscapes. We analysed composition and alpha, beta, and gamma diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages among dual-purpose wetlands in an agricultural region in southwest Sweden in relation to local (water quality, wetland morphology, succession stage, proximity to other aquatic habitats) and landscape parameters (regional connectivity, wetland density). Diversity of mature agricultural ponds {{was used as a}} standard to evaluate the value of dual-purpose wetlands. Dual-purpose wetlands sustained alpha, beta, and gamma diversity similar to that of natural lentic water bodies in agricultural landscapes in the region and elsewhere. Over 80 % of the overall species richness was attributed to beta diversity, and each created wetland contributed to overall species accumulation. Ecosystem parameters explained 19 % of the compositional variation among assemblages, but were only marginally related to diversity. Wetland density promoted alpha and gamma diversity, while spatial heterogeneity (beta) remained equally high, independent of wetland density. Our results indicate that catchment-scale wetland creation for simultaneous retention and diversity purposes benefits the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes, particularly if the density of aquatic habitats is increased by at least 30 %.
