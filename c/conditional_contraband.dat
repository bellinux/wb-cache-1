50|$|Numerous {{treaties}} defining contraband {{have been}} concluded among nations. In time of war, the nations involved have invariably violated the agreements, formulating their own definitions as {{the fortunes of}} war indicated. The Declaration of London, drafted at the London Naval Conference of 1908-1909 and made partly effective {{by most of the}} European maritime nations at the outbreak of World War I, established comprehensive classifications of absolute and <b>conditional</b> <b>contraband.</b> As the war developed, the lists of articles in each category were constantly revised by the various belligerents despite protests by neutral powers engaged in the carrying trade. By 1916, the list of <b>conditional</b> <b>contraband</b> included practically all waterborne cargo. Thereafter, for the duration of World War I, nearly all cargo in transit to an enemy nation was treated as contraband of war by the intercepting belligerent, regardless {{of the nature of the}} cargo. A similar policy was inaugurated by the belligerent powers early in World War II.|$|E
50|$|In {{international}} law, contraband means {{goods that}} are ultimately destined for territory {{under the control}} of the enemy and may be susceptible for use in armed conflict. Traditionally, contraband is classified into two categories, absolute contraband and <b>conditional</b> <b>contraband.</b> The former category includes arms, munitions, and various materials, such as chemicals and certain types of machinery that may be used directly to wage war or be converted into instruments of war.|$|E
50|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>contraband,</b> {{formerly}} known as occasional contraband, consists of such materials as provisions and livestock feed. Cargo of that kind, presumably innocent in character, is subject to seizure if {{in the opinion of}} the belligerent nation that seizes them, the supplies are destined for the armed forces of the enemy rather than for civilian use and consumption. In former agreements among nations, certain other commodities, including soap, paper, clocks, agricultural machinery and jewelry, have been classified as non-contraband, but the distinctions have proved meaningless in practice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{day after}} the declaration, the British Admiralty {{announced}} that all merchant vessels were now liable to examination by the naval Contraband Control Service and by the French Blockade Ministry, which put its ships under British command. Because of the terrible suffering and starvation caused by the original use of the strategy, a formal declaration of blockade was deliberately not made, but the communiqué listed the types of contraband of war that was liable for confiscation if carried. It included all kinds of foodstuffs, animal feed, forage, and clothing, and articles and materials used in their production. This was known as <b>Conditional</b> <b>Contraband</b> of War. In addition, there was Absolute Contraband, which constituted: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} that {{two or more}} different subclassifications of contraband, either absolute or conditional, such as weapons, drugs, people etc., could or would be smuggled by the same smuggling network or during the same smuggling run referred to as Multi Consignment Contraband smuggling was studied in 2009. The study located sixteen different cases of Multi Consignment contraband which occurred around the world, four of which were targeting the United States of America.A 2011 study comparing North America, the Middle East and Asia smuggling tunnels identified smuggling tunnels dug and maintained by different groups ranging from small family business to terrorist organizations. The primary purposes of Middle East tunnels were to generate a profit and other tunnels' primary purpose was to support terrorists, either through profit or action missions. The majority of the smuggling tunnels in the Middle East smuggled Multi Consignment Contraband, specifically <b>conditional</b> <b>contraband</b> although some smuggled both conditional and absolute including terrorist action missions (hybrid tunnels). Most hybrid tunnels rarely smuggled both conditional and absolute contraband {{at the same time}} because conditional and absolute contraband served different purposes. North American tunnels smuggled drugs and North America sewer/drainage ditched tunnels supported both drug and people smuggling. Asian smuggling tunnels in North Korea supported absolute contraband, principally terrorist action missions.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{revision}} of a work first published in two volumes in 1922. In the process of revision it has acquired an additional volume. The work {{comes down to the}} fall of 1941, therefore omitting all discussion of the events of the wars then beginning and the question of consistency with the positions taken by the United States toward the events of 1917. Gone are the 2 ̆ 2 enlightened states 2 ̆ 2 of the first edition. Gone is the conceded belligerent right to seize all goods capable of 2 ̆ 2 assisting 2 ̆ 2 the enemy, a concession which would outlaw or terminate neutral trade. Perhaps the same result is achieved by sustaining the right to abolish the category of <b>conditional</b> <b>contraband</b> and the practice, not supported, of sinking merchant vessels at sight. Belligerents, by the way, are not far from abolishing the distinction between combatants and noncombatants, which would accomplish the purpose of abolishing 2 ̆ 2 <b>conditional</b> <b>contraband.</b> 2 ̆...|$|E
