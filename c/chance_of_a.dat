5|$|On December 3, 2004, Gray's team {{issued its}} first extended-range {{forecast}} for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States and the Florida peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was {{significantly less than}} the 2004 season. On April 1, 2005, after confirming that El Niño conditions would not develop, Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting 13 tropical storms instead of 11 and seven hurricanes instead of six. In addition, the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> storm impacting the United States was raised slightly.|$|E
5|$|On May21, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) {{issued its}} forecast, {{predicting}} a season with below-normal activity. It predicted 8 storms, with a 70% {{chance that the}} number of storms would be between 6 and 10; it predicted 5 hurricanes, with a 70% chance that that number would fall in the range of 3 to 7. UKMO's ACE index prediction was 74 units, with a 70% chance of the index falling in the range of 40 to 108 units. On May27, NOAA released its seasonal forecast, predicting a below-normal season with 6 to 11 named storms, 3 to 6 hurricanes, and 0 to 2 major hurricanes. NOAA indicated that there was a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> below-normal season, a 20% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> near-normal season, and a 10% chance of an above-normal season.|$|E

5|$|On June1, Klotzbach's team issued their updated {{forecast}} for the 2012season, predicting thirteen named storms and five hurricanes, of which {{two of those}} five would further intensify into major hurricanes. The university stated {{that there was a}} high amount of uncertainty concerning whether or not an El Niño would develop in time to hinder tropical development in the Atlantic basin. They also stated there was a lower than average <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major hurricane impacting the United States coastline in 2012. On June6, Tropical Storm Risk released their second {{updated forecast}} for the season, predicting fourteen named storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. In addition, the agency called for an Accumulated Cyclone Energy index of 100. Near-average sea surface temperatures and slightly elevated trade winds for cited for lower activity compared to the 2010 and 2011hurricane seasons. Tropical Storm Risk continued with their forecast of a near-average probability of a United States impact during the season using the 1950–2011 long-term normal, but a slightly below-average <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> United States landfall by the recent 2002–2011 normal.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, NOAA {{issued its}} first outlook {{calling for a}} near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10–16 named storms could form, {{including}} 4–8 hurricanes of which 1–4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated {{that there is a}} 45% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La Niña forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal.|$|E
30|$|When {{working on}} a problem, humans can have an “eureka” moment when they glimpse the problem solution. An eureka moment {{typically}} occurs when people combine facts {{in a new way}} to solve a problem. Continuous education loads more facts into participants’ minds and may increase the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment. Technology can also increase the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment by explicitly managing the juxtaposition of facts presented to the solvers. More eyes on a problem increases the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> uncovering key insights, especially if technology presents the problems in new contexts. Because of this, technological solutions that continuously teach solvers new facts and combine those facts in new ways can improve the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment. Technology may increase the odds of this, but insight only occurs in the human mind.|$|R

5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sizable strategic victory.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a divide and conquer strategy to weaken any <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
5|$|In the {{cultural}} sphere, {{there were some}} Mongol elements in Western medieval art, especially in Italy, of which most surviving examples are from the 14th century, after the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military alliance had faded. These included the depiction of textiles from the Mongol Empire and Mongol script in various contexts, the latter often anachronistic. Imports of textiles had a considerable influence on Italian textile design. Mongol military costume is sometimes worn by soldiers, typically those acting against Christian figures, as in martyrdoms or Crucifixion scenes. These were perhaps copied from drawings made of Mongol envoys to Europe, or ones brought back from Outremer.|$|E
