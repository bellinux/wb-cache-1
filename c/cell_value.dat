50|$|Raster {{data type}} {{consists}} of rows and columns of cells, with each cell storing a single value. Raster {{data can be}} images raster images with each pixel (or cell) containing a color value. Additional values recorded for each cell may be a discrete value, such as land use, a continuous value, such as temperature, or a null value if no data is available. While a raster cell stores a single value, it can be extended by using raster bands to represent RGB (red, green, blue) colors, colormaps (a mapping between a thematic code and RGB value), or an extended attribute table with one row for each unique <b>cell</b> <b>value.</b> The resolution of the raster data set is its cell width in ground units.|$|E

( [...] consider the magic sums of the rows/columns [...]. equal mass at an equal distance balance). The second property that can be calculated is the moment of inertia. Summing the individual moments of inertia ( [...] distance squared from the center x the <b>cell</b> <b>value)</b> gives the moment of inertia for the magic square.

40|$|Vast {{amounts of}} {{information}} is encoded in structured tables found in documents, on the Web, and in spreadsheets or databases. Integrating or searching over this information benefits from understanding its intended meaning. Evidence for a table’s meaning {{can be found in}} its column headers, <b>cell</b> <b>values,</b> implicit relations between columns, caption and surrounding text but also requires general and domain-specific background knowledge. We represent a table’s meaning by mapping columns to classes in an appropriate ontology, linking <b>cell</b> <b>values</b> to literal constants, implied measurements, or entities in the linked data cloud (existing or new) and discovering or and identifying relations between columns. We describe techniques grounded in graphical models and probabilistic reasoning to infer meaning (semantics) associated with a table. Using background knowledge from the Linked Open Data cloud, we jointly infer the semantics of column headers, table <b>cell</b> <b>values</b> (e. g.,strings and numbers) and relations between columns and represent the inferred meaning as graph of RDF triples. We motivate the value of this approach using tables from the medical domain, discussing some of the challenges presented by these tables and describing techniques to tackle them...|$|R

5000|$|One form of hot-deck {{imputation}} {{is called}} [...] "last observation carried forward" [...] (or LOCF for short), which involves sorting a dataset according {{to any of}} a number of variables, thus creating an ordered dataset. The technique then finds the first missing value and uses the <b>cell</b> <b>value</b> immediately prior to the data that are missing to impute the missing value. The process is repeated for the next cell with a missing value until all missing values have been imputed. In the common scenario in which the cases are repeated measurements of a variable for a person or other entity, this represents the belief that if a measurement is missing, the best guess is that it hasn't changed from the last time it was measured. This method is known to increase risk of increasing bias and potentially false conclusions. For this reason LOCF is not recommended for use.|$|E
5000|$|One {{can measure}} the {{superfluid}} {{response of the}} film by measuring the moment of inertia. An indispensable tool {{for this is the}} Torsional Oscillator, and early design was first used by Andronikashvili to detect superfluid in bulk fluid 4He and later modified by John Reppy and co-workers at Cornell in the 1970s. In the torsional oscillator, the experimental volume is suspended by a torsion rod and made to oscillate at resonance via capacitive coupling with a fin or pair of fins, depending on the configuration (shown below in grey). When part of the film becomes superfluid, it no longer has any viscosity and will remain at rest in the lab frame, lowering the moment of inertia of the cell. Recall that the resonant period of a torsional oscillator is [...] Therefore, lowering the moment of inertia reduces the resonant period of the oscillator. By measuring the period drop as a function of temperature, and total loading of the film from the empty <b>cell</b> <b>value,</b> one can deduce the fraction of the film that has entered the superfluid state. A typical set of data clearly showing the superfluid decoupling in helium films is shown in ref. 2.|$|E
50|$|Vector-based GIS is {{typically}} related to operations such as map overlay (combining {{two or more}} maps or map layers according to predefined rules), simple buffering (identifying regions of a map within a specified distance {{of one or more}} features, such as towns, roads or rivers) and similar basic operations. This reflects (and is reflected in) {{the use of the term}} spatial analysis within the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) “simple feature specifications”. For raster-based GIS, widely used in the environmental sciences and remote sensing, th{{is typically}} means a range of actions applied to the grid cells of one or more maps (or images) often involving filtering and/or algebraic operations (map algebra). These techniques involve processing one or more raster layers according to simple rules resulting in a new map layer, for example replacing each <b>cell</b> <b>value</b> with some combination of its neighbours’ values, or computing the sum or difference of specific attribute values for each grid cell in two matching raster datasets. Descriptive statistics, such as cell counts, means, variances, maxima, minima, cumulative values, frequencies and a number of other measures and distance computations are also often included in this generic term spatial analysis. Spatial analysis includes a large variety of statistical techniques (descriptive, exploratory, and explanatory statistics) that apply to data that vary spatially and which can vary over time. Some more advanced statistical techniques include Getis-ord Gi* or Anselin Local Moran's I which are used to determine clustering patterns of spatially referenced data.|$|E
