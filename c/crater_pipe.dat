50|$|Transverse cracks are {{perpendicular}} to {{the direction of the}} weld. These are generally the result of longitudinal shrinkage stresses acting on weld metal of low ductility. Crater cracks occur in the crater when the welding arc is terminated prematurely. Crater cracks are normally shallow, hot cracks usually forming single or star cracks. These cracks usually start at a <b>crater</b> <b>pipe</b> and extend longitudinal in the crater. However, they may propagate into longitudinal weld cracks {{in the rest of the}} weld.|$|E

40|$|A {{submarine}} gas eruption {{started in}} November 2002 offshore of Panarea volcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy). The {{intensity of the}} gas emission and the considerable anomalies of the geochemical and geophysical parameters have alarmed the volcanological community and the Italian Civil Protection Agency on the possibility that this activity may represent a volcanic unrest at Panarea volcano. We used a high resolution Marine Digital Terrain Model (MDTM), with 0. 5 m accuracy, and detailed underwater surveys by scuba diving to study the exhalation centres and the geological, morphological and structural features of the seafloor and to clarify the relationships between gas vents distribution, submarine volcanological structures and the recent deformation of this area. The underwater surveys revealed an exhalative field characterised by 21 main active gas vents and craters from metres to tens of metres in diameter, and a pervasive exhalation from the seafloor; hundreds of fossil craters associated with gas pipes and hydrothermal alteration are also present on the seafoor: <b>craters,</b> <b>pipes</b> and conduits are not associated with juvenile deposits and relate to a long standing history of gas exhalation and eruptions. We present the first geological sketch map of the seafloor surrounding the exhalative area and establish the role of NE- and NWtrending fractures as the main pathways for the gas exhalation...|$|R
50|$|The Buffalo Head Hills {{kimberlite}} {{field is}} an atypical diamond deposit. The lack of indicator minerals such as harzburgitic garnet suggests a mantle composition {{different from those}} of other diamond occurrences. An unusual occurrence of Type II and Type IaB diamonds is indicative of a sub-lithospheric origin, such as a subducting oceanic slab, and the presence of a lherzolitic garnet suggests a formation depth of some 400 km.26 of the 38 kimberlite pipes in the Buffalo Head Hills kimberlite field are, nevertheless, diamondiferous. Drilling restricted to upper 200 m but the carrot-shaped kimberlite diatremes reach below the Proterzoic boundary and contain <b>crater</b> facies. The <b>pipes</b> range in size from 1 to 47 ha.|$|R
40|$|Session: Volcano-Hydrothermal Systems 4 Many {{phenomena}} and data related to volcanoes and volcano eruptions {{have been observed}} and collected {{over the past four}} hundred years. They have been interpreted with the conventional and widely accepted hypothesis or theory of hot magma fluid from mantle. However, the prediction of volcano eruption sometimes is incorrect. For example, the devastating eruption of the Mount Ontake on Sept. 27, 2014 was not predicted and/or warned at all, which caused 55 fatalities, 9 missing and more than 60 injured. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} reconsider the cause and mechanism of active volcano and its hydrothermal system. On the basis of more than 30 year study and research in geology, volcano, earthquake, geomechanics, geophysics, geochemistry and geohazards, the author has developed a new and alternative modeling framework (or hypothesis) to better interpret the observed volcano-hydrothermal system data and to more accurately predict the occurrence of volcano explosion. An active volcano forms a cone-shape mountain and has a <b>crater</b> with vertical <b>pipe</b> conduit to allow hot lava, volcanic ash and gases to escape or erupt from its chamber (Figure). The chamber locates several kilometers below the ground rocks. The active volcanos are caused by highly compressed and dense gases escaped from the Mantle of the Earth. The gases are mainly CH 4 and further trapped in the upper crustal rock mass. They make chemical reactions with the surrounding rocks in the chamber. The chemical reactions are the types of reduction and decomposition. The reactions change the gas chemical compounds into steam water gas H 2 O, CO 2, H 2 S, SO 2 and others. The oxygen in the chemical reaction comes from the surrounding rocks. So, the product lava has a less amount of oxygen than that of the surrounding rocks. The gas-rock chemical reactions produce heat. The gas expansion and penetration power and the heat further break and crack the surrounding rock mass and make them into lavas, fragments, ashes or bombs. The pyroclastic deposits are carried out of the chamber by the gas expansion and uplift power and form the cone-shape mountain. The crust loses its rocks and the chamber becomes larger and larger. Eventually, the last eruption occurs and breaks the upper rocks and the cone mountain. The pyroclatic rocks collapse into the chamber space and leave a basin or lake...|$|R
