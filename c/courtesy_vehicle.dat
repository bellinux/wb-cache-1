30|$|Generally, traffic {{incident}} {{duration time}} {{can be defined as}} the time difference between the occurrence of an incident and clearance of the incident site. The duration includes four time phases: incident detection/reporting time, incident preparation/dispatching time, travel time, and clearance/treatment time. Most previous studies are limited by data availability, so they focus on the traffic incident duration time that consists of the last three phases. The duration covers the length of time between the reporting of the incident and the clearance of the road. Few studies include incident detection and recovery time [23], as well as define the duration time as the time difference from the time the Freeway <b>Courtesy</b> Patrol (FCP) <b>vehicle</b> arrives on the scene to the time the FCP leaves the scene after clearing the incident [24]. Other studies focus on the clearance time [11, 24 – 27], response time [28, 29], or different time phases [9, 30]. One study divides the response time into two parts: preparation time of the response team and travel time of the response vehicles [29]. The different divisions or definitions of traffic incident duration time in various studies cause difficulty in comparing their results. The difference in previous studies is also subject to used different data resources. A deeper investigation of traffic incident duration time is possible and necessary with the availability of more detailed data in the future.|$|R

Operated {{under the supervision of}} a director (as of 2015, Bill Lafferty), DPS is organized into two divisions, Patrol & Investigative Operations and Life & Fire Safety, each under the management of an Associate Director (as of 2015, Ivan Taylor and David Taylor respectively).

DPS has a healthy and working relationship with local law enforcement agencies including the Gettysburg Borough Police Department, Cumberland Township Police Department, and the Gettysburg Barracks for the Pennsylvania State Police.

The college falls under Gettysburg’s Volunteer Fire Department’s first-due response area. According to DPS’s website, the college employs 20 full-time officers and between 10-15 part-time officers. The structure of the agency includes one major, three lieutenants, one sergeant, and two corporals.|$|E
