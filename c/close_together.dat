5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Pavo on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Omega in 1756, but omitted Psi and Xi, and labelled {{two pairs}} of stars <b>close</b> <b>together</b> Mu and Phi Pavonis. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Pavonis as he felt its brightness warranted a name, but dropped Chi Pavonis due to its faintness.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours. Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay <b>close</b> <b>together</b> (shoaling), {{but do not}} swim together {{parallel to each other}} (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|Histological {{analysis}} of the lines of arrested growth within the tibiae from the various ontogenetic stages of Limusaurus indicates that the animal was skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, the outermost lines of arrested growth are very <b>close</b> <b>together</b> (forming {{what is known as}} the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{have their}} termini located <b>close</b> <b>together</b> in 3D space. Because of this, {{it is often}} possible to design circular permutations of proteins. Today, circular permutations are generated routinely in the lab using standard genetics techniques. Although some permutation sites prevent the protein from folding correctly, many permutants have been created with nearly identical structure and function to the original protein.|$|E
5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes <b>close</b> <b>together</b> on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are <b>close</b> <b>together</b> tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E

5|$|The {{new line}} was planned as a through route {{and was not}} {{intended}} to have any stations of its own, but in 1904 it was decided to build two stations on it. A new station, also named Wotton, was built immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. On 2 April 1906 the new route opened to passengers. The two Wotton stations were very <b>close</b> <b>together,</b> and the same stationmaster was responsible for both.|$|E
5|$|A curved line {{of stars}} {{comprising}} Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Beta, Nu and Gamma Phoenicis {{was seen as}} a boat by the ancient Arabs. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated 27 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled two stars <b>close</b> <b>together</b> Lambda, and assigned Omicron, Psi and Omega to three stars, which subsequent astronomers such as Benjamin Gould felt were too dim to warrant their letters. A different star was subsequently labelled Psi Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too <b>close</b> <b>together</b> to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E

5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too <b>close</b> <b>together,</b> causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
5|$|Foxes {{and human}} beings lived <b>close</b> <b>together</b> in ancient Japan; this {{companionship}} gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may {{have as many as}} nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make offerings to them as to a deity.|$|E
5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too <b>close</b> <b>together</b> and the 23 loaders tended {{to interfere with}} one another. This negated the mount's intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast of the mainmast on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E

Adults are similar to Palirisa cervina but are smaller and much paler, more silver-grey, and the transverse bands of the forewings are <b>closer</b> <b>together</b> and much fainter. Furthermore, the females are much less rufous than cervina, and the transverse bands are also much <b>closer</b> <b>together.</b>|$|R
5|$|Harold's forces {{deployed}} in a small, dense formation {{at the top}} of steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields <b>close</b> <b>together</b> or even overlapping to provide protection from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also <b>close</b> <b>together</b> in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E
5|$|Inn-yard theatres {{were first}} {{established}} in the Tudor period, with the Boar's Head Inn (1557) in Whitechapel, the George in Stepney and a purpose built, but short lived, John Brayne's Red Lion Theatre (1567), nearby. The first permanent theatres with resident companies were constructed in Shoreditch, with James Burbage's The Theatre (1576) and Henry Lanman's Curtain Theatre (1577) standing <b>close</b> <b>together.</b> On the night of 28 December 1598 Burbage's sons dismantled The Theatre, and moved it piece by piece across the Thames to construct the Globe Theatre.|$|E

Lacaille charted and designated 20 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Tau in 1756. Of these, he used the designations Eta, Pi and Tau twice each, for three sets of two stars <b>close</b> <b>together,</b> and omitted Omicron and Xi. He assigned Rho to a star that subsequent astronomers were unable to find.|$|E
5|$|Lambda Tucanae is {{an optical}} double—that is, {{the name is}} given to two stars (Lambda1 and Lambda2) which appear <b>close</b> <b>together</b> from our viewpoint, but are in fact far apart in space. Lambda1 is itself a binary star, with two components—a yellow-white star of {{spectral}} type F7IV-V and an apparent magnitude of 6.22, and a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G1V and an apparent magnitude of 7.28. The system is 186 light-years distant. Lambda2 is an orange subgiant of spectral type K2III that is expanding and cooling and has left the main sequence. Of apparent magnitude 5.46, it is approximately 220 light-years distant from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way {{passes through}} much of Canis Minor, yet it has few deep-sky objects.
