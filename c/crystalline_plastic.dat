40|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are polyesters {{synthesized}} by {{a variety}} of bacterial strains as intracellular carbon and energy storage compounds when grown under stress conditions. As biodegradable and biocompatible materials, PHA have drawn industrial attention for potential purposes in many fields, including biomedical and environmental applications. The incorporation of 4 HB units into the polymer influences the physical properties ranging from highly <b>crystalline</b> <b>plastic</b> to elastic rubber, depending on the polymer composition. Different compositions of the co-polymer P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) are promising materials with interesting mechanical properties that can be hydrolyzed by both PHA depolymerases and lipases at relatively rapid degradation rate, as compared with other PHAs. P(3 HB-co- 4 HB) has been produced by a few bacteria, including R. eutropha, Alcaligenes latus, Comamonas acidovorans, Comamonas testosteronii and Hydrogenophaga pseudoflava. Generally, carbon sources structurally related to 4 HB are required to produce 4 HB monomeric unit PHA, such as 4 -hydroxybutyric acid, γ-butyrolactone and 1, 4 -butanediol. However, these carbon sources are much more expensive than glucose or other 3 HB-generating carbon sources, so the use of structurally unrelated substrates or waste materials to generate these copolymers represent a reliable way to cost reduction. In this work we report the growth of H. pseudoflava DSM 1034 in minimal medium supplemented with sucrose, lactose and whey permeate without any co-substrate added. H. pseudoflava was found able to synthesize various PHAs with 3 -hydroxybutyrate (3 HB), 3 -hydroxyvalerate (3 HV) and 4 -hydroxybutyrate (4 HB) monomer units from this structurally unrelated carbon sources. The PHAs isolated from cultures grown in lactose and sucrose presented molecular weights of 1732 and 1120 Da, polydispersity index values (MW/MN) of 1. 19 and 1. 07 with a crystallinity of 66. 4 and 67. 8 % respectively. When grown on whey permeate H. pseudoflava was able to incorporate three different monomer units: 3 -hydroxybutyrate, 3 -hydroxyvalerate and 4 -hydroxybutyrate. Future activities will be addressed to expedite experimental routes enabling an increase of the production yields and above all an increase of the molecular weight of the samples from scl to mcl specimens...|$|E

M. and DICKENS, P. M., 2004. Thermal conditions in stereolithography injection mould tooling and their use for polyether-ether-ketone moulding. International Journal of Production Research, 42 (1), pp. 119 - 129 is available at [URL] use of stereolithography (SL) as a rapid tooling technique for injection moulding provides a low cost and quick alternative to hard tooling methods when producing a small quantity of parts. However, previous work has shown that different characteristics are developed by <b>crystalline</b> <b>plastic</b> parts produced from SL moulds and those produced from conventional tooling methods. Differing characteristics means that the parts are not truly the same as those that would be produced by hard tooling and highlights a disadvantage to SL tooling. Such differences are due to the cooling rate experienced by the part. Parts produced from SL moulds are cooled more slowly than those from metal tools {{as a result of the}} differing thermal conductivity of the mould material itself. This work concerned establishing the extent of the difference in the heat transfer characteristics. The different cooling rates were demonstrated by real-time data acquisition. The results illustrated the very different thermal history imparted on the moulding that are likely to be the cause of characteristical differences in the parts. The work then describes how the thermal conditions experienced in stereolithography moulds can be used to an advantage. A case study details the use of SL moulds for the injection moulding of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) which has high process parameter demands. The results of the case study have shown that not only is the stereolithography rapid tooling method capable of producing a low volume of PEEK parts, but also under conditions that would not be possible using a metal mould. The thermal characteristics of stereolithography moulds allowed fully crystalline PEEK parts to be produced with the mould at room temperature; the equivalent steel mould would require a pre-moulding temperature of 200 C and much higher injection pressures & speeds...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium based {{composites}} {{have attracted}} much attention {{over the past few}} years as a promising solution to lightweighting, energy saving and emission reduction, especially for automotive and aerospace applications. With a specific weight as low as 1. 74 g. cm- 3, magnesium is the lightest of all structural metals. However, the strength of Mg needs to be improved in order to compete with other light metals such as Al or Ti. The present study focuses on Mg reinforced by Y 2 O 3 nanoparticles. The aim of the work is to investigate the single <b>crystalline</b> <b>plastic</b> behavior of Mg strengthened by oxide dispersed particles, in comparison to that of pure Mg. A major challenge is to elaborate single crystalline samples with a homogeneous distribution of particles. In the present work, yttrium oxide reinforced magnesium matrix nanocomposites were produced using friction stir processing (FSP). FSP is a novel solid-state processing technique based on the same principle of friction stir welding. It proves to be an efficient method to produce metal-based composites. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), the initial 3 μm particles were fragmented during the process and their size was reduced to less than 100 nm. The three-dimensional dispersion of nanoparticles was confirmed by synchrotron X-ray microtomography, as shown in Fig. 1 (b). Since the FSP sample presents fine grains (around 10 μm), a subsequent heat treatment was performed to enable abnormal grain growth. The increased grain size allows the subsequent fabrication of single crystalline micropillars for microcompression testing. The advantage of this method over traditional mechanical testing for studying the mechanisms of deformation is that the entire sample can be investigated post-mortem (Fig. 1 (c)), and a variety of grain orientations can be tested for a single processing history. Micropillars were machined inside a single grain with a known orientation using focused ion beam (FIB) machining. Microcompression experiments were then conducted in a nanoindenter equipped with a diamond flat-ended conical indenter. The stress-strain response was measured for different single crystal orientations. In addition to experimental investigations, three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (3 D DDD) simulations (Fig. 1 (d)) were carried out for comparison. The results provide relevant insights on the role of nanoparticles on the onset of plastic deformation in single crystals as well as twinning nucleation in Mg nanocomposites...|$|E

The remnant contribution to activation energy is attributed to ion-association.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals in}} detail the {{influence}} of solvent dynamics and solvation on ion transport in succinonitrile based <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> electrolytes. The main objective of correlating plastic solvent characteristics with ion transport was achieved by probing the electrolyte using characterization techniques at various length and time scales. Although majority of the results presented in this thesis focus on a prototype succinonitrile electrolyte (succinonitrile-lithium perchlorate, SN-LiClO 4), the conclusions drawn from the results on SN-LiClO 4 are quite general and can be extended to various types of salts as well as <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> matrices. Chapters 2 - 5 demonstrate in a systematic and detailed manner the beneficial influence of solvent dynamics on ion transport in the solid state. The thesis comprises of six chapters. A brief discussion of the contents and highlights of the individual chapters are described below: Chapter 1 briefly reviews the importance of various types of electrolytes for electrochemical applications. The chapter starts with a discussion on different types of liquid and solid crystalline electrolytes and their drawbacks in electrochemical devices such as lithium-ion batteries. Following the discussion on the two extremes of electrolytes viz. liquid and solid electrolytes, various soft matter electrolytes including polymer and <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> materials are discussed. Aims of the thesis are specified in chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> electrolytes as prospective electrolytes for electrochemical applications. In this chapter, we present a detailed study of correlation of ion transport with solvent structure and dynamics in lithium perchlorate (LiClO 4) -succinonitrile (SN), a prototype succinonitrile based <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> electrolyte. Significant influences of the salt on the crystallographic structure, trans-gauche isomerism and solvation properties of succinonitrile (SN) are observed. Ionic conductivity (ac-impedance spectroscopy) and single crystal X-ray studies (in-situ cryo crystallography) reveal the influence of configurational isomerism and ion solvation on ion transport in LiClO 4 -SN. We quantify the ion association using theoretical analysis of Fuoss-Onsager formalism for various LiX-SN (typically X = ClO 4 -, CF 3 SO 3 -, TFSI-) electrolytes. Thermal (differential scanning caloriemetry) and spectroscopic (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)) studies have also been discussed in the chapter to support our proposition. Chapter 3 describes our investigation on issues other than salt {{that are likely to}} affect ion transport in Li-salt-SN based <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> electrolytes such as water in sample and sample thermal history. We investigate here in a detailed manner the influence of water and thermal history on SN configurational isomerism and solvation in LiClO 4 -SN. LiClO 4 in SN electrolyte samples were prepared in various ways for the fulfillment of the objectives of the study of the present chapter. Correlation of water and thermal history on ion transport were studied via ac-impedance spectroscopy and room temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The ionic conductivity and infra-red findings were supplemented via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Chapter 4 presents dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) to study the various relaxation processes of the <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> solvent and ionic species responsible for ion-transport in succinonitrile-based electrolytes. For the DRS study, we select the same system i. e. SN-LiClO 4 for which the role of solvent dynamics and ion-association on ion transport was discussed in detail in chapter 2. We supplement the ionic conductivity and various spectroscopic investigations highlighted in chapter 2 via study of the frequency dependence of dielectric function. The permittivity data are further analyzed using Havriliak-Negami (HN) and Kohlrausch-Williams-Watta (KWW) functions for identification of various processes and also for detailed insight on the ion transport mechanism. Chapter 5 comprises of the temperature dependence the bulk acoustic phonons in SN and SN-LiX (X = ClO 4 -, CF 3 SO 3 -, TFSI-, Cl-) electrolytes from (200 - 300) K. Room temperature Brillouin spectra of SN based <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> electrolytes with different cationic salts (MClO 4 -, M = Li+, Na+, Rb+) were also measured. The influences of salt concentration and temperature on solvent dynamics and ion-association effect have been investigated in detail for the SN-LiClO 4 electrolyte. The Brillouin data were further analyzed using Lorentzian and Fano resonance function for identification of behavior of various Brillouin modes. An attempt was made to understand ion transport mechanism in SN-LiX <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> electrolytes based on the concept of molecular liquids as opposed to conventional solid state defect chemistry. The chapter also discusses preliminary results on the relaxational dynamics of SN and SN-LiClO 4 in the plastic phase examined using quasi elastic neutron scattering (QENS) facility at ILL-Grenoble IN 16 beamline. Chapter 6 provides a brief summary of the work presented in the thesis and discusses how knowledge from the present work (chapters 2 - 5) can be utilized to generate new electrolytes. The system proposed is a liquid electrolyte based on bis-nitrile (G 0 -CN) which does not possess majority of the detrimental issues associate with conventional liquids and various improvisations of polymer electrolytes. We also show that the various dendrimer generations obtained from the monomer bis-nitrile (G 0 -CN) can also be utilized as an alternative solvent for generation of liquid electrolytes for electrochemical devices such as (primary/secondary) batteries. In a way, we discuss a novel liquid electrolyte system whose physical (viscosity, dielectric constant) and solvation properties can be tuned easily to fulfill task of specific objectives. The preliminary ionic conductivity, viscosity and electrochemical studies of the Gn-CN-Li-salt (n= 0 - 2) liquid electrolytes show considerable promise. Though the prospective dendrimer solvent is a liquid, we envisage that in future compounds with similar chemical properties can also be synthesized in the soft matter state...|$|R

The parameters of the a-relaxation fit the Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) equation. ESR spin-probe {{studies of the}} glassy crystalline phase of cyclohexanol {{show that there is}} a marked decrease in the correlation time above the glasslike transition temperature.

40|$|In simple <b>crystalline</b> materials, <b>plastic</b> {{deformation}} mostly {{takes place}} by the movement of dislocations. Although the underlying mechanisms in these materials are well explored, in complex metallic alloys [...] crystalline solids containing up to thousands of atoms per unit cell [...] the defects and deformation mechanisms remain essentially unknown. Owing to the large lattice parameters of these materials, extended dislocation concepts are required. We investigated a typical complex metallic alloy with 156 atoms per unit cell using atomic-resolution aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. We found a highly complex deformation mechanism, based on the movement of a dislocation core mediating strain and separate escort defects. On deformation, the escort defects move along with the dislocation core and locally transform the material structure for the latter. This mechanism implies the coordinated movement of hundreds of atoms per elementary glide step, and nevertheless can be described by simple rearrangement of basic structural subunits...|$|R
40|$|The salt lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) when {{dissolved}} in plastic crystal succinonitrile {{has been demonstrated}} to have particularly good conductivity even at room temperature. In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements have previously proved invaluable in interpreting the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) behavior, but the practical lower temperature limit of approximately 2 ̆ 21245 0 C was higher than the 2 ̆ 212100 0 C starting temperature of the DSC measurements, and the important <b>crystalline</b> to <b>plastic</b> crystal transition of succinonitrile. An improved cryo-flow system capable of capillary sample temperatures down to 2 ̆ 212192 0 C without icing can now easily match the DSC conditions. The previously puzzling DSC behavior of the succinonitrile 2 ̆ 013 LiTFSI phase diagram at low temperatures has now been explained, with a surprising formation of a TFSI-rich adduct on heating from 2 ̆ 212100 0 C even at concentrations as low as 2 mol...|$|R
40|$|Imidazolium methanesulfonate (1) {{has been}} studied as a model proton {{conductor}} for high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). It is found that 1 undergoes transformation from <b>crystalline</b> to <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> and then molten states successively from ambient temperature to 200 °C. The solid–solid phase transition of 1 at 174 °C has been preliminarily verified by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (XRD). At the melting point of 188 °C, 1 displays a low entropy of fusion of around 24 J mol− 1 K− 1. In particular, a high ionic conductivity of 1. 0 × 10 − 2 S cm− 1 is reached at 185 °C in the plastic phase. The activation energy for ionic conduction decreases as 1 is heated from the crystal phase to the melt phase. In the molten state, the contribution of protons to the ionic conductivity of 1 was corroborated electrochemically. In addition, 1 is electrochemically active for H 2 oxidation and O 2 reduction at a Pt electrode while it shows a high electrochemical window of 2. 0 V. Furthermore, a Nafion® membrane has been successfully doped with 1, as identified by infrared spectroscopy, powder XRD, grazing incidence XRD and thermogravimetric analysis. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this may be the first report on a protic organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) consisting of protonated imidazole (C 3 H 5 N 2 +) and an organic anion. The good thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, favorable plastic crystal behavior and simple synthesis make 1 a highly interesting model proton conductor for high temperature PEMFCs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{thorough}} dielectric {{investigation of the}} relaxation dynamics of <b>plastic</b> <b>crystalline</b> Freon 112, which exhibits freezing of the orientational degrees of freedom into a glassy crystal below 90 K. Among other plastic crystals, Freon 112 stands out by being relatively fragile within Angell's classification scheme and by showing an unusually strong β-relaxation. Comparing the results to those on Freon 112 a, having only a single molecular conformation, points {{to the importance of}} the presence of two molecular conformations in Freon 112 for the explanation of its unusual properties.
