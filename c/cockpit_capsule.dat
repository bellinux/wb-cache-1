50|$|The {{first major}} {{development}} was the hard composite <b>cockpit</b> <b>capsule</b> designed {{to break away}} {{from the rest of the}} boat in a crash. This also inaugurated the practice of securing the drivers to their seats with a harness. First developed by designer and racer Chris Hodges, this system was optional for a time due to the opposition of the drivers but, after it saved several drivers in major crashes, the UIM mandated it for all boats. In the early 1990s F1 boat builder Dave Burgess introduced a canopy that fully enclosed the cockpit to protect the driver from the full force of water in a nose-dive. In the late 1990s boat builder DAC introduced an airbag situated behind the driver that prevents the cockpit from completely submerging if the boat flips.|$|E
50|$|Stevens is unwillingly {{sent back}} into the Source Code {{repeatedly}} in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times, he cannot locate or disarm the bomb on time and dies on the train. Rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real. Later, Stevens learns {{that he has been}} with them for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan; in real life he is comatose, having lost most of his body, and on life support while hooked up to neural sensors. The <b>cockpit</b> <b>capsule</b> is his brain's way of making sense of a missing environment. Angry to learn that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission. Rutledge agrees.|$|E
5000|$|Black Bomber's second suit. This time it {{features}} a <b>capsule</b> <b>cockpit</b> like the other suits. Has high re-loading capabilities coupled with powerful rapid-fire shots. Was destroyed by the Dark Prince's Blizzard Dragon suit after the Four Dark Lords were all defeated by the other bombers. Black Cluster is stronger than the other bombers. Its main attack is the [...] "Cluster Cannon". It first appeared in episode 19.|$|R
5000|$|Black Bomber's initial suit {{is one of}} {{the older}} designs and does not have much {{capabilities}} except that it can fire a gattling of Beda shots (called the [...] "Gatling Shot") that hit opponents' armours. While this is effective against the minion suits, it is proven useless against the suits of the Four Dark Lords themselves. It was destroyed by Draken's Hogane Dragon when it fired at the gattling part of the suit. Note that this suit does not have a <b>capsule</b> <b>cockpit</b> system unlike the rest of them in the first set.|$|R
