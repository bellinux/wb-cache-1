25|$|At {{a general}} {{meeting of the}} commanders of Indonesia's Armed Forces (ABRI) on 27 March 1980, President Suharto said that ABRI had promised to commit itself to not {{amending}} the Indonesian state philosophy of Pancasila or the 1945 Constitution. He went on to say, that as a socio-political force, ABRI had to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> political partners that had proved their desire to maintain Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution, because there were socio-political forces who had their doubts about them.

25|$|In an {{interview}} for Segno Cinema magazine, Barboni explained that during the two weeks of shooting at the Elios Film set, filming was made problematic by the low amount of available sunlight. Grey and heavy clouds covered the sky nearly permanently, making it extremely difficult for the crew to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> light. Many scenes {{turned out to be}} underexposed, but the type of film negative that was used permitted this, and the crew was enthusiastic about the visual effects created. Deodato believes {{that as a result of}} the limitations imposed by the cold weather and the low budget, as well as the craftsmanship of production members such as costumer Marcella De Marchis (the wife of Roberto Rossellini), the film has a neorealistic aesthetic comparable to the works of Rossellini and Gualtiero Jacopetti. Nero has noted that Corbucci displayed a keen sense of black humour throughout production, which once resulted in the director and his crew abandoning Nero during the shooting of the film's opening titles as a joke.|$|E

25|$|At this stage, {{the story}} splits off in {{numerous}} possibilities, {{based on the}} player's choices. The narrator continues the story, but when the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action, forcing the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path or create a new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors, with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door; the player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> door, which makes the narrator annoyed and causes him to pressure the player {{to return to the}} 'proper' path. Because of this, much of the story is considered thought-provoking about the nature of choice and decisions. The narration also breaks the fourth wall on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Washington Post writer Bob Woodward {{reported}} that Hillary Clinton {{had been having}} [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with Eleanor Roosevelt {{from the start of}} Clinton's time as First Lady. Following the Democrats' loss of congressional control in the 1994 elections, Clinton had engaged the services of Human Potential Movement proponent Jean Houston. Houston encouraged Clinton to pursue the Roosevelt connection, and while no psychic techniques were used with Clinton, critics and comics immediately suggested that Clinton was holding s√©ances with Roosevelt. The White House stated that this was merely a brainstorming exercise, and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations, with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible. In her 2003 autobiography Living History, Clinton titled an entire chapter [...] "Conversations with Eleanor", and stated that holding [...] "imaginary conversations [...] actually a useful mental exercise to help analyze problems, provided you <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> person to visualize. Eleanor Roosevelt was ideal." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E

[...] There are numerous other species of Bryoria that look very similar to wila, but that are bitter and mildly toxic. [...] As well, there are some specimens of wila that contain toxic levels of vulpinic acid. [...] Most people that traditionally harvest wila have figured out ways to make sure that they are collecting the right lichen. [...] The species of tree on which the lichen is growing and the general location of that tree are both thought to be important factors for deciding if it is the right type of lichen to eat, but not everyone agrees on which locations and tree species are better. [...] Many people taste the lichen first to make sure that it isn't bitter, and some people choose the lichens that are darker coloured.|$|E
2500|$|Fors Clavigera: Ruskin {{gave this}} title {{to a series}} of letters he wrote [...] "to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain" [...] (1871‚Äì84). The name was {{intended}} to signify three great powers which go to fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: Force, symbolised by the club (clava) of Hercules; Fortitude, symbolised by the key (clavis) of Ulysses; and Fortune, symbolised by the nail (clavus) of Lycurgus. These three powers (the [...] "fors") together represent human talents and abilities to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from Shakespeare's phrase [...] "There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune" [...] (Brutus in Julius Caesar). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.|$|E

2500|$|Many sources {{place the}} South Beach Diet on lists of [...] "low carb" [...] diets {{such as the}} Atkins Diet.

2500|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} is {{breaking into the}} healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer. There is {{a great amount of}} research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> drugs for the patients. Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called [...] "Hanover". Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient. One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia, a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers. Another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.|$|E

[...] " [...] Executive producers Chibnall and Featherstone and producer Richard Stokes held extensive discussions with the casting directors, who then generated lists of potential actors to whom the producers might wish to offer roles or ask to audition. The casting directors also read all the finished scripts, met with location scouts to see photographs of the anticipated location shoots, and had long discussions with various production department heads to gather as much information as possible so they could <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> performers to audition. A key rule for the casting team was [...] "no wankers allowed", as Featherstone put it. The production team refused to consider egotistical, obnoxious, vain, temperamental, or arrogant actors for roles, as they felt it made it difficult for both cast and crew to do their best work.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, new Bayern manager Jupp Heynckes stated Tymoshchuk {{would play}} more under his coaching. Tymoshchuk {{was given a}} chance to start in matches at the time the team was plagued with injuries, filling in at central defence. He started in central defence {{alongside}} J√©r√¥me Boateng in the Champions League final in Munich, which Bayern lost to Chelsea on penalties. Before the final, Heynckes said, [...] "Tymoshchuk is a great team player. He's really important for us, and in situation, when three players are disqualified, his experience and ability to play in different positions is really useful for us." [...] Because Tymoshchuk played a bigger role under Heynckes than under Van Gaal, he became {{an important part of the}} team. Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said of Tymoshchuk, [...] "For me the main job ‚Äì not to let goals in. As a result, I love partners who have the same job.

2500|$|Ben Mepham, bioethicist {{and fellow}} of the Royal Society of Biology, in his review of Francione and Garner's book The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation?, concludes about the vegan {{philosophy}} that [...] "if the aim of ethics is to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> or best, course of action in specific circumstances ‚Äòall things considered‚Äô, it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self-contradictions. Or, as Farlie puts it, with characteristic panache: ‚Äòto conclude that veganism is the ‚Äòonly ethical response‚Äô {{is to take a}} big leap into a very muddy pond‚Äô." [...] He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals; the imbalance between the resources that are used to promote the welfare of animals as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition, abuse and exploitation; the focus on attitudes and conditions in western developed countries, leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy, culture and, in some cases, survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals.|$|E
2500|$|The Penguin Social History of Britain {{noted that}} [...] "by the 1920s {{newspapers}} {{were filled with}} advertisements for 'lingerie' and 'undies' {{which would have been}} classed as indecent a generation earlier". Thus, in Ben Travers' comic novel Rookery Nook (1923), a young woman evicted from home in her nightwear and requiring day clothes remarked, [...] "Combies. That's all right. But in the summer you know, we don't ...", while in Agatha Christie's thriller, The Seven Dials Mystery (1929), the aristocratic heroine, Lady [...] "Bundle" [...] Brent, wore only [...] "a negligible trifle" [...] under her dress; like many real life [...] "it girls" [...] of her class, she had been freed from the [...] "genteel expectations" [...] of earlier generations. In Hollywood the actress Carole Lombard, who, in the 1930s, combined feistiness with sexual allure, never wore a brassi√®re and [...] "avoided panties". However, she famously declared that though [...] "I live by a man's code designed to fit a man's world ... at the same time I never forget that a woman's first job is to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> shade of lipstick" [...] Coincidentally, sales of men's undershirts fell dramatically in the United States when Lombard's future husband, Clark Gable, was revealed not to be wearing one in a famous motel bedroom scene with Claudette Colbert in the film It Happened One Night (1934). According to Gable, [...] "the idea was looking half-naked and scaring the brat into her own bed {{on the other side of}} the blanket [...] ". However, he [...] "gave the impression that going without was a vital sign of a man's virility" [...] More generally, the adoption by the American movie industry of the Hays Production Code in the early 1930s had a significant effect on how moral, and especially sexual, issues were depicted on film. This included a more conservative approach to matters of dress. Whereas the sort of scanty lingerie on show in some earlier productions (for example, Joan Blondell and Barbara Stanwyck in Night Nurse, 1931) had tended to reflect trends that, in the 1920s, defied convention and were regarded many young women as liberating, by the early years of the Depression such displays came to be regarded quite widely as undesirable. Developments in the late 1960s and 70s, when the strictures of the code were abandoned, followed a similar pattern, although, by then, it was often women themselves who were in the vanguard of resistance to sexualised imagery.|$|E
