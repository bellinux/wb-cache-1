50|$|Canada {{formerly}} used a US-style ACTS <b>coin</b> <b>phone</b> {{system with}} a tone pair which would beep once for a nickel, twice for a dime and five times on receiving a quarter. These phones did not accept $1 coins (or the later $2 coin) and disappeared with the roll-out of Nortel Millennium payphones in the 1990s. The Millennium sets do not use ACTS in-band signalling tones as all coin-handling is automated in the phone itself.|$|E
50|$|Late in the 20th century, caller ID and prepaid {{cellphone}} service became commonplace. These services {{being more}} easily exploited for criminal purposes, {{this type of}} abuse of payphones faded from concern. In Canada, this behaviour has always been more difficult. As a matter of course, incoming calls to payphones are disabled; furthermore, the Bell ANAC number is also disabled (although the telephone number is marked on the payphone itself as it is needed to report a non-working <b>coin</b> <b>phone</b> to 6-1-1 repair service).|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} less {{efficient}} for <b>coin</b> <b>phones,</b> which need special signalling. In urban areas, they were served by older exchanges that had separate junctors for <b>coin</b> <b>phones.</b> Where the 5XB {{was the only}} exchange, a number of work-around methods were devised. Regular and <b>coin</b> <b>phones</b> shared the more complex and expensive coin trunks, or else separate routes were established, or coin trunks connected via tandem switches including the 5XB itself acting as its own tandem. In this last case, the call had to use two connections through the switching fabric: one to connect the line to the coin supervision trunk and another to connect that trunk to the outgoing trunk.|$|R
5000|$|Feature Group C: Rare, {{originally}} used by AT&T for operator-assisted <b>coin</b> <b>phones</b> {{since they}} allow the operator {{to keep control}} of the caller's telephone line until the transaction is completed. As coin-handling for trunk calls is now automated within the phone (like a COCOT, {{the current generation of}} <b>coin</b> <b>phones</b> operates self-contained without the central exchange providing coin-call support functions), group 'C' is largely obsolete.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, COCOTs {{were only}} {{introduced}} long after ACTS {{had been replaced}} with the self-contained Millennium-style <b>coin</b> <b>phones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Development {{and use of}} {{the blue}} box was largely enabled by Bell Telephone's policy of {{publishing}} all technical documentation regarding its equipment. In response to the development of this and other means of telephone hacking, the company began to develop other means of securing its system, without publicly disclosing the details. These included modifying telephone central offices to listen for the 2600 Hz tone coming from a subscriber telephone. This, plus the investigation and prosecution of several hackers by the FBI, led to a decrease in phone phreaking and displaced much of the remaining activity to <b>coin</b> <b>phones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nickel is a {{cheap and}} widely {{available}} core metal. Today, {{it can be}} found in a wide variety of items including jewelry, zippers, buttons, belt buckles, <b>coins,</b> cell <b>phones,</b> tablets, surgical implants, and certain foods.|$|R
5000|$|LCM have smaller line cards, serving 64 lines per {{drawer of}} the same size as in the LM. An LCM require only half the space as an LM for the same number of lines. The {{majority}} of line cards are NT6X17, with three relays for loop start lines. Others include NT6X18 which have four or more relays and a slide switch for ground start lines (a newer version of the NT6X18 has eliminated the ground switch). The NT6X18 also has the ability to provide current reversal required for some <b>coin</b> <b>phones</b> and business systems. The NT6X17BA and the NT6X18BA is known as the world line card and is software configurable to more than 15 million functional settings to meet almost any signalling and transmission requirement in any market.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, despite the Occupation, {{commercial}} activities began to flourish {{and demand for}} telecommunications services increased greatly. This necessitated a third floor to be built at the telephone exchange building in Kuala Lumpur. Along {{with the issue of}} 10 cent <b>coins,</b> <b>phone</b> booths began to spring up in Kuala Lumpur and Penang. From 1950 to 1953, the Department’s revenue more than doubled from $8 million to $17 million as the number of telephones installed rose from 20,000 to 39,000. Accordingly, the trunk and junction networks expanded, and the number of radio stations grew by 10 times to more than 1,000. In 1953, too, the Penang Auto Exchange was opened catering for 5,000 lines. In 1954, the Main Trunk Route linking Singapore to Malacca, Kuala Lumpur and Penang was completed. Satellite exchanges began to emerge. During this period, international connections have also increased, linking Malaysia {{with the rest of the}} world.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, once most phone {{subscribers}} had direct long-distance dialing, {{a single}} type of operator began to serve both {{the local and}} long distance functions. A customer might call to request a collect call, a call billed to a third number, or a person-to-person call. All toll calls from <b>coin</b> <b>phones</b> required operator assistance. The operator was also available to help complete a local or long-distance number which did not complete. For example, if a customer encountered a reorder tone (a fast busy signal), it could indicate [...] "all circuits busy," [...] or {{a problem in the}} destination exchange. The operator might be able to use a different routing to complete the call. If the operator could not get through by dialing the number, she could call the inward operator in the destination city, and ask her to try the number, or to test a line {{to see if it was}} busy or out of order.|$|R
50|$|On Platform 1, door 12 is {{closest to}} the elevator, and on Platform 2, door 9 {{is closest to}} the elevator. There is one wicket. That station has a handicapped-accessible {{bathroom}} with a baby changing area, a <b>coin</b> locker, public <b>phones,</b> and ticket machines.|$|R
50|$|A red box is a {{phreaking}} {{device that}} generates tones to simulate inserting <b>coins</b> in pay <b>phones,</b> thus fooling the system into completing free calls. In the United States, a nickel {{is represented by}} one tone, a dime by two, and a quarter {{by a set of}} 5 tones. Any device capable of playing back recorded sounds can potentially be used as a red box. Commonly used devices include modified Radio Shack tone dialers, personal MP3 players, and audio-recording greeting cards.|$|R
50|$|Communicating {{with the}} outside world was {{challenging}} in an era before computers, cell phones, and fax machines, especially when HEW officials ordered the office phone lines to be turned off. The building’s few pay phones quickly filled will <b>coins</b> as the <b>phone</b> company stopped coming to collect them. The occupiers became resourceful. In addition to unfurling banners out the windows, they used Deaf people inside the building to transmit messages in sign language through windows on the fourth floor to other interpreters outside on the street below. They used this way press releases got out into the public and occupiers got news of the outside world.|$|R
50|$|He {{was signed}} by {{defending}} Premier League champions Manchester United in July 2001 for an undisclosed fee believed to be £2.5 million. Carroll faced stiff competition against Fabien Barthez at United but won a Premier League winners' medal in the 2002-03 season. Carroll received yet more competition for the 2003-04 season, when Manchester United signed American goalkeeper Tim Howard after Barthez left to join Marseille. He won an FA Cup winners' medal in May 2004 when he came on as substitute for Howard in the 84th minute. On 19 February 2005, in an FA Cup match against Everton, Carroll was struck {{on the back of}} the head by any of various projectiles including <b>coins</b> and mobile <b>phones,</b> in a match high on security for teammate and Everton returnee Wayne Rooney which Manchester United won 2-0.|$|R
40|$|The names used in most {{languages}} for {{the letters}} of the Latin alphabet and for the sounds these represent are marked by a striking lack of distinctiveness that often makes them fail their purpose. When this is likely to happen, speakers tend to use one of various auxiliary "spelling alphabets" instead. Such a need does not arise with the longer and more distinctive letter names of Semitic descent that are used for the Arabic, Hebrew, Armenian and Greek alphabets. Short and yet distinctive names for consonants can, however, be coined with a minimum of arbitrariness by exploiting the coarticulatory effects of consonants on vowels, and their reflections in perception. These are analyzed for schwa-like vowels in the permissive vowel systems of NW-Caucasian and Mandarin Chinese, and it is shown how they can be utilized to <b>coin</b> names for <b>phones</b> and letters, especially for Turkish...|$|R
5000|$|At 26 years old, Seda was an {{unemployed}} high school drop out, {{living with his}} mother and half-sister. He had been a good high school student, but was expelled after bringing a starter pistol to school. He had dropped out rather than attend mandatory counseling sessions to be readmitted to school. He was unemployed and supported by his mother, but obtained money by stealing <b>coins</b> from pay <b>phones</b> and vending machines. Seda was mentally and physically abusive to his teenage half-sister, Gladys [...] "Chachi" [...] Reyes. During a confrontation with her and her boyfriend on June 18, 1996, Seda pulled out a weapon and began threatening the couple. While Reyes' boyfriend hid in the bedroom, she tried to escape through the front door, but Seda shot her in the buttocks. Wounded but not incapacitated, she made her way to her neighbor’s apartment where she called the police.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, Telesp inaugurated {{the first}} {{community}} telephone in the Vila Prudente favela, a public telephone that received calls. The population grew stronger and stronger with the Orelhão, who made communication {{possible from the}} most distant and even unlikely places. A print advertisement in 1984 brought images of Orelhões in different geographic settings of Brazil: on the beach, in the mountains, in the typically rural area, {{on the side of}} a road. And the text emphasized, as follows, the companion character of the Orelhão: [...] "Telesp always puts a friendly little ear near you. On the coast, in the estancias, on the roads, on the outskirts of São Paulo, in the streets, squares and avenues, you always find a friendly little ear to listen to you: Telesp's Orelhões." [...] But to enjoy the service it was necessary to have some <b>phone</b> <b>coins</b> in your pocket. These coins would be replaced by phone cards in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood {{is walking}} through the forest with a basket of goodies for her Grandma. She {{opens the door and}} calls to her grandmother, but she discovers that there is a note pinned to her pillow. The note reads, [...] "Dear Red: Got tired of waiting. Have gone to Three Bears' house to eat up Little Goldilocks. Love, the Wolf". Red {{immediately}} goes to the telephone and starts dialing. As sleepy little Golilocks (presumably from eating 3 big bowls of porridge) is climbing the stairs, the phone rings. She runs back down stairs and answers the phone. It's Red calling to warn her about the Wolf. She passes the note to Goldilocks over the split frame and as she finishes reading the note, she shakes Red's hand and says, [...] "Gee, thanks a lot! See ya later!" [...] hangs up the phone and checks the <b>phone's</b> <b>coin</b> return slot for any loose change.|$|R
2500|$|Kevin Lonergan at Information Age, a business-technology magazine, has {{referred}} to the terms surrounding IoT as a “terminology zoo”. The lack of clear terminology is not “useful from a practical point of view” and a “source of confusion for the end user”. A company operating in the IoT space could be working in anything related to sensor technology, networking, embedded systems, or analytics. According to Lonergan, the term IoT was <b>coined</b> before smart <b>phones,</b> tablets, and devices {{as we know them}} today existed, and there is a long list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological convergence: Internet of things, Internet of everything (IoE), industrial Internet, pervasive computing, pervasive sensing, ubiquitous computing, cyber-physical systems (CPS), wireless sensor networks (WSN), smart objects, cooperating objects, machine to machine (M2M), ambient intelligence (AmI), operational technology (OT), and information technology (IT). Regarding IIoT, an industrial sub-field of IoT, the Industrial Internet Consortium's Vocabulary Task Group has created a [...] "common and reusable vocabulary of terms" [...] to ensure [...] "consistent terminology" [...] across publications issued by the Industrial Internet Consortium. IoT One has created an IoT Terms Database including a New Term Alert to be notified when a new term is published. As of March 2017, this database aggregates 711 IoT-related terms, however, without any attempts to reduce terminological ambiguity and complexity.|$|R
2500|$|Chrétien's key {{campaign}} man was Jim Karygiannis {{who became}} a living legend within the Liberal Party due to his ruthlessness. Chrétien told Lavelle that what he wanted was [...] "A tough guy. A guy who could go on a search-and-destroy mission, who could do a kamikaze raid for our side", and decided that Karygiannis was that man. At a meeting to select Liberal delegates for the Kitchener-Waterloo riding, Martin's supporters attempted to call on the pay phones as many potential Martin supporters as possible {{to come to the}} meeting, which led Karygiannis to put chewed gum into all of the pay <b>phone</b> <b>coin</b> slots, and thereby won Kitchener-Waterloo for Chrétien. At another delegate selection meeting, Karygiannis verbally attacked a pro-Martin Liberal official with such rage that the man was hospitalized for angina. Karygiannis specialised in signing up immigrants to serve as delegates for Chrétien, and personally signed 9,500 immigrants as Chrétien delegates between January and June 1990, leading one pro-Martin official to lament that [...] "We were getting Greeked. And if we weren't getting Greeked, we were getting Sikhed". Karygiannis later boasted in an interview that [...] "I signed up anything that moved". Chrétien is said to have praised Karygiannis with the remark [...] "Whatever it takes to win, Jimmy, whatever it takes to win". In large part because of Karygiannis and his team, by late April 1990 Chrétien had signed up 1,500 delegates to Martin's 500 delegates, making him the clear front-runner.|$|R
