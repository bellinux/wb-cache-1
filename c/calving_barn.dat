Pervais put more than $2 {{million of his}} own money into the new company, originally housed in a remodeled <b>calving</b> <b>barn</b> on his ranch. Pervais and partner Don Golbeck bought a license to a process developed by metallurgist inventor and chemical engineer C.A. Dickey to refine precious group metals from automotive catalytic converters, a process they used to retrieve a number of materials, including fine sand for the asphalt industry and platinum, palladium and rhodium compounds to sell to refiners.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{ownership}} Bixby planted {{thousands of}} trees in the home valley around the Spade Ranch and installed airstrips for the ranch airplanes. In addition to reviving the Spade Ranch, Lawrence Bixby also returned the Richards Home in Ellsworth, Nebraska to noteworthy status. Since {{the time of the}} Richards ownership, the house had been divided into apartments and was in disrepair. In 1953-1954, Lawrence and wife Eleanor moved to the Ellsworth house after it was rehabilitated. [...] In 1965 the ranch headquarters included the large 1889 Comstock-Bixby house where Lawrence's son Jim and family lived, another residence built in 1952 for Lawrence's other son Larry and family, three large bunkhouses, the 1879 log cookhouse, large 1889 horse barn, cattle dipping vat, livestock scales, feed yards, large corrals for working with cattle and breaking horses, <b>calving</b> <b>barns,</b> 1895 blacksmith shop, cattle feed storage facilities, a machine shop and a large three aircraft hangar. Starting in the early 1950s Lawrence served as a high-ranking officer in the Nebraska Stock Growers Association, the Nebraska Beef Council and as president of the Nebraska Flying Farmers and Ranchers Association. In 1954, Bixby donated $60,000 ($473,460.44 current USD) to help pave Nebraska Highway 27 from Ellsworth to Gordon, which passed by the ranch.|$|R
40|$|During {{the month}} of November there {{occurred}} an outbreak of pneumonia among the calves in a large dairy. Thirty-two <b>calves</b> in one <b>barn</b> {{were exposed to the}} disease. Ten clinical cases developed. Two died of diffuse pneumonia. From these bovisepticus Group I organisms were obtained at autopsy. Four affected with pneumonia and eight other calves which failed to show symptoms of pneumonia developed a purulent rhinitis. From the nasal exudate of these cases Group I organisms were cultivated. The characteristic rhinitis was reproduced experimentally by brushing the nasal mucosa with a swab dipped in culture. Certain of the calves which suffered from the spontaneous rhinitis continued to carry the organisms in the nasal passages for periods as long as 121 days. After the first outbreak had subsided practically all calves introduced into this barn developed a milder type of rhinitis associated with organisms of Group II bovisepticus. 25 per cent of such calves continued to carry the organism on the nasal mucosa for periods of 50 to 73 days. It was possible to induce nasal infection in calves with pure cultures of this organism...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidium parvum is a {{zoonotic}} protozoan parasite commonly infecting dairy calves {{less than}} 30 days old. Infected animals display symptoms of diarrhea and shed approximately 107 oocysts / gram of feces. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine if there is an association between observed fecal score and oocyst shedding. A double-blinded, randomized trial was conducted using Holstein dairy calves. One of the study personnel was present at all births to transport <b>calves</b> to isolation <b>barns</b> where they were housed for 42 feedings (21 d). Calves received 4 L of colostrum during their first 12 hours of life and were inoculated with 1. 0 x 106 oocysts of C. parvum 1 - 3 hours after the second feeding. Fifty three calves were enrolled in the study (four lost to follow up) and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (group 1, n= 25; group 2, n= 24) of a proprietary prophylactic. Each treatment group was analyzed independently. Fecal scores were assigned at each feeding on a scale of 1 to 4, with the higher number indicating increased severity of diarrhea. Fecal samples were collected once daily and analyzed for the presence of C. parvum oocysts using the Merifluor Crypto/Giardia immunofluorescence antibody assay. Normal excretion patterns of C. parvum were observed and results showed that both treatment groups had a statically significant relationship between the number of oocysts shed in normal feces versus diarrhea. There was no statistical difference in either group for the number of oocysts shed in mild versus severe diarrhea, although the mean number of oocysts shed was increased...|$|R

The property includes 13 contributing buildings and 1 contributing structure. They include three houses built between 1790 and 1827, the John and Catherina Siegfried Bank barn (1819, 1905), <b>calving</b> <b>barn</b> (c. 1900), two small barns (c. 1860 and c. 1900), corn crib, Henry Siegfried Bank barn (mid-19th century), spring and rendering house (c. 1790 and c. 1880), one-story brick school house (1906), smokehouse (c. 1820), and carriage house (c. 1880). The John and Catherina Siegfried house (1790) is a -story, four-bay, rubble stone house with a slate gable roof. The Henry Siegfried house (1827) is a -story, five-bay, rubble stone house in the Georgian style. The Johannes Siegfried house (1790) is a -story, four-bay, sided rubble stone dwelling with a three-bay Victorian porch. Moravian settler Johannes Siegfried acquired the property in 1732. The property remained in the Siegfried family until shortly before it was acquired in 1971 by The Rodale Institute.|$|E
40|$|Calf is {{the most}} {{important}} animal on the farm. Calf rearing should be given due attention as many problems and ailments in the herd as a whole have their origins in calves. The right choice of technology o f rearing can be crucial to the economy of the entire breed. Quality of calf housing is reflected in the overall level of rearing cattle in this category. It has {{a significant impact on the}} overall w ellbeing of animals, zoohygienic conditions and health situation. The aim of this thesis was to compare methods of rearing calves in individual outdoor sheds, where the calves were fed twice daily, with group housing in a spacious <b>calving</b> <b>barn</b> with multip le feeding through a feeding machine. We looked at weight gain, hea lth and welfare of the animals. The thesis was dealt with at a private farm of Václav Duba in Boubín near the town of Horažďovice. The experiment was conducted simultaneously in both systems of calf housing in the time period between May 1 2013 and October 14 2013. Both the observed groups of calves were fed the same amount of milk replacer, only with different frequency of intake. Both groups had the same number of 30 calves (15 heifers and 15 bulls) of Czech pied cattle. After completion of the milk feeding period the average weight of the calves in individual sheds was 107. 2 kg and 110. 8 kg in the <b>calving</b> <b>barn.</b> The calves which were fed by a feeding machine had an average daily weight gain of 0. 787 kg; the calves in individual sheds had lower weight gain of 0. 743 kg. The average consumption of milk replacer for calves in the individual sheds was 521. 7 litres and for calves in the <b>calving</b> <b>barn</b> it was 516. 8 litres. This indicator has been pro ven to have high statistical significance (P 0. 001). The a verage daily temperature in the individual sheds was 19. 7 °C; in t he <b>calving</b> <b>barn</b> it was 17. 9 °C. A diarrheal disease was reported in four animals in the individual sheds, and in six animals in the <b>calving</b> <b>barn.</b> In calves reared in the individual shed mutual sucking of muzzle was found immediately after drinking. In calves fed using a feeding machine there was no sign of unsatisfied sucking reflex...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine barning conditions of dairy farms registered to Cattle Breeders Association (CBA) Ödemiş district of İzmir. The 92 farms were selected among members of the CBA by proportional sampling method. The farms were divided into three groups according to the number of cattle: group 1 from 5 to 20, group 2 from 21 to 40 and group 3 with over 41 heads, respectively. The farms were divided into three groups according to the number of cattle: 5 - 20; 21 - 40 and over 41 heads, respectively. The research results indicated that 76. 1 % of the barns were shed type, 15. 2 % were corral, 8. 7 % were completely closed-up. The flooring types of these barns were a mixed of concrete and soil (73. 9 %), concrete (19. 6 %) and soil (6. 5 %). The stocking density for group 1, 2 and 3 were 22. 2 m 2, 19. 5 m 2 and 18. 2 m 2 per cow, respectively. The barns had a range of full cattle capacity from 12. 5 m 2 to 15 m 2 per cow. But none of the farms surveyed did not use fully capacity of the barn. The present running capacity of farms were between 55 % and 80 %. It was observed that 19. 6 % of farms had a individual calf section, 82. 6 % had a night lighting at the barn, and 64. 1 % had a seperate concenrated feed store. All the farms were milked with milking machines. The percentage of farms with bucked milking machine was 47. 8 %, those with an air pipeline system was 37 % and those with parlour system was 15. 2 %. None of farms had manure pit. Consequently, as herd size grow, the presence of free <b>barn,</b> <b>calving</b> pen, feed store and milk cooling tank increase. It can be concluded that improving the housing conditions is much more related with increasing the herd size per farm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Proper calving {{management}} of dairy herds {{is a crucial}} aspect of the bovine life cycle, as it has profound effects on calf viability and on the post-partum course of the dam. The objectives {{of this study were}} to monitor the calving process {{through the use of a}} remote alarm system and to determine the impact of prompt emergency obstetric procedures in case of dystocia for the prevention of stillbirths and post-partum reproductive pathologies, and for improving herd fertility. Six groups of experimental animals were studied: monitored heifers (n[*]=[*] 60) and multiparous cows (n[*]=[*] 60) were compared with non-observed animals (n[*]=[*] 60 heifers and n[*]=[*] 60 multiparous) giving birth during the same time period and housed in the <b>calving</b> <b>barn,</b> and with unmonitored animals placed in a dry zone (n[*]=[*] 240 heifers and n[*]=[*] 112 multiparous cows).

40|$|Koekompas is an {{instrument}} to investigate risks on farms to prevent disease and to optimize the environment for the cows {{and the production of}} milk. The transition period is a hazardous period for cows for developing metabolic and/or infectious diseases. The following performance indicators (PI’s) are associated with transition cows: feed dry cows, water dry cows, body condition score (BSC), disease incidence of endometritis, retained fetal membranes, metabolic diseases and housing. Koekompas reports from 76 farms were collected and analyzed for trends in data and for relations between PI’s. From the current PI’s and reports one cannot get a complete impression about the transition cows, because the PI’s are not specifically split out for transition cows. The PI incidence of metabolic diseases included both ketosis and hypocalcemia although their pathogenesis and thus their preventive strategy differs. Also for housing <b>calving</b> <b>barn</b> and dry cow housing is not separately valued. In literature, housing, difference in cation-anion balance (DCAB) in dry cow feed and the specific BCS in the dry period were seen as PI. Further research which compares Koekompas results with the current situation on the farm in more detail is necessary...|$|E
