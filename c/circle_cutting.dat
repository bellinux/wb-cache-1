40|$|Circular {{pieces are}} often cut from {{stainless}} steel roll to make common commodities such as pots and cups. The related factories are often make-to-order ones. The stock rolls usually {{have the same}} width. Each working order requires pieces of the same size. Pieces of different sizes cannot appear in the same cutting pattern because the orders do not arrive simultaneously. The approach proposed in this paper assumes that the original roll can be slit into a strip and a partial roll. The strip is used to fulfill the current order. The partial roll {{will be used to}} fulfill future orders and cannot be slit further. The approach determines several standard widths for the partial rolls and uses a greedy procedure to select the roll (either the original roll or a partial roll) to fulfill the current order. The computational results indicate that the approach is efficient in improving material utilization. Cutting stock Two-dimensional cutting <b>Circle</b> <b>cutting</b> Stainless steel rolls...|$|E

Aim: (1) To compare surgical {{stainless steel}} staples and silk sutures for primary wound closure, with respect to presence/absence of wound infection and dehiscence (2) To compare the resultant scar following the two different methods of the closure at 3 rd month postoperatively {{with the help of}} visual analog scale and analyze the result statistically Design: This study was designed to compare skin closure using staples and silk sutures in patients undergoing neck dissection, using both methods in one-half of the same wound; thus each wound affording its own control. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on patients requiring collar line incision (high submandibular incision) with or without a cephalad extension of midline lower lip split incision for surgical access, who presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

5000|$|In geometry, Villarceau circles [...] are {{a pair of}} <b>circles</b> {{produced}} by <b>cutting</b> a torus obliquely through the center at a special angle.

The other two are Villarceau circles. They are named after the French astronomer and mathematician Yvon Villarceau (1813-1883). Mannheim (1903) showed that the Villarceau circles meet all of the parallel circular cross-sections of the torus at the same angle, a result that he said a Colonel Schoelcher had presented at a congress in 1891.|$|R

30|$|According to Koch [5], {{quality of}} peripheral-planed {{surfaces}} is generally improved by short wavelengths (or feed per knife) and low height of knife marks. This is generally accomplished {{by increasing the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>circle</b> diameter, number of jointed knives, or by reducing feed speed. Indeed, reduction in feed speed decreases the normal cutting force [5, 6] by reducing chip dimensions. Rake angle and jointing operation are also important factors influencing surface quality during planing process. For several species, better surface quality is observed as rake angle decreases from 30 ° to 15 ° [7 – 9], whereas the effect of jointing operation depends on wood species and knife wear [3, 10, 11]. On the other hand, Carrano et al. [6] reported an increase in surface quality when decreasing the depth of cut. However, Iskra and Hernández [12] found that surface quality is not affected by depth of cut during routing paper birch wood with different grain orientations. Difference between these two studies {{could be related to}} the efficiency of feeding systems used for conducting the experiments (vibrational effects).|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to find alternative materials for the cutting tools used in turning operations. The conventional materials like tungsten carbide(WC), titanium carbide(TiC), cubic boron nitride (CBN) and diamond used as cutting tools for turning operations on lathe are expensive. Titanium grade 5 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), SS 440 C/AISI 440 C and SS 316 {{are some of the}} materials which satisfy the necessary requirements for turning metals and polymer materials. These materials are machined as per the standard tool signature of high-speed steel tool (HSS) and are subjected to necessary heat treatment for hardening and then finish ground. The machined tools thus prepared were used to turn mild steel and aluminium workpieces. The cutting forces at play are determined using lathe tool dynamometer and plotted on a MCD (Merchant’s <b>Circle</b> Diagram). The <b>cutting</b> tools are also subjected to tests to determine tool life, wear and work hardening. It is found that the performance and tool life of SS 440 C is better and cost effective compared to existing tools. Even though Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is comparatively costly it could be used for obtaining good surface finish...|$|R

40|$|Our five senses {{ask for the}} {{reference}} of reference, which cannot be found in our causal material reality. We all have a subjective reality that {{is presented as a}} simultaneity sphere around our consciousness.

5000|$|Fire {{and water}} are {{considered}} to be polar opposite elements, classically and in alchemy and traditional magical practice. They are sometimes considered to be the two primordial elements, the combination of which gave rise to the other two elements of earth and air. Fire and water are also the elements most associated with Sun and Moon, and thus the Horned God and the Goddess within Wicca. For this reason, covens that associate the athame with air (and the wand with fire) may decide to use the wand to bless the wine chalice, instead of using the athame. A union of air and water does not carry the same symbolic significance of the [...] "conjunctio oppositorum" [...] (union of opposites) that the union of fire and water does. Also, covens that regard the athame as air and the wand as fire may choose to cast the ritual circle with the wand or staff, instead of the sword or athame—if they conceive of this casting in the traditional way, as a casting of etheric fire via a projection of psychic energy. If they conceive of the <b>circle</b> casting as <b>cutting</b> a line in the air with the tool of air, then they may choose to purify the circle with the remaining three elements of fire, water, and earth; this would involve using a candle to purify the circle, and omitting the incense, since the circle has already been imbued with the element of air.|$|R
