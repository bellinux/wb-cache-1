If a second VC were established, given high priority and reserved for VoIP, then a low priority data packet could be suspended in mid-transmission and a VoIP packet sent right away on the high priority VC. Then the link would pick up the low priority VC where it left off. Because ATM links are multiplexed on a <b>cell-by-cell</b> basis, a high priority packet {{would have to wait}} at most 53 byte times to begin transmission.

50|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{departure}} from AOL, Schuler found himself invited {{to invest in}} a start up Ablation Industries, Inc. Ablation Industries, Inc was commercializing (Ultrashort pulse laser) USP laser technology funded by the U.S. government’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA. When Mr Schuler invested in the company, the name of the company was changed to Raydiance, where he raised a significant amount of venture capital funding to help commercialize new technologies of national interest, among them ultrashort pulse lasers. A form of optoelectronics, the lasers emits short pulses of highly concentrated energy {{that can be used to}} break down atoms. In 2004, Schuler joined Raydiance Inc. to develop commercial applications for ultra-short pulse lasers.

50|$|This impulse spreads {{from its}} {{initiation}} in the SA node throughout the atria through specialized internodal pathways, to the atrial myocardial contractile cells and the atrioventricular node. The internodal pathways consist of three bands (anterior,middle, and posterior) that lead {{directly from the}} SA node to the next node in the conduction system, the atrioventricular node. The impulse takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel between these two nodes. The relative importance of this pathway has been debated since the impulse would reach the atrioventricular node simply following the <b>cell-by-cell</b> pathway through the contractile cells of the myocardium in the atria. In addition, there is a specialized pathway called Bachmann's bundle or the interatrial band that conducts the impulse directly from the right atrium to the left atrium. Regardless of the pathway, as the impulse reaches the atrioventricular septum, the connective tissue of the cardiac skeleton prevents the impulse from spreading into the myocardial cells in the ventricles except at the atrioventricular node. The electrical event, the wave of depolarization, is the trigger for muscular contraction. The wave of depolarization begins in the right atrium, and the impulse spreads across the superior portions of both atria and then down through the contractile cells. The contractile cells then begin contraction from the superior to the inferior portions of the atria, efficiently pumping blood into the ventricles.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{member of}} the genus, O. tauri, was {{discovered}} in 1994 in {{an investigation of the}} picoplankton in the Thau lagoon by Courties and Chretiennot-Dinet using flow cytometry. Unicellular photosynthetic organisms are generally amenable to study using flow cytometry because of the autofluorescence provided by chlorophyll and other fluorophores used by the cells for the harvesting and control of sunlight, which allows such pigments to be studied without any staining of the cells. The different pigments present can be distinguished and identified on a <b>cell-by-cell</b> basis using flow cytometry, allowing researchers to deduce the different species present in the sample and help classify any new species found. O. tauri was immediately placed in the class Prasinophyceae based on the presence of characteristic chlorophyll pigments and Chlorophyceae-related carotenoids as well as cell ultrastructure, and its position was later confirmed by analysis of its 18S rDNA. [...] Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on the 18SrDNA sequence led the definition of a new class, the Mamiellophyceae, that contains Ostreococcus species and placed them within the Bathycoccaceae family. Mamiellophyceae represent one of the ecologically most successful groups of eukaryotic, photosynthetic picoplankters in marine and likely also freshwater environments.Metagenomic [...] and metabarcoding [...] surveys revealed the presence of other members of the Ostreococcus genus in many oceanic regions.

5000|$|Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization (LAESI) is an ambient {{ionization}} method for mass spectrometry that combines laser ablation from a mid-infrared (mid-IR) laser with a secondary electrospray ionization (ESI) process. The mid-IR laser {{is used to}} generate gas phase particles which are then ionized through interactions with charged droplets from the ESI source. LAESI was developed by Professor Akos Vertes and Dr. Peter Nemes in 2007 and is now marketed commercially by Protea Biosciences, Inc. LAESI is a novel ionization source for mass spectrometry (MS) {{that has been used}} to perform MS imaging of plants, tissues, cell pellets, and even single cells. [...] In addition, LAESI has been used to analyze historic documents and untreated biofluids such as urine and blood. [...] The technique of LAESI is performed at atmospheric pressure and therefore overcomes many of the obstacles of traditional MS techniques, including extensive and invasive sample preparation steps and the use of high vacuum. LAESI can be used to perform MS analysis of many different classes of compounds ranging from small molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, saccharides, lipids, and metabolites to larger biomolecules like peptides and proteins. [...] LAESI has also been shown to have a quantitative dynamic range of 4 decades and a limit of detection (LOD) of 8 fmol with verapamil, a small pharmaceutical molecule. [...] The technique has a lateral resolution of <200 μm for imaging applications and has been used for 3D imaging of plant tissues. [...] Additionally, in <b>cell-by-cell</b> LAESI imaging experiments single cells can be used as the pixels of the molecular image. This LAESI application uses etched optical fibers to produce laser spot sizes of <50 µm to deliver the laser energy and has also been utilized in single cell analysis experiments.|$|E

40|$|Nanosensor-based {{detection}} of biomarkers can improve medical diagnosis; however, {{a critical factor}} in nanosensor development is deciding which biomarker to target, as most diseases present several biomarkers. Biomarker-targeting decisions can be informed via an understanding of biomarker expression. Currently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the accepted standard for profiling biomarker expression. While IHC provides a relative mapping of biomarker expression, it does not provide <b>cell-by-cell</b> readouts of biomarker expression or absolute biomarker quantification. Flow cytometry overcomes both these IHC challenges by offering biomarker expression on a <b>cell-by-cell</b> basis, and when combined with calibration standards, providing quantitation of biomarker concentrations: this is known as qFlow cytometry. Here, we outline the key components for applying qFlow cytometry to detect biomarkers within the angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family.

40|$|Cell {{membrane}} proteins play {{an important}} role in tissue architecture and cell-cell communication. We hypothesize that segmentation and multidimensional characterization of the distribution of cell membrane proteins, on a <b>cell-by-cell</b> basis, enable improved classification of treatment groups and identify important characteristics that can otherwise be hidden. We have developed a series of computational steps to (i) delineate cell membrane protein signals and associate them with a specific nucleus; (ii) compute a coupled representation of the multiplexed DNA content with membrane proteins; (iii) rank computed features associated with such a multidimensional representation; (iv) visualize selected features for comparative evaluation through heatmaps; and (v) discriminate between treatment groups in an optimal fashion. The novelty of our method is in the segmentation of the membrane signal and the multidimensional representation of phenotypic signature on a <b>cell-by-cell</b> basis. To test the utility of this method, the proposed computational steps were applied to images of cells that have been irradiated with different radiation qualities in the presence and absence of other small molecules.

Surveys of hunters and landowners {{are an important}} source of information for wildlife managers in Minnesota. Two separate studies were conducted to examine the topics addressed by this thesis: 1) the identification of variables that impact landowner’s decisions to allow public hunting access in southeast Minnesota, and 2) the capability of <b>cell-by-cell</b> correction to reduce mixed-mode sampling effects. The first study was a survey of southeast Minnesota landowners conducted in 2013 to examine variables that influence landowners’ decision to allow hunting access to the public. Landowners who own large properties present the greatest potential for improving future public access due to the number of hunters that can be accommodated without crowding and because {{they are more likely to}} allow hunting access. The second study was a survey of 2015 Minnesota deer hunters using a sequential mixed-mode design with Internet and mail surveys. Mixed-mode designs are increasingly used in efforts to produce more representative results of the population than single survey mode designs, but such designs can introduce the potential for measurement error from mode effects. A <b>cell-by-cell</b> correction can be applied to survey results to adjust for nonresponse error.
