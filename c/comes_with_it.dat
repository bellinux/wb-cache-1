Government policies aim at reducing this inequality by reservation, quota for backward classes, but paradoxically also have created an incentive to keep this stratification alive. The Indian government officially recognises historically discriminated communities of India such as the Untouchables under the designation of Scheduled Castes, and certain economically backward castes as Other Backward Class.|$|E

2500|$|The Four Noble Truths {{refer to}} and express the basic {{orientation}} of Buddhism {{in a short}} expression: we crave and cling to impermanent states and things, which are dukkha, [...] "incapable of satisfying" [...] and painful. This craving keeps us caught in samsara, the endless cycle of repeated rebirth and dying again, and the dukkha that <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> There is, however, a way to end this cycle, namely by attaining nirvana, cessation of craving, whereafter rebirth and associated dukkha will no longer arise again. This {{can be accomplished by}} following the eightfold path, restraining oneself, cultivating discipline, and practicing mindfulness and meditation.|$|E

60|$|Long {{before his}} wounds were healed, Legree {{insisted that he}} should be put to the regular field-work; and then came day after day of pain and weariness, aggravated by every kind of {{injustice}} and indignity that the ill-will of a mean and malicious mind could devise. Whoever, in our circumstances, has made trial of pain, even with all the alleviations which, for us, usually attend it, must know the irritation that <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Tom no longer wondered at the habitual surliness of his associates; nay, he found the placid, sunny temper, which had been the habitude of his life, broken in on, and sorely strained, by the inroads of the same thing. He had flattered himself on leisure to read his Bible; but {{there was no such thing}} as leisure there. In the height of the season, Legree did not hesitate to press all his hands through, Sundays and week-days alike. Why shouldn't he?--he made more cotton by it, and gained his wager; and if it wore out a few more hands, he could buy better ones. At first, Tom used to read a verse or two of his Bible, by the flicker of the fire, after he had returned from his daily toil; but, after the cruel treatment he received, he used to come home so exhausted, that his head swam and his eyes failed when he tried to read; and he was fain to stretch himself down, with the others, in utter exhaustion.|$|E
60|$|But {{do not be}} astonished, do not be disheartened, if, {{when the}} trouble comes, there <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> as to Jacob, a more terrible {{struggle}} far, a struggle too deep for words; if {{you find out that}} fine words and set prayers are nothing in the hour of need, and that you will not be heard for your much speaking. Ah! the darkness of that time, which perhaps goes on for days, for months, all alone between you and God himself. Clergymen and good people may come in with kind words and true words: but they give no comfort; your heart is still dark, still full of doubt; you want God himself to speak to your heart, and tell you that he is love. And you have no words to pray with at last; you have used them all up; and you can only cling humbly to God, and hold fast. One moment you feel like a poor slave clinging to his stern master's arm, and entreating him not to kill him outright. The next you feel like a child clinging to its father, and entreating him to save him from some horrible monster which is going to devour it: but you have no words to pray with, only sighs, and tears, and groans; you feel that you know not what to pray for as you ought, know not what is good for you; dare ask for nothing, lest it should be the wrong thing. And the longer you struggle, the weaker you become, as Jacob did, till your very bones seem out of joint, your very heart broken within you, and life seems not worth having, or death either.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this takes}} {{me away from}} Carlyle and from the Annandale view of life. I read the two volumes with {{exceeding}} interest; for my admiration of Carlyle as a letter writer is boundless, and it is curious to watch the first step and gradual amplification of his afterwards extraordinary style. Those addressed to his own family are most remarkable as dedicated to a household of peasants, by one of themselves, and in short for the amateur of Carlyle the book has a high value. But I doubt whether the general public will bite at it very eagerly. I don't know why I allude to this, though--for the general public has small sense and less taste, and its likes and dislikes, I think, must mostly make the judicious grieve. You seem to me a most perfect and ideal editor--and {{it is a great}} pleasure to me that so excellent and faultless a piece of editorial work should proceed from our rough and ready country--but at the same time your demolitions of the unspeakable Froude don't persuade me that Carlyle was amiable. It seems to me he remains the most disagreeable in character of men of genius of equal magnificence. In these youthful letters it appears to me even striking how his disagreeableness comes out more and more in proportion as his talent develops. This doesn't prevent him, however, from being in my opinion--and doubtless in yours--one of the very greatest--perhaps the very greatest of letter writers; only when one thinks of the other most distinguished masters of expression the image evoked has (though sometimes it may be sad enough) a serenity, a general pleasantness. When the vision of Carlyle comes to us there <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> the idea of harshness and discord. The difference between the man and the genius seems to me, in other words, greater than in any other case--for if Voltaire was a rascal he was eminently a social one--and Rousseau (to think of a great intellectual swell who must have been odious) hadn't anything like Carlyle's [...] "parts." [...] All the same, I shall devour the volumes I am delighted to see you are still to publish.|$|E
