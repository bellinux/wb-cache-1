40|$|In Lesotho, {{snow cover}} {{is not only}} highly {{relevant}} to the climate system, but also affects socio-economic factors such as water storage for irrigation or hydro-electricity. However, while sound knowledge of annual and inter-annual snow dynamics is strongly required by local stakeholders, in-situ snow information remains limited. In this study, satellite data are used to generate a time series of snow cover and to provide the missing information on a national scale. A snow retrieval method, {{which is based on}} MODIS data and considers the concept of a normalized difference snow index (NDSI), has been implemented. Monitoring gaps due to cloud cover are filled by temporal and spatial post-processing. The comparison is based on the use of <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> <b>reference</b> images from Landsat-TM and ENVISAT-MERIS. While the snow product is considered to be of good quality (mean accuracy: 68 %), a slight bias towards snow underestimation is observed. Based on the daily product, a consistent time series of snow cover for Lesotho from 2000 – 2014 was generated for the first time. Analysis of the time series showed that the high annual variability of snow coverage and the short duration of single snow events require daily monitoring with a gap-filling procedure...|$|R
40|$|Clouds play a {{critical}} role in the Earth's radiative budget as they modulate the atmosphere by reflecting shortwave solar radiation and absorbing long wave IR radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. Although extensively studied for decades, cloud modelling in global circulation models is far from adequate, mostly due to insufficient spatial resolution of the circulation models. In addition, measurements of cloud properties still need improvement, since the vast majority of remote sensing techniques are focused in relatively large, thick clouds. In this study, we utilize ground based hyperspectral measurements and analysis to explore very thin water clouds. These clouds are characterized by liquid water path (LWP) that spans from as high as ~ 50 g m− 2 and down to 65 mg m− 2 with a minimum of about 0. 01 visible optical depth. The retrieval methodology relies on three elements: a detailed radiative transfer calculations in the longwave IR regime, signal enhancement by subtraction of a <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> <b>reference,</b> and spectral matching method which exploits fine spectral differences between water droplets of different radii. A detailed description of the theoretical basis for the retrieval technique is provided along with a comprehensive discussion regarding its limitations. The proposed methodology was validated in a controlled experiment where artificial clouds were sprayed and their effective radii were both measured and retrieved simultaneously. This methodology can be used in several ways: (1) the frequency and optical properties of very thin water clouds can be studied more precisely in order to evaluate their total radiative forcing on the Earth's radiation budget. (2) The unique optical properties of the inter-region between clouds (clouds' "twilight zone") can be studied in order to more rigorously understanding of the governing physical processes which dominate this region. (3) Since the optical thickness of a developed cloud gradually decreases towards its edges, the proposed methodology can be used to study the spatial microphysical behaviour of these edges. (4) A spatial-temporal analysis can be used to study mixing processes in clouds' entrainment zone...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of determining the degree of atmospheric pollution over the small Greek city of Serres based solely on measurements of global solar radiation and some simple meteorological variables. Hourly data of solar irradiance on an horizontal plane are recorded simultaneously together with relative humidity and wind speed. Along with some traditional techniques for selecting the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> days of the period examined, the statistical coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of the daily distributions of hourly radiation data have been employed with reasonable success. Indeed, for the cloudless days of this study, {{the values of the}} above quantities are confined within narrow ranges which provide a criterion for their identification from the cloudy days. Comparison of global radiation data under <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> conditions with <b>reference</b> values from a suitable theoretical model of literature, in combination with the results of a recent study for the nearby city of Thessaloniki, provides evidence that there is virtually no atmospheric pollution in Serres. Correlation of the observed deviations between measurements and predictions with recorded meteorological data lends further support to the above argument. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Since {{the effect}} of clouds on the earth's {{radiation}} balance is often estimated as the difference of net radiative fluxes {{at the top of}} the atmosphere between all situations and monthly averaged <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> situations of the same regions, a reliable identification of <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> is important for the study of cloud radiative effects. The Scanner for Radiation Balance (ScaRaB) radiometer on board the Russian Meteor- 3 / 7 satellite provided earth radiation budget observations from March 1994 to February 1995 with two ERBE-Re broad-band longwave and shortwave channels. Two narrow-band channels, in the infrared atmospheric window and in the visible band, have been added to the ScaRaB instrument to improve the cloud scene identification. The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) method for cloud detection and determination of cloud and surface properties uses the same narrow-band channels as ScaRaB, but is employed to a collection of measurements at a better spatial resolution of about 5 km. By applying the original ISCCP algorithms to the ScaRaB data, the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> frequency is about 5 % lower than the one over quasi-simultaneous original ISCCP data, an indication that the ISCCP cloud detection is quite stable. However, one would expect an about 10 to 20 % smaller <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> occurrence over the larger ScaRaB pixels. Adapting the ISCCP algorithms to the reduced spatial resolution of 60 km and to the different time sampling of the ScaRaB data leads therefore to a reduction of a residual cloud contamination. A sensitivity study with time-space collocated ScaRaB and original ISCCP data at a spatial resolution of 1 deg longitude x 1 deg latitude shows that {{the effect of}} <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> identification method plays a higher role on the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> frequency and therefore on the statistics than on the zonal mean values of the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> fluxes. Nevertheless, the zonal outgoing longwave fluxes corresponding to ERBE <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> are in general about 2 to 10 W/sq m higher than those obtained from the ScaRaB adapted ISCCP <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> identifications. The latter are close to (about 1 W/sq m higher) fluxes corresponding to <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> regions from original ISCCP data, whereas ScaRaB <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> LW fluxes obtained with the original ISCCP identification lie about 1 to 2 W/sq m below. Especially in the tropics where water vapor abundance is high, the ERBE <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> LW fluxes seem to be systematically overestimated by about 4 W/sq m, and SW fluxes are lower by about 5 to 10 W/sq m. However, the uncertainty in the analysis of monthly mean zonal cloud radiative effects is also produced by the low frequency of <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> occurrence, illustrated when averaging over pixels or even over regions of 4 deg longitude x 5 deg latitude, corresponding to the spatial resolution of General Circulation Models. The systematic bias in the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> fluxes is not reflected in the zonal cloud radiative effects, because the <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> regions selected by the different algorithms can occur in different geographic regions with different cloud properties...|$|R

Later, when a young kit named Fluttering Bird dies of hunger, members of the Tribe vote to leave in search of food. A group of Tribe cats, led by <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky,</b> one of Fluttering Bird's elder brothers, decides to follow the [...] "sun trail" [...] as described to Stoneteller in her vision. When Jagged Peak, <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky's</b> youngest brother, who is still a kit, sneaks out of the Tribe's cave to catch up to <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> and his group, their mother Quiet Rain becomes worried and asks Gray Wing, <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky's</b> other younger brother, to go follow as well, to which Gray Wing reluctantly agrees. Gray Wing finds Jagged Peak and saves him from an eagle, after which they catch up to <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky's</b> group.

When the group stops to rest one night, a trio of eagles attempts to hunt the cats, forcing them to hide. However, while saving Gray Wing from an eagle, Bright Stream is carried away by an eagle; though she successfully kills, she falls to her death as a result. In the aftermath, a rift forms between <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> and Gray Wing because Gray Wing believes that <b>Clear</b> <b>Sky</b> blames him for Bright Stream's death.

40|$|The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments {{require the}} U. S. EPA to control mercury {{emission}} outputs from coal-burning power plants through implementation of MACT, Maximum Achievable Control Technology, standards. However, in 2003 the Bush Administration revealed an alternative and controversial regulatory strategy for mercury, developing a {{cap and trade}} emissions credit trading program under the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> Initiative. Although emissions trading was {{proven to be a}} successful regulatory strategy for sulfur dioxide through the 1992 Acid Rain Program, the uniquely dangerous properties of mercury make this market-based regulation risky for certain vulnerable segments of the population. Since its unveiling, the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> cap and trade approach has been criticized for being too industry-friendly and inadequately setting limits on mercury emissions. Current challenges to the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> approach to the regulation of mercury claim that not only is it illegal under the Clear Air Act, but that it inhibits innovation and undermines an international strategy to reduce anthropogenic mercury emissions.

However, in regions where deep convective activity occurs, the ERBE fluxes are significantly higher (10 - 15 W/sq m) than the calculated fluxes.
