5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions <b>curl</b> <b>up.</b> If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E
5|$|Peniophora quercina is {{a species}} of wood-decay fungus in the family Peniophoraceae. The species {{produces}} fruit bodies which vary in appearance depending on whether they are wet or dry. The wet fruit bodies are waxy and lilac, and attached strongly to the wood. When dry, the edges <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> and reveal the dark underside, while the surface becomes crusty and pink. P.quercina is the type species of Peniophora, and {{was moved to the}} genus upon its creation by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species is found primarily in Europe, where it can be encountered all year. Though primarily growing upon dead wood, especially oak, it is also capable of growing upon still-living wood.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders <b>curl</b> <b>up.</b> Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E

25|$|English Shepherds {{require a}} lot of {{exercise}} (at least 40 minutes of walking per day) and may become destructive if not provided enough.

25|$|Bumastus {{could also}} <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> (known as enrollment) into a ball-like shape. This is {{believed}} to indicate that its habitat {{might have been the}} shallow waters of the Littoral zone. When waves wash them out from the sediments it could simply roll up and be carried along. Enrollment protects the softer body parts below the exoskeleton, while the spherical shape offers the least resistance to wave action.|$|E

All, or almost all, the cervical vertebrae are unfused, allowing their heads to be turned independently of their bodies. None has any throat grooves.|$|E

500|$|A giraffe {{has only}} two gaits: walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs {{on one side of}} the body at the same time, then doing the same on the other side. When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward, and the tail will <b>curl</b> <b>up.</b> The animal relies on the forward and {{backward}} motions of its head and neck to maintain balance and the counter momentum while galloping.

500|$|In Japan, {{enforcement}} {{is not considered}} very strict since only 23% of smugglers (9 out of 39 cases) were officially charged between 1998 and 2006. Instead, most only received fines. Based on reports taken from Kyodo News, the JWCS concluded that the primary concern of Customs officials was the prevention of infectious diseases, such as Ebola. Slow lorises are sometimes mixed in with other trade-restricted species, such as reptiles, and since confiscations target high-profile species, {{it is likely that}} the international smuggling numbers are [...] "just the tip of the iceberg."

500|$|Not all viewers {{were taken}} with Dalton. Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail was entirely dismissive. [...] "The new Bond {{has been widely}} {{described}} in feature stories as {{a throwback to the}} Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and that may be true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. You get the feeling that on his off nights, he might <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved".|$|E
500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] {{received}} universal {{critical acclaim}} and {{is regarded as}} one of the musical and lyrical highlights of All I Ever Wanted. Ryan Brockington from The New York Post called the song a [...] "mixture of old school Stevie Nicks and some Julia Roberts romantic comedy theme song, delivered together in true Clarkson fashion." [...] He continues, [...] "she spits emotion and heart into a song that makes me want to <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> in a blanket and long for someone". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly said Clarkson [...] "knows that the anguish she likes to sing about is enjoyed by millions of people as grandiose admissions of vulnerability. Yet the music that delivers that message is anything but vulnerable. There's a reason they call them power ballads: a sad song blasted at full volume is a metaphor for finding strength in pain." [...] His point was echoed by Danton of [...] The Hartford Courant, who stated that Clarkson [...] "pours on the heartache", and by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, who called the song an [...] "extravagant ballad".|$|E

[...] The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to <b>curl</b> <b>up</b> and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. [...] Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. [...] Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. [...] The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.|$|E
