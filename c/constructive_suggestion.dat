6000|$|Marjorie {{considered}} the Movements about her. She surveyed the accessible aspects of socialism, but that old treasure-house of <b>constructive</b> <b>suggestion</b> {{had an effect}} like a rich château which had been stormed and looted by a mob. For a time the proposition that [...] "we are all Socialists nowadays" [...] had prevailed. The blackened and discredited frame remained, the contents were scattered; Aunt Plessington had a few pieces, the Tory Democrats had taken freely, the Liberals were {{in possession of a}} hastily compiled collection. There wasn't, she perceived, and there never had been a Socialist Movement; the socialist idea which had now become part of the general consciousness, had always been too big for polite domestication. She weighed Aunt Plessington, too, in the balance, and found her not so much wanting indeed as excessive. She felt that a Movement with Aunt Plessington in it couldn't possibly offer even elbow-room for anybody else. Philanthropy generally she shunned. The movements that aim at getting poor people into rooms and shouting at them in an improving, authoritative way, aroused an instinctive dislike in her. Her sense of humour, again, would not let her patronize Shakespear or the stage, or raise the artistic level of the country by means of green-dyed deal, and the influence of Trafford on her mind debarred her from attempting the physical and moral regeneration of humanity by means of beans and nut butter. It was indeed rather by the elimination of competing movements than by any positive preference that she found herself declining at last towards Agatha Alimony's section of the suffrage movement.... It was one of the less militant sections, but it held more meetings and passed more resolutions than any two others.|$|E
6000|$|This old pageant {{included}} {{a series of}} figures from the eighteenth century, and I was told that I was just like Dr. Johnson. Seeing that Dr. Johnson was heavily seamed with small-pox, had a waistcoat all over gravy, snorted and rolled as he walked, and was probably the ugliest man in London, I mention this identification as a fact {{and not as a}} vaunt. I {{had nothing to do with}} the arrangement; and such fleeting suggestions as I made were not taken so seriously as they might have been. I requested that a row of posts be erected across the lawn, so that I might touch all of them but one, and then go back and touch that. Failing this, I felt that the least they could do was to have twenty-five cups of tea stationed at regular intervals along the course, each held by a Mrs. Thrale in full costume. My best <b>constructive</b> <b>suggestion</b> was the most harshly rejected of all. In front of me in the procession walked the great Bishop Berkeley, the man who turned the tables on the early materialists by maintaining that matter itself possibly does not exist. Dr. Johnson, you will remember, did not like such bottomless fancies as Berkeley's, and kicked a stone with his foot, saying, [...] "I refute him so!" [...] Now (as I pointed out) kicking a stone would not make the metaphysical quarrel quite clear; besides, it would hurt. But how picturesque and perfect it would be if I moved across the ground in the symbolic attitude of kicking Bishop Berkeley! How complete an allegoric group; the great transcendentalist walking with his head among the stars, but behind him the avenging realist pede claudo, with uplifted foot. But I must not take up space with these forgotten frivolities; we old men grow too garrulous in talking of the distant past.|$|E

40|$|Â© 1990 The Philosophy of Science AssociationIn {{an earlier}} paper (DuprÃ© 1984), I criticized a thesis {{sometimes}} defended by theorists of probabilistic causality, namely, that a probabilistic cause must raise {{the probability of}} its effect in every possible set of causally relevant background conditions (the "contextual unanimity thesis"). I also suggested that a more promising analysis of probabilistic causality might be sought in terms of statis- tical relevance in a fair sample. Ellery Eells (1987) has defended the contextual unanimity thesis against my objections, and also raised objections of his own to my positive claims. In this paper I defend and amplify both my objections to the contextual unanimity thesis and my <b>constructive</b> <b>suggestion...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} the interference awareness and reduction in mobile radio communication networks {{by use of}} mobile transceiving stations with two antennas and two delay lines. Each of delay lines is installed in a reception path of antenna that ensures constructive interference for useful signal and destructive interference for disturbance one. Such <b>constructive</b> <b>suggestion</b> leads to amplification of useful signal and to attenuation of almost all other signals received by mobile station in owing to reflection from macro obstacles. This method {{considers the}} possibility of utilization of mobile transceiving stations with two antennas not only to face the interference problem but also for simultaneous transceiving the signal by several mobile stations. Key words —dual-antenna reception; dynamical delay lines; reduction of interference. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{price as}} a strategy using two methods of market segmentation through game theory based on the collected data of several typical cities in Shandong province. Three oligarchs are discussed to analyze {{the complexity of the}} market in tobacco system. The effect of different factors on the equilibrium price of Nash equilibrium is discussed. What is more, the variation of parameters drives the system to change to uncertain status, even to bifurcation or chaos. We also discuss the model under normal circumstances, when the three parties jointly take chaos control measures, {{and its impact on the}} system. Finally, we clarify chaos control of economic significance. The results indicate that only reasonable pricing strategy is a critical point to achieve maximized profit and maintain orderly operation at the same time, which is a <b>constructive</b> <b>suggestion</b> for tobacco companies’ operational strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the diploma thesis is Concerning Chosen Translations of the Poem The Raven by E. A. Poe - an Attempt at a Comparison. The thesis deals with the {{comparison}} of Czech translations which have been written over {{the period of the}} last twenty years. The original text would be also dealt with, since there come up distinct shifts of meaning within the process of translation. However, the author will not omit different aesthetical qualities of the original and target language. An observation of schoolbooks for teaching literature at secondary and high schools will be added together with an attempt to determine the most frequently included translation which could therefore be considered as canonic. The output of the thesis should be an analysis evaluating whether including the translation in schoolbooks is appropriate and offering a <b>constructive</b> <b>suggestion</b> on an alternative one...|$|E

40|$|Confronting the {{simultaneous}} global economic stagnation {{that has resulted}} in diminishing consumption, a new driver which can instill in customers an exciting story with their own initiative and thrills them with gratification of consumption is essential. Japan's mobile phone driven innovation may provide a <b>constructive</b> <b>suggestion</b> to this requirement. On the basis of an empirical analysis focusing on the learning dynamism for innovative products in Japan's digital industry, this paper demonstrates the foregoing hypothetical anticipation. Based on measurement of dynamic learning coefficients for seven leading innovative products centered on mobile phones, the Granger causal test, Chow forecast test and wavelet analysis were conducted, and the significant role of mobile phones in leveraging broad dissemination, learning and absorption of core technologies essential to the advancement of digital industry was identified. Furthermore, significant role of demanding customers in inducing resonance between mobile phones learning and that of innovative products was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|This chapter makes three {{critical}} comments on A. Stephan's chapter 'An Emergentist's Perspective on the Problem of Free Will' and a <b>constructive</b> <b>suggestion</b> for a compatibilist position {{making use of}} emergent properties. First, Stephan's 'horizontal emergence' is not synchronic and his 'vertical reduction' requires three steps, not two: indeed, finding a role filler is different from giving a mechanistic explanation of this role filler. Second, unpredictability except by simulation is neither necessary nor sufficient for diachronic structure emergence. Third, Singer's thesis that some part /p/ of the process leading to a free action is conscious, {{in the sense that}} /p/ causes a conscious state /m/, is incompatible with the thesis that /m/ is identical with, or supervenes on, /p/, because identity and supervenience are non‐causal relations. Finally, a compatibilist position is sketched according to which our actions are determined by psychological laws at the level of strongly emergent mental properties...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, in many countries, a {{increasing}} number of private companies resort to prison labor. In fact, inmates work more and more for private undertakings {{both inside and outside}} prison. In consideration of private companies generally engaged in international trade, prison labor thus participate in global supply chains. Then under such circumstances, there is a developing trend that prison economy is being marketed internationally. Nevertheless, there are some institutional barriers in international trade policies, such as WTO rules, which in principle prohibit prison labor product coming into international market. This research aims to discuss the possibility of exports of prison products in international trade market within WTO/GATT framework. In terms of prisoners’ labor rights protection, by exploring the consistency of WTO rule with ILO standard, the research intends to find the possibility of prison labor product being accepted by the international market.
