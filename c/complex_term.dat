The languages that we analysed are French and Italian. Our research proposes an analysis of two mechanisms: the expansion and the reduction of <b>complex</b> <b>terms.</b> These mechanisms affect the linearity {{of the structure of the}} terms and they represent two phases of the evolution of <b>complex</b> <b>terms.</b> The life cycle connects the evolution of terms to the innovation within a domain.

This kind of logical expressions can be mapped to a special cellular architecture, called Reversible Wave Cascade Archi-tecture.

This paper presents an approach to generation of <b>complex</b> <b>terms</b> for incompletely specified Boolean functions using ETDD (EXOR Ternary Decision Diagram) s. Basically the decompositions, Shannon, positive Davio and negative Davio, inherent in ETDDs are employed to generate <b>complex</b> <b>terms.</b> While traversing the ETDD {{can be done in}} a simple and efficient way for completely specified functions, the manipulation of ETDDs with don't care <b>terms</b> becomes very <b>complex</b> because the three decompositions require different evaluations of the function. The changes made to the function due to don't cares in each decomposition are analyzed and an approximation algorithm is presented with its applications to the synthesis of <b>complex</b> <b>terms.</b> I.

For example, one of many theistic traditions script such as Kapilasurisamvada, credited to another ancient Hindu philosopher named Kapila, first describes purusa {{in a manner similar}} to Samkhya-Yoga schools above, but then proceeds to describe buddhi (intellect) as second purusa, and ahamkara (ego) as third purusa. Such pluralism and diversity of thought within Hinduism [...] implies that the term purusa is a <b>complex</b> <b>term</b> with diverse meanings.|$|E

There were two parallel tests to conduct this study. It was aimed at visually explaining {{the manner of the}} partial sum of series with <b>complex</b> <b>terms</b> {{in the first part of}} the study and, in the second part, at constructing the general term of the series with the help of the visually given the sum of it. Research indicated that participants’ success in the transition from the visual to symbolic representation was statistically low.

Susskind regards Document Assembly as one of 10 'disruptive technologies' that are altering the face of the legal profession.

The völkisch movement was [...] "arguably the largest group" [...] in the Conservative Revolutionary movement in Germany. However, like [...] "conservative-revolutionary" [...] or [...] "fascist", völkisch is a <b>complex</b> <b>term</b> ("schillernder Begriff").

When Long tried to break off the short relationship, she says he felt it was a violation of guanxi; because he had given her gifts and paid for their trip, he felt entitled to more efforts from her to help him make contacts. The rape, she says, was partially retaliatory in nature.|$|E

With the introduction of Soto, the emphasis on personal relationship was grafted on, making a <b>complex</b> <b>term</b> that merged the official and legal with the personal and affectionate. To complicate matters further, the Diamond Sangha, the Los Angeles Zen Center and the Rochester Zen Center lineages have combined elements of both modern-day Soto and Rinzai Zen. It’s no wonder there is ambiguity and diversity in the usage of roshi in the West.|$|E
