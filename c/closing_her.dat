It was also her idea that Miranda not wear makeup in the scene where she opens up to Andrea and worries about the effect on her daughters of her divorce becoming public knowledge.

The video ends with Madonna looking up towards the camera the last time, and then <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> eyes. It was treated with sepia color. Carol Vernallis, author of Experiencing music video: aesthetics and cultural context felt that the video was {{a good example of}} how image can direct the viewer's attention towards the shift in instrumentation and arrangement of the song. She noted the aimless movement of the camera towards her as [...] "bringing focus to the main subject, with the viewer's attention fully captured." ...|$|E

Writing for Time, James Poniewozik highlighted an acting of [...] "touching self-recognition by Harry Lloyd, who did {{an outstanding job}} humanizing a villain," [...] and Maureen Ryan congratulated the actor for his [...] "excellent job of showing the human side of this impetuous, cruel aristocrat" [...] and [...] "keeping Viserys just this side of sane in all his scenes." [...] The acting of Emilia Clarke, <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> arc initiated in the first episode from a frightened girl to an empowered woman was also praised. VanDerWerff commented on the difficulty to adapt such an evolution from page to screen, but concluded that [...] "Clarke and Lloyd more than seal the deal here." [...] IGN's Matt Fowler also praised Clarke and noted that Daenerys's choice to watch Viserys die was [...] "powerful" [...] and an important shift in her character.|$|E

Anders praised Bleach's portrayal of Davros for capturing [...] "the character's mixture of curiosity, manipulativeness and mania better than anyone since [...] Michael Wisher". She also commended the [...] "super-heroics" [...] in the episode, such as Wilf's attack on a Dalek with a paintball gun, Gwen and Ianto's final scene, and the [...] "glowing nobility" [...] of Harriet Jones' sacrifice to help the Doctor: <b>Closing</b> <b>her</b> review, she expressed excitement for [...] "Journey's End", saying the final scene left her with a [...] "feeling like [...] no clue how it could be resolved, even using crazy RTD logic".|$|E

500|$|William Safire of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "have a nice day" [...] first {{appeared}} in the 1948film A Letter to Three Wives. The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms stated that [...] "have a nice day" [...] first came into being in 1920, and the phrase and its variants became widely used after the 1950s. In 1964, Carol Reed of WCBS-TV spread the phrase in the New York metropolitan area by <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> weather reports with [...] "have a happy day", which, according to Safire, is a variant of [...] "have a nice day". The 1960s saw the phrase [...] "have a good day" [...] become prevalent and supersede [...] "happy day". Numerous hippies, when parting, told each other to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a beautiful day". In 1970, [...] "have a nice city" [...] was a mayoralty slogan in San Francisco. In 1972, during the Vietnam War, family members of POW/MIA members of the American armed forces participated in South Boston's Saint Patrick's Day march.

500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Sun of a Gun", {{directed}} by ThirtyTwo, was first released onto Vevo on 19 October 2010. It was filmed in 2010 in Brooklyn, and displays Oh Land {{in two different}} themes: dark and light. According to Oh Land herself, she [...] "wanted the video to show the two different states {{that you can get}} in when you are in love with someone". The dark side reflects her [...] "desire to protect oneself from being hurt and celebrating independence", while the light side reflects her [...] "desire to be loved and the joys of being in love". The video opens with the dark side of Oh Land, wearing a black dress and extensive eye makeup. She performs the song's choreography atop a cloud-like stage, surrounded by blinking lights. As the track's chorus begins, the light side of Oh Land appears, in a skin-colored dress and longer hair, in front of a screen displaying the sun. The second verse finds her wearing a different black dress, and singing the song by many mirrors; simultaneously, visuals of Oh Land on the ground dancing appear. The following chorus shows the same scenario, but in the same skin-colored dress from earlier. In the song's bridge, both versions of the singer pull a shawl over their head, allowing it to move with the wind. The video concludes with Oh Land <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> eyes as the screen cuts to black.|$|E

These actions angered her Facebook followers, and resulted in Facebook <b>closing</b> <b>her</b> account and removing the material in question.

The house falls on and kills the Wicked Witch of the East, freeing the Munchkins from her tyranny. Glinda the Good Witch of the North arrives via magic bubble and shows Dorothy the dead woman's two feet visibly sticking {{out from under the}} house wearing the ruby slippers. When the Wicked Witch of the West comes to claim her dead sister's shoes, Glinda magically transfers them to Dorothy's feet. Glinda tells Dorothy to keep tight inside of them and never take them off, as the slippers must be very powerful or the Wicked Witch would not want them so badly. Throughout the rest of the film, the Wicked Witch schemes to obtain the shoes. When she captures Dorothy, she tries to take the slippers, but receives a painful shock. The Wicked Witch then realizes that the slippers will only come off if the wearer is dead, so she decides to kill Dorothy.
