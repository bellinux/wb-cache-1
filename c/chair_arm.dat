He explained to Sylvester that he continued [...] "painting it face because I haven't any other people to do...One of the nicest things Jean Cocteau said was 'each day in the mirror I watch death at work.'

He then recorded the maximum lateral distances at which the target fuels were scorched, charred, or ignited. Items were scorched at distances greater than 0.19 – 1.2  m depending on the material and heat source.|$|E

2500|$|Avoid {{using the}} {{pectoral}} muscles, such as by pushing on the <b>chair</b> <b>arms</b> to assist one's self {{out of a}} chair, or by using the arms to assist in sitting down. Proper standing technique is to rock {{three times in the}} chair and then stand to provide momentum for moving the center of gravity from the sitting to the standing position. Proper sitting technique is to slowly lower the bottom toward the chair seat using gluteus and quadriceps muscles ("legs only") without grabbing the <b>chair</b> <b>arms.</b> Second, patients should avoid lifting objects utilizing the pectoral muscles: carrying light objects with arms extended [...] down at sides, and lifting light objects with the elbows pressed to the chest and using the biceps, are acceptable.

40|$|Wipe {{sampling}} of surfaces {{was carried out}} in the pharmacy compounding area and inpatient and outpatient wards of a South Australian public hospital administering cytotoxic drugs to clients. 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) was chosen as an indicator cytotoxic drug as it was commonly used and administered in these areas of the hospital. 5 -FU has been used to treat colon, rectal, breast and gastrointestinal cancers. We collected wipe samples from boxes and bottles of the 5 -FU obtained from the pharmacy store and found that these were not contaminated with 5 -FU. However, analysis of wipe samples indicated that most surfaces in the pharmacy compounding area, inpatient and outpatient wards were contaminated with 5 -FU. These surfaces included phones, keyboards, <b>chair</b> <b>arm</b> rests, bench tops, door handles, PC mouse and fridge doors. The surfaces tested had been cleaned by the standard hospital protocols. Five different decontaminant agents were tested and only one, a 0. 5 % w/v sodium hypochlorite solution, was found to be effective as a cleaning agent that rapidly breaks down the 5 -FU and will also kill bacteria. Sampling of surfaces for 5 -FU contamination post cleaning with 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite found that this cleaning agent was effective in decontaminating the 5 -FU contaminated surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Seated {{computer}} {{work results}} in prolonged static loading, {{which has been}} associated with the development of musculoskeletal disorders. A popular alternative to sitting on an office chair while performing computer work is to sit on an exercise ball. Sitting on an exercise ball might affect static and dynamic aspects of working posture. We monitored posture, muscle activation and spinal shrinkage in 10 females performing a 1 -h typing task, while sitting on an office chair with armrests and while sitting on an exercise ball. Sitting on an exercise ball resulted in 33 % more trunk motion and in 66 % more variation in lumbar EMG. Both of these findings can be considered to be an advantage for the exercise ball. However, the fifth percentile and average lumbar EMG were also higher when sitting on an exercise ball, with 38 % and 78 %, respectively. In addition, more spinal shrinkage occurred when sitting on an exercise ball than when sitting on an office <b>chair.</b> <b>Arm</b> flexion was reduced, but trapezius activation was unaffected when sitting on an exercise ball. It is concluded that the advantages with respect to physical loading of sitting on an exercise ball may not outweigh the disadvantages. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{horizontal}} transmission of Clostridium difficile {{in the hospital}} environment is difficult to establish. Current methods to detect C. difficile spores on surfaces are not quantitative, lack sensitivity, and are protracted. We propose a novel rapid method to detect and quantify C. difficile contamination on surfaces. Sponge swabbing was compared to contact plate sampling to assess the in vitro recovery of C. difficile ribotype 027 contamination (100, 101, or 102 CFU of spores) from test surfaces (a bed rail, a stainless steel sheet, or a polypropylene work surface). Sponge swab contents were concentrated by vacuum filtration, and the filter membrane was plated onto selective agar. The efficacy of each technique for the recovery of C. difficile from sites in the clinical environment that are touched at a high frequency was evaluated. Contact plates recovered 19 to 32 % of the total contam-ination on test surfaces, whereas sponge swabs recovered 76 to 94 % of the total contamination, and contact plates failed to detect C. difficile contamination below a detection limit of 10 CFU/ 25 cm 2 (0. 4 CFU/cm 2). In use, contact plates failed to detect C. diffi-cile contamination (0 / 96 contact plates; 4 case wards), while sponge swabs recovered C. difficile from 29 % (87 / 301) of the sur-faces tested in the clinical environment. Approximately 74 % (36 / 49) of {{the area in the}} vicinity of the patient was contaminated (1. 34 6. 88 CFU/cm 2 C. difficile spores). Reservoirs of C. difficile extended to beyond the areas near the patient: a dirty utility room sink (2. 26 5. 90 CFU/cm 2), toilet floor (1. 87 2. 40 CFU/cm 2), and <b>chair</b> <b>arm</b> (1. 33 4. 69 CFU/cm 2).
