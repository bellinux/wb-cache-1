5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume {{necessary for a}} patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent <b>cases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Many number systems, {{such as the}} {{integers}} and the rationals enjoy {{a naturally}} given group structure. In some <b>cases,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.|$|E

5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 {{may have}} raised again {{the issue of}} which court would hear <b>cases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Hamdan's.

5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether {{invocation of}} Miranda rights could be implied from the behavior or ambiguous {{words of the}} accused. It concluded (in line with previous <b>cases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Davis v.

He analyses the geometry of cells in a frog's egg when it has divided into 4, 8 and even 64 cells. He shows that uniform growth can lead to unequal cell sizes, and argues that the way cells divide {{is driven by the}} shape of the dividing structure (and not vice versa).|$|E

5|$|Unanimity was {{required}} for the decisions of both the Assembly and the Council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific <b>cases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the admission of new members. This requirement was {{a reflection of the}} League's belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the League sought solution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from sports}} that have world-wide appeal and competitions, {{such as the}} Olympic Games, the {{entertainment}} value of a sport depends on the culture and country {{in which it is}} played. For example, in the United States, baseball and basketball games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is rugby union; in Iran, it is freestyle wrestling. Japan's unique sumo wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history. In some <b>cases,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the international running group Hash House Harriers, participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component {{is more important than the}} competitive.|$|E
5|$|Balcer and Wolf {{conceived}} Law & Order: Criminal Intent as {{a police}} procedural crime drama that follows a distinct division of the New York City Police Department: the 'Major Case Squad', and its investigations in to high-profile murder <b>cases,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> those involving VIPs, local government officials and employees, and people working in the financial industry and the arts and entertainment world. Unlike the other series in the Law & Order franchise, Law & Order: Criminal Intent gives significant attention to the actions and motives of the criminals, rather than primarily focusing on the police investigation and trial prosecution. Episodes do not contain trials, and end in confessions rather than plea bargains or verdicts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{semantic}} {{category of}} case (specifically case role) {{is related to}} morphological <b>case.</b> Morphological <b>case</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> accusative, ergative, dative, genitive, and sometimes also partitive) reflects the ranking of arguments, while semantic <b>case</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> instrumental, comitative, locative, directional) encodes a semantic relation between the DP and the governing head. Morphological case is typical of complements and is licensed by structural Case (described below). By contrast, semantic case is typical of adjuncts; it is only licensed by {{the meaning of the}} head. From the case roles proposed by Fillmore (1968), it was demonstrated that case roles appeared where the morphological cases of dative, genitive or instrumental appeared: ...|$|R

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only {{anticonvulsant}} drugs were the sedative bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult <b>cases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E
5|$|Hastings first rose to {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examinations. After his success in Gruban v Booth in 1917, his practice steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King's Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in <b>cases</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Sievier v Wootton and Russell v Russell, his practice was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend. Hastings was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation of the prosecution of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led to the fall of the government after less than a year in power.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some <b>cases,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E
