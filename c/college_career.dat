40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is three-fold: first, to build an understanding of how high school graduates describe their engagement in <b>college</b> and <b>career</b> ready skills, knowledge, and behaviors during and after high school. The second is to understand how graduates describe secondary school <b>college</b> and <b>career</b> development programs and initiatives. Finally, based on graduate descriptions of struggle after high school, the research uncovered gaps in <b>college</b> and <b>career</b> readiness upon graduation. The conceptual framework for the study was grounded in David Conley’s (2014) Four Keys to <b>College</b> and <b>Career</b> Readiness Model, and social cognitive career theory was explored throughout the study. A qualitative interview study was conducted {{to gain a better understanding}} of how students engage in the acquisition of <b>college</b> and <b>career</b> ready skills, and what <b>college</b> and <b>career</b> ready skills they struggle with upon graduation. Interviews of high school graduates from a southwestern Pennsylvania school district were conducted following Clara Hill’s (1997) Consensual Qualitative Research Method interview process. Analysis of the data included deductive coding using the Four Keys to <b>College</b> and <b>Career</b> Readiness (Conley, 2014), and the social cognitive career theory model of career self-management (Lent & Brown, 2013). Second cycle pattern coding revealed themes of how graduates engaged in <b>college</b> and <b>career</b> readiness, and how their secondary school experiences did or did not contribute to their readiness...|$|R
