These include Diapensia lapponica, found {{only on the}} slopes of Sgurr an Utha, Argyll and Mountain Bearberry, recorded at only a few mainland locations, and on Skye and Orkney. The pinewoods of Strathspey contain rare [...] species such as [...] Creeping Lady's Tresses, Twinflower and the One-flowered Wintergreen. Plans to protect the Intermediate Wintergreen, also found here, were introduced in 2008.

6000|$|It {{may seem}} startling, {{possibly}} (though I hope not, for my readers' sake, irreverent), {{to go back}} at once after such thoughts, be they true or false, to the weeds upon the cliff above our heads. But He who is not here, but is risen, yet is here, and has appointed them their services in a wonderful order; and I wish that on some day, or on many days, when a quiet sea and offshore breezes have prevented any new objects from coming to land with the rising tide, you would investigate the flowers peculiar to our sea-rocks and sandhills. Even {{if you do not}} find the delicate lily-like Trichonema of the Channel Islands and Dawlish, or the almost as beautiful Squill of the Cornish cliffs, or the sea-lavender of North Devon, or any of those rare Mediterranean species which Mr. Johns has so charmingly described in his [...] "Week at the Lizard Point," [...] yet an average cliff, with its carpeting of pink thrift and of bladder <b>catchfly,</b> and Lady's finger, and elegant grasses, most of them peculiar to the sea marge, is often a very lovely flower- bed.|$|E
