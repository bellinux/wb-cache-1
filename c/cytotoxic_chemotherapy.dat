If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease.

Childhood ALL, testicular cancer, and Hodgkins disease, previously universally fatal, are now generally curable diseases. Conventional <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> has shown the ability to cure some cancers, including testicular cancer, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and some leukemias.

25|$|The overall {{impact of}} {{chemotherapy}} on cancer survival {{can be difficult}} to estimate, since improved cancer screening, prevention (e.g. anti-smoking campaigns), and detection all influence statistics on cancer incidence and mortality. In the United States, overall cancer incidence rates were stable from 1995 through 1999, while cancer death rates decreased steadily from 1993 through 1999. Again, this likely reflects the combined impact of improved screening, prevention, and treatment. Nonetheless, cancer remains a major cause of illness and death, and conventional <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>chemotherapy</b> has proved unable to cure most cancers after they have metastasized.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the predictors {{and impact of}} <b>cytotoxic</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy</b> for stage IIIa-IV nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in China. Methods: Medical records of 132 patients who underwent chemotherapy from January 2008 to December 2010 in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The response of first-line gemcitabine (GEM) and platinum doublets chemotherapy was evaluated, and the overall survival (OS) of all patients was followed. Further, risk factors of receipt <b>cytotoxic</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy</b> or not were identified and evaluated by univariate analyses. Results: Sixty-six cases have undergone <b>cytotoxic</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy</b> for lung cancer. The OS between patients received first-line GEM plus platinum doublets chemotherapy and patients without <b>cytotoxic</b> second <b>chemotherapy</b> had no statistical difference (P = 0. 73). Smoking or not might be a meaningful predictor for cytotoxic second-line therapy among these patients in this investigation (P 0. 05). In the sub-analysis, {{we found that the}} OS between patients received first-line GEM plus platinum doublets chemotherapy and patients without <b>cytotoxic</b> second <b>chemotherapy</b> had statistical difference in the population whose OS 0. 05). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that though the essentiality of <b>cytotoxic</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy</b> for stage IIIa-IV EGFR mutation indefinite NSCLC is unclear, patients who are blood type AB with poor prognosis and short OS might be a dominant population for <b>cytotoxic</b> second-line <b>chemotherapy...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is not {{understood}} why healthy tissues can exhibit {{varying levels of}} sensitivity to the same toxic stimuli. Using BH 3 profiling, we find that mitochondria of many adult somatic tissues, including brain, heart, and kidneys, are profoundly refractory to pro-apoptotic signaling, leading to cellular resistance to <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>chemotherapies</b> and ionizing radiation. In contrast, mitochondria from these tissues in young mice and humans are primed for apoptosis, predisposing them to undergo cell death in response to genotoxic damage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the efficacy of low dose cytosine arabinoside (LD Ara-C) as an alternative treatment to conventional <b>cytotoxic</b> induction <b>chemotherapy</b> in childhood acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Four children with APL in poor medical condition prior to chemotherapy were treated with LD Ara-C (10 mg/m 2 / 12 h) for 3 weeks. In three patients, the second course was administered after a resting period of two weeks. Subsequent conventional <b>cytotoxic</b> induction <b>chemotherapy</b> was applied in patients who did not enter complete remission (CR). After induction of CR, maintenance chemotherapy with a conventional monthly multi-drug regimen was applied. CR in one patient and partial remission (PR) in two patients were obtained after two courses of LD Ara-C. Patients who did not enter CR after LD Ara-C entered on subsequent conventional chemotherapy. There were no major complications such as intracranial hemorrhage and sepsis; myelosuppression was not as severe as in conventional chemotherapy; there was clinical and laboratory improvement in coagulopathy. We concluded that LD Ara-C may be an alternative treatment to the conventional chemotherapy in children with APL, especially in whom conventional <b>cytotoxic</b> induction <b>chemotherapy</b> is thought to increase the risk of serious complications and early fatality during induction chemotherapy...|$|R

Histological examination of mammary needle biopsy samples revealed SRCC with a non-invasive lobular carcinoma component. Primary breast SRCC with duodenal metastasis was therefore diagnosed.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{advances}} in targeted anticancer therapies have substantially improved {{the prognosis of}} several cancers. Such targeted therapies are not, however, free of side effects, and these side effects are clearly distinct from those induced by classical <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>chemotherapies.</b> This is likely so because targeted therapies are designed to interfere with specific oncogenic signaling pathways rather than to inhibit cell proliferation in general. In fact, interference with specific signaling pathways may lead to effects that mimic those associated with genetic disorders due to alterations in the corresponding signaling pathways. Here, we compare the clinical effects of treatment with BRAF inhibitors with those of genetic RASopathies and find a striking overlap between the inhibitor-induced, iatrogenic dermatoses with the genodermatoses seen in patients with corresponding congenital RASopathies.
