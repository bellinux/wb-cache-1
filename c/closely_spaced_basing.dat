40|$|Resonant Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{is realized}} on <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> nanowire <b>based</b> quantum wells. Phonon quantization consistent with 2. 4 nm thick quantum wells is observed, {{in agreement with}} cross-section transmission electron microscopy measurements and photoluminescence experiments. The creation of a high density plasma within the quantized structures is demonstrated by the observation of coupled plasmon-phonon modes. The density of the plasma and thereby the plasmon-phonon interaction is controlled with the excitation power. This work represents a base for further studies on confined high density charge systems in nanowires...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} {{multiple}} bolted connections {{in accordance with}} Appendix E of the National Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS) has incorporated provisions for evaluating localized member failure modes of row and group tear-out when the connections are <b>closely</b> <b>spaced.</b> Originally <b>based</b> on structural glued laminated timber (glulam) members made with all L 1 Douglas fir-Larch laminating lumber, the NDS provisions were confirmed by additional analysis, which indicates {{the applicability of the}} provisions to glulam with reduced design shear values. Due to the similarity to glulam in the grain orientation and layup strategy, laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is subject to similar failure modes. As a result, a study was initiated by APA – The Engineered Wood Association and the LVL industry, in collaboration with the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to evaluate if a reduced design shear stress is necessary for LVL under similar multiple bolted connection configurations. This paper describes the test results obtained from the study, which indicate that an adequate load factor exists for LVL multiple bolted connections without a reduction in the LVL design shear stress when designed in accordance with Appendix E of the NDS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{communication}} {{system based on}} transmit-reference (TR) ultra-wideband (UWB) is studied and further developed. Introduced by Hoctor and Tomlinson, {{the aim of the}} TR-UWB transceiver is to provide a straightforward impulse radio system, feasible to implement with current technology, and to achieve either high data rate transmissions at short distances or low data rate transmissions in typical office or industrial environments. The main contribution in this paper is the derivation of a signal processing model that takes into account the effects of the radio propagation channel, in particular, for the case where the two pulses in a doublet are <b>closely</b> <b>spaced.</b> Several receivers <b>based</b> on the code-division multiple-access-like properties of the proposed model are derived, and the performance of the algorithms is tested in a simulation. Index Terms—Impulse radio, receiver algorithm, signal processing, transmit-reference (TR), ultra-wideband (UWB). I...|$|R

40|$|Ridge morphometrices on {{placoid scales}} from 12 galeoid shark species were {{examined}} in order to evaluate their potential value for frictional drag reduction. The geometry of the shark scales is similar to longitudinal grooved surfaces (riblets) that have been previously shown to give 8 percent skin-friction reduction for turbulent boundary layers. The present study of the shark scales was undertaken {{to determine if the}} physical dimensions of the ridges on the shark scales are of the right magnitude to be used by the sharks for drag reduction based on previous riblet work. The results indicate that the ridge heights and spacings are normally maintained between the predicted optimal values proposed for voluntary and burst swimming speeds throughout the individual's ontogeny. Moreover, the species which might be considered to be the faster posses smaller and more <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> ridges that <b>based</b> on the riblet work would suggest a greater frictional drag reduction value at the high swimming speeds, as compared to their more sluggish counterparts...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} the thermomechanical characteristics {{of the system of}} <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> bodies considered by many authors. For scalar problems, such as problems of heat, electrostatic, etc., the localization effect was found (so called Tamm's shielding effect), which consists in the fact that in a system of <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> highly conductive bodies, most energy is localized in the region between adjacent bodies. We can assume that the localization of energy is a general property of <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> bodies. The aim is to study the effect of localization of energy in a system of <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> rigid bodies in an elastic medium. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, 2 table...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{bandwidth}} improvement {{method in}} reflectarray anten-nas by using <b>closely</b> <b>space</b> elements, i. e., unit-cell sizes smaller than λ/ 2, {{has been investigated}} both numerically and experimentally in this paper. A new definition of phase error has been introduced to analyze the broadband mechanism of <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> phasing elements. Through full wave EM simulations, it is revealed that <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> elements achieve a smaller phase error over the band. Based on these theoretical studies two Ka-band reflectarrays were fabricated and their performance was measured across the frequency range of 30 to 34 GHz. It is demonstrated that the reflectarray designed with <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> elements achieves a notable improvement in gain bandwidth perfor-mance. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} a prewhitening invariance of noise space (PW-INN) {{as a new}} magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis method, which is particularly suitable for localizing <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> and highly correlated cortical sources under real MEG noise. Conventional source localization methods, such as sLORETA and beamformer, cannot distinguish <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> cortical sources, especially under strong intersource correlation. Our previous work {{proposed a}}n invariance of noise space (INN) method to resolve <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> sources, but its performance is seriously degraded under correlated noise between MEG sensors. The proposed PW-INN method largely mitigates the adverse influence of correlated MEG noise by projecting MEG data to a new space defined by the orthogonal complement of dominant eigenvectors of correlated MEG noise. Simulation results showed that PW-INN is superior to INN, sLORETA, and beamformer in terms of localization accuracy for <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> and highly correlated sources. Lastly, source connectivity between <b>closely</b> <b>spaced</b> sources can be satisfactorily constructed from source time courses estimated by PW-INN but not from results of other conventional methods. Therefore, the proposed PW-INN method is a promising MEG source analysis to provide a high spatial-temporal characterization of cortical activity and connectivity, which is crucial for basic and clinical research of neural plasticity...|$|R
