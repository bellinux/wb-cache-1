5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement. The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked our whole world up when we read it. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy?

500|$|Panait Cerna's {{father was}} an ethnic Bulgarian schoolteacher, also named Panayot Stachov (Panait Stanciov). He settled in Cerna and married Maria Taşcu. The {{daughter}} of local peasants, she was of Aromanian or of Bulgarian origin. Shortly before Maria gave birth to their son, Romanian administration began taking over in previously Ottoman-ruled Northern Dobruja. Stanchov, who was a Bulgarian nationalist, refused to accept this change and left for the Principality of Bulgaria, leaving his family behind. Consequently, Cerna never met his father. By Cerna's own account, his childhood was marked by acute poverty and social isolation: [...] " [...] told to tutor and learn in cold, unfriendly rooms. For a long time, {{we lived in a}} house on the outskirts, which was avoided by other men, since a rumor had spread that ghosts haunted its rooms. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> living in the middle of winter, without a fire on, with doors that barely close, with windows that are glued with paper?

500|$|A Hollywood executive, not {{involved}} with the film, felt it succeeded because it [...] "has a self-deprecating tone that’s riotous. It’s never been done before. It’s poking fun at Marvel. That label takes itself so seriously; <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> them making fun of themselves in a movie?" [...] James Gunn, director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, refuted this and said Deadpool was a success because [...] "it’s original, it’s damn good ... and it wasn’t afraid to take risks". Gunn hoped studios would learn [...] "the right lesson" [...] from the film and not just try to make more films [...] "like Deadpool". After Fox's Logan (2017) also became a success, Forbes Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was [...] "appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes", but [...] "too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work". Graeme McMillan at The Hollywood Reporter concurred, adding, [...] "Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in June 2013 by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (also known as VTsIOM), at least 90 percent of Russians surveyed were in favour of the law. Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law, with Larry Jacobs, manager of the World Congress of Families, supporting its aim to [...] "prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in a lifestyle that would imperil their physical and moral health." [...] President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then-proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that [...] "I want everyone to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities' rights. They're people, just like everyone else, and they enjoy full rights and freedoms". He {{went on to say}} that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it. As he put it, [...] "Can you imagine an organization promoting pedophilia in Russia? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms.... The same is true for sexual minorities: I can hardly imagine same-sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> it? It would have resulted in human casualties." [...] Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia's low birth rate, as same-sex relationships do not produce children. In August 2013, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law, equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction. He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was [...] "invented" [...] by the Western media.|$|E

Me being from L.A., I was trying to rep our entire city alone, so had to step to him". Ice-T also replied {{that he had no}} personal problem with him but just [...] "thought I could beat him rapping anyways". Ice-T stated that he recorded [...] "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F." [...] as a humorous response to LL Cool J's song [...] "I Need Love". Ice-T stated that: [...] "Girls came to me and asked, 'Ice, why don't you write a ballad'? Now <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> saying, 'I need loooove?' That's a wimp. So I wrote ('Girls') as a joke." [...] LL Cool J later retaliated [...] dissing Ice-T in his song [...] "To da Break of Dawn" [...] from his album Mama Said Knock You Out (1990). Afrika Islam said their feud ended when a group meeting involving Flavor Flav, DJ Red Alert, Mike Tyson and Afrika Bambaataa persuaded them to stop fighting. Islam explained Tyson's role: [...] " [...] down with hip-hop and the Zulus and I've always considered rappers like boxers anyway". Ice-T commented on the feud in NME magazine in 2012, stating: [...] "You need a nemesis in hip hop. It's part of what fuels good rap. L was coming out of New York saying he was the best rapper in the world. I was trying to get my feet out of LA. You can't have someone saying they're the best if you're trying to. We had a little hip hop thing but it was never serious." ...|$|E
