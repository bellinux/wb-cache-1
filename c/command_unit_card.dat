5000|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} between two players - either against an AI [...] in single player, or another person in online multiplayer. Matches are {{played on a}} random game board with each player using their own pre-constructed deck of cards. A typical game board will have two stronghold locations, several {{resource}} locations, {{and in some cases}} additional deployment locations. The objective of the game is to win either by capturing your opponent's stronghold, or collecting 60 Domination points (the game's internal scoring mechanic for controlling locations). Each player has a special Hero unit with a once-per-game ability and plays their turn by <b>commanding</b> <b>unit</b> <b>cards</b> and casting action cards.|$|R
