5|$|Benefits Street is a British {{documentary}} series broadcast on Channel 4. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90% of the residents claim benefits. It shows benefits claimants <b>committing</b> <b>crimes,</b> including a demonstration of how to shoplift, and portrays {{a situation in which}} people are dependent on welfare payments and lack the motivation to seek employment.|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs {{is set in}} a {{contemporary}} Hong Kong, which is split into four districts named after regions of the city. The game reveals the story of Wei Shen (Will Yun Lee), a former San Francisco police officer who was transferred to the Hong Kong Police Force and assigned the task to infiltrate and destroy a Triad organization known as the Sun On Yee (based on the Sun Yee On). The main storyline features two sub-plots: Shen's balance between completing his police mission whilst <b>committing</b> <b>crimes</b> to prove himself to the Triads, and missions assigned by a Triad lieutenant, including assassination of Triad members loyal to other lieutenants.|$|E
5|$|Néstor {{established}} {{a law firm}} that Cristina joined in 1979. The firm worked for banks and financial groups that filed eviction lawsuits, which had a growing rate at the time because the 1050 ruling of the Central Bank had increased the interest rates for mortgage loans. The Kirchners acquired twenty-one land lots at cheap prices as {{they were about to}} be auctioned. Their law firm defended military personnel accused of <b>committing</b> <b>crimes</b> during the Dirty War. Forced disappearances were common at the time, but unlike other lawyers the Kirchners never signed a habeas corpus. Julio César Strassera, prosecutor in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas against the military, critizised the Kirchners' lack of legal actions against the military, and considered their later interest in the issue a form of hipocrisy.|$|E
5000|$|An Iranian cleric {{argues that}} fasting during Ramadan makes people {{less likely to}} <b>commit</b> <b>crimes</b> due to spiritual reasons. Gamal al-Banna argues that fasting can stress people out, which can make them more likely to <b>commit</b> <b>crimes.</b> He criticized Muslims who <b>commit</b> <b>crimes</b> while fasting during Ramadan as [...] "fake and superficial".|$|R

5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into <b>committing</b> <b>crimes,</b> and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after <b>committing</b> <b>crimes,</b> are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
5|$|Red Dead Redemption {{makes use}} of a {{morality}} system where players {{have the ability to}} gain positive or negative honor. Honor can be gained by making morally positive choices, such as taking in an outlaw alive or saving a woman from a kidnapping. The player character's overall honor standard is lowered for <b>committing</b> <b>crimes</b> or other negative choices. This works in conjunction with another system, fame, which affects how people react based on Marston's honor status. If Marston has little honor, non-player characters will feel insecure around him. If he has a high amount of honor, other characters will usually greet him and feel safe around him. He will also receive discounts in some stores, more pay for jobs and other bonuses. A very low honor rating can result in a town's establishments closing their doors when Marston arrives. To combat this he can disguise himself by wearing a bandana when performing criminal acts; alternatively, a very negative or criminal reputation warrants the player a large amount of respect and steep discounts from bandits and fencers at criminal hideouts, such as Thieves' Landing.|$|E

25|$|While, per U.S. law, the lower-court {{decision}} cannot bind other courts, legal professionals {{believe it}} could have a social effect by raising other courts' attention to new, digital methods of <b>committing</b> <b>crimes.</b> The case also attempts to redefine the social spectrum and which attitudes and behaviors would qualify as criminal that were not considered criminal before, though considered tragic.|$|E

25|$|As a {{major cause}} of fires in Edo, arsons were {{recorded}} in great numbers. Many of the arrested arsonists were living an impoverished life due to the high cost of living of Edo and ineligibility to work as indentured servants for not having a guarantor. Some of them had had their houses burned down and had little to lose from <b>committing</b> <b>crimes.</b> Among the 102 arsonists arrested in 1723 and 1724 (Kyōhō 8 and 9), 41 were , and 22 had no registered permanent residences. Most of them came from the lower social classes.|$|E

Medellín {{was one of the}} 51 Mexican nationals named in the suit. The following year, the ICJ ruled in Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.

25|$|Bittaker was {{released}} on parole in 1963, after serving two years of this sentence. In October 1964, he was again imprisoned for parole violation. In 1966, Bittaker underwent further examinations by two independent psychiatrists, who declared {{him to be a}} borderline psychotic, highly manipulative individual who was resistant to acknowledging his responsibility for his actions. To one of these psychiatrists, Bittaker explained that his acknowledged criminal activities gave him a feeling of self-importance, although he insisted circumstantial matters decreased his ability to resist <b>committing</b> <b>crimes.</b> Bittaker was prescribed anti-psychotic medication. One year later, in June 1967, he was again released into society.|$|E

25|$|After {{returning}} home to the west from Washington, DC, Knievel decided to stop <b>committing</b> <b>crimes.</b> He joined the motocross circuit and had moderate success, but he still could not {{make enough money to}} support his family. During 1962, Knievel broke his collarbone and shoulder in a motocross accident. The doctors said he could not race for at least six months. To help support his family, he switched careers and sold insurance for the Combined Insurance Company of America, working for W. Clement Stone. Stone suggested that Knievel read Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude, a book that Stone wrote with Napoleon Hill. Knievel credited much of his later success to Stone and his book.|$|E
25|$|Such {{treaties}} {{were regarded}} as grossly unfair by many Chinese. They had always considered themselves to be superior to foreigners, but their prestige was sorely damaged by the treaties, as foreigners were perceived to receive special treatment compared to Chinese. Rumours circulated of foreigners <b>committing</b> <b>crimes</b> {{as a result of}} agreements between foreign and the Chinese governments over how foreigners in China should be prosecuted. In Guizhou, local officials were reportedly shocked to see a cardinal using a sedan chair decorated {{in the same manner as}} one reserved for the governor. The Catholic Church's prohibition on some Chinese rituals and traditions were another issue of contention. Thus in the late 19th century such feelings increasingly resulted in civil disobedience and violence towards both foreigners and Chinese Christians.|$|E
