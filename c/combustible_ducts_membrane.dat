40|$|The Bureau of Mines made {{time-dependent}} calculations {{to determine}} {{the size of a}} stationary source fire within a ventilated duct (or passage-way) necessary to ignite a <b>combustible</b> <b>duct</b> liner. The objective of this work was to gain more understanding of what occurs in duct fires and to determine critical conditions for ignition and propagation of mine fires. Heat transfer to the combustible surface includes both convective and radiated components, while the heat is conducted into the combustible and reradiated to the surroundings. The combustible is assumed to ignite when the net heat transfer to its surface is sufficient to raise the surface temperature to some minimum temperature, defined as the ignition temperature. A nondimensional parameter, which characterizes the source-fire intensity in the presence of ventilation flow, emerges as a parameter for a criterion of the critical conditions. The results of these calculations indicated that the minimum fire size necessary for ignition increases with the ventilation rate and duct cross section. These results are compared with experimental results obtained from fires in a 0. 8 -by 0. 8 -by Il-m-long duct and a full-scale gallery (2. 4 -by 2. 4 -by 65 -m).

BackgroundSeveral aquaporin- (AQP) type water channels {{are expressed in}} kidney tubules and microvessels, including AQP 1 in proximal tubule, thin descending limb of Henle and vasa recta, AQP 2 in collecting <b>duct</b> apical <b>membrane,</b> and AQP 3 and AQP 4 in collecting <b>duct</b> basolateral <b>membrane.</b> Mice deficient in these aquaporins have distinct phenotypic abnormalities. AQP 1 null mice are polyuria and unable to generate a concentrated urine after water deprivation. AQP 2 -T 126 M mutant mice and AQP 3 null mice manifest nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) with severe polyuria, whereas AQP 4 null mice have only a mild defect in maximal urinary concentrating ability. We reasoned that these mice could serve as useful models for gene replacement because of their predictable and unambiguous phenotypes. MethodsIn an initial feasibility study, an adenovirus directing the expression of AQP 1 was introduced into AQP 1 null mice by intravenous infusion. ResultsAt 1 week after adenovirus infusion, AQP 1 was seen in many proximal tubules and microvessels. Compared with untreated null mice, the treated mice were able to partially concentrate their urine and lost less weight after water deprivation. However, AQP 1 transgene expression and functional correction were lost over 3 – 5 weeks. ConclusionAlthough there remain many technical problems to overcome, aquaporin gene replacement has potential applications in hereditary and acquired NDI, and in the transient modulation of renal fluid conservation...|$|R

50|$|Aldosterone plays {{a central}} role in {{regulating}} blood pressure through its effects on the kidney. It acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron and increases reabsorption of sodium from the glomerular filtrate. Reabsorption of sodium results in retention of water, which increases blood pressure and blood volume. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a neurohypophysial hormone found in most mammals. Its two primary functions are to retain water in the body and to constrict blood vessels. Vasopressin regulates the body's retention of water by increasing water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney nephron. Vasopressin increases water permeability of the kidney's collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels in the kidney nephron collecting <b>duct</b> plasma <b>membrane.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{modeling}} {{breast cancer}} {{transition from the}} in situ stage –when the tumor is confined to the duct– to the invasive phase. Such a transition occurs thanks to the degradation of the <b>duct</b> <b>membrane</b> under the action of specific enzymes so-called matrix metallo-proteinases (MMPs). The model consists of advection–reaction equations that hold in the duct and in the surrounding tissue, in order to describe the proliferation and the necrosis of the cancer cells in each subdomain. The divergence of the velocity is given by the increase of the cell densities. Darcy law is imposed in order to close the system. The key-point of the modeling lies {{in the description of}} the transmission conditions across the duct. Nonlinear Kedem-Katchalsky transmission conditions across the membrane describe the discontinuity of the pressure as a linear function of the flux. These transmission conditions make it possible to describe the transition from the in situ stage to the invasive phase at the macroscopic level. More precisely, the membrane permeability increases with respect to the local concentration of MMPs. The cancer cells are no more confined to the duct and the tumor invades the surrounding tissue. The model is enriched by the description of nutrients concentration, tumor necrosis factors, and MMPs production. The mathematical model is implemented in a 3 D C ++-code, which is based on well-adapted finite difference schemes on Cartesian grid. The membrane interface is described by a level-set, and the transmission conditions are precisely approached at the second order thanks to well-suited sharp stencils. Our continuous approach provides new significant insights in the macroscopic modeling of the breast cancer phase transition, due to the membrane degradation by MMP enzymes...|$|R

Separate Ca(2 +) - and cAMP-dependent Cl- currents were identified. Ca(2 +) -dependent Cl- currents showed outward rectification of the current-voltage relation, time-dependent activation at depolarizing potentials, and reversal near the equilibrium potential for Cl-. Ionomycin (2 microM) increased this current from 357 +/- 72 pA to 1, 192 +/- 414 pA (at + 80 mV) in 5 : 7 cells, and stimulated efflux of 125 I > 36 Cl in 15 : 15 studies. Ionomycin-stimulated efflux was inhibited by the Cl- channel blocker 4, 4 '-diisothiocyano- 2, 2 '-stilbene disulfonic acid (DIDS) (150 microM). A separate cAMP-activated Cl- current showed linear current-voltage relations and no time dependence. Forskolin (10 microM) or cpt-cAMP (500 microM) increased this current from 189 +/- 50 pA to 784 +/- 196 pA (at + 80 mV) in 11 : 16 cells, and stimulated efflux of 36 Cl > 125 I in 16 : 16 studies. cAMP-stimulated efflux was unaffected by DIDS. Because the cAMP-stimulated Cl- conductance resembles that associated with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a putative Cl- channel protein, the presence of CFTR in rat liver was examined by immunoblot analyses. CFTR was detected as a 150 - 165 -kD protein in specimens with increased numbers of duct cells. Immunoperoxidase staining confirmed localization of CFTR to bile duct cells but not hepatocytes. These findings suggest that Ca(2 +) - and cAMP-regulated Cl- channels may participate in control of fluid and electrolyte secretion by intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells, and that the cAMP-regulated conductance is associated with endogenous expression of CFTR.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a synthetized presentation of my research {{in order to get}} the French diploma“Habilitation à diriger des recherches”. It is organized into four chapters that constitute the four main topics I focused on since I got mypermanent position at Inria, in September 2008. These research axes have been developed within theframework of the Inria team MC 2, leaded by T. Colin. This thesis is the result of collaborations withcolleagues of Bordeaux and elsewhere (Karlsruhe, Lyon, Rennes, Villejuif) as well as with Phd students andpostdoctoral fellows I co-supervised. Therefore I choose to use we to present the results. Chapter 1 is devoted to cell electropermeabilization modeling. Electropermeabilization (also calledelectroporation) is a significant increase in the electrical conductivity and permeability of cell membranethat occurs when pulses of large amplitude (a few hundred volts per centimeter) are applied to the cells:due to the electric field, the cell membrane is permeabilized, and then nonpermeant molecules can easilyenter the cell cytoplasm by transport (active and passive) through the electropermeabilized membranes. Ifthe pulses are too long, too numerous or if their amplitude is too high, the cell membrane is irreversiblydestroyed and the cells are killed. However, if the pulse duration is sufficiently short (a few milliseconds ora few microseconds, depending on the pulse amplitude), the cell membrane reseals within several tens ofminutes: such a reversible electroporation preserves the cell viability and is used in electrochemotherapy tovectorize the drugs into cancer cells. In Chapter 1, I present the modeling we derived in tight collaborationwith biologists, namely the L. M. Mir’s group at the IGR, which is one of the world’s leader in this field, aswell as the numerical schemes and the comparisons of the numerical simulations with the experimental data. Interestingly, our modeling that uncouples electric and permeable behaviours of the cell membrane makes itpossible to explain the strange observation of cell desensitization, that has been reported very recently by A. Silve et al. [100]. This desensitization {{consists of}} a less degree of cell permeabilization after a few successiveelectric pulses than for the same number of pulses but with a delay between each electric pulse delivery. Thisphenomenon is counter-intuitive and was not predictable by the previous models of the literature. Chapter II is devoted to cell migration modeling and more precisely to the endothelial cell migration onmicropatterned polymers. The goal is to provide models based on the experimental data in order to describethe cell migration on micropatterned polymers. The long–term goal is to provide tools for the optimizationof such a migration, which is crucial in tissue engineering. We develop a continuous model of Patlak-KellerSegeltype, which makes it possible to provide qualitative results in accordance with the experiments, andwe analyse the mathematical properties of this model. Then, we provide an agent-based model, based ona classical mechanics approach. Strikingly, this very simple model has been quantitatively fitted with theexperimental data provided by our colleagues of the biological institute IECB, in terms of cell orientationand cell migration. I conclude the chapter by on-going works on the invadopodia modeling, in collaborationwith T. Suzuki from Osaka University and M. Ohta from Tokyo University of Sciences. Chapter III is devoted to a very recent activity I started in 2013 on tumor growth models, thereforethis chapter is based on only one submitted preprint. I present the results on ductal carcinoma growthmodeling. Originally confined to the milk duct, these breast cancers may become invasive and agressive afterthe degradation of the <b>duct</b> <b>membrane,</b> and the main features of our model is to describe the membranedegradation thanks to a non-linear Kedem–Katchalsky condition that describes the jump of pressure acrossthe <b>duct</b> <b>membrane.</b> More precisely, the membrane permeability is given as a non-linear function of specificenzymes (MMPs) that degrade the membrane. We also provide some possible explanation of heterogeneityof tumor growth by modeling the influence of the micro-environment and the emergence of specific cell types. I eventually conclude by Chapter IV, which {{consists of a}} few advances in asymptotics analysis for domainsthat are singular or asymptotically singular, in the following of my PhD thesis. The results can be split intotwo parts: first I present approximate transmission conditions through a periodically rough thin layer, andhow we characterize the influence of such a layer on the polarization tensor in the sense of Capdeboscq andVoeglius [19]. Then I focus on the numerical treatment of the eddy current problem in domains with cornersingularity. Each chapter is organized into a description of the results, a few perspectives for forthcoming researchand a list of the published papers related to the topic of the chapter. Before presenting the results weobtained, I give in the next part a brief summary in Frenc...|$|R
50|$|Though the {{collecting}} duct {{is normally}} impermeable to water, it becomes permeable {{in the presence}} of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH affects the function of aquaporins, resulting in the reabsorption of water molecules as it passes through the collecting <b>duct.</b> Aquaporins are <b>membrane</b> proteins that selectively conduct water molecules while preventing the passage of ions and other solutes. As much as three-quarters of the water from urine can be reabsorbed as it leaves the collecting duct by osmosis. Thus the levels of ADH determine whether urine will be concentrated or diluted.

40|$|A {{spectral}} method of Chebyshev collocation with domain decomposition is introduced for linear interaction between sound and structure in a duct lined with flexible walls backed by cavities {{with or without}} a porous material. The spectral convergence is validated by a one-dimensional problem with a closed-form analytical solution, and is then extended to the two-dimensional configuration and compared favorably against a previous method based on the Fourier-Galerkin procedure and a finite element modeling. The nonlocal, exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition is embedded in the domain decomposition scheme without imposing extra computational burden. The scheme is applied to the problem of high-frequency sound absorption by duct lining, which is normally ineffective when the wavelength is comparable with or shorter than the duct height. When a tensioned membrane covers the lining, however, it scatters the incident plane wave into higher-order modes, which then penetrate the duct lining more easily and get dissipated.

Since urine concentrating ability varies among mammalian species, we examined whether an homologous protein is present in human kidney. By screening a human kidney cDNA library, we isolated a cDNA clone, designated human aquaporin of collecting duct (hAQP-CD), that encodes a 271 -amino acid protein with 91 % identity to rat AQP-CD. mRNA expression of hAQP-CD was predominant in the kidney medulla compared with the cortex, immunohistochemical staining of hAQP-CD was observed only in the collecting duct cells, and the staining was dominant in the apical domain. Functional expression study in Xenopus oocytes confirmed that hAQP-CD worked as a water channel. Western blot analysis of human kidney medulla indicated that the molecular mass of hAQP-CD is 29 kD, which is the same mass expected from the amino acid sequence. Chromosomal mapping of the hAQP-CD gene assigned its location to chromosome 12 q 13. These results could be important for future studies of the pathophysiology of human urinary concentration mechanisms in normal and abnormal states...|$|R

40|$|Low phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis (LPAC) is {{characterized}} by the association of ABCB 4 mutations and low biliary phospholipid concentration with symptomatic and recurring cholelithiasis. This syndrome is infrequent and corresponds to a peculiar small subgroup of patients with symptomatic gallstone disease. The patients with the LPAC syndrome present typically with the following main features: age less than 40 years at onset of symptoms, recurrence of biliary symptoms after cholecystectomy, intrahepatic hyperechoic foci or sludge or microlithiasis along the biliary tree. Defect in ABCB 4 function causes the production of bile with low phospholipid content, increased lithogenicity and high detergent properties leading to bile <b>duct</b> luminal <b>membrane</b> injuries and resulting in cholestasis with increased serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity. Intrahepatic gallstones may be evidenced by ultrasonography (US), computing tomography (CT) abdominal scan or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, intrahepatic hyperechogenic foci along the biliary tree may be evidenced by US, and hepatic bile composition (phospholipids) may be determined by duodenoscopy. In all cases where the ABCB 4 genotyping confirms the diagnosis of LPAC syndrome in young adults, long-term curative or prophylactic therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) should be initiated early to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of the syndrome and its complications. Cholecystectomy is indicated in the case of symptomatic gallstones. Biliary drainage or partial hepatectomy may be indicated in the case of symptomatic intrahepatic bile duct dilatations filled with gallstones.

The selective deposition of agrin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) microvessels versus sinusoidal walls prompted us {{to investigate the}} utility of agrin immunohistochemistry (IHC) in detecting malignant hepatocellular lesions. We focused on the differential diagnostic problems often presented by hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) and dysplastic nodules. IHC for agrin was performed on 138 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from 93 patients, including cirrhotic liver tissues (25), focal nodular hyperplasia (10), large regenerative nodules (8), low-grade (23) and high-grade (7) dysplastic nodules, small HCC (8), HCC (27), and HCA (30). Agrin immunostaining was {{compared with that of}} CD 34 and, in selected cases, to glypican- 3. The combination of agrin and CD 34 sensitively (0. 94) and specifically (0. 93) identified lesions judged previously as malignant by histology. The majority of benign lesions were clearly agrin-negative, whereas the strength and extent of agrin IHC faithfully reflected dysplasia in ‘‘atypical’’ HCAs and in high-grade dysplastic nodules. Malignant lesions were uniformly positive. In conclusion, as agrin is highly selective for tumor blood vessels, IHC for agrin facilitates the discrimination of benign and malignant hepatocellular lesions. Moreover, whereas glypican- 3 in some HCCs may appear in few scattered cells only, agrin is diffusely deposited in virtually all malignant lesions, which may prove advantageous in the evaluation of small specimens such as core biopsies...|$|R
40|$|The renal {{collecting}} duct is {{a site of}} insulin-like {{growth factor}} I (IGF I) synthesis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is also synthesized within the kidney in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and the distal tubule. EGF {{has been shown to}} regulate IGF I expression in nonrenal tissues. To shed light upon a role of EGF in intrarenal regulation of IGF I gene expression, plasma membranes prepared from collecting ducts isolated from rat kidney and collecting ducts themselves were incubated in the presence and absence of recombinant human EGF (hEGF). hEGF enhanced phospholipase C activity in collecting <b>duct</b> plasma <b>membranes</b> establishing the potential for EGF signal transduction at this site. Inclusion of hEGF in suspensions of collecting ducts increased production of immunoreactive IGF I in a concentration-dependent manner.

Levels of IGF I mRNA in collecting ducts were increased 2. 8 -fold after incubation with 10 (- 6) M hEGF in vitro. Our findings demonstrate a direct action of hEGF to enhance collecting duct IGF I gene expression in vitro. Such enhancement is likely to reflect an effect of EGF to stimulate IGF I production in the collecting duct of the intact kidney. Since EGF is produced in kidney, our findings are consistent with intrarenal paracrine regulation of IGF I gene expression by EGF...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and discuss imaging methods and management strategies for congenital choledochal cyst with co-existing intrahepatic dilation and aberrant bile duct as well as other complicated biliary anomalies. In this study we reviewed and analyzed 72 patients with congenital choledochal cyst, ranging in age from 15 days to 12 years old and who were seen at our hospital during the past 12 years, from January 1993 to October 2005. The image manifestation and clinical significance of patients with coxisting intrahepatic biliary dilation and aberrant bile duct were carefully examined during operation via MRCP, cholangiography and choledochoscope. Twenty-two cases (30. 1 %) presented with intrahepatic bile duct dilation and 12 of these were of the cystic type. That is, the orifice of the dilated intrahepatic tract that converged into the common hepatic <b>duct</b> showed <b>membrane</b> or septum-like stenosis. In 10 cases the dilation tapered off from the porta hepatis to the initiating terminals of the intra-hepatic bile ducts and was not accompanied by stenosis. An aberrant bile duct was observed in 2 of the cases. In 3 cases, the right and left hepatic ducts converged at the choledochal cyst. In conclusion, the imaging methods for intrahepatic bile duct dilation possess important clinical significance. Further, for hepatojejunostomy with radical excision of a choledochal cyst, additional operative procedures for intrahepatic stenosis, possible bile duct malformation and pancreaticobiliary common duct calculi can potentially reduce postoperative complications...|$|R

40|$|The {{pancreatic}} duct epithelium in the guinea-pig {{and many}} other species secretes HCO 3 - at concentrations approaching 150 mM. This cannot be explained by conventional models based upon HCO 3 - secretion via an anion exchanger at the luminal membrane because: 1) under these conditions, the Cl- and HCO 3 - concentration gradients would favour HCO 3 - reabsorption rather than secretion, and 2) the luminal anion exchanger appears to be inhibited by luminal HCO 3 -concentrations of 125 mM or more. There may, however, be a sufficiently large electrochemical gradient to drive HCO 3 - secretion across the luminal membrane via an anion conductance. In contrast to earlier studies on rat <b>ducts,</b> the <b>membrane</b> potential Em in guinea-pig duct cells does not depolarise appreciably upon stimulation with secretagogues but remains constant at about – 60 mV. Consequently, even with 125 mM or more HCO 3 - in the lumen and an estimated 20 mM in the cytoplasm, the electrochemical gradient for HCO 3 -will still favour secretion to the lumen. Under the same conditions, the intracellular Cl- concentration drops to very low levels (approximately 7 mM) presumably because, although Cl- may leave freely through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels in the luminal membrane, there is no major pathway for Cl- uptake across the basolateral membrane. Consequently a HCO 3 [...] rich secretion may arise {{as a result of}} the lack of competition from intracellular Cl- for efflux via the anion conductances at the luminal membrane. Whether CFTR, or another anion conductance, provides such a pathway for HCO 3 - remains to be seen...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{mechanisms}} of toxic action of amitriptyline on the myocardium. Material and methods. Investigations were conducted using the hearts from 30 outbred albino rats, which had been isolated and perfused according to the procedure described by Fallen et al. There were two series of experiments: 1) amitriptyline was added in a dose of 250 ng/ml to Krebs-Henseleit solution (Group 1); 2) the agent was added at another concentration (1250 ng/ml) to the solution passing through the coronary bed (Group 2). The animals were anesthetized with thiopental sodium (25 mg/kg) peritoneally. Results. Amitriptyline depresses myocardial contractility, which is particularly obvious with high-rate pacing. This manifests itself as reduced contractile velocity and force-power parameters and elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure. Amitriptyline lowers the efficacy of glucose and increases the release of enzymes into the coronary <b>duct.</b> Conclusion.

40|$|In {{pursuing}} {{noise and}} wave control with minimal aerodynamic or hydrodynamic sacrifice, a tensioned membrane {{is used to}} line the otherwise rigid <b>duct</b> wall. The <b>membrane</b> vibrates {{in response to the}} grazing incident waves and the vibration serves to reflect the wave towards its source. The mechanism is identical to what happens in a rig of active wave control, but the difference is that the current rig has no active component. For the purpose of wave control, the device has been tested successfully without flow and with moderate flow conditions commonly found in air ventilation systems. When the flow speed is further increased, flow induced vibration occurs. This study reports the phenomena of such vibration under various flow speeds and membrane tensions. Transient process of exponential vibration growth is recorded and analysed together with the boundary layer measurements. The effects of an external cavity as well as the lateral membrane tension are also found to be significant. Other possible mechanisms for the flow induced vibration are also explored and discussed.

40|$|Pancreatic duct {{epithelium}} secretes a HCO 3 −-rich fluid by {{a mechanism}} dependent on cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the apical membrane. However, the exact role of CFTR remains unclear. One {{possibility is that}} the HCO 3 − permeability of CFTR provides a pathway for apical HCO 3 − efflux during maximal secretion. We have therefore attempted to measure electrodiffusive fluxes of HCO 3 − induced by changes in membrane potential across the apical <b>membrane</b> of interlobular <b>ducts</b> isolated from the guinea pig pancreas. This was done by recording the changes in intracellular pH (pHi) that occurred in luminally perfused <b>ducts</b> when <b>membrane</b> potential was altered by manipulation of bath K+ concentration. Apical HCO 3 − fluxes activated by cyclic AMP were independent of Cl− and luminal Na+, and substantially inhibited by the CFTR blocker, CFTRinh- 172. Furthermore, comparable HCO 3 − fluxes observed in ducts isolated from wild-type mice were absent in ducts from cystic fibrosis (ΔF) mice. To estimate the HCO 3 − permeability of the apical membrane under physiological conditions, guinea pig ducts were luminally perfused with a solution containing 125 mM HCO 3 − and 24 mM Cl− {{in the presence of}} 5 % CO 2. From the changes in pHi, membrane potential, and buffering capacity, the flux and electrochemical gradient of HCO 3 − across the apical membrane were determined and used to calculate the HCO 3 − permeability. Our estimate of ∼ 0. 1 µm sec− 1 for the apical HCO 3 − permeability of guinea pig duct cells under these conditions is close to the value required to account for observed rates of HCO 3 − secretion. This suggests that CFTR functions as a HCO 3 − channel in pancreatic duct cells, and that it provides a significant pathway for HCO 3 − transport across the apical membrane...|$|R

The method for the ionothermal synthesis of the aluminum phosphate AlPO 4 -n zeolite membranes includes the steps: enabling precursor solution to be stirred for 1 - 10 hours under the condition of 80 - 100 DEG C to prepare synthesis solution, enabling a metal substrate to be put vertically into the synthesis solution, carrying out the ionothermal synthesis on the synthesis solution, taking out and cooling after the synthesis solution is through the ionothermal synthesis, using distilled water to washing the synthesis solution to be neutral, and drying to get the AlPO 4 -n zeolite membranes. The method for the ionothermal synthesis of the aluminum phosphate AlPO 4 -n zeolite membranes is simple and rapid. The zeolite membranes synthesized by the method is good in compactness, high in ducts of the zeolite membranes and capable of laying flatly {{on the surface of the}} substrate in orientation, preventing corrosive liquid from permeating the substrate from gaps or the <b>ducts</b> of the <b>membranes</b> and being strong in rotproofness. | 一种无任何有机或无机铝源前驱体条件下，离子热合成AlPO 4 -n分子筛膜的方法，其步骤为：将前驱体溶液在 80 ～ 100 ℃条件下搅拌 1 ～ 10 小时制备出合成液；然后将金属基底垂直放入合成液中，对合成液进行离子热合成；合成后取出并冷却至室温，用蒸馏水洗涤至中性，烘干得AlPO 4 -n型分子筛膜。本合成方法简单、快速。采用本发明方法合成的分子筛膜致密性好，分子筛孔道高取向性平铺于基底表面，阻止腐蚀液从膜的空隙处或孔道渗透到基底，耐腐性强。该分子筛合成重复性高，适于工业放大...|$|R
40|$|Proton {{secretion}} in the renal medullary collecting duct {{is thought}} to occur via a luminal proton-ATPase. In order to determine what mechanism(s) participate in proton transport across medullary collecting <b>duct</b> (MCD) cells <b>membranes,</b> intracellular pH (pHi) regulation and proton extrusion rates were measured in freshly prepared suspensions of rabbit outer MCD cells. Cells were separated by protease digestion and purified by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. pHi was estimated fluorometrically using the entrapped intracytoplasmic pH indicator, 6 -carboxyfluorescein. Proton extrusion rates were measured using a pH stat. The resting pHi of MCD cells was 7. 19 +/- 0. 05 (SE) in a nonbicarbonate medium of pH 7. 30. When cells were acidified by exposure to acetate salts or by abrupt withdrawal of ammonium chloride, they exhibited pHi recovery to the resting pHi over a 5 -min time-course. Depletion of greater than 95 % of cellular ATP content by poisoning with KCN {{in the absence of}} glucose inhibited pHi recovery. ATP depletion inhibited proton extrusion from MCD cells. Treatment with N-ethylmaleimide also inhibited pHi recovery. In addition, cellular ATP content was dependent on transmembrane pH gradients, suggesting that proton extrusion stimulated ATP hydrolysis. Neither removal of extracellular sodium nor addition of amiloride inhibited pHi recovery. These results provide direct evidence that a plasma membrane proton-ATPase, but not a Na+/H+ exchanger, plays a role in proton transport and pHi regulation in rabbit MCD...|$|R
40|$|In the renal {{collecting}} duct, vasopressin controls {{transport of}} water and solutes via regulation of membrane transporters such as aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) and the epithelial urea transporter UT-A. To discover proteins potentially involved in vasopressin action in rat kidney collecting <b>ducts,</b> we enriched <b>membrane</b> “raft” proteins by harvesting detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) of the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells. Proteins were identified and quantified with LC-MS/MS. A total of 814 proteins were identified in the DRM fractions. Of these, 186, including several characteristic raft proteins, were enriched in the DRMs. Immunoblotting confirmed DRM enrichment of representative proteins. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of rat IMCDs with antibodies to DRM proteins demonstrated heterogeneity of raft subdomains: MAL 2 (apical region), RalA (predominant basolateral labeling), caveolin- 2 (punctate labeling distributed throughout the cells), and flotillin- 1 (discrete labeling of large intracellular structures). The DRM proteome included GPI-anchored, doubly acylated, singly acylated, cholesterol-binding, and integral membrane proteins (IMPs). The IMPs were, on average, much smaller and more hydrophobic than IMPs identified in non-DRM-enriched IMCD. The content of serine 256 -phosphorylated AQP 2 was greater in DRM than in non-DRM fractions. Vasopressin did not change the DRM-to-non-DRM ratio of most proteins, whether quantified by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, n = 22) or immunoblotting (n = 6). However, Rab 7 and annexin- 2 showed small increases in the DRM fraction in response to vasopressin. In accord with the long-term goal of creating a systems-level analysis of transport regulation, this study has identified {{a large number of}} membrane-associated proteins expressed in the IMCD that have potential roles in vasopressin action...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this study}} is twofold: (a) to produce a flow-through silencer with zero pressure loss for pressure-critical applications, and (b) to tackle low frequency noise with limited sideway space using cavities filled with helium. The work represents a further development of our recently conceived device of a drum-like silencer with conventional air cavity [Huang, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 112, 2014 - 2025 (2002); Choy and Huang, ibid. 112, 2026 - 2035 (2002) ]. Theoretical predictions are validated by experimental data. The new silencer consists of two highly tensioned membranes lining part of a <b>duct,</b> and each <b>membrane</b> is backed by a cavity filled with helium. For a typical configuration of a duct with height h, membrane length L = 7 h, cavity depth hc = 0. 2 h, and tension T = 0. 52 ρ 0 c 0 2 h 2, where ρ 0 and c 0 are the ambient density and speed of sound in air, respectively, the transmission loss has a continuous stop band of TL> 6. 35 dB for frequency 0. 03 c 0 /h to 0. 064 c 0 /h, which is much better than traditional duct lining. In addition to the mechanisms at work for drum silencers with air cavity, the low density of helium reduces the masslike reactance of the cavity on the second in vacuo mode of membrane vibration. The reduction greatly enhances the membrane response at this mode, which is found to be critical for achieving a broadband performance in the low-frequency regime. © 2003 Acoustical Society of America. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{targeting}} of the aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) water channel to the collecting <b>duct</b> apical plasma <b>membrane</b> {{is critical for}} the urine concentrating mechanism and body water homeostasis. However, the trafficking mechanisms that recruit AQP 2 to the plasma membrane are still unclear. Snapin is emerging as an important mediator in the initial interaction of trafficked proteins with target soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (SNAP) receptor (t-SNARE) proteins, and this interaction is functionally important for AQP 2 regulation. We show that in AQP 2 -Madin-Darby canine kidney cells subjected to adenoviral-mediated expression of both snapin and syntaxins, the association of AQP 2 with both syntaxin- 3 and syntaxin- 4 is highly enhanced {{by the presence of}} snapin. In pull-down studies, snapin detected AQP 2, syntaxin- 3, syntaxin- 4, and SNAP 23 from the inner medullary collecting duct. AQP 2 transport activity, as probed by AQP 2 's urea permeability, was greatly enhanced in oocytes that were coinjected with cRNAs of SNARE components (snapin+syntaxin- 3 +SNAP 23) over those injected with AQP 2 cRNA alone. It was not enhanced when syntaxin- 3 was replaced by syntaxin- 4 (snapin+syntaxin- 4 +SNAP 23). On the other hand, the latter combination significantly enhanced the transport activity of the related AQP 3 water channel while the presence of syntaxin- 3 did not. This AQP-syntaxin interaction agrees with the polarity of these proteins' expression in the inner medullary collecting duct epithelium. Thus our findings suggest a selectivity of interactions between different aquaporin and syntaxin isoforms, and thus in the regulation of AQP 2 and AQP 3 activities in the plasma membrane. Snapin plays an important role as a linker between the water channel and the t-SNARE complex, leading to the fusion event, and the pairing with specific t-SNAREs is essential for the specificity of membrane recognition and fusion...|$|R
40|$|Evidence for {{angiotensin}} IV receptors {{in human}} collecting duct cells. Because angiotensin II (Ang II) {{has been found}} at high concentrations in the proximal tubule fluid and because tubular brush border membranes exhibit a marked capacity for degrading Ang II, we thought it of interest to examine the binding sites for Ang II (3 – 8) (referred to as Ang IV), a metabolite of Ang II, downstream in the nephron. We studied the binding of [125 I]-Ang IV and also of [125 I]-Sar 1 Ala 8, Ang II to SV- 40 transformed human collecting <b>duct</b> cell (HCD) <b>membranes.</b> No specific binding site for [125 I]-Sar 1, Ala 8, Ang II and no Ang II-dependent cytosolic calcium response could be observed. Moreover, no signal for the human type I Ang II receptor (hAT 1) mRNA was present in HCD cells. In contrast, [125 I]-Ang IV bound specifically to HCD cell membranes. Mean Kd and Bmax values derived from saturation binding studies were 5. 6 ± 2. 0 nM and 1007. 6 ± 140. 2 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The rank order of affinity for competitive Ang II-related peptides was: Ang IV > Ang III > Ang II > Ang II (4 – 8) > Ang II (1 – 7). [125 I]-Ang IV binding was not modified by nonpeptide AT 1 (losartan) or AT 2 (PD 123177) antagonists. GTPγS and dithiotreitol did not affect [125 I]-Ang IV binding. Ang IV stimulated cAMP production by intact HCD cells {{in the presence of}} forskolin but did not modify cGMP production or cytosolic calcium concentration. Taken together, these results indicate that HCD cells represent a target site for Ang IV but do not possess Ang II receptors...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} {{and size}} distributions of collagen fibrils in Glisson's sheath were investigated in the rat liver to analyse the mechanical environment around the fibrils and their possible cells of origin. Glisson's sheath {{was found to}} contain 2 populations of collagen fibrils with different diameters and distinct localisations, namely fibroblast-associated and bile epithelium-associated. Fibroblast-associated collagen was composed of fibrils arranged in bundles and constituted {{the majority of the}} collagen in Glisson's sheath. Bile epithelium-associated collagen was represented by small dispersed groups of fibrils just beneath the basement membrane of the bile <b>duct.</b> The basement <b>membrane</b> of the bile duct was frequently reduplicated into a few or as many as 10 layers of laminae densae, with scattered collagen fibrils between these laminae. The diameters of the fibrils of both groups of collagen increased in relation to the calibre of the bile duct, whereas at any given place in Glisson's sheath bile epithelium-associated collagen fibrils had a smaller diameter compared with those of the fibroblast-associated fibrils. The increment in fibril diameter along the bile duct is considered to be correlated with the increase in mechanical stress acting on Glisson's sheath. The difference in diameter between the 2 populations as well as the incorporation of fibrils between the laminae densae of the basement membrane of the bile duct supports the view that the bile epithelium-associated collagen is produced by the epithelial cells of the bile duct, thus having a different origin from that of fibroblast-associated collagen. These findings provide the first evidence that the epithelial cells of the interlobular bile duct produce fibril-forming collagen. Furthermore, it is suggested that cholestasis stimulates the epithelial cells of interlobular bile duct to increased synthesis of fibril-forming collagen that is also produced by these cells under physiological conditions...|$|R
