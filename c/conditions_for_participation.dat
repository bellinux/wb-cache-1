40|$|This PhD thesis {{concerns}} {{language and}} racism. The {{aim is to}} explore how racism is reproduced in interaction in public debates on immigration, integration and refugee policy. From a constructivist pragmatic perspective, language is considered as a practice that composes and makes sense of our social world and all the phenomena and individuals that we perceive in it. Racist discourses discriminate against and privilege people by categorising them according to notions of cultural, ethnical, racial, religious and national differences. The thesis has two main themes: 1) the linguistic reproduction of, and response to, racist discrimination and privileging in interaction, and 2) the role of language in various public arenas, and the norms and <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> in these arenas. The thesis comprises five studies. Study I examines racist discourses and <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> in an online newspaper comments section. Study II examines how the phrase “politically correct” is used and negotiated in the same comments section, and how its usage leads to the reproduction and normalisation of racism. Another comments section {{is the focus of}} Study III, in which discriminating and privileging categorisations of Muslims, Islam, Swedes and Sweden are analysed. Study IV examines an anti-racist forum on the social networking site Instagram. In the study, the reproduction of norms of whiteness is analysed, as well as power relations that are evoked, sustained and transformed in interaction. Finally, Study V is an analysis of linguistic, visual and material reproductions of political positions and racist discourses in a debate among party leaders on Swedish television. The thesis demonstrates how normalisation of racism is accomplished in interaction, and how reproduction of hierarchically structured difference and bigoted stereotypes are performed, and challenged, through language. The medium, combined with the user’s speech acts, set up the norms and <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation,</b> and for the discursive processes that reproduce the relations and structures of power...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background To promote {{participation}} by {{parents in the}} care of their child in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), health professionals need better understanding of what facilitates and what obstructs participation. The aim was to elucidate <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> parents' <b>participation</b> {{in the care of}} their child in NICUs. Methods A field study with a hermeneutic lifeworld approach was used and data were collected at two NICUs through participative observations and interviews with representatives of management, staff and parents. Results The results point to a number of contradictions in the way parents were offered the opportunity to participate in neonatal intensive care. Management and staff both had good ambitions to develop ideal care that promoted parent participation. However, the care including the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> parental <b>participation</b> was driven by the terms of the staff, routines focusing on the medical-technical care and environment, and budgetary constraints. Conclusion The result shows that tangible strategies need to be developed in NICUs aimed at optimising <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> parents to be present and involved in the care of their child. </p...|$|R
