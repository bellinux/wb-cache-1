5|$|There {{is little}} {{development}} within the main canyon, although the El Toro Creek area is primarily residential. There is also some {{residential and commercial}} development downstream of State Route 73.

5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a <b>concrete</b> <b>channel,</b> serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a <b>concrete</b> <b>channel</b> again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa Ana River County Beach.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook flows {{across the}} Pocono Plateau and {{passes through the}} Moosic Mountains via a water gap known as the Spring Brook Gap. Its mouth is in the Lackawanna Valley. In its lower reaches, the stream is {{channelized}} in a large open <b>concrete</b> <b>channel.</b> A number of bank stabilization projects have been done on the stream from Berlin Village downstream to its mouth. Some land {{in the vicinity of}} the stream is designated as a 100 year floodplain.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the {{watershed}} of Spring Brook are mountainous and swampy. Further downstream, the stream flows through a water gap in the Moosic Mountains. Sandstone, shale, and some coal are present {{in the vicinity of the}} stream. It has been channelized in a <b>concrete</b> <b>channel</b> for part of its length and is the main source of flooding in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County. The stream is the second-largest tributary of the Lackawanna River. Reservoirs on Spring Brook include the Spring Brook Intake, the Nesbitt Reservoir, the Watres Reservoir. There are three dams on the stream. The watershed is mainly forested, with only a small amount of urban land.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge stormwater into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a <b>concrete</b> <b>channel.</b> In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E

As early as the 1930s, residents in Albany Park and nearby North Park requested help due to flooding. In 1940-41 a WPA project undertaken by the city attempted to alleviate flooding by dredging the riverbed, regrading the river banks and laying a V-shaped <b>concrete</b> <b>channel</b> in the river bed.

500|$|The creek {{begins as}} a storm culvert exiting into {{daylight}} downstream of a shopping center near the intersection of Crown Valley Parkway and Greenfield Drive. It then flows generally south through a concrete storm channel, then diverted into another culvert that takes it underneath a small access road. For the next few miles, the creek parallels Crown Valley Parkway as it winds west and south through a valley almost entirely filled by residential development. The creek flows through a <b>concrete</b> <b>channel</b> and three more culverts before regaining its natural riverbed. At the third of these four culverts, the creek enters Sulphur Creek Park, which follows the Sulphur Creek riparian corridor to where it turns west-northwest into Crown Valley Park, just upstream of Laguna Niguel Regional Park. Here, it receives two small tributaries (Niguel Storm Drain and an unnamed creek flowing from a spring on the hillside) on the left bank. The creek then enters a box-cut <b>concrete</b> <b>channel</b> that takes it to Sulphur Creek Reservoir, a [...] lake about [...] long, formed by a dam at its north end.

2500|$|On August 18–19, 1955, the Still River, which {{normally}} meandered slowly through downtown Danbury, overflowed its banks when Hurricane Diane hit the area, dropping 6 {{inches of rain}} on the city. This was {{in addition to the}} 9 inches that fell from Hurricane Connie five days earlier. The water flooded stores, factories and homes along the river from North Street to Beaver Brook, causing $3 million in damages. Stores downtown on White Street between Main and Maple were especially hard hit. On October 13–16, another 12 inches of rain fell on Danbury, causing the worst flooding in the City’s history. This time, the Still River damaged all bridges across it, effectively cutting the city in half for several days. [...] Flooding was more widespread than in August, and the same downtown areas hit in August were devastated once again. The resulting damage was valued at $6 million, and two people lost their lives. The City determined the river in the downtown area had to be tamed. $4.5 million in federal and state funding were acquired as part of a greater urban renewal project to straighten, deepen, widen, and enclose the river in a <b>concrete</b> <b>channel</b> through the downtown. [...] At the same time, roads were relocated and rebuilt, 123 major buildings were razed and 104 families were relocated. This began various efforts by the City through 1975 towards urban renewal, using another $22 million of federal funding. However, these efforts failed to reinvigorate the central business district.|$|E
