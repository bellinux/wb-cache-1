2500|$|Theiler's murine {{encephalomyelitis}} virus (TMEV) {{leads to}} the development in mice of a progressive CD4+ T cell-mediated response after these cells have infiltrated the CNS. This virus {{has been shown to}} cause <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> in [...] mice that resembles multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in humans that results in the gradual destruction of the myelin sheath coating axons of the CNS. The TMEV mouse virus shares a thirteen amino acid sequence (His-Cys-Leu-Gly-Lys-Trp-Leu-Gly-His-Pro-Asp-Lys-Phe) (PLP (proteolipid protein) 139-151 epitope) with that of a human myelin-specific epitope. Bystander myelin damage is caused by virus specific Th1 cells that cross react with this self epitope. To test the efficacy in which TMEV uses molecular mimicry to its advantage, a sequence of the human myelin-specific epitope was inserted into a non-pathogenic TMEV variant. As a result, there was a CD4+ T cell response and autoimmune demyelination was initiated by infection with a TMEV peptide ligand. In humans, it has recently been shown that there are other possible targets for molecular mimicry in patients with multiple sclerosis. These involve the hepatitis B virus mimicking the human proteolipid protein (myelin protein) and the Epstein-Barr virus mimicking anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (contributes to a ring of myelin around blood vessels).|$|E

The description of the interaction of space radiation within these pathways would be one approach to developing predictive models of space radiation risks. For example, if the pathways that were studied in animal models could be correlated with studies in humans who are suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, an approach to describe risk that uses biochemical degrees-of-freedom could be pursued.

40|$|The {{end product}} of the {{breakdown}} of the heme group of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins is bilirubin. Bilirubin is hydrophobic and cannot be excreted as such. Therefore, mammals have a liver enzyme bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (B-UGT), which conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid, thereby making the molecule much more water soluble. Bilirubin glucuronides are secreted into bile. Patients with Crigler-Najjar (<b>CN)</b> <b>disease</b> have a deficiency in bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and accumulate high serum levels of bilirubin. An animal model for <b>CN</b> <b>disease</b> is the Gunn rat. The obvious target for gene therapy for <b>CN</b> <b>disease</b> is the liver, but because liver cells do only divide infrequently, they are difficult to transduce. To investigate whether cells that are easily transduced can be used to develop gene therapy for <b>CN</b> <b>disease,</b> we have transduced Gunn rat fibroblasts with B-UGT, using a recombinant retrovirus. Gunn rat fibroblasts expressing B-UGT were able to glucuronidate bilirubin present in cell culture media. In this study, we describe the intraperitoneal transplantation of Gunn rats with Gunn rat fibroblasts expressing B-UGT. Transplantation of the fibroblasts corrected the genetic deficiency of the Gunn rats, serum bilirubin concentrations of the transplanted Gunn rats were reduced to normal, and bilirubin glucuronides appeared in bile.

40|$|Crigler-Najjar (<b>CN)</b> <b>disease</b> is an {{inherited}} disorder of bilirubin metabolism. The disease {{is caused by}} a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (B-UGT). Patients with <b>CN</b> <b>disease</b> have high serum levels of the toxic compound, unconjugated bilirubin. The only defect in bilirubin metabolism of CN patients is the absence of B-UGT activity. The transplantation of cells able to glucuronidate bilirubin should therefore lower serum bilirubin levels. The Gunn rat is the animal model of <b>CN</b> <b>disease.</b> Primary Gunn rat fibroblasts (GURF) were transduced with a recombinant retrovirus, capable of transferring B-UGT cDNA. A cell line was obtained expressing B-UGT at a level comparable to hepatocytes. Bilirubin added to the culture medium of these cells was glucuronidated and excreted. The B-UGT activities of transduced GURF and freshly isolated Wistar hepatocytes were compared at different bilirubin concentrations. The specific B-UGT activities of these two cell types were comparable when physiological bilirubin concentrations (5 - 10 microM) were present in the culture media. At higher bilirubin concentrations (20 - 80 microM) the hepatocytes were more active than the transduced GURF. We conclude that with the addition of only one enzyme (B-UGT) fibroblasts can perform the complete set of reactions necessary for bilirubin glucuronidation. The difference in B-UGT activity between transduced GURF and hepatocytes at 20 - 80 microM bilirubin can be explained by lower UDP-glucuronic acid and glutathione S-transferase levels in GURF. Our findings also indicate that these cells could be used to develop extrahepatic gene therapy for CN diseas...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{differentiate}} between Crigler-Najjar (<b>CN)</b> <b>disease</b> types 1 and 2. DESIGN: The patterns of serum bilirubins, bile pigment composition, and phenobarbital response were studied. PATIENTS: Three infants, affected by high serum unconjugated bilirubin concentrations, previously classified as type 1 CN. METHODS: Serum and bile bilirubin pigment composition, {{both before and}} after phenobarbital (PB) treatment, were determined by alkaline methanolysis and high-pressure liquid chromatography. PB was given for at least 3 weeks by oral administration (5 mg/kg bw per day). RESULTS: No diconjugated bilirubin was found either before or after PB treatment in the serum of the three studied infants. In two patients traces of monoconjugated bilirubin were detected before PB therapy, and the ratio of conjugated/total bilirubin (percent) was increased by the PB response. In the third patient, traces of monoconjugated bilirubin appeared only after PB administration. However, the serum unconjugated bilirubin concentration decreased significantly only in the second patient, following the second cycle of PB treatment, leading to the diagnosis of type 2 CN. The analysis of the methyl ester derivatives of bile pigments was also performed on bile samples obtained in two patients by Entero-Test (R) {{both before and after}} PB treatment. An absolute increment in monoesterified bilirubin concentration was found after PB administration, although the percent concentration increased in one case and decreased in the other. No diesterified bilirubin was detected in the bile samples. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that in types 1 and 2 <b>CN</b> <b>disease</b> it is possible to detect traces of monoconjugated but not diconjugated bilirubin both in serum and in bile. Whereas PB treatment is effective in slightly increasing the serum monoconjugated bilirubin concentration even in type 1 <b>CN</b> <b>disease,</b> the diagnosis of type 1 or 2 is based on finding a substantial decrease of serum unconjugated bilirubin following PB administration...|$|R

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial was conducted in 16 patients, simultaneous with their regular treatment (phototherapy, n = 11, and/or phenobarbital, n = 6). Patients received orlistat or place bo, each for 4 - 6 wk. Compared with placebo, orlistat increased fecal fat excretion (+ 333 %) and fecal UCB excretion (+ 43 %). Orlistat treatment significantly decreased plasma UCB concentration (- 9 %). In 7 of 16 patients, the decrease in plasma UCB levels was clinically relevant (> 10 %, mean 21 %). In patients with a clinically relevant response, plasma UCB concentrations during orlistat were strongly, negatively correlated with fecal fat excretion (r = - 0. 93). Clinically relevant response to orlistat treatment was not correlated with age, sex, CN type, BMI, or co-treatment with phototherapy or phenobarbital, but appeared correlated with a relatively lower dietary fat intake.

50|$|Gliosis is the {{universal}} {{response of the}} CNS to tissue injury and {{occurs as a result}} of many acute conditions such as trauma, ischemia, and stroke. In addition, gliosis is present {{in a wide variety of}} CNS pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Korsakoff's syndrome, multiple system atrophy, prion disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS dementia complex, vasculitis, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. In every case, gliosis involves some degree of hypertrophy or proliferation of glial cells, but the extent and nature of the gliosis response vary widely based on the triggering insult. Gliosis in any form entails an alteration in cellular activity that has the potential to create widespread effects on neurons as well as other non-neural cells, causing either a loss of normal functions or a gain of detrimental ones. In this light, gliosis may be seen not only as a characteristic of many neuropathologies but as a potential contributor to, or even cause of, many <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> mechanisms.

50|$|PIOL {{is known}} as a {{masquerade}} syndrome because it frequently simulates the signs and symptoms of uveitis. As such, PIOL is frequently treated with corticosteroids. Occasionally, PIOL has mimicked a retinitis and has been treated with antiviral medication. It is not until the supposed uveitis fails to respond to treatment, becomes recalcitrant to treatment, or shows worsening with discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment that another cause is sought out. If PIOL is suspected, it is important to first obtain a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain to rule out cerebral involvement (PCNSL). If MRI is negative, lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology should be performed to further rule out <b>CNS</b> <b>disease.</b> Histopathologic identification of atypical lymphocytes is considered the gold standard for diagnosing PCNSL/PIOL. If CSF cytology is negative or inconclusive and PIOL is suspected, a vitrectomy is often performed with cytologic analysis.

40|$|IMPORTANCE: Sentinel {{lymph node}} (SLN) surgery {{provides}} reliable nodal staging information with less morbidity than {{axillary lymph node}} dissection (ALND) for patients with clinically node-negative (cN 0) breast cancer. The application of SLN surgery for staging the axilla following chemotherapy for women who initially had node-positive cN 1 breast cancer is unclear because of high false-negative results reported in previous studies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the false-negative rate (FNR) for SLN surgery following chemotherapy in women initially presenting with biopsy-proven cN 1 breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z 1071 trial enrolled women from 136 institutions from July 2009 to June 2011 who had clinical T 0 through T 4, N 1 through N 2, M 0 breast cancer and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Following chemotherapy, patients underwent both SLN surgery and ALND. Sentinel lymph node surgery using both blue dye (isosulfan blue or methylene blue) and a radiolabeled colloid mapping agent was encouraged. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the FNR of SLN surgery after chemotherapy in women who presented with <b>cN</b> 1 <b>disease.</b> We evaluated {{the likelihood that the}} FNR in patients with 2 or more SLNs examined was greater than 10 %, the rate expected for women undergoing SLN surgery who present with <b>cN</b> 0 <b>disease.</b> RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-six women were enrolled in the study. Of 663 evaluable patients with <b>cN</b> 1 <b>disease,</b> 649 underwent chemotherapy followed by both SLN surgery and ALND. An SLN could not be identified in 46 patients (7. 1 %). Only 1 SLN was excised in 78 patients (12. 0 %). Of the remaining 525 patients with 2 or more SLNs removed, no cancer was identified in the axillary lymph nodes of 215 patients, yielding a pathological complete nodal response of 41. 0 % (95 % CI, 36. 7 %- 45. 3 %). In 39 patients, cancer was not identified in the SLNs but was found in lymph nodes obtained with ALND, resulting in an FNR of 12. 6 % (90 % Bayesian credible interval, 9. 85 %- 16. 05 %). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among women with cN 1 breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy who had 2 or more SLNs examined, the FNR was not found to be 10 % or less. Given this FNR threshold, changes in approach and patient selection that result in greater sensitivity would be necessary to support the use of SLN surgery as an alternative to ALND.

40|$|Crigler-Najjar (<b>CN)</b> <b>disease</b> is {{classified}} into two subtypes, type I and II. The molecular {{basis for the}} difference between these types is not well understood. Several mutations in the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase (B-UGT) gene of six CN type I and two CN type II patients were identified. Recombinant cDNAs containing these mutations were expressed in COS cells. B-UGT activity was measured using HPLC and the amount of expressed protein was quantitated using a sandwich ELISA. This enabled us to determine the specific activities of the expressed enzymes. All type I patients examined had mutations in the B-UGT 1 gene that lead to completely inactive enzymes. The mutations in the B-UGT 1 gene of patients with CN type II only partially inactivated the enzyme. At saturating concentrations of bilirubin (75 microM) CN type II patient A had 4. 4 +/- 2 % residual activity and CN type II patient B had 38 +/- 2 % residual activity. Kinetic constants for the glucuronidation of bilirubin were determined. The affinities for bilirubin of B-UGT 1 expressed in COS cells and B-UGT from human liver microsomes were similar with Km of 5. 1 +/- 0. 9 microM and 7. 9 +/- 5. 3 microM, respectively. B-UGT 1 from patient B had a tenfold decreased affinity for bilirubin, Km = 56 +/- 23 microM. At physiological concentrations of bilirubin both type II patients will have a strongly reduced conjugation capacity, whereas type I patients have no B-UGT activity. We conclude that CN type I is caused by a complete absence of functional B-UGT and that in CN type II B-UGT activity is reduce...|$|R

In total, 76 CSF specimens collected from 65 HIV- 1 -positive patients diagnosed with HCMV <b>CNS</b> <b>disease,</b> other non-HCMV-related CNS diseases, or no <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> were tested {{for the presence of}} HCMV pp 67 mRNA using the NucliSens cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp 67 assay (Organon Teknika, Durham, N. C.). The results were compared to those of a nested PCR for the detection of HCMV glycoprotein B DNA and to those obtained by viral culture (54 samples). CSF specimens collected from patients without HCMV <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> yielded the following results: pp 67 assay negative, 62 of 62 specimens; culture negative, 41 of 41 specimens; and PCR negative, 56 of 62 specimens (6 specimens were positive). CSF specimens collected from patients with HCMV <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> yielded the following results: pp 67 assay positive, 9 of 13 specimens; PCR positive, 13 of 13 specimens; and culture positive, 2 of 13 specimens. After resolution of the discordant results, the following positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) for the diagnosis of HCMV <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> were determined. The PPV for PCR, pp 67 assay, and culture were 68. 4, 100, and 100 %, respectively, and the NPV for PCR, pp 67 assay, and culture were 100, 97. 0, and 82. 7 %, respectively. The sensitivities for DNA PCR, pp 67 assay, and culture for the detection of HCMV were 100, 84. 6, and 18 %, respectively, and the clinical specificities were 90. 5, 100, and 100 %, respectively. This study indicates that the detection of HCMV pp 67 mRNA in CSF has good correlation with active HCMV <b>CNS</b> <b>disease,</b> whereas CSF culture is insensitive and qualitative DNA PCR may detect latent nonreplicating virus in CSF from patients without HCMV <b>CNS</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: Although enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) {{is a highly}} effective therapy, CRIM-negative (<b>CN)</b> infantile Pompe <b>disease</b> (IPD) patients typically mount a strong immune response which abrogates the efficacy of ERT, resulting in clinical decline and death. This {{study was designed to}} demonstrate that immune tolerance induction (ITI) prevents or diminishes the development of antibody titers, resulting in a better clinical outcome compared to CN IPD patients treated with ERT monotherapy. Methods: We evaluated the safety, efficacy and feasibility of a clinical algorithm designed to accurately identify CN IPD patients and minimize delays between CRIM status determination and initiation of an ITI regimen (combination of rituximab, methotrexate and IVIG) concurrent with ERT.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze clinicopathological {{backgrounds}} and prognosis of clinical N 1 non-small cell lung cancer and clarify the difference between bulky and non-bulky <b>cN</b> 1 <b>diseases.</b> Methods: We reviewed 110 patients with completely resected cN 1 non-small cell lung cancer and examined the prognostic impact of lymph node size. We classified the swollen lymph nodes into two groups based on their size on chest computed tomography: short-axis diameter ≥ 20 mm (=bulky group) or < 20 mm (=non-bulky group). Results: The bulky group consisted of 10 patients, and the non-bulky group comprised 100 patients. There was no significant difference in the upstaging rate to pathological N 2 between the bulky and non-bulky groups (31 % vs. 30 %; P = 0. 63). The 5 -year recurrence-free survival rate and 5 -year overall survival rate of both groups did not differ significantly (P = 0. 36, P = 0. 30, respectively). Our results suggested the possibility that the size of the swollen lymph nodes had no impact on the prognosis in cN 1 non-small cell lung cancer patients. In comparison of surgical procedure, pneumonectomy was performed in the bulky groupmore frequently than the non-bulky group (70 % vs. 19 %; P < 0. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe report our {{experience}} with 93 consecutive pulmonary artery reconstructions during pulmonary lobectomy {{with regard to}} morbidity, mortality, and long-term survival. MethodsClinical records of all patients who underwent lobectomy with partial or circumferential pulmonary artery resection in a single institution during an 8 -year period were reviewed retrospectively. ResultsLobectomy with partial (n = 90) or circumferential (n = 3) pulmonary artery resection {{was carried out in}} 93 patients. Indications for surgical intervention were non–small cell lung cancer in 87 patients and other malignancy in the remaining 6 patients. Bronchial sleeve resection was associated in 23 patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy had been administered in 34 cases because of <b>cN</b> 2 <b>disease.</b> Operative mortality was 5. 4 %. Postoperative complications occurred in 27 (29. 0 %) patients. All the patients underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scanning 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively, which always showed patency of the pulmonary arteries. In the whole population median and 5 -year survivals were 40 months and 39. 4 %, respectively. Disease-free survival was 41. 4 % at 5 years. Among patients with non–small cell lung cancer, at univariate analysis, tumor size of less than 3 cm; presence of vascular peritumoral emboli, intratumoral emboli, or both; and dyspnea influenced 5 -year survival. Multivariate analysis showed that the size of the primary tumor and the presence of vascular emboli were independent factors of worse outcome. ConclusionsLobectomy with arterial sleeve resection has acceptable mortality and no specific complications. Late results in terms of survival are satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Forty of 150 (27 %) {{patients}} with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) had central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>disease</b> including psychosis (24), seizure (10), coma (2), meningitis (3) and blindness (1). Raynaud's phenomenon (60 %) and antibody to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (78 %) were significantly {{more common in the}} CNS SLE group than non-CNS SLE group. On the contrary, LE cell (40 %) and clinical renal disease (43 %) were less common in the CNS SLE group than the non-CNS SLE group. At the onset of <b>CNS</b> <b>disease,</b> the incidence of elevated n-DNA binding (35 %) and decreased CH 50 (35 %) were significantly lower than in {{patients with}}out <b>CNS</b> <b>disease.</b> Anti-RNP was present in 78 % of the patients at the onset of <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> and 47 % of the patients without CNS disease; this difference was significant (p< 0. 002). Anti-RNP in CSF was demonstrated by the precipitin reaction in 7 patients at the onset of <b>CNS</b> <b>disease.</b> Anti-Sm in CSF was found in only one patient with <b>CNS</b> <b>disease.</b> Enrichment of anti-RNP in CSF over the serum level was demonstrated in 3 patients. Seventy percent of the CNS episodes began within 8 weeks of the initiation or increase in dose of corticosteroids, including 9 patients within the 1 st week, 9 during the 2 nd week, 2 during the 3 rd week, 5 during the 4 th week and 3 during the 5 th to 8 th week.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{involvement}} of ganciclovir-resistant strains {{in the development of}} central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>disease</b> caused by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), 14 AIDS patients with <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> caused by HCMV were studied for the presence of HCMV strains with UL 97 gene mutations associated with ganciclovir resistance by using amplification and direct sequencing of HCMV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF of all seven patients who had not received ganciclovir prior to the development of <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> and four patients who had been receiving the drug for 3 to 8 months contained wild-type UL 97 sequences. The CSF of three patients who had received ganciclovir for 12 to 30 months contained HCMV strains with nucleotide changes leading to single-amino-acid substitutions within conserved UL 97 sites implicated in nucleotide binding (position 460) and substrate recognition (position 591). Patients containing mutant and wild-type strains revealed a similar spectrum of clinical and histopathologic manifestations. These findings indicate that <b>CNS</b> <b>disease</b> in AIDS patients receiving prolonged ganciclovir therapy can be caused by ganciclovir-resistant HCMV strains. Direct genotypic analysis of HCMV DNA within CSF should help to identify ganciclovir-resistant virus and to guide anti-HCMV therapy...|$|E
40|$|Although uncommon, {{cancer of}} an unknown primary (CUP) metastatic to {{cervical}} lymph nodes poses a range of dilemmas relating to optimal treatment. The ideal resolution would be a properly designed prospective randomized trial, but {{it is unlikely that}} this will ever be conducted in this group of patients. Accordingly, knowledge gained from retrospective studies and experience from treating patients with known head and neck primary tumors form the basis of therapeutic strategies in CUP. This review provides a critical appraisal of various treatment approaches described in the literature. Emerging treatment options for CUP with metastases to cervical lymph nodes are discussed in view of recent innovations in the field of head and neck oncology and suitable therapeutic strategies for particular clinical scenarios are presented. For pN 1 or <b>cN</b> 1 <b>disease</b> without extracapsular extension (ECE), selective neck dissection or radiotherapy offer high rates of regional control. For more advanced neck disease, intensive combined treatment is required, either a combination of neck dissection and radiotherapy, or initial (chemo) radiotherapy followed by neck dissection if a complete response is not recorded on imaging. Each of these approaches seems to be equally effective. Use of extensive bilateral neck/mucosal irradiation must be weighed against toxicity, availability of close follow-up with elective neck imaging and guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) when appropriate, the human papillomavirus (HPV) status of the tumor, and particularly against the distribution pattern (oropharynx in the majority of cases) and the emergence rate of hidden primary lesions (< 10 % after comprehensive workup). The addition of systemic agents is expected to yield similar improvement in outcome as has been observed for known head and neck primary tumors...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Primary aim of {{our study}} {{was to assess the}} impact of timing of {{sentinel}} node procedure, pre- versus post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, on final pathologic node-negative rate (pN 0) in patients with clinically node-negative (cN 0) breast cancer. Secondary endpoint was the usability of the sentinel node procedure in patients with clinically node-positive disease that converted to cN 0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were enrolled in two sequentially conducted Dutch phase III trials, studying the impact of two neoadjuvant chemotherapy schedules and use of zoledronic acid on complete pathologic response rate. For the present analyses, patients were excluded if they had not undergone surgical axillary staging. RESULTS: In total 439 patients were included, of whom 230 (52 %) had pre-treatment cN 0. In this group, pN 0 status was seen in 58 % (N = 23) of patients with a sentinel node biopsy post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to 51 % (N = 83) pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including the axillary lymph node dissection whenever performed. In multivariable analysis, timing of sentinel node procedure (pre- versus post- neoadjuvant chemotherapy) was, however, not significantly associated with final pN 0 /pN 0 (i+) status, with an odds ratio of 1. 18 (95 % CI 0. 64 - 2. 18) after correction for age, clinical tumor status, histology, grade, hormone- and HER 2 receptor. Of patients with clinically node-positive disease only 15 % had a final pN 0 status, with a false-negative rate of the sentinel node of 30 %. CONCLUSION: In breast cancer patients with <b>cN</b> 0 <b>disease,</b> sentinel node procedure performed post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy led to nodal down staging, although not statistically significant after multivariate correction for patient and tumor characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Human ß-defensins are {{a family}} of {{antimicrobial}} peptides located at the mucosal surface. Both sequence multi-site variations (MSV) and copy-number variants (CNV) of the defensin-encoding genes are associated with increased risk for various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis and acute pancreatitis. In a case–control study, we investigated the association between MSV in DEFB 104 as well as defensin gene (DEF) cluster copy number (CN), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and chronic pancreatitis (CP). Results Two groups of PDAC (N= 70) and CP (N= 60) patients were compared to matched healthy control groups CARLA 1 (N= 232) and CARLA 2 (N= 160), respectively. Four DEFB 104 MSV were haplotyped by PCR, cloning and sequencing. DEF cluster CN was determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Neither the PDAC nor the CP cohorts show {{significant differences in the}} DEFB 104 haplotype distribution compared to the respective control groups CARLA 1 and CARLA 2, respectively. The diploid DEF cluster CN exhibit a significantly different distribution between PDAC and CARLA 1 (Fisher’s exact test P= 0. 027), but not between CP and CARLA 2 (P= 0. 867). Conclusion Different DEF cluster b CN distribution between PDAC patients and healthy controls indicate a potential protective effect of higher <b>CNs</b> against the <b>disease.</b> </p...|$|R
