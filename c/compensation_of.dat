5|$|Partly due to Maurice's pro-treaty activity, Moore Hall was burnt by anti-treaty {{forces in}} 1923, {{during the final}} months of the Irish Civil War.

5|$|Allied forces {{remained}} in occupation of San Marino {{for a short}} period following the German surrender.

The British government rejected this claim, arguing that as Germany had breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country, it was not liable; it did, however, offer an ex gratia payment of £26,000 in regard to the June bombing, later increased to £80,000 (about 33.6 million lira).|$|E

That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands. For his injuries he demanded a <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks.

All were related to Babli, and included her brother Suresh, cousins Gurdev and Satish, paternal uncle Rajender, and maternal uncle Baru Ram. The leader of the khap panchayat Ganga Raj (52), was given a life sentence for conspiracy, while the driver, Mandeep Singh, held guilty of kidnapping, was given a jail term of seven years. The court asked the Haryana government to provide a <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> ₨100,000 to Chanderpati, who had filed the case.

The wiretap transcripts have not been published, but the Italian newspaper La Repubblica interviewed the former vice-minister of Foreign Affairs in the Berlusconi II Cabinet and socialist executive Margherita Boniver, who admitted the existence of some messages. She later apologized to Mara Carfagna and the case was closed. Carfagna has instead sued for libel newspapers which had mentioned the alleged conversations and had shown some offensive statements. Following the reports, October 9, 2012 the Civil Court of Rome condemned Sabina Guzzanti to <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> 40,000 euro to the former minister, ensuring, as all authorities, that those conversations never existed.|$|E

40|$|Determining {{the angular}} {{momentum}} <b>compensation</b> temperature <b>of</b> ferrimagnets {{is an important}} step towards ferrimagnetic spintronics, but is not generally easy to achieve it experimentally. We propose a way to estimate the angular momentum <b>compensation</b> temperature <b>of</b> ferrimagnets. We find a linear relation between the <b>compensation</b> temperatures <b>of</b> the magnetization and angular momentum in GdFeCo ferrimagnetic materials, which is proved by theoretically as well as experimentally. The linearity comes from the power-law criticality and is governed by the Curie temperature and the Landé g factors of the elements composing the ferrimagnets. Therefore, measuring the magnetization compensation temperature and the Curie temperature, which are easily assessable experimentally, enables to estimate the angular momentum <b>compensation</b> temperature <b>of</b> ferrimagnets. Our study provides efficient avenues into an exciting world of ferrimagnetic spintronics. Comment: 18 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the Blue Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year {{contract}} with the club on July 10, 2008. His base salary for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35million per season. His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), however, as League President Alexander Medvedev claimed that the Blue Jackets owed CSKA Moscow <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> at least $1.5million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. The Blue Jackets and Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the contract. CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and the Blue Jackets believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's contract was one of six reviewed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) {{in an attempt to}} mediate the disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with the Blue Jackets, and he received his transfer.|$|E
5|$|Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley (1886) {{repeated}} Fizeau's {{experiment with}} improved accuracy, addressing several concerns with Fizeau's original experiment: (1) Deformation of the optical components in Fizeau's apparatus could cause artifactual fringe displacement; (2) observations were rushed, since the pressurized {{flow of water}} lasted only a short time; (3) the laminar flow profile of water flowing through Fizeau's small diameter tubes meant that only their central portions were available, resulting in faint fringes; (4) there were uncertainties in Fizeau's determination of flow rate across {{the diameter of the}} tubes. Michelson redesigned Fizeau's apparatus with larger diameter tubes and a large reservoir providing three minutes of steady water flow. His common path interferometer design provided automatic <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> path length, so that white light fringes were visible at once as soon as the optical elements were aligned. Topologically, the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an even number of reflections in each light path. This offered extremely stable fringes that were, to first order, completely insensitive to any movement of its optical components. The stability was such that it was possible for him to insert a glass plate at h or even to hold a lighted match in the light path without displacing the center of the fringe system. Using this apparatus, Michelson and Morley were able to completely confirm Fizeau's results.|$|E
