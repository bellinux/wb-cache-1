25|$|The US Food and Drug Administration {{requires}} that infant formula not made from cow's milk be supplemented with choline. Choline-providing dietary supplement ingredients include: choline chloride, <b>choline</b> <b>bitartrate,</b> citicoline (CDP-choline), L-alpha-glycerophosphocholine (Alpha-GPC), lecithin, phosphatidylcholine.|$|E
50|$|Choline {{chloride}} is mass-produced and is {{an important}} additive in feed especially for chickens where it accelerates growth. It forms a deep eutectic solvent with urea, ethylene glycol, glycerol and many other compounds. Other commercial choline salts are choline hydroxide and <b>choline</b> <b>bitartrate.</b> In foodstuffs the compound is often present as phosphatidylcholine. It is also used as a clay control additive in fluids used for hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
40|$|Choline is a dietary {{component}} and {{precursor of}} acetylcholine, a crucial neurotransmitter for memory-related brain functions. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over experiments, we investigated whether the food supplement <b>choline</b> <b>bitartrate</b> improved declarative memory and working memory in healthy, young students {{one to two}} hours after supplementation. In experiment 1, 28 participants performed a visuospatial working memory task. In experiment 2, 26 participants performed a declarative picture memorization task. In experiment 3, 40 participants performed a verbal working memory task {{in addition to the}} visuospatial working memory and declarative picture task. All tasks were conducted approximately 60 minutes after the ingestion of 2. 0 - 2. 5 g of either <b>choline</b> <b>bitartrate</b> or placebo. We found that choline did not significantly enhance memory performance during any of the tasks. The null hypothesis that choline does not improve memory performance as compared to placebo was strongly supported by Bayesian statistics. These results are in contrast with animal studies suggesting that choline supplementation boosts memory performance and learning. We conclude that choline likely has no acute effects on cholinergic memory functions in healthy human participants...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the concept}} of {{perinatal}} programming environmental factors during fetal development and early postnatal life can influence phenotype in later life by modifying organ and tissue development and the epigenetic information of specific genes which, in turn, induce alteration in gene expression. Global nutrient restriction is a well-established intervention to study fetal programming but choline, a micronutrient essential for tissue growth and development, has not been extensively studied. The aim of this thesis is to investigate long term effects of modifications in maternal macro and micronutrient intake on the offsprings‟ appetite regulation and metabolic health. Twin-pregnant sheep were fed to requirements until 110 days of gestation and then randomised to stay on the same diet (R) or be restricted to 60 % of caloric requirements (N) until term (~ 145 days). Offspring were subsequently subject either to a standard early postnatal growth rate as both twins remained with the mother (S) or to an accelerated growth rate resulting when only one twin remained to be mother fed (A). After weaning, offspring were reared in either a lean (L) or an obesogenic environment (O) until 17 months of age. These interventions gave rise to 4 groups: RAO, NAO, NSO and NSL. There were no differences in body weight, composition or adipocyte size with perinatal nutrient restriction but insulin response to a glucose tolerance test was increased in offspring born to N mothers. Measurement of hypothalamic gene expression in the latter offspring suggested a more orexigenic and cortisol-sensitive regulatory phenotype. During lactation, rats were fed a diet that was either choline-devoid (D), or contained a standard amount of <b>choline</b> either as <b>bitartrate</b> (C) or as phosphatidylcholine (PC). After weaning, female offspring were maintained on a standard choline diet until 11 weeks of age. D mothers had a substantial decrease in food intake and offspring were smaller at weaning but had similar glucose tolerance. Adult offsprings‟ brain phospholipid concentrations were reduced, which may suggest changes in brain development, but food intake and hypothalamic protein expression were unchanged. Intake of different forms of <b>choline,</b> i. e. <b>bitartrate</b> versus PC, during lactation had no long term effects on offspring. Both maternal dietary interventions had long term effects on offspring. Sheep developed the most adverse metabolic phenotype when the offspring were subjected to slow growth in late gestation followed by rapid growth and obesity, with the onset of insulin resistance mediated through changes in peripheral tissues. Maternal choline intake during lactation is essential for the health of the offspring as it alters brain composition. In conclusion, both studies produced results which are consistent with the concept of perinatal programming as adult metabolic health was affected in the sheep study and organ development was affected in a long term manner in the rat study...|$|R
40|$|Gibberella zeae incites Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB), a devastating disease that causes {{extensive}} yield and quality losses to wheat and barley. Of over 700 microbial strains obtained from wheat anthers, 54 {{were able to}} utilize tartaric acid as a carbon source when the compound was supplied as <b>choline</b> <b>bitartrate</b> in liquid culture. Four tartaric acid–utilizing and three nonutilizing strains reduced FHB in initial tests and were selected for further assays. Antagonists were effective against three different isolates of G. zeae when single wheat florets were inoculated with pathogen and antagonist inoculum. All seven antagonists increased 100 -kernel weight when applied simultaneously with G. zeae isolate Z 3639 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|Choline {{chloride}} is a {{well known}} vitamin in animal feed. As {{a matter of fact}} it was isolated {{for the first time in}} 1849 from ox bile. The Greek name for “bile ” is “chole”. Choline itself is an alkaline product. Therefore it has to be neutralized before it can be used in feed or food. For feed, the usual form is choline chloride. For human application the usual form is <b>choline</b> <b>bitartrate.</b> Both products are produced and marketed by Akzo Nobel Functional Chemicals NL-Amersfoort. In the current EU feed additive directive 70 / 524 and the new 1831 / 2003, choline chloride is listed as a vitamin. There are no restrictions in use, neither for the amount in the feed, nor related to the animal. This is an introduction into the 1. quality, related to current and coming EU directives and 2. nutritional aspects, based on function, need, feed conversion etc...|$|E
40|$|Only few {{nutrients}} {{are known}} to enhance cognition. Here we explore whether visuomotor performance can be improved through the intake of the nutrient choline, an essential chemical compound in a vertebrate’s diet. Choline is abundant in for example eggs and shrimps and many animal studies suggest that {{it serves as a}} cognitive enhancer. As choline is important for the communication between motor neurons and the control of skeletal muscles, we assumed that choline supplementation may have positive effects on action coordination in humans. A group of twenty-eight individuals ingested two grams of <b>choline</b> <b>bitartrate</b> or a placebo in two separate sessions. Seventy minutes post ingestion, participants performed a visuomotor aiming task in which they had to rapidly hit the centers of targets. Results showed that participants hit targets more centrally after choline supplementation. Pupil size (a cognition-sensitive biomarker) also significantly decreased after choline intake and correlated positively with the hit distance to the targets and the number of target misses, and negatively with reaction times. These findings point to a choline-induced bias towards action precision in the trade-off between speed and accuracy. The changes in pupil size suggest that choline uptake alters cholinergic functions in the nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of acute and {{prolonged}} (4 -weeks) ingestion of a supplement designed to improve reaction time and subjective measures of alertness, energy, fatigue, and focus compared to placebo. Methods Nineteen physically-active subjects (17 men and 2 women) were randomly assigned to a group that either consumed a supplement (21. 1 ± 0. 6 years; body mass: 80. 6 ± 9. 4 kg) or placebo (21. 3 ± 0. 8 years; body mass: 83. 4 ± 18. 5 kg). During the initial testing session (T 1), subjects were provided 1. 5 g of the supplement (CRAM; α-glycerophosphocholine, <b>choline</b> <b>bitartrate,</b> phosphatidylserine, vitamins B 3, B 6, and B 12, folic acid, L-tyrosine, anhydrous caffeine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and naringin) or a placebo (PL), and rested quietly for 10 -minutes before completing a questionnaire on subjective feelings of energy, fatigue, alertness and focus (PRE). Subjects then performed a 4 -minute quickness and reaction test followed by a 10 -min bout of exhaustive exercise. The questionnaire and reaction testing sequence was then repeated (POST). Subjects reported back to the lab (T 2) following 4 -weeks of supplementation and repeated the testing sequence. Results Reaction time significantly declined (p = 0. 050) between PRE and POST at T 1 in subjects consuming PL, while subjects under CRAM supplementation were able to maintain (p = 0. 114) their performance. Significant performance declines were seen in both groups from PRE to POST at T 2. Elevations in fatigue were seen for CRAM at both T 1 and T 2 (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 000, respectively), but only at T 2 for PL (p = 0. 029). Subjects in CRAM maintained focus between PRE and POST during both T 1 and T 2 trials (p = 0. 152 and p = 0. 082, respectively), whereas significant declines in focus were observed between PRE and POST in PL at both trials (p = 0. 037 and p = 0. 014, respectively). No difference in alertness was seen at T 1 between PRE and POST for CRAM (p = 0. 083), but a significant decline was recorded at T 2 (p = 0. 005). Alertness was significantly lower at POST at both T 1 and T 2 for PL (p = 0. 040 and p = 0. 33, respectively). No differences in any of these subjective measures were seen between the groups at any time point. Conclusion Results indicate that acute ingestion of CRAM can maintain reaction time, and subjective feelings of focus and alertness to both visual and auditory stimuli in healthy college students following exhaustive exercise. However, some habituation may occur following 4 -weeks of supplementation. </p...|$|E
