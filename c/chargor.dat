40|$|AnalysisIn Agnew v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Privy Council {{decided that}} for a fixed charge to be created over a company's present and future book debts, the chargee must {{exercise}} control over both the uncollected book debts and their realised proceeds. Agnew has thus cast doubt upon the correctness of Siebe Gorman v Barclays Bank Limited, where the debenture in question did not specifically restrict the <b>chargor's</b> freedom {{to draw on the}} proceeds after they were paid into a designated account with the chargee. Recently, a Siebe Gorman-type debenture came under judicial scrutiny in National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited. The English High Court held that the control conferred by a Siebe Gorman-type debenture was deficient, whereas the English Court of Appeal took a completely different view. The issue of control concerning charges over book debts is therefore still unsettled. This article examines the control requirement in the light of recent cases. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

50|$|In the High Court, the Vice Chancellor held, {{applying}} the ruling of Lord Millett in the Privy Council decision of Agnew v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (Re Brumark) and declining to follow Re New Bullas Trading Ltd, {{that because the}} charge allowed Spectrum to use the proceeds of the debts in {{the normal course of}} business {{it must have been a}} floating charge (therefore not following Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd either). In the Court of Appeal, Lord Phillips MR held that he was bound by Bullas and where a <b>chargor</b> is prohibited from disposing of receivables before they are collected and must pay them into a chargee’s account, the charge must be construed as fixed. He said Siebe Gorman was correctly decided given that the debenture there clearly restricted the company’s ability to draw on the bank account into which the proceeds of the book debts were paid. The Siebe Gorman form of debenture had been followed for 25 years, and therefore had acquired meaning. Jonathan Parker LJ and Jacob LJ concurred.|$|E

40|$|The Dutch {{mortgage}} (hypotheek) is {{a limited}} real right which gives the creditor a very high rank in the debtor's insolvency and which gives its holder a quick and very practical means of organising a forced sale of the burdened property. The mortgage is in principle accessory to, that is, linked to the secured claim. To give two examples, when the secured claim lapses {{as a result of}} payment the mortgage lapses also and when the secured claim is assigned, the mortgage automatically passes to the assignee. This is called the principle of accessoriness. This principle primarily aims at protecting the mortgagor. In order to enhance the mortgagor's protection the assignee of the secured claim cannot rely on the public land register for the existence or amount of the secured claim. If the secured claim had already been repaid before the assignment, but the claim and mortgage are still registered in the land register, the assignee receives neither a claim nor a mortgage. This Dutch system is contrasted with German law which takes a different approach for the Verkehrshypothek. Here German law favours the bona fide assignee over the debtor by enabling the assignee to rely on the public land register. In the past this applied equally to the more common German Grundschuld (land charge), which was always described as non-accessory. As the non-accessory character has recently given rise to misuse by assignees, the German legislator has changed the law (in the so-called Risikobegrenzungsgesetz) to enable the <b>chargor</b> to set up against the assignee any defences which he had against the assignor, for example the defence that the debt had already been redeemed (partly). This change in the rules on the Grundschuld entered into force on the 19 th August 2008. The effect is that at the moment of enforcement the Grundschuld is accessory, like the Dutch mortgage. The changes did not affect the German Hypothek so that the Verkehrshypothek is now much less accessory than the German Grundschuld, notably at the time of enforcement. This is a very remarkable change because the German Grundschuld has always been the archetype of a non-accessory mortgage. It no longer is. ...|$|E
