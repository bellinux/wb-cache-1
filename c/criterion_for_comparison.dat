A conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of a system model which takes all system variables into account at a high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient, but the technique lacks the necessary information to explain the internal processes, rendering the model less effective.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Protein {{interface}} region {{prediction is}} very helpful for molecular biologists {{since it is}} able to identify specific amino acids potentially inside the interface region for further experimental analysis. This can save specialists time as well as financial budget. Usually, this problem is modeled as a classification problem with contextual information taken into consideration in a post-processing procedure. We claim that this problem can be modeled as a contextual classification problem and propose to use Markov Random Fields – MRF for that. Obtained results show that the performance for this approach is compatible to other methods and deserves further research.

Moreover, by investigating the robustness of other important features of the Bcl- 2 apoptotic switch (including low Bax basal activation, inhibitory role of anti-apoptotic proteins and insensitivity to small perturbations) the direct activation model was further supported. In all, we identified the direct activation model as a more plausible explanation for the Bcl- 2 apoptotic switch...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} comparison between unordered trees, i. e., trees for which the order among siblings is unimportant. The <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>comparison</b> is the distance as measured by a weighted sum {{of the costs of}} deletion, insertion and relabel operations on tree nodes. Such comparisons may contribute to pattern recognition efforts in any field (e. g., genetics) where data can naturally be characterized by unordered trees. In companion work, we have shown this problem to be NP-complete. This paper presents an efflcient enumerative algorithm and several heuristics leading to approximate solutions. The algorithms are based on probabilistic hill climbing and bipartite matching techniques. The paper evaluates the accuracy and time efficiency of the heuristics by applying them to a set of trees transformed from industrial parts based on a previously proposed morphological model.

In contrast to previous studies that use stock returns or future operating cash flows, we use ex post intrinsic value of equity as the <b>criterion</b> <b>for</b> <b>comparison.</b> Ex post intrinsic value of equity is determined adopting both the discounted dividend and residual income models with ex post (future) realizations of dividends/residual income over three- and five-year horizons as inputs. The advantage of using the ex post intrinsic measure is that this measure is not contaminated by the stock markets fixation on reported earnings (Sloan, 1996). Also, unlike future operating cash flows, ex post intrinsic value is a formal and comprehensive measure of the fundamental value of the firms equity. Our findings unambiguously indicate that accrual-based earnings dominates operating cash flows as a summary indicator of ex post intrinsic value. Key words: Earnings, Cash flows, Intrinsic value.
