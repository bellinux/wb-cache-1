5|$|Lundy has {{attracted}} many vagrant birds, in particular species from North America. The island's bird list totals 317 species. This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient murrelet, eastern phoebe and eastern towhee. Records of bimaculated lark, American robin and <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> were also firsts for Britain (American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a RÃ¼ppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E
5|$|The cool, damp habitat {{provided}} by the bogs at Black Moshannon State Park provides a home for some birds {{that are at the}} southern limit of their habitat in central Pennsylvania. The Canada warbler and northern waterthrush nest in the bogs, as do the alder flycatcher, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> swamp sparrow, red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. The olive-sided flycatcher, which is designated as locally extinct in Pennsylvania, has been seen during the breeding season at Black Moshannon State Natural Area. Bird watchers have observed nesting barred owls in the IBA, as well as Virginia rail and sora.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is home to}} rare {{breeding}} {{populations of}} both Gray and red-shouldered hawks. Species which call the Preserve home include Abert's towhee, American yellow warbler, Anna's hummingbird, ash-throated flycatcher, Bell's vireo, black-chinned hummingbird, black phoebe, black-tailed gnatcatcher, brown-crested flycatcher, Bullock's oriole, canyon wren, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> Cooper's hawk, crissal thrasher, curve-billed thrasher, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, greater roadrunner, hooded oriole, ladder-backed woodpecker, Lesser Goldfinch, Lucy's warbler, northern cardinal, phainopepla, song sparrow, summer tanager, tropical kingbird, vermilion flycatcher, western kingbird, willow flycatcher, yellow-billed cuckoo, and the yellow-breasted chat.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat's</b> song is a loud twichety twichety twichety twich. Its call is a soft jip.|$|R
50|$|Future {{studies are}} needed to {{understand}} specific migration patterns of <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats</b> {{in other parts of the}} United States.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} scarce, and is outnumbered in winter by migrant <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats,</b> but {{appears not to}} be endangered. The {{nominate}} subspecies, however, is either very rare or has gone extinct {{in the last years}} of the 20th century.|$|R
25|$|Birdwatching {{activity}} peaks {{each spring}} (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can {{pass through the}} park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation {{in the fall of}} 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.|$|E
500|$|Combined with Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, the Jordan River {{offers one}} of the region's richest bird resources. Over 200 bird species use the river for {{breeding}} habitat or as a stop-over on their migratory routes. [...] Once-common native species such as the willow flycatcher, gray catbird, warbling vireo, American redstart, black tern, and yellow-billed cuckoo are no longer found along the river. The <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> and yellow-breasted chat are still found in small isolated populations. [...] The most common species now found are the black-billed magpie, mourning dove, western meadowlark, barn swallow, and the non-native ring-necked pheasant and starlings.|$|E
50|$|The {{salt marsh}} <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> (Geothlypis trichas sinuosa), is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> a New World warbler.|$|E
50|$|Other {{bird species}} known to inhabit the marsh include: red-winged blackbirds, common grackles, brown-headed cowbirds, sandhill cranes, common mergansers, double-crested cormorants, great blue herons, marsh wrens, tree {{swallows}}, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats,</b> ring-billed gulls, <b>common</b> moorhens, mallard ducks, wood ducks, Canada geese, barn swallows and soras.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} the Bahama yellowthroat is dense dry or damp low scrub, usually drier than the areas used by wintering <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats.</b> It builds a cup nest low in dense vegetation or a tree stump, and lays two eggs. Like other yellowthroats, it forages low in vegetation and feeds on insects {{and other small}} invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a fairly}} high level of bird {{biodiversity}} in the watershed of Tenmile Run. Birds living in the stream's watershed include worm-eating warblers, wood thrushes, ovenbirds, Eastern tufted titmouses, Eastern towhees, veerys, pileated woodpeckers, nuthatches, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats,</b> and American redstarts. Other bird species found in the watershed include scarlet tanagers, black-capped chickadees, and black-throated green warblers.|$|R

50|$|It {{is closely}} related to <b>common</b> <b>{{yellowthroat}},</b> Altamira yellowthroat and Bahama yellowthroat, with which it forms a superspecies, and was formerly considered conspecific.|$|E
5000|$|Species {{of birds}} {{found within the}} park include purple martins, tree swallows, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats,</b> yellow-breasted chats, summer tanagers, blue grosbeaks, and indigo buntings. Sparrows are common in winter, namely the field, Savannah, song, swamp, white-throated, and white-crowned species. Barn owls {{have been known to}} {{frequent}} the old barns in the area. [...] Waterfowl include Canada geese and mallards.|$|R
50|$|Routes of {{migration}} vary {{based on the}} season and location of <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats.</b> During fall migration, from August to October, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats</b> in Canada, Western, Eastern, and Central U.S., and regions outside of the United States all have unique migration routes. When migrating in the fall months, all adults and immature individuals tend to arrive at their migration destinations around the same time. Migration differences in timing and routes are also seen during the spring months from early February to late May in these same groups across the United States, Canada, and other areas. However, males generally arrive at their destination site before the females during the spring migration months. During both fall and spring migration, many birds take time to rest during a stopover period. Some individuals stay at their stopover destinations for several weeks or months while others spend {{only a few days}} resting before they continue on in their migration patterns to their final destination.|$|R
5|$|Wading and {{woodland}} {{birds are}} year-round residents of Pettigrew State Park. The banks of Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River provide {{an abundance of}} cover and food for sandpipers, great blue herons, great egrets, and green herons. The woods are home to bobwhites, pileated woodpeckers, woodcocks, red-cockaded woodpeckers, and mourning doves. Songbirds found at the park include prairie and prothonotary warblers, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats</b> and northern parulas.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} easily {{distinguished}} from wintering <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> by its uniform yellow underparts, whereas the North American bird has a white belly.|$|E
50|$|The male of the {{northern}} subspecies G. b.goldmaii has a pale belly and grey forecrown, making it very similar to some non-migratory southwestern races of <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> which, however, do not overlap in range. It is larger and slightly brighter than the migratory races of <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> which winter in Baja California, and the male's mask extends further onto the nape than {{is the case with}} the visitors. This race is still fairly common, but its range is shrinking through habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> Belding's yellowthroat, and Bahama yellowthroat, with which it forms a superspecies. It has been {{considered}} conspecific with these species.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} habitats {{of these}} birds are marshes and other wet areas with dense low vegetation, {{and may also}} be found in other areas with dense shrub. However, these birds are less common in dry areas. Females appear to prefer males with larger masks. <b>Common</b> <b>yellowthroats</b> nest in low areas of the vegetation, laying 3-5 eggs in a cup-shaped nest. Both parents feed the young.|$|R

5000|$|The Altamira {{yellowthroat}} is 13 cm {{long and}} has a yellow-green back and bright yellow belly. The adult male has a black face mask and yellow crown. Females are similar, but lack the black mask and have an olive crown. This species is easily distinguished from wintering <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats</b> by its uniform yellow underparts, in contrast to commonâs white belly. [...] Males' yellow forehead bands are diagnostic.|$|R
50|$|The Chelsea Wetlands remains crucial habitat to {{wildlife}} including endangered {{species such as}} the California clapper rail and salt marsh <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat.</b> It was once home to egrets.|$|E
50|$|The song of Bahama {{yellowthroat}} is a loud wichety wichety wichety wich, {{similar to}} that of <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat.</b> The call is a softer jip than that of common yellowthoat.|$|E
50|$|Vocalizations {{are very}} similar to those of <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> and are not readily {{distinguishable}} to the human ear. Altamira and common yellowthoats, however, do not respond to tapes of one otherâs songs.|$|E
50|$|Through the {{lobbying}} {{of public interest}} groups, actions were initiated to restore Maplewood Flats back to its natural state. Landscape architect Patrick Mooney, designed all the major enhancement projects for Maplewood Flats, including the freshwater marsh. The projects were installed from 1995 to 2004. In 1997, the system was dedicated {{and is now a}} breeding ground for marsh wrens, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats,</b> wood ducks, American coots, blue-winged teal, red-winged blackbirds, pied-billed grebes, soras and virginia rails.|$|R
40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of migration routes of many birds is limited and researchers have employed various methods to determine migratory patterns. Recently, parasites {{have been used}} to track migratory birds. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether haemosporidian parasite lineages detect significant geographic structure in <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats</b> (Geothlypis trichas). We examined liver tissue or blood from 552 birds sampled from multiple locations throughout the continental United States, southern Canada, and the Bahamas. We found a 52. 7...|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>yellowthroats</b> {{are small}} songbirds that have olive backs, wings and tails, yellow throats and chests, and white bellies. Adult males have black face masks which stretch {{from the sides}} of the neck across the eyes and forehead, which are bordered above with white or gray. Females are similar in {{appearance}}, but have paler underparts and lack the black mask. Immature birds are similar in appearance to the adult female. First-year males have a faint black mask which darkens completely by spring.|$|R
50|$|The creek {{flows through}} coastal {{saltwater}} marsh and coastal brackish-water marsh habitats. The wetlands provide suitable habitat for San Pablo song sparrow, California black rail, saltmarsh <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat,</b> California brackishwater snail, and California clapper rail.|$|E
50|$|The {{salt marsh}} <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> has {{experienced}} a dramatic 80% decline from the early 20th century through 1976. It is a species of concern for protection in efforts to restore Chelsea Wetlands in Hercules, California.|$|E
50|$|The song of Belding's {{yellowthroat}} is a loud wichety wichety wichety wich, {{similar to}} that of <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroat</b> but deeper, fuller, and with some buzzes. The call is a soft jip, again similar to common yellowthoat.|$|E
50|$|The island {{especially}} provides important habitat to many guilds {{of birds}} including: seabirds, shorebirds, marshbirds, waterfowl, songbirds and raptors. During the summer, {{large numbers of}} double-crested cormorants, Virginia rails and various songbirds (Savannah sparrows and <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats)</b> rely on the island for nesting habitat. In addition, Leach's storm-petrels have been confirmed nesting on the Island since 2002 (one of only two sites where this species nests in Massachusetts). During the fall migration, numerous species of raptors (such as peregrine falcons and Cooper's hawks) and neotropical migrants use the island as feeding and resting habitat.|$|R
500|$|The {{sheltered}} open {{waters of}} the bay and the outlying chain of keys provide resting areas for migrating birds on their way between North American, the Caribbean islands, and South America. Many southbound land birds stop in the fall at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, {{just north of the}} park on Key Biscayne, before venturing across the open waters of Biscayne Bay. [...] Northbound spring migrants do likewise on Elliott Key. Most of the small passerine migrants are warblers, with ovenbirds, palm warblers, American redstarts, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats,</b> prairie warblers, worm-eating warblers and black-throated blue warblers accounting for the majority. Migrant raptors include short-tailed hawks, sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, peregrine falcons and swallow-tailed kites, while bald eagles and ospreys nest in the park. Both white-tailed and red-tailed tropicbirds are seen in the park, as are American flamingos, with some of the latter probably escaped captive birds.|$|R
50|$|Each year, {{at least}} many tens of {{thousands}} of birds are killed in North America by flying into windows. In 1997 New York City Audubon launched Project Safe Flight, modeled after Torontoâs Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP), to work toward long-term solutions for the bird collision problem. From the programâs inception through 2013, field volunteers have found more than 6,000 dead or injured birds of more than 100 species. The most frequently harmed species include white-throated sparrows, <b>common</b> <b>yellowthroats,</b> and ovenbirds. Project Safe Flight works with building owners and managers to address site-specific threats to migratory birds and is working with politicians, architects, glass manufacturers and others to seek long-term solutions. Prior to 9/11 the management of the World Trade Center gained a good deal of notice when, at New York City Audubonâs request, they placed protective netting around the lower flowers of 1 WTC and 2 WTC. The netting acted somewhat like a trampoline â instead of striking the glass, the birds just bounced off, unharmed.|$|R
