For instance, polarized light will cause the molecules to isomerize and relax in random positions.

Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation will make an azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically birefringent and dichroic.
