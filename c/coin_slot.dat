500|$|When {{the game}} was first {{introduced}} to a wider industry audience at the November 1982 AMOA show, it was immediately received favorably by the press. Video Games placed Q*bert first in its list of Top Ten Hits, describing it as [...] "the most unusual and exciting game of the show" [...] and stating that [...] "no operator dared to walk away without buying at least one". The <b>Coin</b> <b>Slot</b> reported [...] "Gottlieb's game, Q*BERT, {{was one of the}} stars of the show", and predicted that [...] "The game should do very well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{corporations}} and supermarkets have introduced self-checkout machines, where {{the customer is}} trusted to scan the barcodes (or manually identify uncoded items like fruit), and place the items into a bagging area. The bag is weighed, and the machine halts the checkout when the weight of something in the bag does not match the weight in the inventory database. Normally, an employee is watching over several such checkouts to prevent theft or exploitation of the machines' weaknesses (for example, intentional misidentification of expensive produce or dry goods). Payment on these machines is accepted by debit card/credit card, or cash via <b>coin</b> <b>slot</b> and bank note scanner. Store employees are also needed to authorize [...] "age-restricted" [...] purchases, such as alcohol, solvents or knives, which can either be done remotely by the employee observing the self-checkout, or {{by means of a}} [...] "store login" [...] which the operator has to enter.|$|E

50|$|In {{some parts}} of the world, {{including}} North America, apartment buildings and dormitories often have laundry rooms, where residents share washing machines and dryers. Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a <b>coin</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Coin slots, coin {{returns and}} the coin box, which {{allow for the}} {{exchange}} of money or tokens. They are usually below the control panel. Very often, translucent red plastic buttons are placed in between the coin return and the <b>coin</b> <b>slot.</b> When they are pressed, a coin or token that has become jammed in the coin mechanism is returned to the player. See coin acceptor. Early coin slots could be defeated using a piezo-electric gas fire or gas oven igniter held against the steel bodywork of the cabinet, thus enabling free credits to be obtained. In some arcades, the <b>coin</b> <b>slot</b> is replaced with a card reader that reads data from a game card bought from the arcade operator.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of MetroCards did eliminate one class of unauthorized resale.

50|$|The park is now {{divided into}} three themes: water, as a friend and an enemy, {{historical}} cities and The Netherlands as an inspiration for the world. Each theme offers different activities - from light shows to mixing music. Small <b>coin</b> <b>slots</b> trigger bridges, factories or an oil tanker on fire. While aesthetic improvements have been made, the informative aspect has also been improved. Small television stands show brief video footage or in-depth information. Visitors receive chipped cards upon entry, {{which can be used}} to trigger these.|$|R

25|$|For the 1990 model year, changes {{included}} larger protective laminate {{in front}} of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 & 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side. In addition to an airbag and airbag indicator light on dash, {{there was also a}} redesign of the left side switch panel, which replaced one of the <b>coin</b> <b>slots</b> with the dimmer. Lower dash panel became a two piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally the memory lever on the steering column was removed.|$|R
50|$|Various {{standard}} equipment included interesting {{features such as}} a coat hook on the driver's side, AM radio (AM/FM and AM/FM Cassette were optional), scuff plates and vent windows. The back of the glove compartment door featured <b>coin</b> <b>slots</b> and cup depressions to hold cups and food similar to a food tray on a train. This was a feature only found on this generation and never on later models. It also showed a diagram with lift points {{as well as other}} mechanical information. Sliding rear windows were optional as well as cargo lights, under-hood lights, and many others. Ford offered over 150 options for the seventh-generation F-Series.|$|R

50|$|Poly Play ran on a U880, a clone of the Zilog Z80 CPU, {{which was}} clocked at 2.457600 MHz and a custom sound chip. Its display ran at a {{resolution}} of 512*256 at 50 Hz and supported a palette of ten colours, though it could also use coloured overlays. The machine's <b>coin</b> <b>slot</b> was designed for 50 Pfennig, but it was flawed - the pressure sensor could be deceived by pressing a 1-Pfennig coin very sharply {{into the top of}} the slot. However, this was largely tolerated because the machine was not a capitalistic commercial venture, but a state-owned product found predominantly in FDGB holiday homes, youth hostels and non-profit clubs. The machine ran with a deactivated <b>coin</b> <b>slot</b> in many youth clubs. However, the free play often caused large crowds to form around it, which incited their reactivation.|$|E
50|$|Payment {{by various}} methods may be {{accepted}} by the machines: card via EFTPOS, debit/credit cards, electronic food assistance cards, cash via <b>coin</b> <b>slot</b> and bank note scanner, and in-store gift cards where applicable.

50|$|The European arcade {{version of}} Dragon's Lair was {{licensed}} to Atari Ireland (as was Space Ace later). The cabinet design was therefore {{different from the}} Cinematronics version. The main differences were that the LED digital scoring panel was replaced with an on screen scoring display appearing after each level. The Atari branding was present in various places on the machine (marquee, <b>coin</b> <b>slots,</b> control panel and speaker grill area), and the machines featured the cone LED player start button used extensively on Atari machines. Although licensing for this region was exclusive to Atari, a number of Cinematronics machines were also available from suppliers mostly via a gray import. The original Fantasy Machine was later released as a prototype video game console known as Halcyon.|$|R
5000|$|Although more {{conservative}} than Corgi Toys, Spot-On had several innovations. The Volvo 122 [...] "Amazon" [...] had a sliding sunroof as did the Ford Consul sedan. On some models detailed interiors were featured with appropriately dressed drivers and passengers. For example, the [...] "Tonibell" [...] ice cream van had a moving worker inside the serving area and some models were banks with <b>coin</b> <b>slots</b> in the roof (Gibson 1970, pp. 42-43). The Ford Zodiac was made to appear as a 'press' car (Rixon 2005, p. 75). Also, enhancing the [...] "Spot-On" [...] name, several cars were redesigned to incorporate battery powered working headlights (these cars had no interiors). As seen below, the line-up was particularly British and often focused on British cars not always popular internationally.|$|R
50|$|Kingdom is {{presented}} to the player in a pixel art, two-dimensional screen, with the goal to build up and create a kingdom while surviving various foes that will attempt to capture the player-character's crown, effectively ending their rule. The player starts {{the game with a}} randomly generated king or queen on horseback. The player can move the character on horse to the left or right, including at a gallop, but has no other direct action. As the character passes landmarks, these will produce a few coins, from which the player can pick up by riding over them, and spend on various resources, which will be marked with open <b>coin</b> <b>slots</b> when the character passes near them; to purchase an upgrade, the player must be able to provide all the required coins at that time.|$|R

5000|$|Released in 2005, {{this was}} made to {{celebrate}} the 25th anniversary of Pac-Man. It included Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, and Galaga again; however, Pac-Man was available {{right from the start}} instead of being secret. It still had the option to play the faster versions of the games. There was also a [...] "countertop" [...] version made for homes without the <b>coin</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The company {{involved}} {{will then}} use a computer (called a stage rig controller) to automatically take a [...] "participation fee" [...] which is set by the operator (usually between 40% and 60%). The rest of the credit is then put into the prize pool to be played for. The customer chooses {{when they want to}} play, and insert credit into a <b>coin</b> <b>slot.</b> Almost all games cost either 50p or £1 per board. Most clubs have two possible boards to play per <b>coin</b> <b>slot,</b> known as Board A and Board B. When credit is added to play a game, the A board is automatically lit. In order to bring the B board into play, players are required to insert extra credit and press their claim buttons in order to activate their B boards. Players can also play on their electronic bingo terminals by touching each board that they wish to bring into play. On electronic boards, players can choose from an A, B, C or D board.|$|E

5000|$|When RedEye appeared, it was {{in direct}} {{competition}} with another paper Red Streak, which the Tribunes Chicago competitor the Sun-Times began publishing at the same time. Initially, both papers were handed out for free by [...] "hawkers" [...] on street corners, usually with one vendor from each paper directly next to each other. After about 6 months of the free papers, both companies placed vending boxes throughout the city with the papers thereafter costing 25 cents. At the end of 2005, the Sun-Times discontinued Red Streak. According to Sun-Times publisher John Cruickshank, Red Streak was only launched [...] "to stop Tribune from gaining {{a foothold in the}} paid tabloid market...". Its only purpose was to undermine RedEyes attempt at drawing commuters, customers which have historically belonged to the Sun-Times. [...] At the beginning of 2006, RedEye became a free paper once again, with vending boxes being unlocked and <b>coin</b> <b>slots</b> covered over.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Games {{have evolved}} from the arcade <b>coin</b> <b>slots</b> of the 70 s to Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMOs) costing {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars to develop. Often, MMO budgets only start to break even years after they launched. Hence the need to acquire and retain players, and have them spend extra money in the game by buying virtual items. Hence the need for business intelligence (BI) in MMOs. Beyond its economic and marketing use, BI can also provide feedback and guidance to game designers about their systems and the players they are designing these systems for. From a cross-cultural dataset of 2865 World of Warcraft players, we look at two BI aspects of importance to MMOs: retention and (virtual) gold buying. We introduce three retention metrics: the weekly play time, the stop rate, and the number of years playing WoW. The typical gold buyer is a middle-aged competitive man with a full-time job who does not play with real-life relatives.
