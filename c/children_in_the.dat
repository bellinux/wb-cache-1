5|$|Dickens {{was touched}} by the lot of poor <b>{{children}}</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle decades of the 19th century.

5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the novel was {{considered}} a classic for primary school <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK, and in the United States it was a staple of high-school suggested reading lists.
