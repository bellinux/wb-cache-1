2500|$|Normally, any {{intentional}} {{radio transmission}} requires an FCC license pursuant to Title III. [...] However, {{in recent decades}} the FCC has also opened some spectrum bands for unlicensed operations, typically restricting them to low power levels conducive to short-range applications. [...] This has facilitated the development of a very wide range of common technologies from wireless garage door openers, <b>cordless</b> <b>phones,</b> and baby monitors to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth among others. [...] However, unlicensed devices — like most radio transmission equipment — must still receive technical approval from the FCC before being sold into the marketplace, including to ensure that such devices cannot be modified by end users to increase transmit power above FCC limits.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} types of propagation are used in practical radio transmission systems. [...] Line-of-sight propagation means radio waves which travel {{in a straight line}} from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. [...] Line of sight transmission is used in short to medium range radio transmission such as cell phones, <b>cordless</b> <b>phones,</b> walkie-talkies, wireless networks, [...] FM radio and television broadcasting and radar, and satellite communication, such as satellite television. [...] Line-of-sight transmission {{on the surface of the}} Earth is limited to the distance to the visual horizon, which depends on the height of transmitting and receiving antennas. [...] It is the only propagation method possible at microwave frequencies and above. [...] At microwave frequencies moisture in the atmosphere (rain fade) can degrade transmission.|$|E

50|$|A jazz {{musician}} named Teri Pall invented {{a version of}} the <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> in 1965 but could not market her invention, as its 2 mi range caused its radio signals to interfere with aircraft communications.

2500|$|Line-of-sight {{refers to}} radio waves which travel {{directly}} {{in a line}} from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. [...] It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions. [...] This is the most common propagation mode at VHF and above, and the only possible mode at microwave frequencies and above. [...] On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles (64 km). [...] This is the method used by cell phones, <b>cordless</b> <b>phones,</b> walkie-talkies, wireless networks, [...] point-to-point microwave radio relay links, [...] FM and television broadcasting and radar. [...] Satellite communication uses longer line-of-sight paths; [...] for example home satellite dishes receive signals from communication satellites 22,000 miles (39,000 km) above the Earth, and ground stations can communicate with spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, digital <b>cordless</b> <b>phones</b> in the 900 MHz {{frequency}} range were introduced. Digital signals allowed the phones {{to be more}} secure and decreased eavesdropping—it was relatively easy to eavesdrop on analog cordless phone conversations. In 1995, digital spread spectrum (DSS) was introduced for <b>cordless</b> <b>phones.</b> This technology enabled the digital information to spread in pieces among multiple frequencies between the receiver and the base, thereby making {{it almost impossible to}} eavesdrop on the cordless conversations.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the higher}} {{frequency}} often brings advantages. The 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz band {{are increasingly being}} used {{for a host of}} other devices, including baby monitor, microwave oven, Bluetooth, and wireless LAN; thus, it is likely that a <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> will suffer interference from signals broadcast by those devices, and also may itself generate interference. It is also possible for a <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> to interfere with the 802.11a wireless standard, as the 802.11a standard can be configured to operate in the 5.8 GHz range. However, this can easily be fixed by reconfiguring the wireless LAN device to work in the 5.180 GHz to 5.320 GHz band.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the {{exposure}} of young children to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and potentially associated health effects. We assessed the relationship between residential RF-EMF exposure from mobile phone base stations, residential presence of indoor sources, personal cell <b>phone</b> and <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> use, and children's cognitive function at 5 - 6 years of age. METHODS: Cross-sectional study on children aged 5 - 6 years from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development (ABCD) study, the Netherlands (n= 2354). Residential RF-EMF exposure from mobile phone base stations was estimated with a 3 D geospatial radio wave propagation model. Residential presence of indoor sources (<b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> base stations and Wi-Fi) and children's cell <b>phone</b> and <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> use was reported by the mother. Speed of information processing, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and visuomotor coordination was assessed using the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks. RESULTS: Residential presence of RF-EMF indoor sources was associated with an improved speed of information processing. Higher residential RF-EMF exposure from mobile phone base stations and presence of indoor sources was associated with an improved inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility whereas we observed a reduced inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility with higher personal <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> use. Higher residential RF-EMF exposure from mobile phone base stations was associated with a reduced visuomotor coordination whereas we observed an improved visuomotor coordination with residential presence of RF-EMF indoor sources and higher personal cell phone use. CONCLUSIONS: We found inconsistent associations between different sources of RF-EMF exposure and cognitive function in children aged 5 - 6 years...|$|R
50|$|GIP is a DECT profile, {{meaning a}} set of {{protocols}} that runs over the base DECT system. The most popular profile for DECT is GAP, {{which is used to}} provide <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> service, but this is not used for GIP.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>cordless</b> <b>phones</b> in {{the early}} 21st century are digital. Digital {{technology}} has helped provide clear sound and limit eavesdropping. Many <b>cordless</b> <b>phones</b> have one main base station and {{can add up to}} three or four additional bases. This allows for multiple voice channels that allow three-way conference calls between the bases. This technology also allows multiple handsets to be used at the same time, and up to two handsets can have separate conversations with outside parties.|$|E

50|$|A {{forerunner of}} these types of network was the CT2 <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> system, which {{provided}} access to a looser network (without handover), again with base stations deployed in areas where large numbers of people might need to make calls. CT2's limitations ensured the concept never took off. CT2's successor, DECT, was provided with an interworking profile, GIP so that GSM networks could make use of it for microcellular access, but in practice the success of GSM within Europe, and the ability of GSM to support microcells without using alternative technologies, meant GIP was rarely used, and DECT's use in general was limited to non-GSM private networks, including use as <b>cordless</b> <b>phone</b> systems.|$|R
