40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} continuous infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam in critically ill patients with microbiologically documented infections is currently unknown. We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study in 7 Portuguese intensive care units (ICU). We included 569 critically ill adult {{patients with a}} documented infection and treated with piperacillin/tazobactam admitted {{to one of the}} participating ICU between 2006 and 2010. We successfully matched 173 pairs of patients according to whether they received <b>continuous</b> <b>or</b> conventional <b>intermittent</b> dosing of piperacillin/ tazobactam, using a propensity score to adjust for confounding variables. The majority of patients received 16 g/day of piperacillin plus 2 g/day of tazobactam. The 28 -day mortality rate was 28. 3 % in both groups (p = 1. 0). The ICU and in-hospital mortality were also similar either in those receiving <b>continuous</b> infusion <b>or</b> <b>intermittent</b> dosing (23. 7 % vs. 20. 2 %, p = 0. 512 and 41. 6 % vs. 40. 5 %, p = 0. 913, respectively). In the subgroup of patients with a Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II. 42, the 28 -day mortality rate was lower in the continuous infusion group (31. 4 % vs. 35. 2 %) although not reaching significance (p = 0. 66). We concluded that the clinical efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam in this heterogeneous group of critically ill patients infected with susceptible bacteria was independent of its mode of administration, either continuou...|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Sustained low-efficiency {{dialysis}} (SLED) {{has become}} a frequent renal replacement therapy (RRT) technique used in instable critically ill patients hospitalised in ICU. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of SLED on antibiotics clearance. Despite recent new antibiotics, vancomycin remains an important drug used to treat cocci-gram positive severe infections in ICU. Many studies have reported data regarding clearance of vancomycin during <b>continuous</b> and <b>or</b> <b>intermittent</b> RRT. However, only few data are available regarding vancomycin pharmacokinetic (PK) on SLED. Here, we realised a meta-analysis of vancomycin clearance during continuous and intermittent RRT to model vancomycin PK during SLED.|$|R

40|$|Limited {{diffusive}} {{mass transfer}} is one cause for stagnant groundwater remediations. We characterise the diffusive mass transfer {{process as a}} three stage cyclic process of mass transfer {{into and out of}} stagnant or immobile zones. The first stage is the contamination stage, where net inward diffusive mass transfer happens and the last stage is the remediation stage where the opposite happens. An intermittent stage may happen when the immobile zone has reached equilibrium with the mobile zone. Using an analytical solution for diffusive mass transfer into and out of an immobile zone, we show that decades may be involved to reach this stage for natural systems. If this stage does not get reached, continuous inward diffusion happens during the remediation stage. Then, the remediation period required lasts much longer than the contamination period available. Numerical simulation for a simplified two-layer mobile/immobile system further shows that excessive pumping rates do not speed up remediation, since the rate-limiting process is not significantly affected by this. <b>Intermittent</b> pumping <b>or</b> <b>continuous</b> pumping at low rates is equally effective from remediation point of view. Other criteria are then decisive whether <b>continuous</b> pumping <b>or</b> <b>intermittent</b> pumping is most interesting...|$|R
30|$|Root {{resorption}} {{is prone}} to occur in patients with orthodontic treatment [13], {{but because of the}} presence of several complicated root resorption-related factors, it is difficult to provide accurate reasons [14]. Among these, known patient-related factors include genetic factors [15 – 18]; root resorption or traumatic anamnesis [17, 19]; anamnesis of root canal treatment [19, 20]; anatomical factors such as shape or length of the tooth root [16, 21 – 23], contiguity between the roots of teeth and the cortical bone [24, 25], and density of the alveolar bone [16, 24]; the degree of malocclusion [16, 17, 21, 26]; and patient age [21, 27] and gender [16, 19, 22]. In addition, orthodontic treatment-related factors include treatment duration [22 – 24], strength of the force applied [28], force application method (<b>continuous</b> force <b>or</b> <b>intermittent</b> force) [20, 25, 27], direction of tooth movement [28, 29], displacement of the tooth root [22, 26], and the type of orthodontic appliance [30].
