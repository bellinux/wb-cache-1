25|$|The {{separate}} {{range and}} bearing receiver units could {{operate on a}} number of frequency bands. A common oscillator was used by both receivers, which was sent into the four-tube radio frequency (RF) section. The frequency of the oscillator could be switched between two broad bands, LF band from 54.5 to 66.7MHz, and the HF band from 66.7 to 84.0MHz. The receivers were then fine-tuned using conventional rotating iron cores, which were mechanically connected to tune both receivers from a single dial. To correct for slight differences in the two receivers, the output of one of the cores could be adjusted by sliding a <b>copper</b> <b>ring</b> along post on the core. To ensure that the signal would not reflect off of one of the RF stages, the range receiver added a buffer circuit at the end of RF stage.|$|E
2500|$|Alkyl and aryl copper {{complexes}} aggregate both in {{crystalline form}} and in solution. Aggregation is especially evident for charge-neutral organocopper compounds, i.e. species with the empirical formula (RCu), which adopt cyclic structures. [...] Since each copper center requires {{at least two}} ligands, the organic group is a bridging ligand. [...] This effect {{is illustrated by the}} structure of mesitylcopper, which is a pentamer. A cyclic structure is also seen for CuCH2SiMe3, first 1:1 organocopper compound to be analyzed by X-ray [...] crystallography (1972 by Lappert). This compound is relatively stable because the bulky trimethylsilyl groups provide steric protection. It is a tetramer, forming an 8-membered ring with alternating Cu-C bonds. In addition the four copper atoms form a planar Cu4 ring based on three-center two-electron bonds. The copper to copper bond length is 242 pm compared to 256 pm in bulk copper. In pentamesitylpentacopper a 5-membered <b>copper</b> <b>ring</b> is formed, similar to (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)gold, and pentafluorophenylcopper is a tetramer.|$|E

60|$|When one or {{two more}} pieces of the stone had been got out by the aid of crowbars, the rest was removed without the least difficulty. Another slab two feet square was exposed.

As soon as this casing was cleared, Dias and José took their places on one side, the two brothers on the other.

60|$|Presently a drum {{began to}} beat high above {{us, and we}} {{were taken from the}} chamber and placed in a {{procession}} of many priests, I being the first among the victims. Then the priests set up a chant and we began the ascent of the pyramid, following a road that wound round and round its bulk till it ended on a platform at its summit, which may have measured forty paces in the square. Hence the view of the surrounding country was very fine, but in that hour I scarcely noticed it, having no care for prospects, however pleasing. On the further side of the platform were two wooden towers fifty feet or so in height. These were the temples of the gods, Huitzel God of War and Quetzal God of the Air, whose hideous effigies carved in stone grinned at us through the open doorways. In the chambers of these temples stood small altars, and on the altars were large dishes of gold, containing the hearts of those who had been sacrificed on the yesterday. These chambers, moreover, were encrusted with every sort of filth. In front of the temples stood the altar whereon the fire burned eternally, and before it were a hog-backed block of black marble of the size of an inn drinking table, and a great carven stone shaped like a wheel, measuring some ten feet across with a <b>copper</b> <b>ring</b> in its centre.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study was performed using an oblique rotating barrel cathode to recover copper from a simulated wastewater, which initially contained 100 {{parts per million}} (ppm) of cupric ions. The barrel was a perforated cylindrical polypropylene basket having several axial and circumferential fins on its exterior surface. It was partially filled with <b>copper</b> Raschig <b>rings</b> and was partially submerged in the wastewater at a tilted angle from the horizontal position. During the operation, the barrel was slowly rotating about its axis and the <b>copper</b> <b>rings</b> were made as the cathode by connecting them to a d. c. power supply through a dangler contact. The movement of exterior fins and tumbling motion of <b>copper</b> <b>rings</b> provided a high mass transfer rate and a large cathode area for copper electrodeposition reaction. The cupric ion concentration in the wastewater was reduced to less than 1. 0 ppm, permitting discharge of the treated wastewater to the drain system. With an operating cell voltage of 2. 5 - 5. 0 V, the overall cathode current efficiency was 53 - 20 %, and the electric energy requirement was 4 to 21 kWh per kilogram of copper recovered from the wastewater.

60|$|We {{started on}} the 25th of March in the {{schooner}} Hester Helena, belonging to my friend Mr. Duivenboden, and bound on a trading voyage along the north coast of New Guinea. Having calms and light airs, we were three days reaching Gane, near {{the south end of}} Gilolo, where we stayed to fill up our water-casks and buy a few provisions. We obtained fowls, eggs, sago, plantains, sweet potatoes, yellow pumpkins, chilies, fish, and dried deer's meat; and on the afternoon of the 29th proceeded on our voyage to Dorey harbour. We found it, however, by no means easy to get along; for so near to the equator the monsoons entirely fail of their regularity, and after passing the southern point of Gilolo we had calms, light puffs of wind, and contrary currents, which kept us for five days in sight of the same islands between it and Poppa. A squall them brought us on to the entrance of Dampier's Straits, where we were again becalmed, and were three more days creeping through them. Several native canoes now came off to us from Waigiou on one side, and Batanta on the other, bringing a few common shells, palm-leaf mats, cocoa-nuts, and pumpkins. They were very extravagant in their demands, being accustomed to sell their trifles to whalers and China ships, whose crews will purchase anything at ten times its value. My only purchases were a float belonging to a turtle-spear, carved to resemble a bird, and a very well made palm-leaf box, for which articles I gave a <b>copper</b> <b>ring</b> and a yard of calico. The canoes were very narrow and furnished with an outrigger, and in some of them there was only one man, who seemed to think nothing of coming out alone eight or ten miles from shore. The people were Papuans, much resembling the natives of Aru.|$|E
