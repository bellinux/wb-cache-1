The research confirmed the likelihood that the introduction happened through clouds over the ocean, a phenomenon of intercontinental species dispersal previously reported for bacteria and fungi but not for an alga. <b>Clouds</b> over ocean <b>dispersal</b> is analogous to the intercontinental flights; spores of this alga from Europe are transported to India via clouds that drift across the Arabian Sea.

These sprays {{by their very nature}} will drift for a long distance. In order to {{minimize}} biologically significant off-target drift, careful planning derived from a good understanding of all aspects influencing spray <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> is essential. Three phases of vertical spray <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> occur between emission at the aircraft nozzle and depositing out at ground level: entrainment within the descending aircraft vortices, general atmospheric turbulence and sedimentation. These three phases of movement are influenced by four major factors (assuming aircraft type, speed and weight are constant) : Droplet size, Spray altitude, horizontal wind speed and atmospheric stability. For the small drop sizes effective against adult mosquitoes, sedimentation velocity is very small and so sedimentation plays a minimal role in their vertical transport from aircraft to ground level. But it may be important in regards to the larger droplet fraction produced by inefficient “conventional ” spray systems which produce a spray cloud with a VMD between 50 and 100 microns. There is a paucity of research data describing spray cloud movement in mosquito control aerial adulticiding.

40|$|The recent Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland) {{eruption}} strikingly under-lined {{the vulnerability}} of a globalized society to the atmospheric dispersal of volcanic clouds from even moderate-size eruptions. Ash aggregation controls volcanic clouds dispersal by prematurely remov-ing fi ne particles from the cloud and depositing them more proxi-mally. Physical parameters of ash aggregates have been modeled and derived from ash fallout deposits of past eruptions, yet aggregate sedimentation has eluded direct measurement, limiting our ability to predict the dispersal of volcanic clouds. Here we use fi eld-based, high-speed video analysis together with laboratory experiments to provide the fi rst in situ investigation and parameterization of the physical fea-tures and settling dynamics of ash aggregates from a volcanic cloud. In May 2010, high-speed video footage was obtained of both ash par-ticles and aggregates settling from the Eyjafjallajökull volcano erup-tion cloud {{at a distance of}} 7 km from the vent; fallout samples were collected simultaneously. Experimental laboratory determinations of the density, morphology, and settling velocity of individual ash par-ticles enable their distinction from aggregates. The combination of fi eld and experimental analyses allows a full characterization of the size, settling velocity, drag coeffi cient, and density distributions of ash aggregates as well as the size distribution of their component par-ticles. We conclude that ash aggregation resulted in a tenfold increase in mass sedimentation rate from the cloud, aggravating the ash haz-ard locally and modifying <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> regionally.

Magma discharge rates during explosive eruptions in a still environment have been estimated using steady one-dimensional (1 D) volcanic plume models (e.g., Woods, 1988; Carrazo et al., 2008).

40|$|A {{supernova}} explosion, {{the final}} death throe {{of a massive}} star, creates an expanding bubble of hot gas that overruns up the surrounding medium. When a supernova remnant encounters a dense interstellar cloud, the compression may trigger gravita-tional collapse {{and the formation of}} a new generation of stars. This event can be detected through intense stimulated emission in the 1720 -megahertz transition of the hydroxyl radical, OH, which yields unique insights into the physical processes and conditions occurring during the interaction. S hock waves from supernova explosionshave played a key role in the evolutionof the Milky Way Galaxy by depositing energy and material enriched in heavy ele-ments into interstellar space (1 – 4). The pas-sage of a shock wave past an interstellar molecular cloud contributes to the <b>cloud’s</b> eventual <b>dispersal,</b> but the compression of the cloud’s gas during the interaction may lead to star formation. Interactions between superno-vae and clouds are common: About half of all supernova explosions occur when a massive star (8 MJ, where MJ is the mass of the Sun) exhausts its supply of nuclear fuel (5); and during its short life, the star does not drift very far from its parent cloud. The evolution and appearance of a super-nova remnant (SNR) is also affected by an adjacent cloud in several ways. The expan-sion is slowed at the cloud’s location and the remnant is distorted. A reflected shock is driven into the remnant’s interior as it runs into the obstacle, and the incorporation and heating of cloud material may fill the interior with gas, substantially modifying its x-ray emission (6 – 9). Enhanced particle accelera-tion in the shock front produces synchrotron radiation at radio frequencies, and, if the particle energy is high enough (as in the SNR RCW 86), at x-ray frequencies (10). Interaction between a SNR and a molec-ular cloud is signaled by bright, compact spots—masers (see below) —emitted by OH molecules at a frequency of 1720 MHz (11). About 10 % of SNRs have associated masers and are probably interacting with molecular clouds (12 – 15). Here we review what we have learned about the interaction from these masers, and we describe how they have pro-vided a crucial window into the physical processes induced within the cloud by the interaction...|$|R

Data acquired by Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) have been analyzed to quantify the cloud extent and composition. The VOL-CALPUFF dispersal code was applied to reconstruct the transient and 3 -D evolution of the cloud. Source parameters estimated {{on the base of}} available a posteriori volcanological data sets have been used. Quantitative comparisons between satellite retrievals and modeling results were performed for two selected instants of time during the first and third eruptive phases on a regional scale. Sensitivity of the model to initial volcanological conditions has been analyzed at continental scale. Several complex non intuitive features of cloud dynamics have been highlighted and strengths and limitations of the adopted methods identified. The main findings are: the level of quantitative agreement between satellite observations and numerical results depends on ash cloud composition (particle sizes and concentration) with better agreement for smaller particles and higher concentrations; the agreement between observations and modeling outcomes also depends on the temporal stability of volcanological conditions and the complexity of the meteorological wind field; the irregular dispersion of ash, as reconstructed from satellite data and numerical modeling, can be well explained by the different response of particle sizes to strong vertical wind-shear, and by resuspension processes acting at ground level; eruptive source conditions are the main source of uncertainty in modeling, especially during an ongoing crisis and at long-range scales...|$|R

40|$|We have {{discovered}} that SDSSJ 105213. 51 + 442255. 7 (T 0. 5 ± 1. 0) is a binary in Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging, displaying a large J-to-K-band flux reversal (ΔJ = - 0. 45 ± 0. 09 mag, ΔK = 0. 52 ± 0. 05 mag). We determine a total dynamical mass from Keck orbital monitoring (88 ± 5 M_ Jup) and a mass ratio by measuring the photocenter orbit from CFHT/WIRCam absolute astrometry (M_B/M_A = 0. 78 ± 0. 07). Combining these provides the first individual dynamical masses for any field L or T dwarfs, 49 ± 3 M_ Jup for the L 6. 5 ± 1. 5 primary and 39 ± 3 M_ Jup for the T 1. 5 ± 1. 0 secondary. Such a low mass ratio for a nearly equal luminosity binary implies a shallow mass-luminosity relation over the L/T transition (ΔlogL_ bol/ΔlogM = 0. 6 ^+ 0. 6 _- 0. 8). This provides the first observational support that <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> {{plays a significant role}} in the luminosity evolution of substellar objects. Fully cloudy models fail our coevality test for this binary, giving ages for the two components that disagree by 0. 2 dex (2. 0 σ). In contrast, our observed masses and luminosities can be reproduced at a single age by "hybrid" evolutionary tracks where a smooth change from a cloudy to cloudless photosphere around 1300 K causes slowing of luminosity evolution. Remarkably, such models also match our observed JHK flux ratios and colors well. Overall, it seems that the distinguishing features SDSSJ 1052 + 4422 AB, like a J-band flux reversal and high-amplitude variability, are normal for a field L/T binary caught during the process of <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal,</b> given that the age (1. 11 ^+ 0. 17 _- 0. 20 Gyr) and surface gravity (logg = 5. 0 - 5. 2) of SDSSJ 1052 + 4422 AB are typical for field ultracool dwarfs.

It reads data recorded in various formats (video files, image files, or web-camera image streams), and at various wavelengths (infrared, visible, or ultra-violet). Using a set of filters which can be set interactively, the plume is first isolated from its background. A user-friendly interface then allows tracking of plume ascent and various parameters that characterize plume evolution during emission and ascent. These include records of plume height, velocity, acceleration, shape, volume, ash (fine-particle) loading, spreading rate, entrainment coefficient and inclination angle, as well as axial and radial profiles for radius and temperature (if data are radiometric). Image transformations (dilatation, rotation, resampling) can be performed to create new images with a vent-centered metric coordinate system.

The feedback efficiency, {{as measured by the}} amount of <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> generated by the jet–ISM interactions, is sensitive to the maximum size of clouds in the fractal cloud distribution but not to their volume filling factor. Feedback ceases to be efficient for Eddington ratios Pjet/Ledd 10 − 4, although systems with large cloud complexes 50 pc require jets of Eddington ratio in excess of 10 − 2 to disperse the clouds appreciably. Based on measurements of the bubble expansion rates in our simulations, we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations without a multi-phase treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume filling factor of warm-phase material is less than 0. 1 and the cloud complexes are smaller than ∼ 25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the dense embedded clouds is provided by the ram pressure of the high-velocity flow through the porous channels of the warm phase, flow that has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase gas it has swept up, and is additionally mass loaded by ablated cloud material. This mechanism transfers 10 % to 40 % of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas, accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match those observed in a range of high- and low-redshift radio galaxies hosting powerful radio jets...|$|E

These processes are considered here, including turbulence compression in the outer parts of giant molecular cloud (GMC) cores and GMC envelopes, GMC core formation in an initially supercritical state, and compression-induced triggering in dispersing GMC envelopes. The classical issues related to star formation timescales are addressed: high molecular fractions, low efficiencies, long consumption times for CO and HCN, rapid GMC core disruption {{and the lack of}} a stable core, long absolute but short relative timescales with accelerated star formation, and the slow motions of protostars. We consider stimuli to collapse from changes in the density dependence of the ionization fraction, the cosmic ray ionization rate, and various dust properties at densities above ~ 10 ^ 5 cm^{- 3 }. We favor the standard model of subcritical GMC envelops and suggest they would be long lived if not for disruption by rapid star formation in GMC cores.

To investigate how radiation forces influence realistic turbulent systems, we have conducted a series of numerical simulations employing the Hyperion radiation hydrodynamics solver, considering the regime that is optically thick to ultraviolet (UV) and optically thin to infrared (IR) radiation. Our model clouds cover initial surface densities between Σ_ cl, 0 ∼ 10 - 300 M_ pc^- 2, with varying initial turbulence. We follow them through turbulent, self-gravitating collapse, formation of star clusters, and <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> by stellar radiation. All our models display a lognormal distribution of gas surface density Σ; for an initial virial parameter α_ vir, 0 = 2, the lognormal standard deviation is σ_ ln Σ = 1 - 1. 5 and the star formation rate coefficient ε_ ff,ρ̅ = 0. 3 - 0. 5, both of which are sensitive to turbulence but not radiation feedback. The net star formation efficiency ε_final increases with Σ_ cl, 0 and decreases with α_ vir, 0. We interpret these results via a simple conceptual framework, whereby steady star formation increases the radiation force, such that local gas patches at successively higher Σ become unbound. Based on this formalism (with fixed σ_ ln Σ), we provide an analytic upper bound on ε_final, which is in good agreement with our numerical results. The final star formation efficiency depends on the distribution of Eddington ratios in the cloud and is strongly increased by turbulent compression of gas. Comment: 86 pages, 39 figure...|$|E

We detected two velocity molecular components of 12 km s^- 1 velocity separation, which is continuous over 3 degrees along the plane. In NGC 6334 the two components show similar two-peaked intensity distributions toward the young HII regions and are linked by a bridge feature. In NGC 6357 we found spatially complementary distribution between the two velocity components as well as a bridge feature in velocity. Based on these results we hypothesize that the two clouds in the two regions collided with each other during the last ∼ 1 Myr and triggered formation of the starbursts over ∼ 100 pc along the Galactic plane. We suggest that the formation of the starbursts happened toward the collisional region with initial high molecular column densities. For NGC 6334 we present a scenario which includes spatial variation of the colliding epoch due to non-uniform cloud separation. The scenario possibly explains the apparent age difference among the young O stars in NGC 6334 raging from 10 ^ 4 yrs to 10 ^ 6 yrs, the latest collision happened within 10 ^ 5 yrs toward the youngest stars in NGC 6334 I and I(N) which exhibit molecular outflows without HII regions.

This rendering of the molecular line data allowed for a rapid and efficient way to search for molecular outflows over a large (~ 16 sq. deg.) area. Our outflow-searching technique detected previously known molecular outflows as well as new candidate outflows. Most of these new outflow-related high-velocity features lie in regions that have been poorly studied before. These new outflow candidates more than double the amount of outflow mass, momentum, and kinetic energy in the Perseus cloud complex. Our results indicate that outflows have significant impact on the environment immediately surrounding localized regions of active star formation, but lack the energy needed to feed the observed turbulence in the entire Perseus complex. This implies that other energy sources, in addition to protostellar outflows, are responsible for turbulence on a global cloud scale in Perseus. We studied the impact of outflows in six regions with active star formation within Perseus of sizes in the range of 1 to 4 pc. We find that outflows have enough power to maintain the turbulence in these regions and enough momentum to disperse and unbind some mass from them. We found no correlation between outflow strength and star formation efficiency for the six different regions we studied, contrary to results of recent numerical simulations. The low fraction of gas that potentially could be ejected due to outflows suggests that additional mechanisms other than <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> by outflows are needed to explain low star formation efficiencies in clusters.

40|$|Abstract. Star {{formation}} is enhanced in spiral arms {{because of a}} combination of orbit crowding, cloud collisions, and gravitational instabilities. The characteristic mass for the instability is 10 7 M ⊙ in gas and 10 5 M ⊙ in stars, and the morphology is the familiar beads on a string with 1 - 2 kpc separation. Similar instabilities occur in resonance rings and tidal tails. Sequential triggering from stellar pressure occurs in two ways. For short times and near distances, it occurs in the bright rims and dense knots that lag behind during <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal.</b> For long times, it occurs in swept-up shells and along the periphery of cleared regions. The first case should be common but difficult to disentangle from independent star formation in the same cloud. The second case has a causality condition and a collapse condition and is often easy to recognize. Turbulent triggering produces a hierarchy of dense cloudy structure and an associated hierarchy of young star positions. There should also be a correlation between the duration of star formation {{and the size of the}} region that is analogous to the size-linewidth relation in the gas. The cosmological context is provided by observations of star formation in high redshift galaxies. Sequential and turbulent triggering is not yet observable, but gravitational instabilities are, and they show a scale up from local instabilities by a factor of ∼ 3 in size and ∼ 100 in mass. This is most easily explained as the result of an increase in the ISM turbulent speed by a factor of ∼ 5. In the clumpiest galaxies at high redshift, the clumps are so large that they should interact with each other and merge in the center, where they form or contribute to the bulge...|$|E
40|$|Eruption source {{parameters}} (ESP) characterizing {{volcanic eruption}} plumes are crucial inputs for atmospheric tephra dispersal models, used for hazard assessment and risk mitigation. We present FPLUME- 1. 0, a steady-state 1 -D (one-dimensional) cross-section-averaged eruption column model {{based on the}} buoyant plume theory (BPT). The model accounts for plume bending by wind, entrainment of ambient moisture, effects of water phase changes, particle fallout and re-entrainment, a new parameterization for the air entrainment coefficients and a model for wet aggregation of ash particles {{in the presence of}} liquid water or ice. In the occurrence of wet aggregation, the model predicts an effective grain size distribution depleted in fines with respect to that erupted at the vent. Given a wind profile, the model can be used to determine the column height from the eruption mass flow rate or vice versa. The ultimate goal is to improve ash <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> forecasts by better constraining the ESP (column height, eruption rate and vertical distribution of mass) and the effective particle grain size distribution resulting from eventual wet aggregation within the plume. As test cases we apply the model to the eruptive phase-B of the 4 April 1982 El Chichón volcano eruption (México) and the 6 May 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption phase (Iceland). The modular structure of the code facilitates the implementation in the future code versions of more quantitative ash aggregation parameterization as further observations and experiment data will be available for better constraining ash aggregation processes.

40|$|We studied star {{formation}} {{activities in the}} molecular clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We have utilized the second catalog of 272 molecular clouds obtained by NANTEN to compare the cloud distribution with signatures of massive {{star formation}} including stellar clusters, and optical and radio HII regions. We find that the molecular clouds are classified into three types according to the activities of massive star formation; Type I shows no signature of massive star formation, Type II is associated with relatively small HII region(s) and Type III with both HII region(s) and young stellar cluster(s). The radio continuum sources were used to confirm that Type I GMCs do not host optically hidden HII regions. These signatures of massive star formation show a good spatial correlation with the molecular clouds in a sense they are located within ~ 100 pc of the molecular clouds. Among possible ideas to explain the GMC Types, we favor that the Types indicate an evolutionary sequence; i. e., the youngest phase is Type I, followed by Type II and the last phase is Type III, where the most active star formation takes place leading to <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal.</b> The number of {{the three types of}} GMCs should be proportional to the time scale of each evolutionary stage if a steady state of massive star and cluster formation is a good approximation. By adopting the time scale of the youngest stellar clusters, 10 Myrs, we roughly estimate the timescales of Types I, II and III to be 6 Myrs, 13 Myrs and 7 Myrs, respectively, corresponding to a lifetime of 20 - 30 Myrs for the GMCs with a mass above the completeness limit, 5 x 10 ^ 4 Msun.

40|$|Traditionally, tephra {{transport}} and dispersal models have evolved decoupled (offline) from {{numerical weather prediction}} models. There is a concern that inconsistencies and shortcomings associated with this coupling strategy might lead to errors in the ash cloud forecast. Despite this concern and the significant progress in improving the accuracy of tephra dispersal models {{in the aftermath of}} the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull and 2011 Cordón Caulle eruptions, to date, no operational online dispersal model is available to forecast volcanic ash. Here, we describe and evaluate NMMB-MONARCH-ASH, a new online multi-scale meteorological and transport model that attempts to pioneer the forecast of volcanic aerosols at operational level. The model forecasts volcanic ash cloud trajectories, concentration of ash at relevant flight levels, and the expected deposit thickness for both regional and global configurations. Its online coupling approach improves the current state-of-the-art tephra dispersal models, especially in situations where meteorological conditions are changing rapidly in time, two-way feedbacks are significant, or distal ash <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> simulations are required. This work presents the model application for the first phases of the 2011 Cordón Caulle and 2001 Mount Etna eruptions. The computational efficiency of NMMB-MONARCH-ASH and its application results compare favorably with other long-range tephra dispersal models, supporting its operational implementation.

40|$|The Great Nebula in Carina is {{a superb}} {{location}} {{in which to}} study the physics of violent massive star-formation and the resulting feedback effects, including <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> and triggered star-formation. In order to reveal the cold dusty clouds in the Carina Nebula complex, we used the Large APEX Bolometer Camera LABOCA at the APEX telescope to map a 1. 25 deg x 1. 25 deg (= 50 x 50 pc^ 2) region at 870 micrometer. From a comparison to Halpha images we infer that about 6 % of the 870 micrometer flux in the observed area is likely free-free emission from the HII region, while about 94 % of the flux is very likely thermal dust emission. The total (dust + gas) mass of all clouds for which our map is sensitive is ~ 60 000 Msun, in good agreement with {{the mass of the}} compact clouds in this region derived from 13 CO line observations. We generally find good agreement in the cloud morphology seen at 870 micrometer and the Spitzer 8 micrometer emission maps, but also identify a prominent infrared dark cloud. Finally, we construct a radiative transfer model for the Carina Nebula complex that reproduces the observed integrated spectral energy distribution reasonably well. Our analysis suggests a total gas + dust mass of about 200000 Msun in the investigated area; most of this material {{is in the form of}} molecular clouds, but a widely distributed component of (partly) atomic gas, containing up to ~ 50 % of the total mass, may also be present. Currently, only some 10 % of the gas is in sufficiently dense clouds to be immediately available for future star formation, but this fraction may increase with time owing to the ongoing compression of the strongly irradiated clouds and the expected shockwaves of the imminent supernova explosions.

40|$|PUFF is a {{numerical}} volcanic ash tracking model developed {{to simulate the}} behaviour of ash clouds in the atmosphere. The model uses wind field data provided by meteorological models and adds dispersion and sedimentation physics to predict {{the evolution of the}} cloud once it reaches thermodynamic equilibrium with the atmosphere. The software is intended for use in emergency response situations during an eruption to quickly forecast the position and trajectory of the ash cloud in the near (~ 1 - 72 hour) future. In this paper we describe the first application of PUFF model in forecasting volcanic ash dispersion from the Etna and Vesuvio volcanoes. We simulated the daily occurrence of an eruptive event of Etna utilizing ash cloud parameters describing the paroxysm of 22 nd July 1998 and wind field data for the 1 st September 2005 - 31 st December 2005 time span from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model at the approximate location of Etna volcano (38 N 15 E). The results show that the volcanic ash particles are dispersed in a range of directions in response to changing wind field at the various altitudes and that the ash clouds are mainly dispersed toward the east and southeast, although the exact trajectory is highly variable, and can change within of a few hours. We tested the sensitivity of the model to the mean particle grain size and found that an increased concentration of ash particles in the atmosphere results when the mean grain size is decreased. Similarly, a dramatic variation in dispersion results when the logarithmic standard deviation of the particle size distribution is changed. Additionally, we simulated the occurrence of an eruptive event at both Etna and Vesuvio, using the same parameters describing the initial volcanic plume, and wind field data recorded for 1 st September 2005, at approximately 38 N 15 E for Etna and 41 N 14 E for Vesuvio. The comparison of the two simulations indicates that identical eruptions occurring at the same time at the two volcanic centres display significantly different dispersal axes {{as a consequence of the}} different local wind field acting at the respective eruptive vent. At Vesuvio volcano, a plinian eruptive event with the dynamical parameters of the 79 A. D. eruption was simulated daily for one year, from 1 st July 2005 to 30 th June 2006. The statistical processing of results points out that, although in most cases the ash <b>cloud</b> <b>dispersal</b> encompasses many different areas, generally the easterly-southeasterly direction is preferred. Our results highlight the significant role of wind field trends in influencing the distribution of ash particles from eruptive columns and prove that the dynamical parameters that most influence the variability of plume dispersal are the duration of the eruption and the maximum column height. Finally, the possible use of cloud simulations for refining hazard maps of areas exposed to volcanic ash dispersal is proposed...|$|E
