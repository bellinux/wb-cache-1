Furthermore, this article is to highlight the causal connection between the success of internal control and corporate governance at the entity level, precisely because good corporate governance can not be provided based on an internal control system working with serious deficiencies, resulting from this the imperative need for establishing permanent regulatory frameworks to enable a real and procedural functioning of the internal control system...|$|E

Therefore, the research of the forest natural disturbance regimes falls among the crucial present scientific challenges...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{personal}} assistants for mobile devices, systems that are marketed as engaging in (spoken) dialogue have reached a wider public than ever before. For a student of dialogue, this raises the question to what extent such systems are genuine dialogue partners. In order to address this question, this study proposes to use {{the concept of a}} dialogue game as an analytical tool. Thus, we reframe the question as asking for the dialogue games that such systems play. Our analysis, as applied to a number of landmark systems and illustrated with dialogue extracts, leads to a fine-grained classification of such systems. Drawing on this analysis, we propose that the uptake of future generations of more powerful dialogue systems will depend on whether they are self-validating. A self-validating dialogue system <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>talk</b> and do things, but also discuss the why of what it says and does, and learn from such discussions...|$|R
40|$|In the {{conditions}} of dominant influence of anthropogenic greenhouse effect and according to simulation models, a more intensive temperature increase in upper-air layers of troposphere than in lower-air layers should be expected. In order to check this, the difference between temperature trends {{in the middle and}} lower troposphere over the Australian continent has been analyzed. Satellite data UAHMSU for lower troposphere (TLT) and middle troposphere (ТМТ), for the 1979 - 2014 period have been used in the study. Estimates have been done on seasonal and annual value, and the results obtained indicate that there is a trend of temperature increase, but not altitude amplification over Australia. Reducing the time series for a year from the beginning (1980 - 2014, 1981 - 2014 …), a comparative analysis between corresponding time series for each season, i. e., each year, showed that from 140 mutual comparisons, altitude amplification does not exist in 130, i. e., in 93 % of cases. Moreover, in sub-periods of 1996 (1997 - 2014, 1998 - 2014 …), we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> even <b>talk</b> about warming in most cases because the trend of temperature is negative...|$|R

40|$|Administrative-territorial {{organisation}} is {{a problem}} of national interest and it is not given for ever. Without a solid administrative organisation we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about systematic organisation of public activity. Administrative-territorial units are state cells, that assure indivisibility and unity, but giving exaggerates power to local units’ results a weak state. Today Romanian administrative-territorial organisation has two levels. First level is formed by communes and cities. The second level is formed by districts. Regional level was created in 1999, but this is not an administrative level. Regional level is an organisation modality to respond to European Unions’ requests. An eventual future administrative-territorial reorganisation should take in consideration an abstract element dictated by administrative law science and a concrete element resulted from Romanian peoples’ needs. The real questions regarding administrative-territorial reorganisation is to create regions and a second intermediary level or to keep the actual organisation and to realise a larger decentralization, especially in financial area. Regarding administrative-territorial reorganisation there are a few theories...|$|E
40|$|Fiscal {{decentralization}} is {{an important}} influence factor on the autonomy of local government. To the extent in which a local government benefits from amounts and transfers from the central government, it depends on it and has a reduced capacity {{to make decisions about}} the services they provide to citizens, local autonomy being limited. Even if the legal framework for decentralization was created in Romania, we still <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about a high degree of financial autonomy of local governments. Further, significant amounts from the state budget are transferred to local budgets to cover local expenses. Moreover, despite consistent efforts to implement the decentralization process, there is a series of imbalances, especially in smaller territorial administrative units that are clearly disadvantaged both in terms of financial capacity to finance themselves through local taxes and duties, and especially in terms of the low absorption capacity of European funds. In general, in Romania, the degree of financial autonomy differs nationally from the city level and from the village level...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyze}} the {{significance}} of the impact of low interest rates on profitability of banks in the Czech Republic. Profitability of banks is examined through an analysis of the financial profitability ratios on a sample of 6 banks in the period 2004 to 2014. A more detailed analysis and a better assessment of the impact of low interest rates on bank profitability are used decomposition of return on equity, which did not show the effect of low interest rates on return on assets. A more relevant indicator for assessing the impact of low interest rates is the net interest margin, reflecting a negative impact with half of all banks. The financial analysis results were confirmed in a subsequent regression analysis, which examined a variety of internal and external determinants of profitability including the impact of low interest rates. The impact of low interest rates, there was again demonstrated only in the net interest margin, but it certainly <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> about the dominant factor...|$|E

40|$|B is {{a method}} for specifying, {{designing}} and coding software systems. It is based on Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice, the concept of generalized substitution and on structuring mechanisms (machine,refinement, implementation). The concept of refinement is the key notion for developing B models of (software) systems in an incremental way. B models are accompanied by mathematical proofs that justify them. Proofs of B models convince the user (designer or specifier) that the (software) system is effectively correct. We provide {{a survey of the}} underlying logic of the B method and the semantic concepts related to the B method; we detail the B development process partially supported by the mechanical engine of the prover.
