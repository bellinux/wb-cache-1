5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} {{uses its}} feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the <b>catkin</b> still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
25|$|Hornbeams {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} trees, Carpinus betulus reaching {{a height of}} 32m. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, and simple with a serrated margin, and typically vary from 3–10cm in length. The flowers are wind-pollinated pendulous catkins, produced in spring. The male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (monoecious). The fruit is a small nut about 3–6mm long, held in a leafy bract; the bract may be either trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing {{is important in the}} identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10–30 seeds are on each seed <b>catkin.</b>|$|E
500|$|The leaves have short slender stalks and are [...] long, {{triangular}} with broad, untoothed, wedge-shaped bases, slender pointed {{tips and}} coarsely double-toothed, serrated margins. They are sticky with resin {{at first but}} this dries as they age leaving small white scales. The foliage is a pale to medium green and turns yellow early in the autumn before the leaves fall. In mid-summer, the female catkins mature and the male catkins expand and release pollen, and wind pollination takes place. The small 1 to 2mm winged seeds ripen in late summer on pendulous, cylindrical catkins [...] long and [...] broad. The seeds are very numerous and are separated by scales, and when ripe, the whole <b>catkin</b> disintegrates and the seeds are spread widely by the wind.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Geoffrey Langford {{took off}} his hat, so as to let the moist spring breeze play round his temples and in the thin locks where the silvery threads had lately grown more perceptible, and gazed upon the dewy grass, the tiny {{woodbine}} leaf, the silver [...] "pussycats" [...] on the withy, and the tasselled <b>catkin</b> of the hazel, with {{the eyes of a}} man to whom such sights were a refreshment--a sort of holiday--after the many springs spent in close courts of law and London smoke; and now after his long attendance in a warm dark sick-room. His daughter sat by him, thinking deeply, and her heart full of a longing earnestness which seemed as if it would not let her speak. She was going to meet her mother, whom she had not seen for so long a time; but it was only to be for one evening! Her father, finding that his presence was absolutely required in London, and no longer actually indispensable at Knight Sutton, had resolved on changing places with his wife, and she was to go with him and take her mother's place in attending on Lady Susan St. Leger. They were now going to fetch Mrs. Geoffrey Langford home from the Allonfield station, and they would have one evening at Knight Sutton with her, returning themselves the next morning to Westminster.|$|E

40|$|A novel Chinese {{chestnut}} (Castanea mollissima Bl.) mutant {{with extreme}} short <b>catkins,</b> here was named sck 1 {{and has been}} characterized in the present study. This sck 1 caused 6 -fold shorter than wild-type <b>catkins.</b> Endogenous gibberellic acids markedly decreased in the mutant, and application of exogenous GA 3 could partially restore the sck 1 phenotype to the wild-type phenotype. Paclobutrazol (PP 333), an antagonist of GAs biosynthesis, could significantly inhibit the wild-type <b>catkins</b> growth, and lead to a short <b>catkins</b> phenotype similar to the sck 1. In addition, compared to the wild-type <b>catkins,</b> the mRNA expression level of ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), a gibberellin biosynthsis key gene, was significantly down-regulated (P, 0. 01) in the sck 1. Importantly, transient over-expression of a normal CmKAO gene in short <b>catkins</b> also could partially restore the wild-type phenotype. Real-time PCR and semi-quantitative analysis showed that the mRNA expression level of KAO was significantly up-regulated. In addition, transient RNA interference of CmKAO in wild-type <b>catkins</b> led the mRNA expression level of KAO decrease significantly and inhibited the wild-type <b>catkins</b> elongation strongly.

60|$|Yet {{this little}} herb-like willow, {{one of the}} most northerly and hardy of European plants, is a true tree at heart none the less for all that. Soft and {{succulent}} as it looks in branch and leaf, you may yet count on it sometimes as many rings of annual growth as on a lordly Scotch fir-tree. But where? Why, underground. For see how cunning it is, this little stunted descendant of proud forest lords: hard-pressed by nature, it has learnt {{to make the best of}} its difficult and precarious position. It has a woody trunk at core, like all other trees; but this trunk never appears above the level of the soil: it creeps and roots underground in tortuous zigzags between the crags and boulders that lie strewn through its thin sheet of upland leaf-mould. By this simple plan the willow manages to get protection in winter, on the same principle as when we human gardeners lay down the stems of vines: only the willow remains laid down all the year and always. But in summer it sends up its short-lived herbaceous branches, covered with tiny green leaves, and ending at last in a single silky <b>catkin.</b> Yet between the great weeping willow and this last degraded mountain representative of the same primitive type, you can trace in Europe alone at least a dozen distinct intermediate forms, all well marked in their differences, and all progressively dwarfed by long stress of unfavourable conditions.|$|E
60|$|Down to that fatal {{moment the}} one desire {{of his heart}} was to serve his friend {{faithfully}} in this delicate business. Now, the first sight of her, the first touch of her hand, wrought a change in him, and all thought of Edgar and {{of the purpose of}} his visit vanished out of his mind. Even he, one of the great nobles of his time, the accomplished courtier and life of the court, stood silent like a person spell-bound before this woman who had been to no court, but had lived always with that sullen old man in comparative seclusion in a remote province. It was not only the beautiful dignity and graciousness with which she received him, with the exquisite beauty in the lines and colour of her face, and her hair which, if unloosed, would have covered her to the knees as with a splendid mantle. That hair of a colour comparable only to that of the sweet gale when that sweet plant is in its golden withy or <b>catkin</b> stage in the month of May, and is clothed with catkins as with a foliage of a deep shining red gold, that seems not a colour of earth but rather one distilled from the sun itself. Nor was it the colour of her eyes, the deep pure blue of the lungwort, that blue loveliness seen in no other flower on earth. Rather it was the light from her eyes which was like lightning that pierced and startled him; for that light, that expression, was a living spirit looking through his eyes into the depths of his soul, knowing all its strength and weakness, and in the same instant resolving to make it her own and have dominion over it.|$|E
