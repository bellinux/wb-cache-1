40|$|During {{design of}} the {{envelope}} of a noncircular <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> one should take into account several conditions resulting from kinematics and geometry of the uneven-running strand transmission. Design of proper values of pitches for a <b>belt</b> <b>pulley,</b> which enable good cooperation between the <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> and the <b>belt,</b> should be carefully done. In available Polish literature and catalogues offered by belt manufacturers, one can find only detailed dimensions of belts with a trapezoidal profile. Information on other profiles is insufficient for full description of geometrical features of <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> teeth {{as well as to}} design tools for machining <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys.</b> Manufacturers of <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> and <b>belts</b> give only necessary data to submit a purchase order. The paper presents a digitization process (scanning) of geometry of the envelope of circular <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> with non-standard profiles; this scanning has been done with the application of coordinate measuring machines. The obtained information on geometrical features of tooth profiles has been numerically analysed. As a result of this analysis, the mathematical description has been obtained. Finally, noncircular <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> with different tooth profiles have been designed and manufactured...|$|R

50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> was a U.S.-based {{magazine}} {{dedicated to}} antique farm tractors of all brands and makes. It published successfully for over 2 decades {{and was one}} of the best known titles in the category. It was a family business run first by the Aumann family and then by the Elmore family. In 2009 it was sold, and the new owner eventually changed the name of the publication to Vintage Tractor Digest. This ended its publication under the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> title.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> for a flat belt (which is what <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} few issues of the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine, Kurt Aumann wrote nearly all the {{articles}} contained in each issue. If any inclination toward any one brand of tractor or any one antique farm collectors organization could be perceived in the new publication, {{it would be an}} inclination toward the products of the Oliver Farm Equipment Company. This was a reflection of the close relationship that Kurt Aumann had developed with individual members of the Hart-Parr/Oliver Collectors Association. Nonetheless, the magazine sought to cover the history and the technical data of all makes and brands of antique farm tractors and farm equipment. Toward this end, the magazine announced its intention of establishing a network of the reporters from around the nation to contribute articles. [...] Originally, the writers or contributors to <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine were called [...] "Reporters." [...] An early list of Reporters for the <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> magazine included Ed Westen of Kewaunee, Wisconsin, Jerry Engstrom of Fargo, North Dakota; Richard LaRusso of New Milford, Connecticut; Robert Oliphant of Waterford, Virginia; David Grube of Ringold, Pennsylvania; and Loran Ellingson of Northwood, North Dakota. [...] In 1989, Kevin Talley of Vermillion, South Dakota and Sam Meeker of North Henderson, Illinois were added as reporters. [...] The reporters attended antique tractor shows across the nation and submitted [...] "show reports" [...] to the magazine on the shows they had attended. Humorous reminiscences from Walter M. Buescher, a retired Allis-Chalmers salesman and manager, were featured in a <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley</b> column for several years.|$|R

5000|$|The Allis-Chalmers Model 6-12 was a farm tractor {{produced}} by Allis-Chalmers between 1918 and 1923. Like many other tractors of the era, its model name came from its horsepower ratings, with 6-12 (or 6/12) meaning 6 hp at the drawbar and 12 hp at the <b>belt</b> <b>pulley.</b>|$|R

50|$|Volkswagen use a {{variator}} {{system with}} two variators, {{one for each}} camshaft. Like the Alfa Romeo system, these are electrically-controlled hydraulic units, mounted in the camshaft's timing <b>belt</b> <b>pulley.</b> These systems are fitted to the Volkswagen VR5 and VR6 engines, and also to the W8 and W12 engines. The multiple-bank W engines have four variators in total, one for each camshaft.|$|R
5000|$|Conditions {{under which}} the <b>belt</b> and <b>pulleys</b> are {{operating}} - The friction between the <b>belt</b> and <b>pulley</b> may decrease substantially if the belt happens to be muddy or wet, as it may act as a lubricant between the surfaces. This also applies to extremely dry or warm conditions which will evaporate any water naturally found in the belt, nominally making friction greater.|$|R

Starting with the March/April 1994 issue of <b>Belt</b> <b>Pulley,</b> he has contributed an article to every issue of the magazine since that time and has continued to do so down to the present time. His first article carried in that March/April 1994 issue was actually a legal article on the Freedom of Information legislation of the states of Iowa and Wisconsin. As a practising attorney with membership in the bars of Mississippi, Minnesota and West Virginia, Brian was asked by Editor in Chief, Kurt Aumann to write the article, called [...] "Researcher's Rights" [...] and outlines {{the proposition that the}} materials held by various publicly funded archives and libraries is actually the property of the public at large and, thus, the property of the individual researcher. The article points out that restrictions of the use of the content and or copies of these public documents by librarians are not legal restrictions.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and docking saws. The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via flat <b>belts</b> and <b>pulleys.</b> The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original flat <b>belts</b> and <b>pulley</b> wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] <b>belts</b> and <b>pulleys</b> which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R

50|$|A {{crankshaft}} is {{subjected to}} enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft {{is connected to the}} fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area. The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, <b>belts,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.|$|R
