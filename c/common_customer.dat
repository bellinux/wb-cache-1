50|$|When Steve Wozniak wrote Integer BASIC for the Apple II, {{he did not}} {{implement}} {{support for}} floating point math because he was primarily interested in writing games, a task for which integers alone were sufficient. In 1976, Microsoft had developed Microsoft BASIC, a BASIC interpreter for the MOS Technology 6502, {{but at the time}} there was no production computer that used it. Upon learning that Apple had a 6502 machine, Microsoft asked if the company were interested in licensing BASIC, but Steve Jobs replied that Apple already had one. The Apple II was unveiled to the public at the West Coast Computer Faire in April 1977 and became available for sale in June. One of the most <b>common</b> <b>customer</b> complaints about the computer was BASIC's lack of floating-point capability. Integer BASIC is limited to whole numbers between −32768 and 32767 and caused problems for users attempting to write business applications with it. As Wozniak—the only person who understood Integer BASIC well enough to add floating point features—was busy with the Disk II drive and controller and with Apple DOS, Apple turned to Microsoft. Making things more problematic was that the rival TRS-80 and Commodore PET personal computers both had floating point-capable BASIC interpreters from the beginning. The Applesoft license also saved Microsoft from near-bankruptcy when they licensed BASIC to Commodore for the PET in an agreement that proved unexpectedly costly for them.|$|E

40|$|In {{introducing}} Islamic banking in Malaysia, {{the basic}} {{strategy was to}} replicate the products/ services offered by conventional banks. The successful implementation of such a strategy has meant that Malaysia today has a truly dual banking system. Islamic banks in Malaysia not only have product similarity with conventional banks but share the same overall economic environment and a <b>common</b> <b>customer</b> base. The ability of non Muslim customers/depositors to switch between the two banking systems, means that deposit / financing rates have to be similar – else give rise to arbitrage flows. The implication is that, though Islamic banks operate on interest free principles, the economic environment in a dual banking system inevitably exposes them {{to the problems of}} conventional banks; in particular interest rate risk. Using monthly data over the 10 year period 1994 – 2003, the paper argues that, paradoxical as it may seem, Islamic banks operating within a dual banking system may also be subject to interest rate risk. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 In this dissertation, {{we study}} three {{problems}} related to omnichannel sale. In the first two chapters, we study omnichannel fulfillment where a retailer can use either the online or the offline channel {{to back up the}} other one by fulfilling its demand, because of stockout or low inventory availability. In the last chapter, we study an incentive problem where sales agents compete for a <b>common</b> <b>customer</b> base. This problem is loosely related to similar problems in omnichannel sales – when an online order is filled by an offline store, or vice versa, how should sales credit be shared? In the first chapter, we study store fulfillment strategy of an omnichannel retailer that would like to leverage its established offline retail channel infrastructure to capture online sales after stockout. We consider a single newsvendor-type product that is sold in both online and offline channels to non-overlapping markets with independent Poisson demand. The offline store can fulfill online demand at an additional handling and fulfillment cost, k, but not vice versa. We characterize the optimal rationing policy which determines whether online demand should be fulfilled or not given the remaining time and inventory. Due to the challenges of implementing the optimal policy, we further propose two simple and effective heuristics. We also show that integrating the rationing policy into retailer’s higher-level inventory stocking and supply chain design decisions can {{have a significant impact on}} the retailer’s inventory level and profitability. As a result, we propose an integrated policy, where the retailer builds separate inventory stocks for each channel but can use the offline inventory to back up online sales, subject to a rationing heuristic. In the second chapter, we study discounted home delivery strategy of an omnichannel retailer that would like to leverage its online channel to help with offline sales when offline store has limited inventory. We consider a single newsvendor-type product that is sold in both online and offline channels to non-overlapping markets with independent Poisson demand. Store has option to offer customers discount d to incentivize them to accept home delivery of item rather than taking an inventory unit from the store. We assume customers are heterogeneous in their discount sensitivity, ranging from price sensitive to leadtime sensitive. We characterize the optimal dynamic discounting policy which determines at any point in season whether the offline store should offer discount or not, and if yes, the optimal discount level. Again, due to the challenges of implementing the optimal policy, we propose two simple and effective heuristics. We conduct an extensive numerical study and find that retailers can considerably benefit from discounted home delivery policy. In the last chapter, we study sales agent’s competition for a <b>common</b> <b>customer</b> base when sales agents are heavily paid by commission. We assume agents can affect customers perceived service quality through their service time. We build a simple model that captures agents time and quality trade off while competing for a <b>common</b> <b>customer</b> base. We assume that the agent’s service time can increase sales probability, but the agents incur cost for their effort. We show that agent’s speed up in the decentralized setting, in comparison to the central solution, which results in lower expected sale for the system. We suggest financial, operational, and informational tools that can align agent’s incentive with that of the service provider’s...|$|E

30|$|Waiting {{in line to}} {{purchase}} products at luxury brand department stores or luxury outlet malls has recently become a <b>common</b> <b>customer</b> experience. Since many people find waiting {{to purchase}} fashion goods less common than waiting to receive service in hospitals, banks, restaurants, or airports, {{little research has been}} done on waiting in the purchasing context. This study on waiting while shopping for fashion goods categorized wait times in terms of the use of time fillers. We examined customers’ psychological and emotional responses and purchase-related behaviors. We found different effects for waiting and fillers on customer’s responses, expectation of competition, and excitement level. Using related fillers during the wait showed the highest positive responses, such as the expectation of competition and excitement level. The positive responses to unrelated fillers were lower than were those for related fillers. We can infer that unrelated fillers distract customers’ attention from the wait or their shopping. Furthermore, excitement level was found to partially mediate the relationship between expectation of competition and purchase intention, reinforcing the importance of positive emotions in shopping situations.|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{cellular}} {{approaches to}} the development of manufactu ring architectures based upon lean manufacturing concepts are often hindered or prevented by the lack of a smooth regular demand for products. This is frequently the case in apparel manufacturing where demand is erratic because of the high variety of end items and the fickleness of fashion markets. Multi-Channel Manufacturing (MCM) is an approach to cell development, which examines first the market channel requirements and configures cells based upon <b>common</b> <b>customer</b> service requirements. This paper describes the MCM approach and presents an application study in the apparel industry. Working through the case example, the paper describes the application of three MCM principles in seven specific application steps. The resulting revised system provides better customer service and reduced inventories albeit at some potential sacrifice in direct labor efficiency. Like other cellular designs, refinement of the system is a continual process. The paper illustrates trade-off’s and extensions of the system to improve efficiency and performance.

30|$|Our {{findings}} suggest that the proposed STC features are significantly better than demographic features in bank customer churn prediction. We report that diversity and regularity in customers’ spatio-temporal activities and entropy of financial choices are more important than other behavioral traits in financial churn prediction. In particular, the exploration levels of the eventual churners, reflected by the diversity patterns, had a decreasing trend during the observation window, while {{this was not the case}} for non-churners. This seems to suggest that deviations from a customer’s usual spatio-temporal spending patterns could be indicators of the presence of the financial stress that could be associated with his churn decision, in a way similar to the increasing vulnerability of living organisms as a reaction to persistent stress [36]; however, validity of such relationship needs to be further investigated in a future research, by seeking a relationship between deteriorating financial wellbeing of a customer and her spatio-temporal behavior change. Furthermore, we conducted the same study for different demographic groups and found out that churn prediction seems to be relatively easier for the group of younger customers, while gender-based difference is not significant. These findings also remain consistent over a number of different data sets that are generated based on different sampling strategies and observation windows applied on a much larger and <b>common</b> <b>customer</b> base.|$|E

While there is mounting evidence that design {{can be seen as}} a strategic tool to successfully spur sales of new product developments at the firm level, the topic of design innovation has not been linked to the open innovation concept yet. In this paper we empirically test whether design activities conducted in-house differ in their contribution to new product sales from externally acquired design. Using a large crosssection of manufacturing and service firms, we investigate the effects on sales of products new to the market and of imitation or significantly improved products of the firm. At first glance, we find the paradox that externally acquired design is not superior to in-house design activities. This effect is robust to several modifications of the model specification. As earlier literature on new technological developments in high-tech sectors, we argue, however, that external design may not affect the sales of market novelties as the "market news" may spill-over quickly to rivals through <b>common</b> <b>customers</b> and suppliers including external designers...|$|R
