40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for the simultaneous measurement {{of changes in}} membrane current and unidirectional radiotracer flux in internally dialyzed voltage-clamped squid giant axons. The small currents that are produced by electrogenic transport processes or steady-state ionic currents can be resolved using this method. Because the use of grounded guard electrodes in the end pools is not, by itself, an adequate means of eliminating end-effects, two ancillary end pool clamp circuits are described to eliminate extraneous current flow from {{the ends of the}} axon. The end pool voltage-clamp circuits serve to minimize net current flow between the end pools and center pool, and employ stable, low-impedance <b>calomel</b> <b>electrodes</b> to monitor the potentials of the end and center pools. The adequacy of the method is demonstrated by experiments in which unidirectional 22 Na efflux and current, flowing through tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive Na channels into Na-free seawater, under K-free conditions, are shown to be equal. The equality of unidirectional TTX-sensitive flux and current is maintained over the entire range of membrane potentials examined (- 60 to + 20 mV). The method has been applied to a series of experiments in which the voltage dependence and stoichiometry of the Na/K pump have been measured (Rakowski et al., 1989), and can be applied in general to the simultaneous measurement of changes in current and flux of other electrogenic transport processes, and of currents through ionic channels that open under steady-state conditions...|$|R
