40|$|Background. Development {{of methods}} {{and means of}} the {{adaptive}} management of the radio networks bandwidth with <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> to the radio channel. Objective. The aim of the paper {{is to determine the}} packet length effect on the effective radio networks transmission rate with taking into account the parameters, formats, and procedures of the physical and link levels at using the MAC protocol with a rigid strategy of <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> to the radio channel. Methods. The goal is achieved by creating and analyzing the mathematical model of the effective transmission rate in radio networks. The model is described by the equation for the effective transmission rate, which is the function of both the probability of the conflict-free transmission of the MAC protocol and the coefficient of the data packet size deviation from the optimal for LLC protocol. Results. It is proved that there is the optimal deviation of the data packet length for each MAC protocol traffic intensity value, which provides the most effective transfer rate. This makes the possibility for adaptive management of the radio bandwidth by applying a pre-calculated deviation of the data packet size in dependence on the traffic intensity. Conclusions. The proposed mathematical model is the tool for calculation of both the radio bandwidth network capacity and the optimal deviation of the data packet length at adaptive management of <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> to a radio channel with a rigid strategy at conditions of the significant fluctuation in traffic intensity...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of threads inside the cores of a multicore processor, and <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> to the shared cache memory, become {{the main reasons for}} an increased number of competitive cache misses and performance decline. Inevitably, the development of modern processor architectures leads to an increased number of cache misses. In this paper, we make an attempt to implement a technique for decreasing the number of competitive cache misses in the first level of cache memory. This technique enables <b>competitive</b> <b>access</b> to the entire cache memory when there is a hit - but, if there are cache misses, memory data (by using replacement techniques) is put in a virtual part given to threads, so that competitive cache misses are avoided. By using a simulator tool, the results show a {{decrease in the number of}} cache misses and performance increase for up to 15 %. The conclusion that comes out of this research is that cache misses are a real challenge for future processor designers, in order to hide memory latency. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

Starting with a discussion of the economic consequences of the internationalisation of the markets for telecommunication services, we argue that various requirements have to be met by an international framework agreement on telecommunications. By allowing foreign firms to enter domestic markets, the WTO accord is a major step in the direction of liberalising national telecommunication markets. However, its main shortcoming is that member countries are not obliged to apply most-favoured-nation treatment to all other members, and that commitments on national regulatory policies are rather vague.

To substantially expand the scope of the market in which they operate without dramatically increasing their network investment, they have requested state and federal regulatory agencies to allow the collocation of their transmission equipment inside telephone companies' local switching offices. Several major policy issues arise: If local telephone company access service prices continue to be tightly regulated, will the benefits of competition in the form of lower long-distance prices ultimately reach consumers? Would a national collocation policy simply redistribute industry revenues without directly benefiting the general public? And could collocation become a mechanism for long-distance companies to vertically integrate their operations into local exchange markets less than a decade after the massive effort to separate the toll and local markets that culminated in the AT&T divestiture?...|$|E
40|$|E-commerce {{will have}} a {{profound}} effect on agricultural markets. Due to lower transactions costs, more firms throughout the agricultural value chain will be able to engage in business-to-business e-commerce. Products and services will be increasingly unbundled throughout the marketing channel. Firms will be able to specialize in narrow niches and will face competition from other similarly specialized firms. Many more products and services will be traded as "commodities," and price discovery throughout the value chain will become more transparent and observable. Differentiated or value-added agricultural products, such as high oil corn, or "Roundup Ready" soybeans could be traded on organized, perhaps virtual, exchanges.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the economics of}} catch discarding in fisheries. To study this issue a simple dynamic fisheries model is constructed. On {{the basis of this}} model it is demonstrated that in a differentiated fishery discarding of catch may be socially optimal. The paper goes on to show that individual firms in a free <b>access,</b> <b>competitive</b> fishery employ the socially optimal discarding rule. In contrast, the individual transferable quota (ITQ) fisheries management regime tends to generate an excessive incentive for discarding catch. The problem, however, does not appear to derive from the ITQ. system as such. Rather, it seems to depend on the imperfect application of the system to real fisheries. The concept of a discarding function is defined and it is shown that at least {{within the framework of the}} model employed the discarding function for an ITQ fishery dominates the one for free <b>access,</b> <b>competitive</b> fisheries. Numerical examples are provided. Finally, possible remedies of the discarding problem are briefly discussed.
