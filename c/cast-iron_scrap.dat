It is useful for reducing the material cost in fabricating β-FeSi 2 by utilizing the waste that is obtained from the manufacturing process of cast-iron components. In this research, β-FeSi 2 was successfully obtained from cast iron bscrap chips and showed good thermoelectric performance in Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity which is around 70 % to almost 100 % compared to β-FeSi 2 that was prepared from pure Fe and other publications. The thermoelectric power factor was achieved 90 % performance compared to other literatures and β-FeSi 2 prepared from pure Fe...|$|E
40|$|The upgrade {{recycling}} of <b>cast-iron</b> <b>scrap</b> chips towards β-FeSi 2 thermoelectric materials is proposed as an eco-friendly and cost-effective production process. By using scrap waste from the machining process of cast-iron components, the material cost to fabricate β-FeSi 2 is reduced {{and the industrial}} waste is recycled. In this study, β-FeSi 2 specimens obtained from cast iron scrap chips were prepared both in the undoped form and doped with Al and Co elements. The maximum figure of merit (ZT) indicated a thermoelectric performance of approximately 70 % in p-type samples and nearly 90 % in n-type samples compared to β-FeSi 2 prepared from pure Fe and other published studies. The use of cast iron scrap chips to produce β-FeSi 2 shows promise as an eco-friendly and cost-effective production process for thermoelectric materials...|$|E
