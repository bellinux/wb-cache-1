40|$|Design of pre-swirl {{systems is}} {{important}} for the secondary air cooling system of gas turbine engines. In this paper, three pre-swirl nozzles, a <b>cascade</b> <b>vane</b> and two drilled nozzles are analysed and their performances are compared. The two drilled nozzles considered are a straight drilled nozzle and an aerodynamically designed nozzle. CFD analyses are presented for stand-alone and pre-swirl system 3 D sector models at engine operating conditions near to engine maximum power condition rotational Reynolds number (Re ?) up to 4. 6 ! 10. Nozzle performance is characterised by the nozzle discharge coefficient (C), nozzle velocity coefficient (?η) and cooling air delivery temperature. Two commonly used eddy viscosity models are employed for the study, the standard κ-ε and Spalart-Allmaras models with wall functions. Both models give very similar results for C and η and are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. Effects of nozzle or vane number and sealing flow have been analysed. The cascade vanes perform slightly better than the aerodynamically designed drilled nozzles but the final design choice will depend on other component and manufacturing costs. An elementary model is presented to separate temperature losses due to the nozzle, stator drag and sealing flow. Copyright © 2011 by Rolls-Royce plc...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design of a cascade within a cold stream thrust {{reverser}} during the early, conceptual stage of the product development process. A reliable procedure is developed for the exchange of geometric and load data between a two dimensional aerodynamic model and a three dimensional structural model. Aerodynamic and structural simulations are carried out using realistic operating conditions, for three different design configurations with a view to minimising weight for equivalent or improved aerodynamic and structural performance. For normal operational conditions the simulations show that total reverse thrust is unaffected when the performance of the deformed vanes is compared to the un-deformed case. This shows that for the conditions tested, the minimal deformation of the cascade vanes has no significant affect on aerodynamic efficiency and that there is scope for reducing the weight of the cascade. The pressure distribution through a two dimensional thrust reverser section is determined for two additional <b>cascade</b> <b>vane</b> configurations and it is shown that with a small decrease in total reverse thrust, it is possible to reduce weight and eliminate supersonic flow regimes through the nacelle section. By increasing vane sections in high pressure areas and decreasing sections in low pressure areas the structural performance of the cascade vanes in the weight reduced designs, is improved with significantly reduced levels of vane displacement and stress...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{performance}} {{testing of the}} two-dimensional convergent-divergent (2 D-CD) nozzle has established the concept as {{a viable alternative to}} the axisymmetric nozzle for advanced technology aircraft. This type of exhaust system also offers potential integration and performance advantages in the areas of thrust reversing and vectoring over axi-symmetric nozzles. These advantages include the practical integration of thrust reversers which operate not only to reduce landing roll but also operate in-flight for enhanced maneuvering and thrust spoiling. To date there is a very limited data base available from which criteria can be developed for the design and evaluation of this type of thrust reverser system. For this reason, a static scale model test was conducted in which five different thrust reverser designs were evaluated. Each of the five models had varying performance/integration requirements which dictated the five different designs. Some of the parameters investigated in this test included; variable angle external <b>cascade</b> <b>vanes,</b> fixed angle internal <b>cascade</b> <b>vanes,</b> variable position inner doors, external slider doors and internal slider valves. In addition, normal force and yawing moment generation was investigated using the thrust reverser system. Selected results from this test will be presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R

Doors in the bypass duct are used to redirect the air that is accelerated by the engine's fan section but does not pass through the combustion chamber (called bypass air) such that it provides reverse thrust. The cold stream reverser system is activated by an air motor. During normal operation, the reverse thrust vanes are blocked. On selection, the system folds the doors to block off the cold stream final nozzle and redirect this airflow to the <b>cascade</b> <b>vanes.</b> This system can redirect both the exhaust flow of the fan and of the core.|$|R

The aft cowl is axially translatable relative to the forward cowl from a first position fully retracted against the forward cowl, to a second position partially extended from the forward cowl, and to a third position fully extended from the forward cowl.

40|$|Presented at the Conference Active Flow and Combustion Control 2014, September 10 - 12 2014, Berlin, GermanyThe current {{investigation}} examines {{the impact of}} a new pulsed unsteady combustion to the turbine sealing cavity, which prevents hot gas ingestion into the inner machine. Sealing flow is ensured by relatively cold secondary air blowing radially through the rotor-stator-wheel space. The interaction between the sealing flow and the main gas flow however causes aerodynamic losses. These losses as well as the secondary compressor air should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the efficiency of the whole machine. The Hot-Acoustic-Testrig (HAT) allows an investigation of the subject under realistic flow conditions. Therefore a specific measurement section has been designed, which features a plenum to provide secondary air to the main flow. To simulate an pressure increasing combustion, a setup with 6 fast shifting valves was realized. The unsteady flow was measured by pressure tabs with a high time resolution. In the next step a characteristic linear cascade was designed to replace the turbine stator and generate a typical stator wake. Measurements of the total pressure loss over the <b>cascade</b> <b>vanes</b> have been conducted by means of a five-hole probe and by Particle Image Velocimetry.

Although anaerodynamic stabilizing effect of tying airfoils together ingroups on the whole cascade is indicated by numerical andexperimental studies, for some operating conditions suchsectored <b>vane</b> <b>cascade</b> can still remain unstable. The goal of the present work is to investigate thepossibilities of a sectored <b>vane</b> <b>cascade</b> to undergoself-excited vibrations or flutter. The presented method forpredicting the aerodynamic response of a sectored vane cascadeis based on the aerodynamic work influence coefficientrepresentation of freestanding blade cascade. The sectored vaneanalysis assumes that the vibration frequency is the same forall blades in the sectored vane, while the vibration amplitudesand mode shapes can be different for each individual blade inthe sector. Additionally, the vibration frequency as well asthe amplitudes and mode shapes are supposed to be known. The aerodynamic analysis of freestanding blade cascade isperformed with twodimensional inviscid linearized flow model. As far as feasible the study is supported by non-linear flowmodel analysis as well as by performing comparisons againstavailable experimental data in order to minimize theuncertainties of the numerical modeling on the physicalconclusions of the study. As has been shown for the freestanding low-pressure turbineblade, the blade mode shape gives an important contributioninto the aerodynamic stability of the cascade. During thepreliminary design, it has been recommended to take intoaccount the mode shape as well rather than only reducedfrequency. In the present work further investigation using foursignificantly different turbine geometries makes these findingsmore general, independent from the low-pressure turbine bladegeometry. The investigation also continues towards a sectoredvane cascade. A parametrical analysis summarizing the effect ofthe reduced frequency and real sector mode shape is carried outfor a low-pressure sectored <b>vane</b> <b>cascade</b> for differentvibration amplitude distributions between the airfoils in thesector as well as different numbers of the airfoils in thesector. Critical (towards flutter) reduced frequency maps areprovided for torsion- and bending-dominated sectored vane modeshapes. Utilizing such maps at the early design stages helps toimprove the aerodynamic stability of low-pressure sectoredvanes. A special emphasis in the present work is put on theimportance for the chosen unsteady inviscid flow model to bewell-posed during numerical calculations. The necessity for thecorrect simulation of the far-field boundary conditions indefining the stability margin of the blade rows isdemonstrated. Existing and new-developed boundary conditionsare described. It is shown that the result of numerical flowcalculations is dependent more on the quality of boundaryconditions, and less on the physical extension of thecomputational domain.
