2500|$|A {{decade after}} the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the {{cultural}} legacy of Romanian totalitarianism was undergoing critical reevaluation. As various critics note, the fact that Sfarmă-Piatră brought together some of the period's leading writers helps document the spread of fascism and antisemitism within the Romanian middle class in the 1930s and '40s. However, in post-communist times, some publishers have created controversy by choosing to omit mentions of Sfarmă-Piatră from the standard bibliographies of such figures, obscuring their association with the Iron Guard or with Antonescu. Referring to the standard dictionaries of Romanian literature, published or revised before 2005, literary historian Paul Cernat proposed that the selective censorship of totalitarian beliefs, either fascist or communist, rendered the works unreliable. An especially <b>contentious</b> <b>case</b> is that of Vintilă Horia. His inclusion among the fascist writers was repeatedly contested by those who regard him as mainly an anti-communist—according to Laszlo, these views rely on a severe distortion of historical facts. Writer and editor Geo Șerban also notes a habit of only mentioning Horia's contributions to the more palatable Gândirea, and so a tendency [...] "to hide away [...] involvement in the more foul, hooligan-like, campaigns of Sfarmă-Piatră or Porunca Vremii".|$|E

5000|$|In <b>contentious</b> <b>cases</b> (adversarial {{proceedings}} {{seeking to}} settle a dispute), the ICJ produces a binding ruling between states that agree {{to submit to the}} ruling of the court. Only states may be parties in <b>contentious</b> <b>cases.</b> Individuals, corporations, parts of a federal state, NGOs, UN organs and self-determination groups are excluded from direct participation in cases although the Court may receive information from public international organizations. That does not preclude non-state interests from being the subject of proceedings if a state brings the case against another. For example, a state may, in cases of [...] "diplomatic protection", bring a case on behalf of one of its nationals or corporations.|$|R

50|$|The Corfu Channel case (Affaire du Détroit de Corfou) was {{a public}} {{international}} law case heard before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) between 1947 and 1949, concerning state responsibility for damages at sea, {{as well as the}} doctrine of innocent passage. A <b>contentious</b> <b>case,</b> {{it was the first of}} any type heard by the ICJ after its establishment in 1945.|$|E
50|$|Advisory {{opinions}} {{have often}} been controversial because the questions asked are controversial or the case was pursued as an indirect way of bringing what is really a <b>contentious</b> <b>case</b> before the Court. Examples of advisory opinions {{can be found in}} the section advisory opinions in the List of International Court of Justice cases article. One such well-known advisory opinion is the Nuclear Weapons Case.|$|E
40|$|Protocol 16 ECHR {{will provide}} for an {{extension}} of the advisory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), enabling highest national courts to request advisory opinions on questions of principle concerning the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) or its Protocols. This extension of the ECtHR’s advisory jurisdiction aims to achieve two goals: a reduction in the ECtHR’s excessive docket, and the enhancement of dialogue between the ECtHR and (highest) national courts. While the aims of this reform initiative are laudable, we argue that Protocol 16 is likely to fail to achieve its objectives. Our analysis suggests that rather than facilitating the Court’s adjudicatory function, extended advisory jurisdiction has the potential to impact on the Court’s constitutionalist function in a manner which can be better achieved through the Court’s <b>contentious</b> <b>cases.</b> The burden this procedure will place on the Court’s already overstretched resources would risk delays to <b>contentious</b> <b>cases</b> and potentially undermine judicial comity should requests for advisory opinions be declined. Furthermore, evidence of ‘constructive’ dialogue between highest national courts and the ECtHR is emerging in <b>contentious</b> <b>cases</b> without the need for an extended advisory opinions mechanism. Rather than achieving its objectives, Protocol 16 risks exacerbating the Court’s backlog and nullifying the positive effects of advisory opinions on dialogue...|$|R

50|$|Article 31 of {{the statute}} sets out a {{procedure}} whereby ad hoc judges sit on contentious cases before the Court. The system allows any party to a <b>contentious</b> <b>case,</b> if it otherwise does not have one of that party's nationals sitting on the Court, to select one additional person to sit as a judge on that case only. It is thus possible {{that as many as}} seventeen judges may sit on one case.|$|E

Again the roadway air dispersion model was employed to predict levels of air pollution for residences, schools and parks near the Turnpike. After an initial hearing in Superior Court where the ESL model results were set forth, the judge ordered the Turnpike Authority {{to negotiate with the}} plaintiff, Concerned Citizens of East Brunswick and develop air quality mitigation for the adverse effects. The Turnpike Authority hired ERT as its expert, and the two research teams negotiated a settlement to this case using the newly created roadway air dispersion models.|$|E

Some, such as Candiano-Popescu, were very soon validated and able to take their seats; although elected for Senate, Haralambie soon gave up, after revelations {{that he was not}} of the legal age to run. Bishop Filaret, contested for legal reasons because he had been a monk, was nevertheless also accepted by Senate. Long conflicts ensued over the early opening of ballot boxes in various precincts. Some, including Alexandru Văsescu and Theodor Lateș, were confirmed regardless of this procedural objection. Another <b>contentious</b> <b>case</b> was that of Cezar Bolliac, who had lost his seat to Grigore Serrurie, still demanded to be recognized as a deputy, and had to be evicted from the Assembly; meanwhile, [...] "Red" [...] senator Anton Gugiu was confirmed by his peers in a special vote.

After a problematic murder investigation and a rushed and complicated trial, Zeigler was found guilty, but only after Paul, without the defense team's knowledge, [...] arranged for the hold-out juror's doctor to prescribe her Valium. Paul then overruled the jury's recommendation of a life sentence and sentenced Zeigler to death.

40|$|Social science {{evidence}} {{plays an}} increasingly important role in contentious constitutional litigation. This paper examines the competence of courts to examine these materials in spite of both time- and finance-based pressures. Rather than critique the judiciary’s ability to examine social science evidence, this article seeks to determine what judicial structure is best placed to examine these materials in <b>contentious</b> <b>cases</b> (particularly focusing on reference cases). Trial courts are determined to best address resource concerns, and are best able to handle expert evidence and social science data. Examination of three recent <b>contentious</b> constitutional <b>cases</b> confirms {{that they are able}} to weigh the latter materials well. They should thus be the court of first instance in contentious constitutional law references...|$|R
50|$|Disputes {{involving}} peerage {{claims were}} normally referred by the Crown to the House of Lords, perhaps because hereditary peers were, {{prior to the}} House of Lords Act 1999, members of that House.

In practice, however, such decisions are made in <b>contentious</b> <b>cases</b> only after a reference is made to the House of Lords.|$|R

50|$|The Rota's main {{function}} {{is that of}} an appellate tribunal, ordinarily reviewing decisions of lower courts if the initial court (first instance) and the first appellate court (second instance) do not agree {{on the outcome of}} a case; however, any party to an initial decision before a court of the Latin Church (and also some Eastern Churches) has the right to file a second-instance appeal directly to the Rota. Dominating its case load are petitions seeking the issuance of a decree of nullity of a marriage, although it has jurisdiction to hear any other type of judicial and non-administrative case in any area of canon law. The Rota serves as a tribunal of first instance (in Anglo-American common law what would be termed exclusive original jurisdiction) in certain cases such as any <b>contentious</b> <b>case</b> in which a Bishop of the Latin Church is a defendant. If the case can still be appealed after a Rotal decision, the appeal goes to a different turnus, or panel, of the Rota.|$|E

5000|$|She {{joined the}} Bergen County, New Jersey, prosecutor's office after {{completing}} her law school education, where she handled some 50 cases {{as an assistant}} prosecutor. Her most notable case was the 1978 [...] "Dr. X" [...] murder trial of Mario Jascalevich, which she took on only four years after completing law school. The case dated back to series of suspicious deaths of surgical patients at Riverdell Hospital in Oradell, New Jersey in the mid-1960s. An initial investigation did not turn up any conclusive evidence of wrongdoing and the case lay dormant for a decade. In 1976, M. A. Farber of The New York Times wrote a six-month-long series of investigative articles which blamed a [...] "Dr. X" [...] {{for a series of}} murders at the hospital using curare, a powerful muscle relaxant. The prosecutor's office reopened the case and an indictment was issued against Jascalevich, charging him with responsibility for five of the deaths after curare was found in bodies of patients that had been exhumed. The <b>contentious</b> <b>case</b> went to trial in February 1978, with Moses arguing that Jascalevich had played God, trying to make his colleagues look incompetent. Defense Attorney Raymond A. Brown argued that Jascalevich was framed by incompetent colleagues and explained that the curare was used in canine experiments. Brown subpoenaed reporter Farber's notes, and Farber was jailed for 40 days for refusing to turn over the documents Brown had requested. The trial lasted eight months, then the longest criminal trial in New Jersey history; Jascalevich was acquitted of all charges.|$|E

40|$|Is {{the legal}} {{protection}} that {{is given to}} the expression of Abrahamic religious belief adequate or appropriate in the context of English medical law? This is the central question that is explored in the thesis. A framework to support judges in the resolution of <b>contentious</b> <b>cases</b> that involve dissension between religious belief and medical law is developed from Alan Gewirth’s Principle of Generic Consistency (PGC). This framework is applied to a number of medical law cases studies: the principle of double effect, ritual male circumcision, female genital mutilation, Jehovah’s Witnesses (adults and children) who refuse blood transfusions, and conscientious objection of healthcare professionals to abortion. The thesis also examines the legal and religious contexts in which these <b>contentious</b> <b>cases</b> are arbitrated. It demonstrates how human rights law and the proposed framework can provide a gauge to measure competing rights and apply legitimate limits to the expression of religious belief, where appropriate. Thus, the original and significant contribution to knowledge is the development of an evaluative framework and its application to distinct case studies. This leads to the conclusion, based upon a stance of principled pragmatism, that some aspects of current legal protections in English medical law require amendment...|$|R

40|$|Human rights {{violations}} continue today {{at an alarming}} pace. To appreciate the severity of these violations, and the seemingly ineffectual response by the international legal regime, one {{need look no further}} than the persecuted Muslim Rohingya. The Rohingya people, an ethnic and religious minority in Myanmar, have been the subject of state-sponsored violence for years, a trend that continues despite Myanmar 2 ̆ 7 s recent moves towards democracy. Two of Myanmar 2 ̆ 7 s neighbors, Thailand and Bangladesh, have contributed to the problem by violating the international legal principle of non-refoulement. This Comment argues that the International Court ofJustice can play a larger role in policing and remedying human {{rights violations}}, using the Muslim Rohingya as a case study. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional requirements to hear a <b>contentious</b> <b>case</b> are stringent, and participation in an ICJ case generally requires the consent of the states involved. However, several current human rights treaties provide a way to get the plight of the Rohingya into the Court. Moreover, the Rohingya 2 ̆ 7 s plight can also be the subject of an ICJ advisory opinion, which would be more difficult than a <b>contentious</b> <b>case</b> to enforce, but which can be brought before the ICJ with relative ease, and which can be transformed from soft law to hard law by other international actors...|$|E
