5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. People {{may be given}} levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to <b>confirm</b> the PD diagnosis. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to <b>confirm</b> accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Issues of Gallicanism were {{prominent}} in the 1689 conclave that had elected Alexander VIII. Alexander's predecessor, Innocent XI, had refused to <b>confirm</b> new French bishops {{to the point where}} thirty-five dioceses lacked a bishop confirmed by Rome in 1688. Alexander's election had been secured by promising that he would <b>confirm</b> the unconfirmed French bishops. Despite this, Alexander's last act as pope before he died was to condemn the Declaration of the Clergy of France on 1 February 1691.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In a <b>confirmer</b> signature, {{verification}} of a signature requires collaboration of the <b>confirmer.</b> A Fail-Stop <b>Confirmer</b> signature provides protection against an enemy with unlimited computational power.

In this paper we discuss security issues that will arise in naive construction of such systems...|$|R

40|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>confirmer</b> signatures and ordinary digital signatures {{is that a}} <b>confirmer</b> signature can be verified only {{with the assistance of}} a semitrusted third party, the <b>confirmer.</b> Additionally, the <b>confirmer</b> can selectively convert single <b>confirmer</b> signatures into ordinary signatures. This paper points out that previous models for <b>confirmer</b> signature schemes are too restricted to address the case where several signers share the same <b>confirmer.</b> More seriously, we show that various proposed schemes (some of which are provably secure in these restricted models) are vulnerable to an adaptive signature-transformation attack. We define a new stronger model that covers this kind of attack and provide a generic solution based on any secure ordinary signa [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Where {{there is}} still a corneal reflex or {{spontaneous}} motor response to painful stimulus but all other criteria are satisfied, or where any of the criteria cannot be performed but the remaining criteria are satisfied, the irreversible cessation of all brain functions can be determined by a combination of the criteria that have been satisfied and the performance of a supplementary test. These tests are cerebral angiography to <b>confirm</b> that there is no intracranial blood flow, and a radionuclide scan to <b>confirm</b> that there is no intracranial perfusion.|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} of society-oriented {{designated}} <b>confirmer</b> signatures (SDCS) is introduced in this paper. SDCS {{is well suited}} to applications where the capability of the signer {{and that of the}} <b>confirmer</b> are both expected to be shared among a group of individuals. The ways to share the signing capability and the <b>confirming</b> capability are different due to the distinct stabilities of the signer group and the <b>confirmer</b> group. Based on the techniques of threshold cryptography, a concrete SDCS scheme is proposed and its security is analyzed. Ordinary designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures and threshold designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures can be regarded as special cases of the proposed society-oriented designated <b>confirmer</b> signatures. Meanwhile, our scheme can be converted into an ordinary signature scheme or a designated verifier signature scheme...|$|R
