50|$|In 1842 Alexander Keith Johnston (1804-1871) visited Gotha {{to discuss}} several {{projects}} with Perthes. These negotiation first {{resulted in the}} publication of the National Atlas of General Geography, which contained 4 maps by Berghaus. Though Berghaus deemed the commercial and scientific climate in England not ready for scientific maps Johnston persisted in wanting to publish a translation of the Physikalischer Atlas, on which he requested aid from Berghaus. With a letter of recommendation by von Humboldt in October 1844 Heinrich ‘Henry’ Lange joined Johnston in Edinburgh for this purpose. Petermann stayed behind in Gotha and became teacher in the 2nd course of Berghaus’ school. In April 1845 he followed Lange, who received him in his house in Edinburgh and acquainted him with the friends he had made. Together they made a tour through the Grampians, applying what they had learned by using barometers for height measurements and taking geological and botanical samples. Meanwhile, they also worked on the Johnston’s Physical atlas (Physical geography, illustrating in a series of original designs, the elementary facts of geology, hydrology, meteorology and natural history etc.) and several other cartographic publications.During his time in Edinburgh he may have come into contact with the publisher G.H. Swanston, for whom he constructed several maps for The Royal Illustrated Atlas, Of Modern Geography, 1st edition published in 27 parts 1854-62. and republished probably in 1872. He also may have met in Edinburgh with John Bartholomew Jr. (1831-1893), who created many maps in the same atlas. John Bartholomew became Petermann’s student in Gotha from 1855 till he was recalled to his father’s firm in 1856. The German school of cartography was pre-eminent, and four generations of Bartholomews widened their knowledge by studying with the German masters. John George’s son Ian studied in Leipzig (1907-8) with Oswald Winkel. His grandson John Christopher carried on the tradition, studying with Eduard Imhof, the great Swiss cartographer, in Berne and Zurich in 1960, and his son John Eric followed in 1977 with Imhof’s pupil, Ernst Spiess."Bartholomew is best known for the development of colour contouring (or hypsometric tints), the system of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green.

However, he might have picked up this idea during his time in Gotha as the colour scheme was first introduced by Emil von Sydow (1812-1873) in 1838 when he developed a color methodology for landscape features using hachures, where green was depicted for lowlands and brown used for highlands. The white for the higher reaches might later have been used by Hermann Haack (1872-1966) for his Perthes’ wall maps.Several maps have been co-constructions of Petermann and Bartholomew.|$|E

In this paper, a contouring control method for biaxial feed drive systems is presented, which transforms tracking errors in each feed drive axis into errors that are reference to a moving frame around the desired position. The method is extended to include a referenced adjustment function for reducing inherent contour errors in the moving frame approach. Because friction is a major disturbance in motion control of feed drive systems, a friction compensation method for the <b>contouring</b> control <b>systems</b> is proposed.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scanners {{have long been}} used to produce three-dimensional (3 D) samplings of anatomy elements for use in medical visualization and analysis. From such data sets, physicians often need to construct surfaces representing anatomical shapes in order to conduct treatment, such as irradiating a tumor. Traditionally, this is done through a time-consuming and error-prone process in which an experienced scientist or physician marks a series of parallel contours that outline the structures of interest. Recent advances in sur-face reconstruction algorithms have led to methods for reconstructing surfaces from nonparallel contours that could greatly reduce the manual component of this pro-cess.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Optical contouring is a full field, non-contact technique capable of determining shape and deformation data from 3 -D surfaces. The data, which are obtained from the optical <b>contouring</b> <b>system,</b> represent the surface geometry at evenly sampled points. The main objective of this thesis is to report some advances achieved by the author in the optical contouring field. Conditions for the design and construction of optical systems to measure object topography and deformation using the same hardware, {{as well as the}} optical working methodology and system parameters, are analysed. The conventional in-plane and out-of-plane optical setups for displacement sensitive ESP I systems are employed to contour. The contour maps are obtained by giving small displacements to optical fibres carrying the object and reference beam illumination. A rigorous mathematical treatment of shape contours generated by ESPI is given. It is experimentally verified that the fringe patterns produced are identical to projected fringe contours, and may be analysed in the same way. Then, practical systems which combine deformation and shape measurement in both in-plane and out-of-plane ESPI configuration are demonstrated. Comparison is made with shape measurement using two fringe projection moire techniques. The first moire technique uses electronic demodulation to obtain the contour maps. This technique encodes and analyses moire contours by using an electronic system similar to that used for Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI). Hence automatic fringe detection and contour measurement is possible. The Talbot effect, where the self imaging of a periodic object is used as second moire technique. The Talbot image of a linear grating is imaged on the target surface. The grating lines are deformed according to the surface shape. Viewing this deformed grating image through a second reference grating, generates contour maps. A novel on-axis sensor which directly measures distance as a direct colour mapping is introduced. It is emphasized that all the techniques researched here can be extended to be applied as industrial tools for surface inspection or quality control.

40|$|AbstractConventional {{coronary}} arteriography is able {{to demonstrate}} the presence of coronary collateral vessels but cannot delineate the specific region of myocardium to which they supply blood. To test the hypothesis that contrast echocardiography can specifically identify collateralized myocardium, contrast echocardiographic perfusion “maps” were compared in patients with (n = 12) end without (n = 12) angiographic evidence of coronary collateral flow, {{both before and after}} coronary angioplasty. Contrast echocardiographic images of the mid-left ventricle in the short-axis view at end-diastole were obtained after separate injections of a sonicated contrast agent into both {{the right and the left}} coronary arteries. A computerbased <b>contouring</b> <b>system</b> was used to determine the individual areas of myocardium perfused by each of the two coronary arteries and then to superimpose the images of the two perfusion beds. The resulting area of overlapping perfusion represented myocardium receiving blood flow from both coronary systems and was defined as collateralized myocardium. To normalize for heart size, overlap area was expressed as a percent of total myocardial area, which was the area between endocardium and epicardium in the short-axis view. To adjust for differences in vascular distribution, overlap area was expressed as a percent of the perfusion area of the recipient vessel. In patients with angiographic collateral flow, the recipient vessel was that vessel receiving the collateral flow. In patients without angiographic collateral flow, the right coronary artery was considered the recipient vessel. Overlap area was 1. 3 ± 0. 4 % of total myocardial area and 6. 6 ± 1. 7 % of recipient vessel area in patients without angiographic evidence of collateral flow compared with 30. 6 ± 2. 5 % and 89. 2 ± 6. 4 %, respectively, in patients with angiographic collateral flow (p < 0. 001 for both). In four patients in whom angiographic collateral flow was abolished by angioplasty, overlap area decreased from 30. 3 ± 5. 3 % to 6. 8 ± 2. 7 % of total myocardial area and from 100 % to 18. 5 ± 5. 4 % of recipient vessel area (p < 0. 05 for both).

40|$|Genitourinary cancer {{refers to}} the {{presence}} of tumours in the genital or urinary organs such as bladder, kidney and prostate. In 2008 the worldwide incidence of bladder cancer was 382, 600 with a mortality of 150, 282. Radiotherapy {{is one of the main}} treatment choices for genitourinary cancer where accurate delineation of the gross tumour volume (GTV) on computed tomography (CT) images is crucial for the success of this treatment. Limited CT resolution and contrast in soft tissue organs make this difficult and has led to significant inter- and intra- clinical variability in defining the extent of the GTV, especially at the junctions of different organs. In addition the introduction of new imaging techniques and modalities has significantly increased the number of the medical images that require contouring. More advanced image processing is required to help reduce contouring variability and assist in handling the increased volume of data. In this thesis image analysis methodologies were used to extract low-level features such as entropy, moment and correlation from radiotherapy planning CT images. These distinctive features were identified and used for defining the GTV and to implement a fully-automatic <b>contouring</b> <b>system.</b> The first key contribution is to demonstrate that second-order statistics from co-occurrence matrices (GTSDM) give higher accuracy in classifying soft tissue regions of interest (ROIs) into GTV and non-GTV. Loadings of the principal components (PCs) of the GTSDM features were found to be consistent over different patients. Exhaustive feature selection suggested that entropies and correlations produced consistently larger areas under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves than first-order features. The second significant contribution is to demonstrate that in the bladder-prostate junction, where the largest inter-clinical variability is observed, the second-order principal entropy from stationery wavelet denoised CT images (DPE) increased the saliency of the bladder prostate junction. As a result thresholding of the DPE produced good agreement between gold standard clinical contours and those produced by this approach with Dice coefficients. The third contribution is to implement a fully automatic and reproducible system for bladder cancer GTV auto-contouring based on classifying second-order statistics. The Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) were employed to evaluate the automatic contours. It was found that in the mid-range of the bladder the automatic contours are accurate, but in the inferior and superior ends of bladder automatic contours were more likely to have small DSCs with clinical contours, which reconcile with the fact of clinical variability in defining GTVs. A novel male bladder probability atlas was constructed based on the clinical contours and volume estimation from the classification results. Registration of the classification results with this probabilistic atlas consistently increases the DSCs of the inferior slices...|$|E
