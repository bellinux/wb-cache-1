5|$|In statistics, maximum spacing {{estimation}} (MSE or MSP), or maximum {{product of}} spacing estimation (MPS), {{is a method}} for estimating the parameters of a univariate statistical model.

5|$|The concept {{underlying}} {{the method is}} based on the probability integral transform, in that a set of independent random samples derived from any random variable should on average be uniformly distributed with respect to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>distribution</b> function of the random variable. The MPS method chooses the parameter values that make the observed data as uniform as possible, according to a specific quantitative measure of uniformity.|$|E

5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space.

ABSTRACT: To asses {{correctly}} {{distances between}} {{events in a}} parameter space we replace the values of parameters with the values of their <b>cumulative</b> <b>distributions.</b> The <b>cumulative</b> <b>distributions</b> result from the kernel estimation.

25|$|Continuous {{probability}} distributions can {{be described}} in several ways. The probability density function describes the infinitesimal probability of any given value, and the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by integrating the probability density function over that interval. On the other hand, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>distribution</b> function describes the probability that the random variable is no larger than a given value; the probability that the outcome lies in a given interval can be computed by taking the difference between the values of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>distribution</b> function at the endpoints of the interval. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>distribution</b> function is the antiderivative of the probability density function provided that the latter function exists.|$|E
25|$|Here FX is the <b>cumulative</b> <b>distribution</b> {{function}} of X, and the integral {{is of the}} Riemann–Stieltjes kind.

This requirement {{is stronger than}} simple continuity of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>distribution</b> function, {{and there is a}} special class of distributions, singular distributions, which are neither continuous nor discrete nor a mixture of those. An example is given by the Cantor distribution. Such singular distributions however are never encountered in practice.|$|E

Further, the equation helps interpolation and extrapolation.However, care should be taken with extrapolating a <b>cumulative</b> frequency <b>distribution,</b> because {{this may be a}} source of errors.
