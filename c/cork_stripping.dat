40|$|Differences of {{raw cork}} quality, {{in terms of}} {{thickness}} and porosity, were observed in productive cork oak (Quercus suber L.) stands in the Nebrodi and Iblei mountains of Sicily in relation to stand density. Five study areas were chosen {{across a range of}} different stand density satisfying specific sampling requirements among two managed cork oak stands. Analysis of variance using Fisher-Snedecor's F test (p< 0, 05) were used to identify statistically significant differences of cork quality and sylvicultural, dendrometric and <b>cork</b> <b>stripping</b> parameters between study areas within each stand and also between stands. Relationships between cork quality and sylvicultural and dendrometric parameters were also tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). The results shown that sylvicultural practices are a key factor influencing cork quality: statistically significant differences in cork thickness and crown area were observed between areas at different stand density; positive correlations were found between cork thickness and crown area in lower density study areas favouring a significant vegetative activity; negative correlations were found between the parameters of <b>cork</b> <b>stripping</b> (<b>cork</b> <b>stripping</b> coefficient, <b>cork</b> <b>stripping</b> surface, maximum height of <b>cork</b> <b>stripping)</b> and cork thickness. No correlations were found between cork porosity and dendrometric or sylvicultural parameters, demonstrating the probable genetic origin of cork porosity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study aims to (1) {{evaluate}} {{the environmental impacts}} associated with {{the three types of}} raw cork produced in Portuguese cork oak woodlands (in Alentejo region) considering two alternative practices for stand establishment (plantation and natural regeneration), (2) compare the environmental impacts of raw cork production in Portuguese cork oak woodlands and in Catalonian cork oak forests, and (3) assess the influence of different allocation criteria for partitioning the environmental impacts between the different types of raw cork produced. : A cradle-to-gate approach was adopted starting with stand establishment up to cork storage in a field yard. The system boundaries include all management operations undertaken during the following stages: stand establishment, stand tending, <b>cork</b> <b>stripping,</b> and field recovery. The allocation of the environmental impacts to reproduction, second, and virgin cork was based on mass and market price criteria. An alternative allocation approach was simulated by allocating environmental impacts also to the wood produced in the cork oak stands. The impact assessment was performed using the characterization factors recommended by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD). and discussion: In Portugal, cork produced from naturally regenerated stands has a better environmental performance than cork produced from planted stands, but the differences are smaller than 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{sprouting}} response {{types of}} 1, 151 cork oak (Quercus suber) trees one and half {{years after a}} wildfire in southern Portugal were characterised. It was hypothesised that different response types should occur according to the following conceptual model: an increased level of damage (fire severity) on a sprouting tree that suffered a crown fire {{was expected to be}} reflected in a sequence of four alternative events, namely (a) resprouting exclusively from crown, (b) simultaneous resprouting from crown and base, (c) resprouting exclusively from base and (d) plant death. To assess whether the level of expected damage was influenced by the level of protection from disturbance, we explored the relationships between response types and tree size, bark thickness and <b>cork</b> <b>stripping,</b> using an informationtheoretic approach. The more common response type was crown resprouting (68. 8 % of the trees), followed by plant death (15. 8 %), simultaneous resprouting from crown and base (10. 1 %) and basal resprouting (5. 3 %). In agreement with the conceptual model, trees which probably suffered a higher level of damage by fire (larger trees with thinner bark; exploited for cork) died or resprouted exclusively from base. On the other hand, trees that were well protected (smaller trees with thicker bark not exploited for cork) were able to rebuild their canopy through crown resprouting. Simultaneous resprouting from the crown and base was determined mainly by tree size, and it was more common in smaller tree...|$|E
50|$|Both sides lined out {{in their}} usual jerseys. Offaly wore their green, white and gold <b>strip</b> while <b>Cork</b> lined {{out in their}} {{traditional}} red jerseys. There was one special change to the <b>Cork</b> <b>strip</b> that was introduced prior to the game. The Cork jersey now had the word 'Corcaigh' emblazoned across the front while the jersey also contained the GAA centenary logo. Only one set of these jerseys were made.|$|R
50|$|This red {{and white}} colour scheme {{has led to the}} <b>Cork</b> <b>strip</b> being nicknamed the blood and bandage. A colour clash with Louth in the 1957 All-Ireland Football Final saw Cork wear the blue jerseys again, but this {{occasion}} saw the team wear the blue jersey of the province of Munster. In 1976 Cork's footballers became involved in an incident known as 'the three stripes affair'. Before the Munster football final Cork were offered a set of Adidas jerseys. The use of these jerseys caused controversy as it seemed to undermine the promotion of Irish manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The mid 19th century {{brought more}} complex corsets (no longer called stays) and tighter lacing, which {{required}} more boning {{to create the}} desired shape. The modern busk was popular allowing corsets to easily open in the front. Steel and baleen (whalebone) were the dominant materials for boning and were occasionally used together. By {{the fourth quarter of}} the 19th century baleen was growing increasingly more expensive and becoming more difficult to acquire. This encouraged experimentation into types of materials used for boning. Some of the most popular alternatives were <b>cork</b> <b>strips,</b> cording, watchspring steel, Coraline, and Featherbone. Coraline was manufactured from the straight, stiff fibers of the Mexican ixtle plant, bound together by two strands of thread wrapped in opposite directions. Featherbone was manufactured from the quills of feathers. The extremely rigid and elongated torso popular in the 1880s to early 1890s required extensive boning to support and enhance the steam-molded and starched corsets of the period.|$|R
40|$|Aim of study: The aim of {{this study}} is to test new tools {{designed}} to debark cork oak trees: mechanized tools to perform cutting operations (IPLA-Morell, Stihl MC 200 and COVELESS) and manual tools to separate and extract the cork (cork pincers, MIJURO). Area of study: Southwestern Spain. Material and methods: One of the longstanding problems affecting the sector is the shortage of skilled labor to perform debarking due to the difficulty of handling axes and the temporary nature of the work. To overcome these problems, four debarking systems using the new tools were designed according to the morphological properties of cork oak. The viability of the debarking systems were evaluated based on productivity (kg · person– 1 · hour– 1), production costs (€ · t 1) and percentage of pieces smaller than 400 cm 2 (%), and compared with the traditional system. Debarking quality and operator experience were also evaluated. A total of 204 trees were debarked. Main results: The new systems obtain better results: productivity is higher, the percentage of pieces is slightly lower and production costs are reduced, except for one system. Debarking quality improves with the new tools as cork is extracted in a more precise and cleaner manner, thus permitting cork manufacturers to obtain higher yields from the cork planks. Research highlights: Semi-skilled operators using the new tools obtain very similar results to skilled operators using axes. This would therefore resolve the problem of the lack of skilled labor, while improving the working conditions of operators. The results demonstrate that the new tools are viable for cork debarking and can bring potential benefits to the sector.

40|$|ES] En muy pocas ocasiones tiene hoy lugar el refugado, cocido y enfardado del corcho en el mismo monte, a diferencia de lo que ocurría desde {{la tercera}} década del siglo XIX hasta las primeras décadas del XX. Los Montes Propios de Jerez de la Frontera es una de las tres excepciones en el Parque Natural de los Alcornocales. Son tres opciones potenciales de venta del corcho llegado el año final del turno de saca del corcho: (i) en pie, (ii) en cargadero a pie de carril y (iii) una vez preparado en fardos y a granel. El interés de esta investigación es presentar la renta total y la tasa de rentabilidad comerciales alcanzadas en cada eslabón de la Cadena de integración {{vertical}} del corcho sacado y cocido en los Montes Propios de Jerez, considerando los datos de un año medio del período 1994 - 2002 a precios de poder adquisitivo de 2002. [EN] * Nowadays, in few cases {{the preparation of}} cork bark takes place at cork Oak woodland estates {{as it has been}} occurred from the third decade of the 19 th century to {{the first decades of the}} 20 th century, by the beginning of cork commercial extraction activity. The Montes Propios de Jerez de la Frontera is one of the three exceptions at the Alcornocales Natural Park, which is located in the southwest of Spain spreading out the provinces of Cádiz and Málaga along 170. 025 hectares. The cork Oak is the main specie taking up the 48. 5 per cent of his total surface. There are three cork purchasing alternatives for a cork Oak woodland owner once the <b>cork</b> <b>stripping</b> turn is accomplished: to sell cork (i) standing, (ii) at farm gate or (iii) prepared for stoppers and other cork products industries. At the Montes Propios de Jerez de la Frontera the cork is sold by the third alternative. The aim of this research is to present the total commercial income and profitability rate accrued from each link of the vertical integrated cork chain, for cork that is annually stripped and boiled at the Montes Propios de Jerez. The Agroforestry Account System (AAS) methodology is used to classify the different productions and costs generated in each link of the vertical integrated cork chain, considering average values of period 1994 - 2003, expressed at purchasing power terms of year 2002. Moreover, the results obtained are integrated with the rest of activities which are conducted in the Montes Propios de Jerez de la Frontera, offering a global view of their private commercial economy. The fact the studied state is property of a public institution could justify the fulfilment of the second and the third link of the vertical chain, since the capital profitability rates are negative, although the overall rate is positive. So, the criteria followed by the managers of the Montes Propios de Jerez de la Frontera reflect a social economy with high levels of employed labour force. This could explain why the preparation of the cork bark in the cork Oak woodland estates has practically disappeared in the Alcornocales Natural Park, and the private owners prefers to sell the cork standing or at farm gate.
