50|$|Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI) was an American {{publisher}} of board wargames and related magazines, particularly its flagship Strategy & Tactics, in the 1970s and early 1980s. It produced {{an enormous number}} of games and introduced innovative practices, changing the course of the wargaming hobby in its bid {{to take control of the}} hobby away from then-dominant Avalon Hill. SPI ran out of cash in early 1982 when TSR <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> secured by SPI's assets. TSR began selling SPI's inventory in 1982, but later acquired the company's trademarks and copyrights in 1983 and continued a form of the operation until 1987.|$|R

50|$|Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is a {{youthful}} criminal who is intrigued {{with the film}} persona of Humphrey Bogart. After stealing <b>a</b> car <b>in</b> Marseille, Michel shoots and kills a policeman who has followed him onto a country road. Penniless and {{on the run from}} the police, he turns to an American love interest Patricia (Jean Seberg), a student and aspiring journalist, who sells the New York Herald Tribune on the streets of Paris. The ambivalent Patricia unwittingly hides him in her apartment as he simultaneously tries to seduce her and <b>call</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to fund their escape to Italy. Patricia says she is pregnant, probably with Michel's child. She learns that Michel is on the run when questioned by the police. Eventually she betrays him, but before the police arrive she tells Michel what she has done. He is somewhat resigned to <b>a</b> life <b>in</b> prison, and does not try to escape at first. The police shoot him in the street and, after a prolonged death run, he dies “à bout de souffle” (out of breath).|$|R

Harvey resents the competition and intends to <b>call</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> overdue <b>loan</b> immediately, but Jack enters a rodeo, wins first prize in the bucking bronco competition and pays off the debt.|$|R
25|$|On 29 June, club {{president}} Carson Yeung {{was arrested}} in Hong Kong on charges of money laundering, relating to a period before his involvement with the club. He was bailed to re-appear in August, his assets were frozen, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange suspended trading of shares in the club's holding company, Birmingham International Holdings (BIHL), in which Yeung was the single largest shareholder with around 26%. BIHL appointed acting chairman Peter Pannu and Yeung's 18-year-old son Ryan {{to the board of}} the football club, and Michael Wiseman stepped down from the board, ending an 83-year formal association between the club and the Wiseman family. Although it appeared that HSBC, the club's bankers, were unlikely to <b>call</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> secured on the St Andrew's site, as such a course of action would make it difficult for the club to continue, thus reducing the likelihood of HSBC recovering their money, Yeung's situation impeded the search for new investment. Such a combination of factors, added to the reduced income to be expected following relegation, left the club in financial difficulty and ready to off-load high-earning players, particularly in light of the Football League's adoption of UEFA's financial fair-play regulations relating to clubs not spending in excess of their revenue.|$|R

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> bid {{to reverse}} its decline the party adopted a {{strongly}} anti-semitic platform. Thurlow notes: 'it was noticeable that the BF became increasingly anti-semitic in its death throes.' In 1933 Lord and Lady Downe, {{as representatives of}} the British Fascists, entertained Nazi German envoy Gunther Schmidt-Lorenzen at their country estate and suggested {{to him that the}} Nazis should avoid any links with Mosley, whom Lady Downe accused of being in the pay of Jewish figures such as Baron Rothschild and Sir Philip Sassoon. Fellow member Madame Arnaud repeated similar allegations about Mosley to another German official, Dr Margarete Gartner of the Economic Policy Association. However, by this stage Lintorn-Orman's mother had cut her off financially after hearing lurid tales of debauchery involving the female fascist leader and so the group fell into debt until being declared bankrupt <b>in</b> 1934 when <b>a</b> Colonel Wilson <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> £500 <b>loan.</b> This effectively brought the British Fascists to a conclusion; Rotha Lintorn-Orman died the following year.|$|R
50|$|The Panic of 1884 was a panic {{during the}} Depression of 1882-85. Gold {{reserves}} of Europe were depleted and the New York City national banks, with tacit {{approval of the}} United States Treasury Department, halted investments {{in the rest of}} the United States and <b>called</b> <b>in</b> outstanding <b>loans.</b> <b>A</b> larger crisis was averted when New York Clearing House bailed out banks in risk of failure.

Richardson responded by issuing $26 million in greenbacks to meet the demand. The legality of his action was doubtful, but the Congress did not interfere and the crisis was eased. Such cycles of expansion and panic continued for the next thirty years, however, and were {{the basis for the}} creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.|$|R

50|$|National bank {{currency}} {{was considered}} inelastic {{because it was}} based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds rather than the growing desire for easy credit. If Treasury bond prices declined, a national bank had {{to reduce the amount of}} currency it had in circulation by either refusing to make new loans or by <b>calling</b> <b>in</b> loans it had made already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-based banks were required to set aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks, which in turn were required to have reserves in central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves to finance full plantings, and during the harvest seasons they would use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds, by borrowing from a clearing house or by <b>calling</b> <b>in</b> <b>loans.</b> <b>As</b> there was little in the way of deposit insurance, if a bank was rumored to be having liquidity problems then this might cause many people to remove their funds from the bank. Because of the crescendo effect of banks which lent more than their assets could cover, during the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial panics.|$|R

Showing how the return to the classed society divided those families who once had fought as brothers. This return to the old classed society resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sense of betrayal on one side and guilty indignation on the other. This until the niece of an estate owner befriends a neighboring family. The neighbors who had lost their noble status still maintained a large tract of land which they farmed successfully themselves. While her own uncle {{is on the verge of}} losing his estate because his brother <b>in</b> law is <b>calling</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> old <b>loan</b> of money. The brother in law wants to spend the money on a big dowry and grand piano for his daughter. The niece understands the financial position. Her own father lost his estate and they both live with the uncle. The niece finds more happiness in her new friendship with her neighbors than with those of her own class. She begins to spend all her time next door learning to do the chores of a peasant farmer's wife. This is unlike her aunt who spends her days reclining on a couch acting the grand lady. The aunt is completely incapable of understanding how close she is to losing her couch. From her couch the aunt entertains a wealthy suitor who is connected to the family. But the niece declines the offer of marriage from this suitor. The suitor is also a very sedate morphine addict but he is a noble. Her family can not understand what she could be thinking to reject such an advantageous offer. Until she marries the handsome peasant farmer next door. The family grudgingly at first admit it is a very good match after all. This alliance heals the breach between peasant and noble. The old promises of solidarity between the neighbors are reaffirmed.

A victory postponed and finally won,"Nad Niemnem" [...]Nad Niemnem, based on the novel of the same name. It was released in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|The claimant, Mr Smith, was {{the former}} {{managing}} director and controlling shareholder {{of a company}} called Display Electronics Ltd (referred to in the judgment as [...] "DEL"). At some time in 1988, Mr Smith decided to transfer the banking for DEL from Barclays Bank Plc to Lloyds Bank. At that time DEL owed Barclays over £250,000. An agreement was entered into between Mr Smith, DEL and Lloyds under which Lloyds would take over the funding of the development, {{but one of the}} terms of this agreement was that both Mr Smith's personal borrowings (which at that time were very small) and DEL's borrowings would be subject to a security interest over the development in favour of the bank, and also by a mortgage on Mr Smith's home. DEL did not prosper, and eventually Lloyds <b>called</b> <b>in</b> its <b>loans.</b> <b>As</b> a result, DEL went into liquidation, and Mr Smith lost his home. The bank also lodged a bankruptcy petition with respect to Mr Smith personally. A number of litigation cases ensued between Mr Smith and Lloyds. One of the assertions Mr Smith made in these cases was that he and Lloyds had entered into an oral agreement to the effect that Lloyds would make available to DEL long term finance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> substantial amount. Lloyds always denied the existence of any such oral agreement. In {{at least two of the}} actions findings of fact had been made to the effect that no such oral agreement existed.
