5|$|For {{his part}} in the battle, King was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 20 January 1944. He <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> form of unit award, and later regretted not asking Whitehead for an American Distinguished Unit Citation, such as was awarded to D Company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, for a similar action in the Battle of Long Tan in 1966.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} by Brown & Kempf in 1968 {{based on two}} workers collected in a Berlese sample of humus in El Salvador. Due to morphological similarities, they <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> very primitive ant {{and placed it in}} what was then a myrmicine tribe, the Agroecomyrmecini, together with ants known from Early Eocene Baltic amber (Agroecomyrmex) and late Eocene Florissant shale (Eulithomyrmex).|$|E
5|$|Poe eschewed the {{scientific}} method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.|$|E
50|$|The Balti {{language}} {{belongs to}} the Tibetic language family. Read (1934) <b>considers</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> dialect of Ladakhi, while Tournadre (2005) <b>considers</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> sister language of Ladakhi.|$|R

5|$|Russia and Poland {{remained}} {{divided on}} the legal description of the Katyn crime. The Poles <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> case of genocide and demanded further investigations, as well as complete disclosure of Soviet documents.|$|E
5|$|Williams was a vocal {{supporter}} of Dwight D. Eisenhower. According to singer Jo Stafford, he sent Eisenhower a telegram {{on his birthday}} prior to the 1952 presidential election informing him that Williams <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> personal honor to endorse a military figure to lead the nation in its coming future.|$|E
5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} first people he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, as he did not have one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like herself out of all the roles she has played.|$|E

50|$|Some {{authorities}} <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of Cucurbita okeechobeensis.|$|R
50|$|Some authors <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> {{subspecies}} of Catocala kuangtungensis.|$|R
5|$|Another species {{complex in}} Attalea {{includes}} A.speciosa and related species. Henderson (1995) recognised A.speciosa and A.spectabilis, considering {{the latter to}} either be an acaulescent form of A.speciosa or a hybrid between it and A.microcarpa. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted A.spectabilis, but Glassman <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> dubious taxon. Attalea vitrivir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors; Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of A.speciosa. Glassman also described a fourth member of this group, A.brejinhoensis, and it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield.|$|E
5|$|As a halogen, {{astatine}} {{tends to}} be classified as a nonmetal. It has some marked metallic properties and is sometimes instead classified as either a metalloid or (less often) as a metal. Immediately following its production in 1940, early investigators <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> metal. In 1949 {{it was called the}} most noble (difficult to reduce) nonmetal as well as being a relatively noble (difficult to oxidize) metal. In 1950 astatine was described as a halogen and (therefore) a reactive nonmetal. In 2013, on the basis of relativistic modelling, astatine was predicted to be a monatomic metal, with a face-centred cubic crystalline structure.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> good omen.|$|E

5|$|Bo {{took up the}} Chongqing post on 30 November, a month {{following}} {{the conclusion of the}} Congress, even though Wang Yang had vacated the position on 13 November. Whilst some saw this transfer as a 'banishment' from the central government to the hinterlands to keep Bo's perceived arrogance and high-profile antics out of Beijing's view, others <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> promotion since being the party chief in one of the four direct-controlled municipalities came with an ex officio seat on the Politburo.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century the Cherokee and Creek {{had begun to}} compete for the same {{resources}} and fought a battle at nearby Slaughter Gap. The Creek lost, ceding the Blood Mountain area to the Cherokee, who <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> holy place. Archaeological evidence has been discovered that tends to back the story of the battle, but the date of the battle and its participants are still disputed.|$|E
5|$|Cornelio Saavedra, who {{was aware}} of the conspiracy, <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> plot by peninsulars to secure {{political}} power over the criollo peoples. He marched with the Regiment of Patricians swiftly to the Plaza, and thwarted the mutiny. There was no violence in the operation, as the criollos forced the rebels to give up just by the sheer force of numbers. Thus, Liniers stayed in office as viceroy. All the heads of the mutiny were sentenced to prison at Carmen de Patagones, and the militias that took part in it were dissolved. The only peninsular militias remaining were those of Andaluces and Montañeses, who did not join the mutiny; criollos obtained the military command, and the political power of Saavedra increased even more.|$|E
5000|$|Director’s note: [...] "The Camp … you may <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> {{film and}} maybe not…. You may <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> short trip After taking this trip I asked myself … what is pleasure? Before {{trying to explain}} the answer I have reached…. Let {{me tell you the}} story from the beginning.|$|R
5000|$|Some sources <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> part of {{the broad}} {{ligament}} of uterus while other sources just <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "termination" [...] of the ligament. <b>It</b> is not <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> true ligament in {{that it does not}} physically support any anatomical structures; however <b>it</b> is <b>an</b> important landmark and it houses the ovarian vessels.|$|R

5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive. Although critics felt that it lacked a classic single and <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> minor letdown compared to Body Talk Pt. 1, it received praise for being solid and club-ready. In Sweden, the album {{reached the top of}} the Sverigetopplistan chart. It also reached number one in Denmark and number three in Norway. In the United States, it peaked at number forty-one, becoming Robyn's highest position on the chart.|$|E
5|$|Development on {{the film}} began in 2001, when Spears created a concept that was later {{expanded}} by Rhimes. Principal filming began on March 2001, and encompassed {{over a period of}} six months. Critics gave negative reviews to Crossroads; however, they <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> better effort when compared to Mariah Carey's 2001 film Glitter. Despite the movie's response from critics, it was a box office success, grossing over $61.1 million worldwide in three months.|$|E
5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations {{was reflected in the}} cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier Soviet leaders would have <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> provocation.|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{controversy}} {{as to whether}} Green Zebra should be considered an heirloom tomato. Some people don't <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> heirloom quite yet, while others <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> either <b>an</b> heirloom, [...] "modern heirloom" [...] or [...] "created heirloom'.|$|R
5|$|Finally, {{the supreme}} {{director}} Juan Martín de Pueyrredón appointed {{a commission to}} discuss the case of Saavedra. By this time, the Congress of Tucumán had made the Argentine Declaration of Independence {{a couple of years}} before. The commission restored Saavedra with the military rank of brigadier, and ordered the payment of all the wages he did not receive during the time he was demoted. A second commission ratified the ruling. The payment was not enough to compensate Saavedra's losses, but he <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> token of his restored prestige. He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján.|$|E
5|$|Giving Jharokha Darshan {{from this}} jharokha was a daily feature. This {{tradition}} was also continued by rulers who followed Akbar (r. 1556–1605 CE). Jahangir (r. 1605–27 CE) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628–58 CE) also appeared before their subjects punctiliously. However, this ancient practice was discontinued by Aurangzeb during his 11th year of reign as he <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> non-Islamic practice, {{a form of}} idol worship. In Agra Fort and Red Fort, the jharokha faces the Yamuna and the emperor would stand alone on the jharokha to greet his subjects.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high dynamic range, global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> waste of resources.|$|E
60|$|I {{assured her}} we {{understood}} this, and <b>considered</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> admirable idea.|$|R
25|$|Nowadays, the {{linguistic}} classification of Tunisian Arabic causes controversies between interested people. The problem is caused {{because of the}} Arabic dialect continuum. Some linguists, such as Michel Quitout and Keith Walters, <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> independent language, and some others, such as Enam El-Wer, <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> divergent dialect of Arabic that is still dependent of Arabic morphology and structures.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{authorities}} <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> subspecies of the ferruginous pygmy-owl, {{in which}} case it is called Glaucidium brasilianum pallens. [...] For example, the IUCN does not list it. [...] Among authorities that do <b>consider</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> full species are the 2007 Clements Checklist of Birds of the World and the Handbook of the Birds of the World.|$|R
