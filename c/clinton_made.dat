5|$|On February 15, 1993, <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> {{his first}} {{address to the}} nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in a nationally {{televised}} address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Washington at {{this time}} moved his {{headquarters}} from Middlebrook in New Jersey up to New Windsor on the Hudson, with an army of 10,000. The British, led by <b>Clinton,</b> <b>made</b> a move up the Hudson against American posts at Verplanck's Point and Stony Point, and both places succumbed; but a counter-offensive was briefly successful by the patriots led by General Anthony Wayne. Clinton was able to shut off Kings Ferry in the end, {{but it was a}} strategic loss; he could proceed no farther up the river due to American fortifications and Washington's army. The skirmishes at Verplanck's Point and at Stony Point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous boost to morale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E

5|$|On September 22, 1993, <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> a major {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} {{a health care}} reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
5|$|The Clintons accrued {{several million}} dollars in legal fees during his presidency; the bills were paid off four years after he left office. Bill and Hillary Clinton have both {{received}} {{millions of dollars in}} book authorship fees. In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001 to December 2015 (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing). Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015. In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period. In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported {{that at the end of}} 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president. Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012. In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, the New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns show they have made $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.|$|E
25|$|In early March 2009, <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> {{her first}} trip as {{secretary}} to Israel. During this time, Clinton {{announced that the}} US government will dispatch two officials to the Syrian capital to explore Washington's relationship with Damascus.|$|E

25|$|ACORN and its {{affiliates}} {{advocated for}} affordable housing by urging the development, rehabilitation and establishment of housing trust funds at the local, state, and federal levels. The group also pushed for enforcement of affordable-housing requirements for developers and promoted {{programs to help}} homeowners repair their homes and organize tenant demands. An ACORN official voiced support for a proposal Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> during the 2008 presidential primary election to create a federal fund for distressed homeowners.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Bush, Clinton {{was able}} to unite his fractious and ideologically diverse party behind his candidacy, even when its {{different}} wings were in conflict. To garner the support of moderates and conservative Democrats, he attacked Sister Souljah, a little-known rap musician whose lyrics Clinton condemned. Furthermore, <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> clear his support {{of the death penalty}} and would later champion making school uniforms in public schools a requirement. Clinton could also point to his centrist record as Governor of Arkansas. More liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton's record on abortion and affirmative action. His strong connections to African Americans also played a key role. In addition, he organized significant numbers of young voters and became a symbol of the rise of the Baby Boomer generation to political power. Supporters remained energized and confident, even in times of scandal or missteps.|$|E
25|$|At Surrey he {{immediately}} formed a successful opening partnership with Alan Butcher which lasted until the 1986 season when Butcher suffered {{a loss of}} form and was dropped down the order and then omitted from the side before being released by Surrey {{at the end of}} the season. Their first wicket stands included 277 against Yorkshire in 1984, when <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> his highest score of 192, and 266 against Cambridge University in 1980. Butcher and Clinton shared 19 century opening partnerships for Surrey. He opened the batting with Butcher in Surrey's match against Essex at Chelmsford in May 1983 when Surrey were bowled out for 14 runs, the lowest score in English first-class cricket since 1907 and Surrey's lowest first-class score ever. Clinton top-scored with six runs in the first innings before scoring 65 not out as Surrey batted through their second innings to draw the match.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Rogers, {{pitching}} for the <b>Clinton</b> Giants, <b>made</b> 29 appearances, starting 28 games. He went 13-8 with a 2.55 ERA, {{while allowing}} 128 hits in 169 innings {{of work and}} striking out 168 batters.|$|R
5000|$|With {{just days}} to go in his presidency, Clinton renominated Johnson on January 3, 2001. [...] However, Johnson's {{nomination}} was returned by President Bush on March 20, 2001, along with 61 other executive and judicial nominations that <b>Clinton</b> had <b>made.</b>|$|R

25|$|Openers Scott Newman and Richard <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> up {{for their}} first-innings failure and batted 22 overs until stumps on day two without giving away their wickets, but on the third morning James Kirtley got the vital breakthrough, having Clinton caught for 12 off 79 balls. Rikki Clarke's 75 led Surrey to set a target, at least, as the Pakistanis {{dominated}} - Naved-ul-Hasan got four for 70 and Mushtaq Ahmed three for 96. Surrey had some Pakistanis of their own, as Azhar Mahmood and Mohammad Akram took two and one wicket respectively, and Sussex scrambled to 33 for 4 at tea on day 3, chasing a meagre 125 to win. After tea, however, Michael Yardy and Matt Prior attacked Nayan Doshi with fury - Prior finishing with 66 not out off just 48 balls - as Sussex eased to the target with five wickets to spare, losing Yardy for 35 but still holding out for the win.|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 2009, Obama and Hu Jintao {{announced}} {{the establishment of}} the high-level U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue co-chaired by Hillary Clinton and Timothy Geithner on the U.S. side and Dai Bingguo and Wang Qishan on the Chinese side and on May 16, 2009 Obama personally {{announced the}} nomination of Jon Huntsman, Jr., the Republican Governor of Utah to fill the position of Ambassador to China. Huntsman was the only ambassador in the Administration to be personally announced by the President times. Later that year, President Obama and Secretary <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> a high-profile trip to China on November 15–18, 2009 marking Obama's first visit to China. It was Obama's first presidential Asia trip since he was inducted. He also went to Japan, Singapore for the APEC summit and South Korea for the first U.S.-ASEAN summit. The United States Pacific Command had also {{been at the forefront of}} efforts to strengthen military relationships in the region. The United States and China often clashed over China's claims in the South China Sea, parts of which are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, {{who also}} {{served in the}} U.S. Senate and was the First Lady of the United States, {{became the first woman}} to {{formally}} launch a major candidacy for the presidency. <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> the announcement on April 12, 2015, via a video message. While nationwide opinion polls in 2015 indicated that Clinton was the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, she faced extreme challenges from Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who became the second major candidate when he formally announced on April 30, 2015, that he was running for the Democratic nomination. September 2015 polling numbers indicated a narrowing gap between Clinton and Sanders. On May 30, 2015, former Governor of Maryland Martin O'Malley was the third major candidate to enter the Democratic primary race, followed by former Independent Governor and Republican Senator of Rhode Island Lincoln Chafee on June 3, 2015, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb on July 2, 2015, and former Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig on September 6, 2015.|$|E

500|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> {{a second}} presidential run in 2016. She {{received}} the most votes and primary delegates in the 2016 Democratic primaries and formally accepted her party's nomination for President of the United States on July 28, 2016 with vice presidential running mate Senator Tim Kaine. She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. Despite winning a plurality of the national popular vote, Clinton lost the electoral vote and the presidency to her Republican opponent Donald Trump. Following her loss, in 2017 she stated that she decided to focus on being a self-described [...] "activist citizen".|$|E
5000|$|Also {{reported}} {{for the first time}} was a comment Bill <b>Clinton</b> supposedly <b>made</b> in trying to convince Ted Kennedy not to back Obamas candidacy but rather that of his wife, Hillary Clinton. Clinton reportedly said to Kennedy that [...] "a few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee." [...] There is no evidence that <b>Clinton</b> ever <b>made</b> the remark. However, the alleged belittling of Obamas candidacy supposedly helped lead to Kennedys endorsement of Obama shortly thereafter. [...] Reverend Al Sharpton condemned Clintons alleged remark, saying, [...] "I think thats far more disturbing Senator Reids comments because this is someone seeking to stop Mr. Obamas campaign... If someone said that he would have been getting us coffee like that in the context they said he said it, that would be very offensive to me, and I would definitely take Mr. Clinton on".|$|R

500|$|Clinton was {{defeated}} by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election. By {{the early morning hours}} of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win and media sources proclaimed him the winner. Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave a victory speech. The next morning <b>Clinton</b> <b>made</b> a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying [...] "We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead." [...] Though Clinton lost the election by only capturing 232 electors to Trump's 306, a month after the election the popular vote count showed her leading by more than 2.7 million votes, with many votes yet to be counted. She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.|$|E
500|$|After the 1992 presidential election, Browner {{served as}} {{transition}} director for Vice President-elect Gore. [...] President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992. [...] While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration's commitment to environmental protection during the campaign, {{the selection of}} Browner – who was described by The Washington Post as having [...] "the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist" [...] – {{was seen as an}} indication that Gore's ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton's more pro-business mindset. [...] Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named. [...] The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that <b>Clinton</b> <b>made,</b> helped solidify the vice president's position within the administration. [...] At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore. [...] She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{months after}} this, the Buckingham/Nicks/McVie/McVie/Fleetwood line-up reunited {{at the request}} of U.S. President Bill Clinton for his first Inaugural Ball in 1993. <b>Clinton</b> had <b>made</b> Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Don't Stop" [...] his {{campaign}} theme song.
