50|$|Scavenging {{of small}} {{two-stroke}} engines relies on inertial scavenging through the Kadenacy effect. At low rpm and low gasflow velocities, {{this effect is}} reduced. Scavenging thus becomes less effective when idling, {{and so it is}} when idling (at either low rpm or low throttle) that four-stroking is most likely to become a problem. Schnuerle or loop scavenging is considered to be less prone than the simpler <b>cross-scavenging.</b>|$|E
