40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will discuss}} {{some of the early}} {{pioneering}} work {{as well as some of}} our more recent research. The Albany Research Center (ARC) has been involved with the melting and processing of metals since it was established in 1942. In the early days, hardly anything was known about melting refractory or reactive metals and as such, virtually everything had to be developed in-house. Besides the more common induction heated air-melt furnaces, ARC has built and/or utilized a wide variety of furnaces including vacuum arc remelt ingot and casting furnaces, cold wall induction furnaces, electric arc furnaces, cupola furnaces and reverberatory furnaces. The melt size of these furnaces range from several grams to a ton or more. We have used these furnaces to formulate custom alloys for wrought applications as well as for such casting techniques as spin <b>casting,</b> <b>investment</b> casting and lost foam casting among many. Two early spin-off industrializations were Wah Chang (wrought zirconium alloys for military and commercial nuclear applications) and Oremet (both wrought and cast Ti). Both of these companies are now part of the ATI Allegheny Ludlum Corporation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract––To {{survive in}} today’s {{manufacturing}} environments companies must push {{the standards of}} accuracy and speed to the highest levels possible.

The aim is to produce and evaluate electrodes produced by different manufacturing methods. The new methods of Rapid tooling concept include Net shape <b>casting,</b> <b>Investment</b> casting and Wire Cut EDM processes has only recently become viable methods of producing usable rapid tooling components. The speed and accuracy as well as the cost of manufacture {{play a vital role in}} the tool and mould manufacturing process. The Rapid tooling methods offer an alternate option to traditional manufacturing of electrodes. The two methods in which RP (Rapid Prototyping) master pattern is used are Net shape casting and Investment casting processes,which helps in the preparation of mould and finished electrode.

40|$|<b>Investment</b> <b>casting</b> {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as the best option in producing TiAl components with key benefits of accuracy, versatility and integrity. The collapsibility of ceramic moulds for <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> is critical in the manufacturing process of TiAl components due to TiAl’s intrinsic brittleness at room temperature. The aim of the present research {{is to provide a}} method for production of TiAl components by <b>investment</b> <b>casting</b> in ZrO 2 ceramic moulds with improved collapsibility.

The stress/strain curves obtained from green and baked ceramic moulds demonstrate that the green strength was increased with the application of high polymer, while baked strength decreased, thus the collapsibility of ceramic moulds was improved. It is suggested that this result is related to the burn-out of high polymer which left a lot of cavities.
