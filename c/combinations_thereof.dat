The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and <b>combinations,</b> <b>thereof.</b> Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and <b>combinations</b> <b>thereof.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of {{the census}} of 2010, Jerome was home to 444 people {{comprising}} 253 households, 93 of which were families {{made up of a}} householder and one or more people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The other 160 were non-family. The residents had a racial makeup that was nearly 94percent white, and the remainder was listed in the census as black or African American, Native American, Asian, other, or <b>combinations</b> <b>thereof.</b> About 6percent of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The population, nearly evenly split along gender lines, consisted of 226 women with a median age of 54 and 218 men with a median age of 55. The estimated population in 2015 was 456.|$|E

5|$|Pollination is {{the process}} by which pollen is {{transferred}} in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and <b>combinations</b> <b>thereof)</b> that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.|$|E
25|$|More commonly, {{the process}} of {{pollination}} requires pollinators: organisms that carry or move the pollen grains from the anther of one flower to the receptive part of the carpel or pistil (stigma) of another. This is biotic pollination. The various flower traits (and <b>combinations</b> <b>thereof)</b> that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes.|$|E

500|$|Lung cancer {{can either}} arise {{directly}} from lung tissue or {{as a result}} of metastasis from another part of the body. There are two main types of primary tumour described as either small-cell or non-small-cell lung carcinomas. The major risk factor for cancer is smoking. Once a cancer is identified it is staged using scans such as a CT scan and a sample of tissue (a [...] ) is taken. Cancers may be treated by surgically removing the tumour, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or <b>combinations</b> <b>thereof,</b> or with the aim of symptom control.Lung cancer screening is being recommended in the United States for high-risk populations.|$|E
500|$|Cult films {{frequently}} break cultural taboos, {{and many}} feature excessive displays of violence, gore, sexuality, profanity, or <b>combinations</b> <b>thereof.</b> [...] This {{can lead to}} controversy, censorship, and outright bans; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when critics call them frivolous or incompetent. [...] Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films. [...] Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films; fans of these films often emphasize the films' niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects. [...] Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons, such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing, will often be ostracized or ridiculed. [...] Likewise, fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection.|$|E
500|$|Chuck Kleinhans {{states that}} the {{difference}} between a guilty pleasure and a cult film {{can be as simple as}} the number of fans; David Church raises the question of how many people it takes to form a cult following, especially now that home video makes fans difficult to count. [...] As these cult films become more popular, they can bring varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations, such as camp, irony, genuine affection, or <b>combinations</b> <b>thereof.</b> [...] Earnest fans, who recognize and accept the film's faults, can make minor celebrities of the film's cast, though the benefits are not always clear. [...] Cult film stars known for their camp can inject subtle parody or signal when films should not be taken seriously. [...] Campy actors can also provide comic book supervillains for serious, artistic-minded films. [...] This can draw fan acclaim and obsession more readily than subtle, method-inspired acting. [...] Mark Chalon Smith of the Los Angeles Times says technical faults may be forgiven if a film makes up for them in other areas, such as camp or transgressive content. [...] Smith {{states that the}} early films of John Waters are amateurish and less influential than claimed, but Waters' outrageous vision cements his place in cult cinema. [...] Films such as [...] Myra Breckinridge (1970) and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) can experience critical reappraisal later, once their camp excess and avant-garde filmmaking are better accepted, and films that are initially dismissed as frivolous are often reassessed as campy. [...] Films that intentionally try to appeal to fans of camp may end up alienating them, as the films become perceived as trying too hard or not authentic.|$|E

2500|$|Reactive flows {{can involve}} gases, liquids, and solids, or <b>combinations</b> <b>thereof.</b> [...] As these move through space and over time, they may change chemically. Reactive flow {{problems}} often involve multiple processes interacting simultaneously. [...] Identifying the boundary conditions where states of matter react, {{and the ways}} in which they interact, is important in modelling reactive flows. Physical processes involved in reactive flows include species reactions, diffusive transport, radiative transport, convection, and wave-like properties, some or all of which may be modeled to address a particular problem. [...] Modelling of complex reactive flows has applications in a wide variety of areas including aerodynamics, [...] hydrodynamics, [...] microfluidics, [...] chemical kinetics, [...] chemical process modeling (involving advective and diffusive transport processes as well as chemical kinetics) and combustion-related flame and detonation phenomena.|$|E
