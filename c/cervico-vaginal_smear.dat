40|$|There {{are several}} case reports documenting {{opportunistic}} fungal {{infection in the}} female genital tract, with Aspergillus spp being a rarely reported causative organism. We hereby report a case of Aspergillus infection in a 48 year-old, postmenopausal female with carcinoma of the cervix. She presented with features of pelvic inflammatory disease, and an initial routine <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smear</b> revealed severe inflammation along with fungal bodies. The features {{were consistent with the}} presence of Aspergillus spp, while the background epithelial cells were negative for intraepithelial malignancy. She was offered therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease. A repeat Papanicolaou smear after two weeks was negative for intraepithelial organisms, but showed the evidence of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, with biopsy confirming squamous cell carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Cytopathology {{which is}} more {{appreciated}} {{in recent years is}} one of the valuable diagnostic methods. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate and stratify cytology specimens according to routes of retrieval, organ systems and general cytomorphologic diagnosis. This study was carried out at Department of Pathology, Zonguldak Karaelmas University, Faculty of Medicine, from January 2003 to December 2005 retrospectively, by evaluating 9043 cytology specimens. A total number of 9043 cytology specimen composed of exfoliative cytology (89. 9 %) and fine needle aspiration (10. 1 %) specimens. Eighty-four percent of exfoliative cytology material was from Gynecology and Obstetrics Department, whereas 63 percent of fine needle aspiration material was from Internal Medicine Department. The majority of fine-needle aspiration specimens were obtained from thyroid (63 %), whereas the majority of exfoliative specimens came from <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> (82. 5 %). The fine needle aspiration specimens were evaluated as malignant, suspicious of malignancy, benign and indeterminate, in 1. 6 %, 1. 9 %, 65. 8 % and 30. 7 % of the samples respectively, whereas the exfoliative cytology specimens were reported as malignant, suspicious of malignancy, benign and indeterminate in 0. 7 %, 0. 8 %, 92. 1 %, and 6. 4 % of the samples respectively. Cytology specimens are mainly composed of exfoliative cytology specimens which are mostly <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears.</b> Thyroid is the most common sampled organ by fine needle aspiration. The high rate of inadequate diagnosis with this method can be associated with probably inadequate sampling...|$|R
40|$|Koilos means “hollow” in Greek. Koilocyte is a {{cell with}} a big perinuclear halo, {{characteristic}} of the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV causes various changes through its structural proteins in the cytoplasms and nuclei of the cells and tissues it infects. Among these cellular changes, koilos formation {{is influenced by the}} structural proteins of the virus and tumour suppressor genes. The koilocytes observed in <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> are considerably important for observing the presence of HPV, its typification, and early diagnosis of cervical cancer cases due to this virus. Therefore, this research attempts to explain the koilocyte formation mechanism by human papillomavirus proteins and tumour suppressor genes...|$|R
40|$|Senescence is {{characterized}} by a gradual loss of the stem cells activity and an atrophy of all cells and tissues which lead to the deterioration of the functional activity. The senescence processes manifest also in the female genital organs, producing different morphologic alterations. For the evidentiation of these aspects we retrospectively analyze 75 cases, from menopausal and postmenopausal women, investigating the histerectomy specimens, bioptic curettages and <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears.</b> The specimens were paraffin-embeded and routinely fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and the smears were stained using Papanicolau technique. Histologic and cytologic alterations in uterus, ovaries and vagina were observed. There were seen changes of the endometrial glands and stroma, cystic atrophy. Also, it was emphasized the arteriosclerosis of myometrial arteries, with medial hypertrophy. The microscopic aspect of the atrophic endometrium is different in histerectomy specimens than in bioptic curettages. The endometrial cystic atrophy must be differentiated from glandulo-cystic hyperplasia with retrograde atrophy. The cervical squamous epithelium is atrophic, with little or no intracytoplasmic glycogen, and the endocervical glands developed small clusters called endocervical tunnel clusters. These histologic features must not be diagnosed as invasive well differentiated endocervical adenocarcinoma. It has been noticed the absence of primordial and maturing ovarian follicles, the absence of the luteal body (corpus luteum) and atretic follicles and the persistence of corpora albicantia, especially in medulla. In ovarian stroma, different proliferation degrees of the cortical and medular stromal cells were seen, with occasional luteinised stromal cells and cortical cysts. The <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> presented atrophic features. The described cyto-morphologic aspects are due to insufficient estrogenic stimulation, {{as a consequence of the}} lack of ovarian hormone productio...|$|R
40|$|Artigo {{original}} (p. 163 - 169) To {{determine the}} frequency of detecting tubal metaplasia of the endocervix (TME) in <b>cervico-vaginal</b> cytological <b>smears,</b> we retrospectively reviewed 450 out of 2, 371 <b>cervico-vaginal</b> Pap <b>smears,</b> selected by chance, with no glandular abnormality at the first examination [150 from women using intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD), 150 from sterilized women by bilateral tubal ligation (BTL); and 150 from women using no or other contraceptive methods]. TME was seen in 16. 7 % of the patients using IUD; 70. 1 % of the patients submitted to BTL; and 49. 0 % of the patients from the last group. Atypical glandular cells on cervical cytology are a problem for clinicians and pathologists alike. The differential diagnosis of endocervical glandular abnormalities including TME is discussed...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{usefulness}} of fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the vaginal cuff in various lesions in the female genital tract. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-six FNAs of vaginal cuff lesions were performed at our institution from 1994 to 1998. All cases were reviewed. Data on clinical histories and follow-up, if available, were collected. Histologic material was reviewed. Fourteen gynecologic (<b>cervico-vaginal)</b> <b>smears</b> performed on these patients within six {{months prior to the}} FNA were also reviewed. RESULTS: Two of twenty-six (7. 7 %) FNAs were nondiagnostic due to poor cellular yield. Four lesions were classified as benign (16. 7 %). The remaining 20 FNAs were classified as malignant (83 %) and were consistent with the clinical history in all cases. CONCLUSION: The results show that FNA of the vaginal cuff appears to be a simple and accurate procedure for detecting benign and malignant lesions of the female genitourinary tract. Clinical indications, cytologic techniques and potential pitfalls are identical to those of FNAs at other sites...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the immunohistochemical pattern of {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) in cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) in correlation with L 1 HPV capsid protein, {{in order to determine}} the relationship between EGFR expression and the infection status of human papillomavirus (HPV). The study included 40 cases, 24 LSIL (low grade SIL) (CIN 1, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) and 16 HSIL (high grade SIL) (6 cases of CIN 2 and 10 cases of CIN 3). The immunoexpression of L 1 HPV protein was assessed on conventional <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> and EGFR was immunohistochemically evaluated on the corresponding cervical biopsies. The HPV L 1 capsid protein was expressed in 45. 83 % of LSIL and 25 % of HSIL. EGFR was overexpressed in 62, 4 % of HSIL (58, 4 % CIN 2 and 41, 6 % CIN 3) and 37, 6 % LSIL. The immunoexpression of L 1 HPV has clinical application in the progression assessment of the cervical precancerous lesions without a correlation to the grade of the cervical SIL. EGFR is expressed by all proliferating squamous epithelial cells, thus corresponding with the grade of SIL. The evaluation of EGFR status, correlated with L 1 HPV protein expression, can provide useful data of progression risk of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In Bethesda System of {{reporting}} <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears,</b> the equivocal epithelial cell abnormalities have been categorised as "atypical squamous and glandular cells of undetermined significance" (ASCUS and AGUS). These abnormalities may harbour minor lesions attributed to mere inflammatory changes to potentially serious high grade lesions. It is recommended to further qualify these lesions {{according to whether}} they favor a reactive or a neoplastic outcome. AIMS: We undertook the present study to assess the significance of ASCUS qualifiers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 12071 women were screened for early detection of cancer cervix. The women with ASCUS diagnosis were further qualified as ASCUS favor reactive and ASCUS favor SIL (Squamous intraepithelial lesion) according the Bethesda 1991 system {{of reporting}}. ASCUS-reactive cases were followed up by a repeat smear examination and persistent ASCUS cases were taken up for colposcopy and biopsy if indicated. All ASCUS-SIL cases were taken up for immediate colposcopy. RESULTS: The pick up rate of high grade lesions was not significantly different (P= 0. 47; Chi square test) on the follow up of ASCUS-reactive (2 / 222) and ASCUS-SIL (2 / 130) groups. The low grade lesions were picked up in 10 / 222 ASCUS-reactive and 58 / 130 in ASCUS-SIL, which was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate {{that it is not}} worthwhile to qualify these lesions as majority of ASCUS-SIL also revealed only low grade epithelial which have a benign biological behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to further assess the validity of the cytological description of morphological lesions said to be related to Papillomavirus (HPV) infections in senior women. The casuistic comprised 196 cervical smears from a group of women with no clinical or morphological evidence of neoplasia, collected simultaneously with samples submitted to detection of HPV DNA by PCR in a previous study. Three experienced cytologists studied each slide in two different conditions, with an interval of 20 months between them. The first approach was performed under routine laboratory standards, whereas the second was guided by a list of 16 well-defined parameters indicative of HPV-related cytological lesions. When suspicious cases of HPV-related alterations were grouped with positive cases, they showed on average: sensitivity of 25. 5 %, specificity of 84. 4 % and positive predictive value (PPV) of 26. 8 %. When suspicious cases were grouped with negative cases, sensitivity decreased, whereas specificity and PPV increased, as expected. In the second reading, which followed a "guide-list", a decrease in sensitivity was observed, contrasting with a sharp increase of positive predictive value. Among the 16 cytomorphological criteria tested, "koilocytosis", "mild koilocytosis" and "condylomatous parabasal cells" yielded the best predictive value for HPV DNA detection by PCR. In conclusion, despite the low sensitivity, cytopathologic assessment of <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> leads to a highly specific diagnosis of HPV infection in menopausal women, with PPV of 91. 0 % when directed by a guide-list of well-defined morphologic criteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of cervical intraepithelial precursors lesions and cervical cancer are {{strongly associated with}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The protein capsid L 1 of HPV represents the major target of the cellular immune response in the cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions. The {{aim of this study}} was the assessment of the protein capsid L 1 of high risk (HR) HPV in cervical low and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL), {{in the context of their}} progression to malignancy. The study involved 80 patients, between 16 - 38 years old, with abnormal cervical cytology, who underwent subsequent cervical biopsies under colposcopic guidance, as follows: 52 cases with LSIL (CIN 1, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) and 28 cases with HSIL (18 cases with CIN 2 and 10 cases with CIN 3). The conventional smears and the cervical biopsies were Papanicolau and Hematoxylin-Eosin stained and evaluated for the immunoexpression of L 1 HPV protein. For the <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears,</b> the HPV L 1 capsid protein was expressed in 67 % of LSIL and 24 % of HSIL. For the cervical biopsies, the HPV L 1 capsid protein was expressed in 62 % of LSIL and 20 % of HSIL (CIN 2). The absence of immunoexpression of HPV L 1 protein capsid, in smears and biopsies is correlated with the progression of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions. The immunochemical assessment of L 1 HPV creates the premises for a comprehensive study, by the combination of multiple molecular and clinic-morphological parameters, in the context of monitoring the events that interest cervical neoplasia progression...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to detect the {{adequacy}} and quality of cervico-vaginal sampling in different age groups. Method: As a screening test, <b>cervico-vaginal</b> <b>smears</b> were obtained from 1179 women was admitted to Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic of Bozok University Hospital between September 2012 and April 2013. Patients were grouped according to their ages. Patients under 20 years were designated as adolescents, patients between 20 and 44 years represented fertile period and patients 45 years and over were defined as menopausal patients. All the smears were evaluated by the same pathologist. Transformation Zone detection is required for sufficient and appropiate smear sampling. Kruskal Wallis H Tests were used for statistical analysis. Values under 0. 05 were accepted as significant. Mann Whitney U test was performed for detecting the origin of significance. Results: Among 1179 patients, 14 of them were adolescents (1. 18 %), 752 of them belonged to fertile period group (63. 78 %) and 413 of them were menopausal patients (35. 02 %). In these groups smear sampling sufficiency and quality detected as; 64. 20 % in adolescents, 72. 90 % in fertile period and 59. 95 % in menopausal patients. Among smears with inflammation, 7 of them were adolescents (50 %), 470 of them were in fertile period group (62, 50 %) and 158 cases were in menopause group (38, 25 %). Only 1 patient diagnosed as ASC-US (0, 08 %) and no other premalignant lesion was detected. There was a statistical difference between groups (p< 0, 05) and in the fertile group cervicovaginal samplings were more efficient. Conclusion: As the transformation zone presents in the easily screened outer portion, the more efficient sampling has been achieved in the fertile group compared to other groups...|$|R

O presente estudo analisou aspectos relacionados ao valor da citologia cervical na identificação de alterações cito-morfológicas relacionadas à infecção por Papilomavírus humano (HPV) em mulheres com idades avançadas. A casuística compreendeu 196 amostras cérvico-vaginais provenientes de uma população de mulheres sem evidências clínicas ou citológicas de neoplasia cervical. As amostras foram coletadas simultaneamente para pesquisas para DNA-HPV por Reação de Polimerização em Cadeia (PCR) e citologia. Três observadores experientes efetuaram análise das lâminas em duas etapas com intervalo de 20 meses: a primeira em condições de rotina laboratorial e a segunda dirigida por um roteiro de critérios pré-estabelecidos. Quando os casos suspeitos para alterações relacionadas ao HPV foram agrupados com os casos positivos, eles mostraram em média: 25, 5 % de sensibilidade, 84, 4 % de especificidade e valor preditivo positivo (VPP) de 26, 8 %. Quando os casos suspeitos foram agrupados com os negativos, a sensibilidade diminuiu, e a especificidade e o VPP aumentaram. Na segunda leitura, a sensibilidade diminuiu, contrastando com o aumento do VPP. Entre os 16 critérios cito-morfológicos avaliados, coilocitose, coilocitose leve e célula parabasal coilocitótica foram os que apresentaram melhor VPP para HPV em comparação ao PCR. Concluímos que, apesar da baixa sensibilidade, o painel de critérios cito-morfológicos poderá elevar a especificidade do teste de Papanicolaou para triagem das alterações relacionadas à infecção por HPV em pacientes de mais idade...|$|R
