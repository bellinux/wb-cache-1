40|$|Flax is an {{important}} crop for oil and fiber, however, no high-density genetic maps have been reported for this species. Specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a high-resolution strategy for large scale de novo discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In this study, SLAF-seq was employed to develop SNP markers in an F 2 population to construct a high-density genetic map <b>for</b> <b>flax.</b> In total, 196. 29 million paired-end reads were obtained. The average sequencing depth was 25. 08 in male parent, 32. 17 in the female parent, and 9. 64 in each F 2 progeny. In total, 389, 288 polymorphic SLAFs were detected, from which 260, 380 polymorphic SNPs were developed. After filtering, 4, 638 SNPs were found suitable for genetic map construction. The final genetic map included 4, 145 SNP markers on 15 linkage groups and was 2, 632. 94 cM in length, with an average distance of 0. 64 cM between adjacent markers. To our knowledge, this map is the densest SNP-based genetic map <b>for</b> <b>flax.</b> The SNP markers and genetic map reported in here {{will serve as a}} foundation for the fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs), map-based gene cloning and marker assisted selection (MAS) <b>for</b> <b>flax...</b>|$|R

The two most common forms <b>for</b> <b>flax</b> in traditional craft are the use of stripped, dried leaves as broad bands, such as in the weaving of kete (flax baskets), and the scraping, pounding, and washing of the leaves to create a fibre — muka — which is used in tāniko (weaving) of soft, durable fabric <b>for</b> clothing. <b>Flax</b> is also used as a decorative and structural element in tukutuku, panelling found within Mãori wharenui (meeting houses).|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} applied {{research}} is to design a sustainable industrial scale enzyme based flax retting process. A systematic approach has been adopted.

Optimisation of process parameters has been carried out using alkaline pectinase, non-ionic surfactants and chelating agents in terms of concentration of enzyme and other auxiliaries, time, temperature, liquid to solid ratio etc. Scale up experiments were performed.

40|$|International audienceWe {{evaluate}} the elastic properties of glass, carbon, and flax fibers {{that are used}} to manufacture composite materials. The transverse elastic properties of fibers are more difficult to measure than the longitudinal properties. But the knowledge of the transverse properties is mandatory to predict correctly the mechanical behavior of a composite material. We apply the laser resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) technique to {{evaluate the}} transverse Young modulus and Poisson ratio of fibers. The mechanical vibrations of a cross section are generated by a pulsed subnanosecond laser beam focused and shaped on the fiber as a line parallel to the fiber. The vibrations are detected optically by the probe beam of an interferometer, focused at the zone of excitation. The measured eigenfrequencies range from 5 MHz <b>for</b> <b>flax</b> fibers to 500 MHz for carbon and glass fibers. Using finite element modeling, the eigenmodes of fibers are identified and the mechanical properties of the fiber materials are evaluated. The transverse elastic properties of carbon fibers are significantly different from the longitudinal properties. <b>For</b> <b>flax</b> fibers, the strong damping of modes which is observed could explain the strong damping of flax fiber reinforced polymers...|$|R

50|$|The soils most {{suitable}} <b>for</b> <b>flax,</b> besides the alluvial kind, are deep loams containing {{a large proportion}} of organic matter. Flax is often found growing just above the waterline in cranberry bogs. Heavy clays are unsuitable, as are soils of a gravelly or dry sandy nature. Farming flax requires few fertilizers or pesticides. Within eight weeks of sowing, the plant can reach 10 - 15 cm in height and grows several centimeters per day under its optimal growth conditions, reaching 70 - 80 cm within 50 days.|$|R

40|$|SSAP {{method was}} used to study the genetic {{diversity}} of 22 Linum species from sections Linum, Adenolinum, Dasylinum, Stellerolinum, and 46 flax cultivars. All the studied flax varieties were distinguished using SSAP for retrotransposons FL 9 and FL 11. Thus, the validity of SSAP method was demonstrated <b>for</b> <b>flax</b> marking, identification of accessions in genebank collections, and control during propagation of flax varieties. Polymorphism of Fl 1 a, Fl 1 b, and Cassandra insertions were very low in flax varieties, but these retrotransposons were successfully used for the investigation of Linum species. Species clusterization based on SSAP markers was in concordance with their taxonomic division into sections Dasylinum, Stellerolinum, Adenolinum, and Linum. All species of sect. Adenolinum clustered apart from species of sect. Linum. The data confirmed {{the accuracy of the}} separation in these sections. Members of section Linum are not as closely related as members of other sections, so taxonomic revision of this section is desirable. L. usitatissimum accessions genetically distant from modern flax cultivars were revealed in our work. These accessions are of utmost interest <b>for</b> <b>flax</b> breeding and introduction of new useful traits into flax cultivars. The chromosome localization of Cassandra retrotransposon in Linum species was determined...|$|R

50|$|Another {{challenge}} will be the transport and storage of the flaxseed once harvested.

50|$|Oil {{seeds and}} residue from oil {{extraction}} will self-heat if too moist. Typically, storage at 9-14% moisture is satisfactory, but limits are established {{for each individual}} variety of oil seed. In the presence of excess moisture just under levels required for germinating seed, the activity of mold fungi to generate heat is a likely candidate. This has been established <b>for</b> <b>flax</b> and sunflower seeds, as well as soy beans. Many of the oil seeds generate oils that are self-heating. Palm kernels, rapeseed, and cotton seed have also been studied. Rags soaked in linseed oil can spontaneously ignite if improperly stored or discarded.|$|R
