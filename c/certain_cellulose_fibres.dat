40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{establishing}} quantification methods for binary mixtures containing a new polypropylene/polyamide 6 - based bicomponent fibre, for which a new generic fibre name has been requested to the European Commission. Application of such methods is requested by EU legislation (Directive 96 / 73 /EC) to enable market surveillance regarding the textile composition data on labels that are compulsory. The methodology for quantification of fibre mixtures is usually based either on manual separation or on chemical dissolution methods. In both cases, a sample pre-treatment, able to remove non-fibrous material, is needed. The key experimental parameters {{that need to be}} established for the novel fibre are: its moisture regain in standard atmosphere (agreed allowance), its mass loss due to pre-treatment (b coefficient) and its mass losses in the methods where it is insoluble (d correction factors). Results of this study showed that the b coefficient for the new fibre, using the normal pre-treatment, is equal to 0 %. As expected from the chemical composition and synthetic character of the novel fibre, the experimental value for the agreed allowance was low and equal to 0. 54 %. The new fibre was insoluble in ten out of the 14 dissolution methods tested and the correspondent ten d correction factors were evaluated. Three of them were also validated through a collaborative trial organised at European level following the internationally accepted guideline ISO 5725 - 2 : 1994. The d correction factors obtained throughout the study were in the range of 1. 00 - 1. 01, meaning that the fibre was completely insoluble or at maximum 1 % soluble in the dissolution reagent. Based on the results of this study, laboratories across the EU and beyond have now at their disposal methods to quantify the new fibre in binary mixtures with polyester, elastomultiester, polyamide, chlorofibres, certain acrylic and modacrylic fibres, acetate, triacetate, polylactide, <b>certain</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> and certain protein fibres.

40|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> are {{available}} from many sources, often from materials separated from food production waste. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> for composite preparation should preferably be free of other plant material to allow optimum and consistent properties. Pure <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> have modulus and strength comparable with glass fibres and more favourable when relative fibre densities are considered. The pure fibres may be modified for compatibility with the matrix polymer. Physical and chemical separation and purification methods will be discussed with particular reference to bast fibres. The methods include retting, steam explosion, solvent extraction, alkali and enzyme treatment. Hydrophilic <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> require modification to reduce property variability with humidity and to increase compatibility with matrix polymers that are typically hydrophobic.

40|$|Traditionally, {{polymers}} and macromolecular components used in {{the foam}} industry are mostly derived from petroleum. The current transition to a bio-economy creates demand {{for the use of}} more renewable feedstocks. Soybean oil is a vegetable oil, composed mainly of triglycerides, that is suitable material for foam production. In this study, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil and variable amounts of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> were {{used in the}} production of bio-based foam. The developed macroporous bio-based architectures were characterised by several techniques, including porosity measurements, nanoindentation testing, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that the introduction of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> during the foaming process was necessary to create the three-dimensional polymer foams. Using <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> has potential as a foam stabiliser because it obstructs the drainage of liquid from the film region in these gas-oil interfaces while simultaneously acting as a reinforcing agent in the polymer foam.

50|$|Chemical pulping {{achieves}} this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules {{which can}} be washed away from the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> without depolymerizing the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> (chemically depolymerizing the <b>cellulose</b> weakens the <b>fibres).</b> The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. Related hybrid pulping methods {{use a combination of}} chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include thermomechanical pulping (TMP) and chemithermomechanical pulping (CTMP). The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.|$|R

However, several factors must be considered when designing polypropylene/cellulose composites: the poor compatibility between the hydrophilic fibres and the hydrophobic thermoplastic matrix leads to a weak interface, which has to be improved by coupling agents; the hydrophilic nature of the fibres makes them very sensitive towards water absorption, which also leads to a loss of properties and swelling with subsequent dimensional instability; the reduced thermal stability of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> leads to degradation of the fibres at thermoplastic processing temperatures producing odours in the final material; and finally the properties of composites are greatly influenced by the structure, size and quality of the fibres. Pulp fibres modified by different methods in order to enhance the compatibility fibre-matrix, were tested. Modified fibres led to improved mechanical properties and thermal behaviour when used in composites with recycled polypropylene. Four different types of natural fibres were used as reinforcement in two different polypropylene types: virgin and recycled polypropylene. The mechanical properties of the composites were mostly dependent on the fibre loading and slightly dependent on the type of fibre. Moreover, water absorption kinetics was studied by the Fickian diffusion theory. After absorption, a remarkable loss of properties was observed. Hydrolysed <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> showed a greater enhancing effect on polypropylene than non-hydrolysed <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres.</b> This is attributed to the greater mechanical properties of reduced cellulose structures.

In the last few years, the interest in man-made <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> has grown as a consequence of increased environmental awareness and the depletion of fossil fuels. However, an environmental assessment of modern man-made <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> has not been conducted so far. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the environmental impact of man-made <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres.</b> Five staple fibre products, i. e., 1) Lenzing Viscose Asia, 2) Lenzing Viscose Austria, 3) Lenzing Modal, 4) Tencel Austria, and 5) Tencel Austria 2012, are analysed by means of Life cycle assessment (LCA). The system boundary is cradle to factory gate. We compare the results with conventional cotton, novel bio-based fibres (PLA fibres), and fossil fuel-based fibres (PET and PP). The inventory data for the {{production of}} man-made <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> were provided by Lenzing AG. The inventory data for cotton, PET, PP, and PLA were obtained from literature sources. The environmental indicators analysed include resources and the impact categories covered by CML 2000 baseline method. The indicators for resources include non-renewable energy use (NREU), renewable energy use (REU), cumulative energy demand (CED), water use, and land use. The environmental impact indicators covered by the CML method are global warming potential (GWP) 100 a, abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication. In addition, the system boundary of cradle to factory gate plus end-of-life waste management was analysed for NREU and GWP. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses have been carried out to understand the influence of various assumptions and allocation methods. The LCA results show that Lenzing Viscose Austria and Lenzing Modal offer environmental benefits in all categories (except for land use and water use) compared to Lenzing Viscose Asia.
