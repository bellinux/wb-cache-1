We partially purified a soluble PAP from mid maturing seeds of bottle gourd, Lagenaria siceraria. The steps include both anionic and <b>cationic</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> columns. Catalytic characterization of the partially purified PAP revealed that the optimum pH and temperature for activity were at 5. 5 ?C and 45 ?C. Under optimum assay condition using dioleoyl phosphatidic acid (DPA) as the substrate, the Vmax and Km were 0. 36 ηkat/mg of protein and 200 µM, respectively. For the synthetic substrate, ρ-nitrophenylphosphate, ρ-NPP, the Vmax and Km were 33. 0 nkat/mg of protein and 140 µM, respectively. The activity was neither inhibited nor enhanced by the presence of Mg 2 + at a concentration range of 0 to 10 mM. Two major protein bands at 42 -kDa and 27 -kDa were visible in SDS-PAGE after partial purification.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{purification}} of soluble RNA replicase from {{healthy and}} alfalfa mosaic virus-infected tobacco leaves, crude extracts were chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex A- 25, and three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities were obtained; {{one of these}} was previously characterized as a true RNA replicase, the remaining two were not studied (Chifflot et al., 1980, Virology 100, 91). We now demonstrate {{that all of these}} activities correspond to the same RNA replicase, complexed or not to cellular or viral RNA. Upon chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A- 25, the free replicase did not bind to the gel at low ionic strength, whereas the RNA-replicase complexes were bound to the gel through the medium of RNA. Increasing the ionic strength allowed the dissociation of the complexes and elution of the replicase only. From this observation, a new and rapid purification procedure combining all these activities and yielding large amounts of replicase was developed; the first main step of purification was chromatography on Blue-Sepharose CL 6 B under conditions conductive to the dissociation of RNA-replicase complexes, and thus maximal adsorption of the replicase. The enzyme was then eluted by increasing the ionic strength and was further purified on coupled DEAE-Sephadex A- 25 and phosphocellulose columns. The DEA-Sephadex A- 25 was used to bind the remaining RNA, while the replicase passed through, and bound to the <b>cationic</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The final replicase preparations which were obtained were very stable and had a purification factor of 1100 - 1400.

40|$|The use {{of ammonia}} (NH 3) rich wastewaters as an {{ecological}} chemical absorption solvent for the selective extraction {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) during biogas upgrading to ‘biomethane’ has been studied. Aqueous ammonia absorbents of up to 10, 000 gNH 3 m− 3 demonstrated CO 2 absorption rates higher than recorded in the literature for packed columns using 20, 000 – 80, 000 g NH 3 m− 3 which can be ascribed to the process intensification provided by the hollow fibre membrane contactor {{used in this study}} to support absorption. Centrifuge return liquors (2325 g m− 3 ionised ammonium, NH 4 +) and a regenerant (477 gNH 4 + m− 3) produced from a <b>cationic</b> <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> used to harvest NH 4 + from crude wastewater were also tested. Carbon dioxide fluxes measured for both wastewaters compared reasonably with analogue ammonia absorption solvents of equivalent NH 3 concentration. Importantly, this demonstrates that ammonia rich wastewaters can facilitate chemically enhanced CO 2 separation which eliminates the need for costly exogenic chemicals or complex chemical handling which are critical barriers to implementation of chemical absorption. When testing NH 3 analogues, the potential to recover the reaction product ammonium bicarbonate (NH 4 HCO 3) in crystalline form was also illustrated. This is significant as it suggests a new pathway for ammonia separation which avoids biological nitrification and produces ammonia stabilised into a commercially viable fertiliser (NH 4 HCO 3). However, in real ammonia rich wastewaters, sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate were preferentially formed over NH 4 HCO 3 although it is proposed that NH 4 HCO 3 can be preferentially formed by manipulating both ion exchange and absorbent chemistry...|$|E

40|$|This renewal {{proposal}} outlines {{our current}} progress {{and future research}} plans for ion exchangers: novel metal niobate and silicotitanate <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> and their ultimate deployment in the DOE complex. In our original study several forms (including Cs exchanged) of the heat treated Crystalline Silicotitanates (CSTs) were fully characterized {{by a combination of}} high temperature synthesis and phase identification, low temperature synthesis and phase identification, and thermodynamics. This renewal proposal is predicated on work completed in our current EMSP program: we have shown preliminary data of a novel class of niobate-based molecular sieves (Na/Nb/M/O, M = transition metals), which show exceptionally high selectivity for divalent cations under extreme conditions (acid solutions, competing cations), in addition to novel silicotitanate phases which are also selective for divalent cations. Furthermore, these materials are easily converted by a high temperature in-situ heat treatment into a refractory ceramic waste form with low cation leachability. The new waste form is a perovskite phase, which is also a major component of Synroc, a titanate ceramic waste form used for sequestration of HLW wastes from reprocessed, spent nuclear fuel. These new niobate <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> also shown orders of magnitude better selectivity for Sr 2 + under acid conditions than any other material. The goal of the program is to reduce the costs associated with divalent cation waste removal and disposal, to minimize the risk of contamination to the environment during <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> processing, and to provide DOE with materials for near-term lab-bench stimulant testing, and eventual deployment. The proposed work will provide information on the structure/property relationship between <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> frameworks and selectivity for specific ions, allowing for the eventual ''tuning'' of framework for specific ion exchange needs. To date, DOE sites have become interested in on-site testing of these materials; ongoing discussions and initial experiments are occurring with Dr. Dean Peterman, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) (location of the DOE/EM Waste Treatment Focus Area), and Dr. John Harbour, Savannah River Site (SRS). Yet the materials have not been optimized, and further research and development of the novel <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> and testing conditions with simulants are needed. In addition, studies of the <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> composition versus <b>ion</b> selectivity, ion exchange capacity and durability of final waste form are needed. This program will bring together three key institutions to address scientific hurdles of the separation process associated with metal niobate and silicotitanate <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers,</b> in particular for divalent cations (e. g., Sr 2 +). The program involves a joint effort between researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, who are leaders in structure/property relations in silicotitanates and in waste form development and performance assessment, Sandia National Laboratories, who discovered and developed crystalline silicotitanate <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> (with Texas A&M and UOP) and also the novel class of divalent metal niobate <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers,</b> and the Thermochemistry Facility at UC Davis, who are world renowned experts in calorimetry and have already performed extensive thermodynamic studies on silicotitanate materials. In addition, Dr. Rodney Ewing of University of Michigan, an expert in radiation effects on materials, and Dr. Robert Roth of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and The Viper Group, a leader in phase equilibria development, will be consultants for radiation and phase studies. The research team will focus on three tasks that will provide both the basic research necessary for the development of highly selective ion exchange materials and also materials for short-term deployment within the DOE complex: (1) Structure/property relationships of a novel class of niobate-based molecular sieves (Na/Nb/M/O, M = transition metals), which show exceptionally high selectivity for divalent cations under extreme conditions (acid solutions, competing cations), (2) the role of <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> structure change (both niobates and silicotitanates) on the exchange capacity (for elements such as Sr and actinide-surrogates) which results from exposure to DOE complex waste simulants, (3) thermodynamic stability of metal niobates and silicotitanate <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers...</b>|$|R
