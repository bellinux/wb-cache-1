A few days prior to the release, the band {{won the right to}} self-release the album, with the band contractually obligated to owing Victory at least two more albums. McKinnon said about Victory, [...] "The only thing [...] held above us was the right to put out this album and we won the right to put it out ourselves [...] Now it <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> jury and good luck having a jury of random people agree that two live albums that are sold separately not count as an album, good luck with that." [...] The band self-released the album digitally on October 8. A physical edition with additional tracks was released on November 25, by the band's own label, ADTR Records.|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Anne Edwards {{wrote about}} the tone and tenor of Shirley Temple films, [...] "This was mid-Depression, and schemes proliferated {{for the care of}} the needy and the {{regeneration}} of the fallen. But they all required endless paperwork and demeaning, hours-long queues, {{at the end of which}} an exhausted, nettled social worker dealt with each person as a faceless number. Shirley offered a natural solution: to open one's heart." [...] Edwards pointed out that the characters created for the little actress would change the lives of the cold, the hardened, and the criminal with positive results. Her films were seen as generating hope and optimism, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, [...] "It is a splendid thing that for just fifteen cents an American <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles." ...|$|E

6000|$|Wonder if you will. You cannot wonder too much. That {{you might}} wonder {{all your life}} long, God put you into this wondrous world, and gave you that faculty of wonder which he has not given to the brutes; which is at once the mother of sound science, and a pledge of {{immortality}} in a world more wondrous even than this. But wonder at the right thing, not at the wrong; at the real miracles and prodigies, not at the sham. Wonder not at the world of man. Waste not your admiration, interest, hope on it, its pretty toys, gay fashions, fine clothes, tawdry luxuries, silly amusements. Wonder at the works of God. You will not, perhaps, take my advice yet. The world of man looks so pretty, that you will needs have your peep at it, and stare into its shop windows; and if you <b>can,</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few of its stage plays, and dance at a few of its balls. Ah--well--After a wild dream comes an uneasy wakening; and after too many sweet things, comes a sick headache. And one morning you will awake, I trust and pray, {{from the world of}} man to the world of God, and wonder where wonder is due, and worship where worship is due. You will awake like a child who has been at a pantomime over night, staring at the [...] "fairy halls," [...] which are all paint and canvas; and the [...] "dazzling splendours," [...] which are gas and oil; and the [...] "magic transformations," [...] which are done with ropes and pulleys; and the [...] "brilliant elves," [...] who are poor little children out of the next foul alley; and the harlequin and clown, who through all their fun are thinking wearily over the old debts which they must pay, and the hungry mouths at home which they must feed: and so, having thought it all wondrously glorious, and quite a fairy land, slips tired and stupid into bed, and wakes next morning to see the pure light shining in through the delicate frost-lace on the window-pane, and looks out over fields of virgin snow, and watches the rosy dawn and cloudless blue, and the great sun rising to the music of cawing rooks and piping stares, and says, [...] "This is the true wonder. This is the true glory. The theatre last night was the fairy land of man; but this is the fairy land of God." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{wedding of}} the farmer's {{daughter}} has taken place. We had {{hoped it would}} have been in the little chapel of our house, but it seems some special permission was necessary, and they applied for it too late. They all said, [...] "This is the Constitution. There would have been no difficulty before!" [...] the lower classes making the poor Constitution the scapegoat for everything they don't like. So as it was impossible for us to climb up to the church where the wedding was to be, we contented ourselves with seeing the procession pass. It was not a very large one, for, it requiring some activity to go up, all the old people remained at home. It is not etiquette for the bride's mother to go, and no unmarried woman <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wedding--I suppose for fear of its making her discontented with her own position. The procession stopped at our door, for the bride to receive our congratulations. She was dressed in a shot silk, with a yellow handkerchief, and rows of a large gold chain. In the afternoon they sent to request us to go there. On our arrival we found them dancing out of doors, and a most melancholy affair it was. All the bride's sisters were not to be recognised, they had cried so. The mother sat in the house, and could not appear. And the bride was sobbing so, she could hardly stand! The most melancholy spectacle of all to my mind was, that the bridegroom was decidedly tipsy. He seemed rather affronted at all the distress. We danced a Monferrino; I with the bridegroom; and the bride crying the whole time. The company did their utmost to enliven her by firing pistols, but without success, and at last they began a series of yells, which reminded me of a set of savages. But even this delicate method of consolation failed, and the wishing good-bye began. It was altogether so melancholy an affair that Madame B. dropped a few tears, and I was very near it, particularly when the poor mother came out to see the last of her daughter, who was finally dragged off between her brother and uncle, with a last explosion of pistols. As she lives quite near, makes an excellent match, and is one of nine children, it really was a most desirable marriage, in spite of all the show of distress. Albert was so discomfited by it, that he forgot to kiss the bride as he had intended to do, and therefore went to call upon her yesterday, and found her very smiling in her new house, and supplied the omission. The cook came home from the wedding, declaring she was cured of any wish to marry--but I would not recommend any man to act upon that threat and make her an offer. In a couple of days we had some rolls of the bride's first baking, which they call Madonnas. The musicians, it seems, were in the same state as the bridegroom, for, in escorting her home, they all fell down in the mud. My wrath against the bridegroom is somewhat calmed by finding that it is considered bad luck if he does not get tipsy at his wedding." ...|$|E
