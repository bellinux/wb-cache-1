5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the <b>camshafts</b> and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E
5|$|TWR {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the V64V engine from Austin Rover in 1989 and developed a completely new turbocharged engine, codenamed JV6, under the auspices of Allan Scott, with proportions roughly similar to the V64V, and suitable for Sportcar racing. As the V64V was originally naturally aspirated, TWR needed to redesign all parts of the engine to accommodate forced induction. A few of the changes included increasing the displacement to 3.5 litres, strengthening the internals, and adding two Garrett TO3 turbochargers. The JV6 engine would first be used in the JaguarSport XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars; its compact dimensions and low weight made it an ideal candidate for the XJ220. The engine had a 90° bank angle, four valves per cylinder and belt-driven double overhead <b>camshafts.</b> It shares a number of design features with the Cosworth DFV Formula One engine.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of effect of variety lobe separation angle <b>camshaft</b> to engine power. Lobe separation angle (LSA) <b>camshaft</b> variation used is LSA standart <b>camshaft</b> (104 o), LSA widened <b>camshaft</b> (107 o), and LSA narrowed <b>camshaft</b> (101 o). <b>Camshaft</b> of Honda Supra X 125 {{is used for}} this research. This research at some speed of engine, these are 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500, 7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000 and 9500 rpm. Based on the data analysis it may be concluded that the change of LSA narrowed <b>camshaft</b> (101 o) produces a maximum power of increase. While the change of LSA widened <b>camshaft</b> (107 o) produces a maximum power of decreases. LSA narrowed <b>camshaft</b> which impact on engine speed 4000 rpm – 5500 rpm generated power falls below the standard <b>camshaft,</b> while the engine speed above 6000 rpm increased power over standard <b>camshaft.</b> Differences that occur in this research is a positive effect because the engine power can be increased on a lap top.

50|$|The {{electric}} motor in the actuator spins {{together with the}} intake <b>camshaft</b> as the engine runs. To maintain <b>camshaft</b> timing, the actuator motor will operate {{at the same speed}} as the <b>camshaft.</b> To advance the <b>camshaft</b> timing, the actuator motor will rotate slightly faster than the <b>camshaft</b> speed. To retard <b>camshaft</b> timing, the actuator motor will rotate slightly slower than <b>camshaft</b> speed. The speed difference between the actuator motor and <b>camshaft</b> timing is used to operate a mechanism that varies the <b>camshaft</b> timing. The benefit of the electric actuation is enhanced response and accuracy at low engine speeds and at lower temperatures as well as a greater total range of adjustment. The combination of these factors allows more precise control, resulting in an improvement of both fuel economy, engine output and emissions performance.|$|R

5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead <b>camshafts.</b> The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead <b>camshafts.</b> This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E
25|$|While today some engines rely on {{a single}} {{camshaft}} per cylinder bank, which {{is known as a}} single overhead camshaft (SOHC), most modern engines are driven by a two <b>camshafts</b> per cylinder bank arrangement (one camshaft for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves); such camshaft arrangement is known as a double or dual overhead cam (DOHC), thus, a V engine, which has two separate cylinder banks, may have four <b>camshafts</b> (colloquially known as a quad-cam engine).|$|E

25|$|Chilled iron castings: Commonly used in {{high volume}} production, chilled iron <b>camshafts</b> have good wear {{resistance}} since the chilling process hardens them. Other elements {{are added to the}} iron before casting to make the material more suitable for its application.|$|E
50|$|The <b>camshaft</b> in the {{crankcase}} has {{a flange}} {{to hold the}} <b>camshaft</b> gear. Between this flange and the <b>camshaft</b> gear, the <b>camshaft</b> has another gear that drives the injection pump. In {{the center of the}} <b>camshaft,</b> a third gear drives the oil pump. The overhead valves have double valve springs; each cylinder has one inlet and one outlet valve of the same size. The valves are pushed by tappets, pushrods and rocker arms. The rocker arms, which are supported in bronze bearings, are lubricated by the wet sump lubrication system. They are secured with a horizontal screw each. The fuel is pumped to the injection nozzels by a Bosch size A injection pump, that is driven by the gear between the flange and <b>camshaft</b> gear on the <b>camshaft.</b> The injection pump has a Hele-Shaw clutch and a pneumatic governor.|$|R
40|$|Factors {{that also}} affect {{performance}} and reduce {{exhaust gas emissions}} are fuel quality combustion in the combustion chamber. One of the parameters that influence {{is the amount of}} supply of combustion air into the combustion chamber. Where this supply is governed by the <b>camshaft</b> mechanism through open-close of the intake valve and the exhaust valve. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the effect of reduction of lift <b>camshaft</b> on engine performance. The investigation was conducted on a Yamaha jupiter Z 1 single-cylinder, four-stroke, spark ignition engine. The experiments were performed by varying the reduction of lift <b>camshaft,</b> with <b>camshaft</b> standard (CAM STD), <b>camshaft</b> condition 1 with reduction of lift <b>camshaft</b> 0. 5 mm (CAM 1), <b>camshaft</b> condition 2 with reduction of lift <b>camshaft</b> 0. 10 mm (CAM 2) and <b>camshaft</b> condition 3 with reduction of lift <b>camshaft</b> 0. 15 mm (CAM 3) and speed of the engine (2000 rpm, 3000 rpm and 4000 rpm). As a result, the maximum effective braking power was on CAM STD, at the engine speed of 3000 rpm that was 535. 072 Watt, minimum SFC (Specific Fuel Consumption) was on CAM 2, at the engine speed 3000 rpm that was 1. 54 x 10 - 7 kg/J and the thermal of maximum braking efficiency was on the CAM 2, at the engine speed of 3000 rpm equal to 14. 129 %...|$|R
50|$|In the {{overhead}} <b>camshaft</b> (OHC) design, the cylinder head contains the valves, spark plugs and inlet/exhaust tracts {{just like the}} OHV engine, but the <b>camshaft</b> is now also contained within the cylinder head. The <b>camshaft</b> may be seated centrally between each offset row of inlet and exhaust valves, and still also utilizing rocker arms (but without any pushrods), or the <b>camshaft</b> may be seated directly above the valves eliminating the rocker arms and utilizing 'bucket' tappets.|$|R

50|$|In a {{piston engine}} {{configuration}} where the valves are overhead but the <b>camshaft</b> is not, informally called pushrod engine or I-head engine, the <b>camshaft</b> is placed within the cylinder block (usually beside and slightly above the crankshaft {{in a straight}} engine or directly above the crankshaft in the V of a V engine), and uses pushrods or rods to actuate rocker arms above the cylinder head to actuate the valves. Lifters or tappets {{are located in the}} engine block between the <b>camshaft</b> and pushrods. By contrast, overhead <b>camshaft</b> design avoids the use of pushrods by putting the <b>camshaft</b> directly above the valves in the cylinder head, thus simplifying the valvetrain.|$|R

50|$|A helical <b>camshaft</b> must operate {{through a}} lift-multiplying {{pivoting}} follower. The Helical <b>Camshaft</b> could not really {{be used with}} an inverted bucket type of follower. Even though the inverted bucket is still used, it is being increasingly replaced both in road and racing engines by the pivoting “finger” follower. As well as needing a pivoting follower, if the engine has four valves per cylinder then the follower must be forked so that the one Helical <b>Camshaft</b> lobe operates two valves. This is more a characteristic than a problem. If a really wide duration range is required, because axial space is somewhat limited along the <b>camshaft,</b> usually only room for one Helical <b>Camshaft</b> lobe (and its operating space) can be found.|$|R
