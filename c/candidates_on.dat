50|$|In the 2009 European {{election}}s, she was {{the fourth}} <b>candidate</b> <b>on</b> the Union for a Popular Movement list in the Massif Central-Centre region - which made her election quasi-impossible in the 5-seat constituency. However, Brice Hortefeux, then-Minister of Labour, third <b>candidate</b> <b>on</b> the list, was elected due to the UMP's surprisingly good result.

Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs. The closest the voting for the Hart Trophy has ever come was in the 2001–02 season, when Jose Theodore and Jarome Iginla tied in the total voting. The tiebreaker for choosing the Hart Trophy winner in such a case is number of first-place votes: Theodore claimed it, who had 86 first-place votes to Iginla's 82.|$|E
5|$|Marcos {{was allowed}} to return to the Philippines by Corazon Aquino on 4 November 1991. The {{following}} year, she ran for president in the presidential elections on 11 May 1992, finishing 5th out of 7 <b>candidates.</b> <b>On</b> 8 May 1995, she was elected as a congresswoman of Leyte, representing the first district, despite facing a disqualification lawsuit in which the Supreme Court ruled in her favor. She sought the presidency again on 11 May 1998, but later withdrew to support the eventual winner Joseph Estrada and she finished 9th among 11 candidates. In November 2006, she started her own business, a fashion label that included designing jewelry. In March 2008, she was acquitted of charges of having illegally taken money from the country by the Manila Regional Trial Court due to reasonable doubt.|$|E
5|$|Members of the WSPU were {{sometimes}} heckled and derided for spoiling elections for Liberal <b>candidates.</b> <b>On</b> 18 January 1908, Pankhurst and her associate Nellie Martel {{were attacked by}} an all-male crowd of Liberal supporters who blamed the WSPU for costing them a recent by-election to the Conservative candidate. The men threw clay, rotten eggs, and stones packed in snow; the women were beaten and Pankhurst's ankle was severely bruised. Similar tensions later formed with Labour. Until party leaders made the vote for women a priority, however, the WSPU vowed to continue its militant activism. Pankhurst {{and others in the}} union saw party politics as distracting to the goal of women's suffrage and criticised other organisations for putting party loyalty ahead of women's votes.|$|E

5|$|Pierce, so far, {{has been}} {{overlooked}} for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. However, in October 2014 he was selected {{for the first time}} by the Baseball Writers' Association of America's (BBWAA) overview committee to be one of ten <b>candidates</b> <b>on</b> the Golden Era Committee ballot for possible induction in 2015. He and the other candidates, including former White Sox teammate Minnie Miñoso, all fell short of selection. The committee meets and votes on ten candidates selected from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Pierce received less than 4 votes of the required 12 votes from the committee at the MLB winter meeting on December 8, with no one elected to the Hall by the committee. Ron Santo received 15 votes at the committee's previous election, prior to his 2012 enshrinement.|$|E
5|$|The {{race between}} Amondson and Dodge {{was viewed as}} a way to {{determine}} which faction would lead the party in the future. Amondson achieved ballot access in Louisiana as the nominee of the Prohibition Party and in Colorado as the nominee of the Concerns of People Party. Dodge achieved ballot access only in Colorado, where he was listed as the nominee of the Prohibition Party. Overall, Amondson won the contest, collecting 1,896 (1,512 of those were from Louisiana) votes compared to Dodge's 140. As expected, Amondson placed well behind both major candidates (George W. Bush received 1.1million votes, and John Kerry received over 1million votes). He placed eighth in a slate of 12 <b>candidates</b> <b>on</b> Colorado's ballot (Dodge placed last, even though it was his home state). Amondson's third-place finish in four Louisiana parishes was the first time since 1960 that the Prohibition Party nominee for President out polled-all other third party candidates for president in any county.|$|E
5|$|The Matriculation exam tested <b>candidates</b> <b>on</b> five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam-time this {{dedication}} to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E
