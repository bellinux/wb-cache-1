40|$|Most of the {{existing}} work on information integration in the Semantic Web concentrates on resolving schema-level problems. Specific issues of data-level integration (instance <b>coreferencing,</b> conflict <b>resolution,</b> handling uncertainty) are usually tackled by applying the same techniques as for ontology schema matching or by reusing the solutions produced in the database domain. However, data structured according to OWL ontologies has its specific features: e. g., the classes are organized into a hierarchy, the properties are inherited, data constraints differ from those defined by database schema.

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that the {{resolution}} of anaphoric expressions in an utterance is essentially an abductive task following [12] who use a weighted abduction scheme on horn clauses to deal with reference. We give a semantic representation for utterances containing anaphora that enables us to compute possible antecedents by abductive inference. We extend the disjunctive model construction procedure of hyper tableaux [3, 14] with a clause transformation turning the abductive task into a model generation problem and show the completeness of this transformation {{with respect to the}} computation of abductive explanations. This abductive inference is applied to the resolution of anaphoric expressions in our general model constructing framework for incremental discourse representation which we argue to be useful for computing information updates from natural language utterances.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} how to {{annotate}} coreference and predicate-argument relations in Japanese written text. There have been research activities for building Japanese text corpora annotated with coreference and predicate-argument relations as {{are done in}} the Kyoto Text Corpus version 4. 0 (Kawahara et al., 2002) and the GDA-Tagged Corpus (Hasida, 2005). However, {{there is still much}} room for re ning their speci cations. For this reason, we discuss issues in annotating these two relations, and propose a new speci cation for each relation. In accordance with the speci cation, we built a large-scaled annotated corpus, and examined the reliability of our corpus. As the result of our current work, we have released an annotated corpus named NAIST Text Corpus 1, which is used as the evaluation data set in the <b>coreference</b> and zero-anaphora <b>resolution</b> tasks in Iida et al.

50|$|In {{computational}} linguistics, <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> is a well-studied {{problem in}} discourse. To derive the correct {{interpretation of a}} text, or even to estimate {{the relative importance of}} various mentioned subjects, pronouns and other referring expressions must be connected to the right individuals. Algorithms intended to resolve coreferences commonly look first for the nearest preceding individual that is compatible with the referring expression. For example, she might attach to a preceding expression such as the woman or Anne, but not to Bill. Pronouns such as himself have much stricter constraints. Algorithms for resolving coreference tend to have accuracy in the 75% range. As with many linguistic tasks, there is a tradeoff between precision and recall.|$|E
5000|$|Coreference resolution: Given a {{sentence}} or larger chunk of text, determine which words ("mentions") {{refer to the}} same objects ("entities"). Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer. The more general task of <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> also includes identifying so-called [...] "bridging relationships" [...] involving referring expressions. For example, in {{a sentence}} such as [...] "He entered John's house through the front door", [...] "the front door" [...] is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified {{is the fact that}} the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of several noun phrase <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> data sets {{as well as several}} formal evaluations on the task, it remains frustratingly difficult to compare results across different <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> systems. This is due to the high cost of implementing a complete end-to-end <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> system, which often forces researchers to substitute available gold-standard information in lieu of implementing a module that would compute that information. Unfortunately, this leads to inconsistent and often unrealistic evaluation scenarios. With the aim to facilitate consistent and realistic experimental evaluations in <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution,</b> we present Reconcile, an infrastructure for the development of learning-based noun phrase (NP) <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> systems. Reconcile is designed to facilitate the rapid creation of <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> systems, easy implementation of new feature sets and approaches to <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution,</b> and empirical evaluation of coreference resolvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and standard scoring metrics. We describe Reconcile and present experimental results showing that Reconcile can be used to create a coreference resolver that achieves performance comparable to state-ofthe-art systems on six benchmark data sets. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit {{the task of}} {{quantitative}} evaluation of <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> systems. We review {{the most commonly used}} metrics (MUC, B 3, CEAF and BLANC) {{on the basis of their}} evaluation of <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> in five texts from the OntoNotes corpus. We examine both the correlation between the metrics and the degree to which our human judgement of <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> agrees with the metrics. In conclusion we claim that loss of information value is an essential factor, insufficiently adressed in current metrics, in human perception of the degree of success or failure of <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution.</b> We thus conjecture that including a layer of mention information weight could improve both the <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> and its evaluation. 1 Introduction an...|$|E

In this paper, we first demonstrate the diverse scenarios of event coreference by an example. We then model event <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> as a spectral graph clustering problem and evaluate the clustering algorithm on ground truth event mentions using ECM F-Measure. We obtain the ECM-F scores of 0. 8363 and 0. 8312 respectively by using two methods for computing coreference matrices. ...|$|E

The experiments on the CoNLL- 2011 corpus show that our rule-based mention identification system obtains a recall of 87. 69 %, and the best result of the SVM-based <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> system is an average F-score 50. 92 % of the MUC, B-CUBED and CEAFE metrics...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{noun phrase}} anaphoricity might be profitably {{exploited}} in <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> {{to bypass the}} resolution of non-anaphoric noun phrases.

This paper employs a global learning method in determining the anaphoricity of noun phrases via a label propagation algorithm to improve learningbased <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution.</b> In particular, two kinds of kernels, i. e. the feature-based RBF kernel and the convolution tree kernel, are employed to compute the anaphoricity similarity between two noun phrases.

More importantly, the clustering approach outperforms the only MUC- 6 system to treat <b>coreference</b> <b>resolution</b> as a learning problem.
