In this article, we have introduced the Bootstrap-DEA approach from the international literature to analyze the technical efficiency of public hospitals in Tianjin (China) and tried to improve the application of this method for benchmarking and inter-organizational learning. It is found that the bias corrected efficiency scores of Bootstrap-DEA differ significantly {{from those of the}} traditional Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (BCC) model, which means that Chinese researchers need to update their DEA models for more scientific calculation of hospital efficiency scores. Our research has helped shorten the gap between China and the international world in relative efficiency measurement and improvement of hospitals. It is suggested that Bootstrap-DEA be widely applied into afterward research to measure relative efficiency and productivity of Chinese hospitals so as to better serve for efficiency improvement and related decision making...|$|E

40|$|A novel gene {{targeting}} strategy, small fragment homologous replacement (SFHR), {{has been used}} to correct specific genomic lesions in human epithelial cells. The frequency of targeting was estimated to be 1 - 10 %. However, given the genomic target, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, it is difficult to accurately quantify targeting frequency. As an alternative to targeting CFTR, targeted <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> a mutant selectable marker or reporter gene would be more amenable to accurate and rapid quantification <b>of</b> {{gene targeting}} <b>efficiency.</b> The present study evaluates the conditions that modulate SFHR-mediated <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> a defective Zeocin antibiotic resistance (Zeo(r)) gene that has been inactivated by a 4 -bp insertion. The conditions include delivery systems, plasmid-to-fragment ratio, fragment length, and fragment strandedness (single- or double-stranded DNA). Targeting fragments comprise the wild-type Zeo(r) gene sequence and were either 410 (Zeo 1) or 458 bp (Zeo 3). Expression vectors containing the corrected Zeo(r) gene were isolated as episomal plasmids or were allowed to stably integrate into cultured human airway epithelial cells. <b>Correction</b> <b>of</b> the Zeo(r) gene was phenotypically defined as restoration of resistance to Zeocin in either bacteria or epithelial cell clones. Extrachromosomal gene correction was assayed using polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction enzyme digestion, DNA sequencing, and Southern blot hybridization analysis of DNA from isolated prokaryotic and eukaryotic clones. Neither random sequence alteration in the target episomal gene nor random integration of the small fragments was detected.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{precisely}} defined beam shapes in photoelectron sources {{has been well}} established. In this paper, we use a spatial light modulator and simple shaping algorithm to create arbitrary, detailed transverse laser shapes with high fidelity. We transmit this shaped laser to the photocathode of a high voltage dc gun. Using beam currents where space charge is negligible, and using an imaging solenoid and fluorescent viewscreen, we show that the resultant beam shape preserves these detailed features with similar fidelity. Next, instead of transmitting a shaped laser profile, we use an active feedback on the unshaped electron beam image to create equally accurate and detailed shapes. We demonstrate that this electron beam feedback has the added advantage of correcting for electron optical aberrations, yielding shapes without skew. The method may serve to provide precisely defined electron beams for low current target experiments, space-charge dominated beam commissioning, {{as well as for}} online adaptive <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> photocathode quantum <b>efficiency</b> degradation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{detailed}} performance analysis and experimental characterization of a high-pressure supercharger in a multi-stage boosting system (turbo-super arrangement). Infact, besides the technical challenges associated with achieving adequate tuning, interoperability and driveability of multi-stage boosting systems, another {{challenge lies in}} their performance prediction during engine design. Indeed, performance maps of single boosting systems are usually provided by manufacturers and used as look-up tables in 1 -D engine models. Tests are usually conducted in a standalone mode, with no information provided on the behaviour and performance of the combination {{of more than one}} boosting device. The supercharger was tested with varying inlet pressures and temperatures matching on-engine operating conditions and the results were then used to assess the effectiveness of 1 -D engine models performance prediction when dealing with multi-stage boosting systems. An assessment on heat transfer in superchargers was also carried out together with the analysis on the nature of non-dimensional performance maps when dealing with a pressurized inlet. Finally, the analysis also looked into the opportunity to use the superchargers as expanders (‘expansion mode’) in order to cool the air charge entering the engine. The results showed that there is discrepancy between the efficiency values computed by 1 -D engine models and those obtained experimentally under pressurized/heated inlet air conditions; the <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>efficiency</b> maps for heat transfer plays {{a significant role in the}} final measured <b>efficiency</b> and the <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> the maps for varying inlet temperatures must be carried out in order to avoid incurring in apparent efficiencies greater than unity. The experiments on the supercharger in ‘expansion mode’ showed that low isentropic efficiencies can be achieved; despite this, 1 -D engine simulations showed that it is possible to achieve savings of a few percentage points in Brake Specific Fuel Consumption when the supercharger is used to recover some throttling energy by expanding the close-to-ambient pressure to the required intake pressure...|$|R

We matched our photometry of hundreds of stars in these fields from the ACS images to existing, ground-based photometry of faint sequences which were calibrated on the standard BV RI system of Landolt. These stars are significantly fainter than those generally used for HST calibration purposes, and therefore are much better matched to supporting precision photometry of ACS science targets. We were able to derive more accurate photometric transformation coefficients for the commonly used ACS broad-band filters compared to those published by Sirianni, et al.

40|$|This {{collection}} of essays contains two kinds of contributions. All four essays include applications of the existing DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) toolbox on real world datasets. But the main contribution is that they also offer new and useful tools for practitioners doing efficiency and productivity analysis. Essay I is about benchmarking by means of applying the DEA model on electricity distributors. A sample of large electricity distribution utilities from Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands for the year 1997 is studied by assuming a common production frontier for all countries. The peers supporting the benchmark frontier are from all countries. New indices describing cross-country connections {{at the level of}} individual peers and their inefficient units as well as between countries are developed, and novel applications of Malmquist productivity indices comparing units from different countries are performed. The contribution of Essay II is to develop a method for classifying self-evaluators based on the additive DEA model into interior and exterior ones. The exterior self-evaluators are efficient “by default”; there is no firm evidence from observations for the classification. These units should therefore not been regarded as efficient, and should be removed from the observations <b>of</b> <b>efficiency</b> scores when performing a two-stage analysis of explaining the distribution of the scores. The application to municipal nursing- and home care services of Norway shows significant effects of removing exterior self-evaluators from the data when doing a two-stage analysis. The robustness <b>of</b> the <b>efficiency</b> scores in DEA has been addressed in Essay III. It is of crucial importance for the practical use <b>of</b> <b>efficiency</b> scores. The purpose is to demonstrate the usefulness of a new way of getting an indication of the sensitivity of each <b>of</b> the <b>efficiency</b> scores to measurement error. The main idea is to investigate a DMU’s (Decision Making Unit) sensitivity to sequential removal of its most influential peer (with new peer identification as a part of each of the iterations). The Efficiency stepladder approach is shown to provide relevant and useful information when applied on a dataset of Nordic and Dutch electricity distribution utilities. Some <b>of</b> the empirical <b>efficiency</b> estimations are shown to be very sensitive to the validity and existence of one or a low number of other observations in the sample. The main competing method is Peeling, which consists of removing all the frontier units in each step. The new method has some strengths and some weaknesses in comparison. All in all, the Efficiency stepladder measure is simple and crude, but it is shown that it can provide useful information for practitioners about the robustness <b>of</b> the <b>efficiency</b> scores in DEA. Essay IV is an attempt to perform an <b>efficiency</b> study <b>of</b> the construction industry at the micro level. In this essay information on multiple outputs is utilized by applying DEA on a cross section dataset of Norwegian construction firms. Bootstrapping is applied to select the scale specification of the model. Constant returns to scale was rejected. Furthermore, bootstrapping was used to estimate and correct for the sampling bias in the DEA efficiency scores. One important lesson that can be learned from this application is the danger <b>of</b> taking the <b>efficiency</b> scores from uncorrected DEA calculations at face value. A new contribution is to use the inverse of the standard errors (from the bias <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>efficiency</b> scores) as weights in a regression to explain the <b>efficiency</b> scores. Several <b>of</b> the hypotheses investigated concerning the latter are found to have statistically significant empirical relevance...|$|R

40|$|A novel spatio-temporal 2 -dimensional (2 -D) {{processing}} method that can jointly estimate the transmitting-receiving azimuth and Doppler frequency for bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar {{in the presence}} of spatial colored noise and an unknown number of targets is proposed. In the temporal domain, the cross-correlation of the matched filters’ outputs for different time-delay sampling is used to eliminate the spatial colored noise. In the spatial domain, the proposed method uses a diagonal loading method and subspace theory to estimate the direction of departure (DOD) and direction of arrival (DOA), and the Doppler frequency can then be accurately estimated through the estimation of the DOD and DOA.

40|$|A mental-rotation {{task was}} {{presented}} to 17 young (aged 18 - 28 yrs) and 13 old (aged 60 - 76 yrs) adults to simultaneously assess age-related changes in performance, response monitoring and adaptive behavior. Relative to young participants, older adults were less inclined to adjust their speed {{at the expense of}} accuracy. They displayed a larger number of slow errors, smaller error potentials, more immediate <b>corrections</b> <b>of</b> errors when detected, and a larger speed reduction on trials following an error. The data suggest that for older adults an increase of task complexity sometimes caused a radical failure in determining the correct response, rather than a gradual reduction <b>of</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R
