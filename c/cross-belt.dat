25|$|Prince Harry {{wore the}} uniform of a captain of the Blues and Royals, with a forage cap. He wore aiguillettes, a <b>cross-belt</b> and gold waist belt with sword slings, but no sword. He wore {{the wings of the}} Army Air Corps and Golden Jubilee and Afghanistan Campaign medals.|$|E
60|$|Dare made no reply; {{and they}} watched the captain as he rode past with his drawn sword in his hand, the sun making a little sun upon its blade, and upon his brilliantly {{polished}} long boots and bright spurs; also warming his gold <b>cross-belt</b> and braidings, white gloves, busby with its red bag, and tall white plume.|$|E

6000|$|But {{in costume}} and {{appearance}} these soldiers were what is familiarly known as [...] "a queer lot!" [...] The {{uniform of the}} rank and file consisted of a tunic and trousers of white material, with a narrow-brimmed straw hat painted white, <b>cross-belts</b> and cartouche-box--by no means an unbecoming dress. But it was worn only at drills and reviews and state ceremonies. At other times, when on duty, soldiers went about almost naked, and the contrast of their dirty-white <b>cross-belts</b> with their brown breasts was curious, to say the least, while their straw hats and slovenly gait suggested anything but soldierly bearing.|$|R
60|$|A line {{of native}} troops was drawn {{up across the}} court, but these wore no uniform, only the lamba wound round their waists, and white <b>cross-belts</b> on their naked bodies. They were armed with the old flint-lock muskets and bayonets of the period.|$|R
6000|$|... [p.116] the kerchief, are of many kinds; the Bishr tribe near Meccah make {{a kind of}} crown {{like the}} gloria round a saint’s head, with bits of wood, in which are set pieces of mother-o’-pearl. Sandals, too, are of every description, from the simple sole of leather tied on with thongs, to the {{handsome}} and elaborate chaussure of Meccah; the price varies from a piastre to a dollar, and the very poor walk barefooted. A leathern bandoleer, called Majdal, passed over the left shoulder, and reaching to the right hip, supports a line of brass cylinders for cartridges.[FN#54] The other <b>cross-belt</b> (Al-Masdar), made of leather ornamented with brass rings, hangs down at the left side, and carries a Kharizah, or hide-case for bullets. And finally, the Hizam, or waist-belt, holds the dagger and extra cartridge cases. A Badawi never appears in public unarmed.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{religious}} dissension and sectarian heat were in {{the very}} air. Outside, on the Castle Green, the voices of preachers rose up like the drone of insects. Every waggon or barrel or chance provision case had {{been converted into a}} pulpit, each with its own orator and little knot of eager hearkeners. Here was a russet-coated Taunton volunteer in jackboots and bandolier, holding forth on the justification by works. Further on a grenadier of the militia, with blazing red coat and white <b>cross-belt,</b> was deep in the mystery of the Trinity. In one or two places, where the rude pulpits were too near to each other, the sermons had changed into a hot discussion between the two preachers, in which the audience took part by hums or groans, each applauding the champion whose creed was most in accordance with his own. Through this wild scene, made more striking by the ruddy flickering glare of the camp-fires, I picked my way with a weight at my heart, for I felt how vain it must be to hope for success where such division reigned, Saxon looked on, however, with glistening eyes, and rubbed his hands with satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|Calvert stepped back, {{lifted his}} hand to his cap, still pleasantly, and then walked gravely along the gallery, down the steps, and towards the cover. From her window, unseen, she {{followed}} his neat little figure moving undeviatingly on, without looking to the left or right, and still less towards the house he had just quitted. Then she saw the sunlight flash on <b>cross-belt</b> plates and steel barrels, and a light blue line issued from out the dark green bushes, round the point, and disappeared. And then it suddenly occurred to her what she had been doing! This, then, was her first step towards that fancy she had so lately conceived, quarrelled over with her brother, and lay awake last night to place anew, in spite of all opposition! This was her brilliant idea of dazzling and subduing Logport and the Fort! Had she grown silly, or what had happened? Could she have dreamed of the coming of this whipper-snapper, with his insufferable airs, after that beggarly deserter? I am afraid that for a few moments the miserable fugitive had as small a place in Maggie's sympathy as the redoubtable whipper-snapper himself. And now the cherished dream of triumph and conquest was over! What a [...] "looney" [...] she had been! Instead of inviting him in, and outdoing him in [...] "company manners," [...] and [...] "fooling" [...] him about the deserter, and then blazing upon him afterwards at Logport in the glory of her first spent wealth and finery, she had driven him away! ...|$|E

50|$|The 'Bloomsbury and Inns of Court Volunteers' {{was one of}} the Volunteer Corps {{raised in}} June 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was formed by the {{residents}} of the London district of Bloomsbury and the lawyers of the Inns of Court.

60|$|They looked, {{and through}} the opening beheld a band of men moving in single file along the track they had just left. They were most of them nearly naked, with only short calico {{breeches}} which did not quite reach to their knees, but all had muskets on their shoulders and <b>cross-belts</b> on their dark bodies, one of which belts sustained apparently a cartridge-box, the other a bayonet. Their own thick hair was all the cap they wore, excepting two or three men of superior rank, who wore cloths wrapped in turban fashion on their heads, and a voluminous plaid-like garment on their shoulders. These carried swords instead of muskets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{men were}} armed {{initially}} with sawed-off muskets, but gradually came to prefer British-issue muskets and by 1813 {{this is what}} they carried. They wore sword bayonets on waist belts instead of shoulder or <b>cross-belts</b> (this was also common among British light infantry and rifle units). Officers carried longer sabre-style weapons, just as their light infantry counterparts in Western European armies did. The men were supposed to be issued pistols, but it was [...] "thought prudent" [...] not to issue them to the men as they were, in the view of one historian 'always volatile', although officers carried. At least one contemporary print by Charles Hamilton Smith shows enlisted men of the sister regiment wearing pistols, another two by Goddard depict an enlisted man with a single pistol, possibly French pattern, and the other an officer of the 1st with a brace of pistols and enlisted man with one.|$|R

50|$|The uniform {{consisted}} of a blue tunic and Hungarian-style trousers. The tunic had red cuffs, decorations in the dolman style and scale epaulettes. The shako was black with a scarlet plume and an eagle helmet-plate and the shoes, waistbelt and <b>cross-belt</b> were also black. The waistbelt was in the light cavalry style.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its first}} two years, the corps uniform {{consisted}} of khaki pants and tops with a black belt and <b>cross-belt,</b> a uniform reminiscent of the 27th Lancers. Since 2007, Frontier wears a chocolate and crimson uniform with brass buttons and white gauntlets and gloves. [...] For 2008, the uniform {{was supposed to be}} changed to incorporate silver buttons, red gauntlets with black gloves, and a red sash with silver sequins.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the volunteers were on the march, and as Derriman ascended the road he met the Overcombe company, in which trudged Miller Loveday {{shoulder}} to shoulder with the other substantial householders of the place and its neighbourhood, duly equipped with pouches, <b>cross-belts,</b> firelocks, flint-boxes, pickers, worms, magazines, priming-horns, heel- ball, and pomatum. There was nothing to be gained by further suppression of the truth, and briefly informing them that the danger was not so immediate as had been supposed, Festus galloped on. At the end of another mile he met a large number of pikemen, including Bob Loveday, whom the yeoman resolved to sound upon the whereabouts of Anne. The circumstances were such as to lead Bob to speak more frankly than he might have done on reflection, and he told Festus the direction in which the women had been sent. Then Festus informed the group that the report of invasion was false, upon which they all turned to go homeward with greatly relieved spirits.|$|R
60|$|The fifth {{regiment}} {{was headed}} by a column of fen men from the dreary marches which stretch round Athelney. These men, in their sad and sordid dwellings, had retained the same free and bold spirit which had made them in past days the last resource of the good King Alfred and the protectors of the Western shires from the inroads of the Danes, who {{were never able to}} force their way into their watery strongholds. Two companies of them, towsy-headed and bare-legged, but loud in hymn and prayer, had come out from their fastnesses to help the Protestant cause. At their heels came the woodmen and lumberers of Bishop's Lidiard, big, sturdy men in green jerkins, and the white-smocked villagers of Huish Champflower. The rear of the regiment was formed by four hundred men in scarlet coats, with white <b>cross-belts</b> and well-burnished muskets. These were deserters from the Devonshire Militia, who had marched with Albemarle from Exeter, and who had come over to Monmouth on the field at Axminster. These kept together in a body, but there were many other militiamen, both in red and in yellow coats, amongst the various bodies which I have set forth. This regiment may have numbered seven hundred men.|$|R

"Well, first, I {{began by}} turning out at 5:30 a.m.," [...] said Miles, rolling {{with a sigh}} on his other side, for a uniform, <b>cross-belts,</b> boots, ammunition, etcetera, don't, after all, form an easy night-dress. [...] "After {{a cup of coffee}} I fell in with a lot of our fellows, and was told off for fatigue-duty. Worked away till 7:30. Then breakfast. After that I had to clear up the mess; then got ready for {{inspection}} parade at 9:30, after which I had to scrub belts, and clean up generally. Dinner over, I was warned to go on night-guard; but, for some reason which was not stated to me, that was changed, and I'm not sorry for it, because the heat has taken a good deal out of me, and I prefer lying here beside you, Willie, to standing sentry, blinking at the desert, and fancying every bush and stone to be a dusky skirmisher of Osman Digna. By the way, if that mountain range where the enemy lies is twelve or fourteen miles distant from the town, they {{have a long way to}} come when they take a fancy to attack us--which is pretty often too. They say he has got two hundred thousand men with him. D'you think that can be true?" ...|$|R
50|$|Cane is {{used for}} a variety of artistic and {{practical}} purposes, such as Native American baskets of North America. During the 18th and early 19th century, non-commissioned officers in some European armies could carry canes to discipline troops (when not in use, the cane was hooked to a <b>cross-belt</b> or a button). Cane is used to describe furniture made of wicker. Cane also describes a length of colored, patterned glass rod used in caneworking, a style of glassblowing.|$|E
50|$|Infantry {{officers}} wore {{a variant}} that used two suspender-like straps {{instead of the}} <b>cross-belt.</b> It was supposedly invented in 1878 by Lieutenant Sir Basil Templer Graham-Montgomery, 5th Baronet of the 60th Rifles while serving in India.

Since there were no patents issued for either design and both camps have accounts backing up their claims, it may never be decided.|$|E
50|$|The Rurales {{achieved}} {{a high profile}} internationally, rather {{like that of the}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police or the Texas Rangers, whose roles they paralleled. They wore a distinctive grey uniform braided in silver, which was modelled on the national charro dress and included wide felt sombreros, bolero jackets, tight fitting trousers with silver buttons down the seams, and red or black neckties. Senior officers wore elaborate rank insignia in the form of Austrian knots and sombrero braiding, which cost hundreds of pesos. The corps number appeared in silver on both the headdress and a leather carbine <b>cross-belt.</b>|$|E
6000|$|June 21st.--Yesterday, after dinner, we went, {{with the}} two eldest children, to the Boboli Gardens. [...] . We entered by a gate, nearer to our house than that by the Pitti Palace, and found {{ourselves}} almost immediately among embowered walks of box and shrubbery, and little wildernesses of trees, with {{here and there a}} seat under an arbor, and a marble statue, gray with ancient weather-stains. The site of the garden is a very uneven surface, and the paths go upward and downward, and ascend, at their ultimate point, to a base of {{what appears to be a}} fortress, commanding the city. A good many of the Florentines were rambling about the gardens, like ourselves: little parties of school-boys; fathers and mothers, with their youthful progeny; young men in couples, looking closely into every female face; lovers, with a maid or two attendant on the young lady. All appeared to enjoy themselves, especially the children, dancing on the esplanades, or rolling down the slopes of the hills; and the loving pairs, whom it was rather embarrassing to come upon unexpectedly, sitting together on the stone seat of an arbor, with clasped hands, a passionate solemnity in the young man's face, and a downcast pleasure in the lady's. Policemen, in cocked hats and epaulets, <b>cross-belts,</b> and swords, were scattered about the grounds, but interfered with nobody, though they seemed to keep an eye on all. A sentinel stood in the hot sunshine, looking down over the garden from the ramparts of the fortress.|$|R
6000|$|The {{greater part}} of the vendors seemed to be women, of the buyers men; there was more {{difference}} of appearance than in any European fair, and the population about Nkulu {{seemed to be a}} very mixed race. Some were ultra-negro, of the dead dull-black type, prognathous and long-headed like apes; others were of the red variety, with hair and eyes of a brownish tinge, and a few had features which if whitewashed could hardly be distinguished from Europeans. The tattoo was remarkable as amongst the tribes of the lower Zambeze.[FN#33] There were waistcoats, epaulettes, braces and <b>cross-belts</b> of huge welts, and raised polished lumps which must have cost not a little suffering; the skin is pinched up between the fingers and sawn across with a bluntish knife, the deeper the better; various plants are used as styptics, and the proper size of the cicatrice is maintained by constant pressure, which makes the flesh protrude from the wound. The teeth were as barbarously mutilated as the skin; these had all the incisors sharp-tipped; those chipped a chevron-shaped hole in the two upper or lower frontals, and not a few seemed to attempt converting the whole denture into molars. The legs were undeniably fine; even Hieland Mary's would hardly be admired here. Whilst the brown mothers smoked and carried their babies, the men bore guns adorned with brass tacks, or leaned upon their short, straight, conical [...] "spuds" [...] and hoes, long-handled bits of iron whose points, after African fashion, passed through the wood. I nowhere saw the handsome carved spoons, the hafts and knife-sheaths figured by the Congo Expedition.|$|R
6000|$|... § LVII. Let us now {{return to}} Venice, where, {{in the second}} chapel {{counting}} from right to left, at {{the west end of}} the Church of the Frari, there is a very early fourteenth, or perhaps late thirteenth, century tomb, another exquisite example of the perfect Gothic form. It is a knight's; but there is no inscription upon it, and his name is unknown. It consists of a sarcophagus, supported on bold brackets against the chapel wall, bearing the recumbent figure, protected by a simple canopy {{in the form of a}} pointed arch, pinnacled by the knight's crest; beneath which the shadowy space is painted dark blue, and strewn with stars. The statue itself is rudely carved; but its lines, as seen from the intended distance, are both tender and masterly. The knight is laid in his mail, only the hands and face being bare. The hauberk and helmet are of chain-mail, the armor for the limbs of jointed steel; a tunic, fitting close to the breast, and marking the noble swell of it by two narrow embroidered lines, is worn over the mail; his dagger is at his right side; his long <b>cross-belted</b> sword, not seen by the spectator from below, at his left. His feet rest on a hound (the hound being his crest), which looks up towards its master. In general, in tombs of this kind, the face of the statue is slightly turned towards the spectator; in this monument, on the contrary, it is turned away from him, towards the depth of the arch: for there, just above the warrior's breast, is carved a small image of St. Joseph bearing the infant Christ, who looks down upon the resting figure; and to this image its countenance is turned. The appearance of the entire tomb is as if the warrior had seen the vision of Christ in his dying moments, and had fallen back peacefully upon his pillow, with his eyes still turned to it, and his hands clasped in prayer.|$|R
50|$|The open {{belt drive}} has {{parallel}} shafts rotating {{in the same}} direction, whereas the <b>cross-belt</b> drive also bears parallel shafts but rotate in opposite direction. The former is far more common, and the latter not appropriate for timing and standard V-belts {{unless there is a}} twist between each pulley so that the pulleys only contact the same belt surface. Nonparallel shafts can be connected if the belt's center line is aligned with the center plane of the pulley. Industrial belts are usually reinforced rubber but sometimes leather types, non-leather non-reinforced belts, can only be used in light applications.|$|E
5000|$|One of Fabro’s first pieces {{was called}} Tubo da mettere tra i fiori (Tube to place among flowers), 1963. It was a {{site-specific}} installation {{designed for a}} Milanese garden, {{even if it was}} never displayed there; it was made of telescopic steel tubes. He made several works that deals with steel tubes in dialogue with basic physical laws of nature. [...] In 1965(Milan, Galleria Vismara), he had his first solo show where he combined mirror pieces with spatial lines.

5000|$|The Yeomen of the Guard {{are often}} {{confused}} with the Yeomen Warders of Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, popularly known as [...] "Beefeaters", a similar but distinct body. Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), {{is set in the}} 16th century, an earlier era before the two corps were split apart; it concerns what are today the Yeomen Warders. Both bodies wear identical dress uniforms, consisting of a royal red tunic with purple facings and stripes and gold lace ornaments, red knee-breeches and red stockings, flat hat, and black shoes with red, white and blue rosettes. The gold-embroidered emblems on the back and front of the coats consist of the crowned Tudor Rose, the shamrock and the thistle, the motto [...] "Dieu et mon droit", and the [...] "regal" [...] initial of the reigning sovereign (currently ER for [...] "Elizabeth Regina"). However, the Guard wear a red <b>cross-belt,</b> which distinguishes them from the Yeomen Warders.|$|E
60|$|Behind the horse, in a {{long line}} which {{stretched}} from the Eastover gate, across the bridge, along the High Street, up the Cornhill, and so past the church to the Pig Cross, stood our foot, silent and grim, save when some woman's voice from the windows called forth a deep, short answer from the ranks. The fitful light gleamed on scythes-blade or gun-barrel, and showed up the lines of rugged, hard set faces, some of mere children with never a hair upon their cheeks, others of old men whose grey beards swept down to their <b>cross-belts,</b> but all bearing the same stamp of a dogged courage and a fierce self-contained resolution. Here were still the fisher folk of the south. Here, too, were the fierce men from the Mendips, the wild hunters from Porlock Quay and Minehead, the poachers of Exmoor, the shaggy marshmen of Axbridge, the mountain men from the Quantocks, the serge and wool-workers of Devonshire, the graziers of Bampton, the red-coats from the Militia, the stout burghers of Taunton, and then, as the very bone and sinew of all, the brave smockfrocked peasants of the plains, who had turned up their jackets to the elbow, and exposed their brown and corded arms, as was their wont when good work had to be done. As I speak to you, dear children, fifty years rolls by like a mist in the morning, and I am riding once more down the winding street, and see again the serried ranks of my gallant companions. Brave hearts! They showed to all time how little training it takes to turn an Englishman into a soldier, and what manner of men are bred in those quiet, peaceful hamlets which dot the sunny slopes of the Somerset and Devon downs. If ever it should be that England should be struck upon her knees, if those who fight her battles should have deserted her, and she should find herself unarmed in the presence of her enemy, let her take heart and remember that every village in the realm is a barrack, and that her real standing army is the hardy courage and simple virtue which stand ever in the breast of the humblest of her peasants.|$|R
6000|$|This letter, which {{arrived by}} the very same ship which brought out Lady O'Dowd's box of {{millinery}} from London (and which you may be sure Dobbin opened before {{any one of the}} other packets which the mail brought him), put the receiver into such a state of mind that Glorvina, and her pink satin, and everything belonging to her became perfectly odious to him. The Major cursed the talk of women, and the sex in general. Everything annoyed him that day--the parade was insufferably hot and wearisome. Good heavens! was a man of intellect to waste his life, day after day, inspecting <b>cross-belts</b> and putting fools through their manoeuvres? The senseless chatter of the young men at mess was more than ever jarring. What cared he, a man on the high road to forty, to know how many snipes Lieutenant Smith had shot, or what were the performances of Ensign Brown's mare? The jokes about the table filled him with shame. He was too old to listen to the banter of the assistant surgeon and the slang of the youngsters, at which old O'Dowd, with his bald head and red face, laughed quite easily. The old man had listened to those jokes any time these thirty years--Dobbin himself had been fifteen years hearing them. And after the boisterous dulness of the mess-table, the quarrels and scandal of the ladies of the regiment! It was unbearable, shameful. [...] "O Amelia, Amelia," [...] he thought, [...] "you to whom I have been so faithful--you reproach me! It is because you cannot feel for me that I drag on this wearisome life. And you reward me after years of devotion by giving me your blessing upon my marriage, forsooth, with this flaunting Irish girl!" [...] Sick and sorry felt poor William; more than ever wretched and lonely. He would like to have done with life and its vanity altogether--so bootless and unsatisfactory the struggle, so cheerless and dreary the prospect seemed to him. He lay all that night sleepless, and yearning to go home. Amelia's letter had fallen as a blank upon him. No fidelity, no constant truth and passion, could move her into warmth. She would not see that he loved her. Tossing in his bed, he spoke out to her. [...] "Good God, Amelia!" [...] he said, [...] "don't you know that I only love you in the world--you, who are a stone to me--you, whom I tended through months and months of illness and grief, and who bade me farewell with a smile on your face, and forgot me before the door shut between us!" [...] The native servants lying outside his verandas beheld with wonder the Major, so cold and quiet ordinarily, at present so passionately moved and cast down. Would she have pitied him had she seen him? He read over and over all the letters which he ever had from her--letters of business relative to the little property which he had made her believe her husband had left to her--brief notes of invitation--every scrap of writing that she had ever sent to him--how cold, how kind, how hopeless, how selfish they were! ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{regards to}} the {{carrying}} of ammunition, a buff leather waist-belt with brass buckles was attached to a double frog holding brown leather, brass-tipped scabbards for sword and bayonet. The sword carried was brass-hilted and had a straight blade. A red-brown leather cartridge-box {{was attached to the}} waist-belt, but it eventually came to be suspended on the right hip from a buff leather <b>cross-belt.</b> The standard French cartouchière of the mid-eighteenth century held thirty musket cartridges instead of nine, contrasting its predecessor, though it can be assumed that there were many different stylistic variations. The older variant was engraved with the King's arms or a white anchor and border. A small brass-mounted powder-horn was also carried. The cartridge case was used to carry ammunition and a model 1728 French infantry musket, or [...] "St. Etienne", although different types of flintlock muskets and fusils were carried at different points {{in the history of the}} units. Although the exact designs of the muskets used by a unit such as the Compagnies franches de la marine can no longer be found, it is accepted that they were all of the flintlock type. Given that the colonial regulars were the responsibility of the navy, they carried navy-model muskets made at Tulle. In the 1740s, the navy began to purchase muskets from St-Etienne that probably resembled the army's 1728 model. In 1752, the royal magazines at Montreal and Quebec contained a great variety of muskets and bayonets.|$|E
