5|$|Gastrointestinal {{disorders}} are sometimes associated with aphthous-like stomatitis, e.g. most commonly <b>Celiac</b> <b>disease,</b> but also {{inflammatory bowel disease}} such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The link between gastrointestinal disorders and aphthous stomatitis is probably related to nutritional deficiencies caused by malabsorption. Less than 5% of people with RAS have <b>Celiac</b> <b>disease,</b> which usually presents with severe malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). Sometimes aphthous-like ulcerations can be {{the only sign of}} <b>celiac</b> <b>disease.</b> Despite this association, a gluten-free diet does not usually improve the oral ulceration.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} provide better therapy we strive to {{increase}} our knowledge of how the immune system behaves and communicates in common pediatric immunological diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, allergic and <b>celiac</b> <b>diseases.</b> However, when dealing with pediatric diseases, where study subjects are almost exclusively children, blood volumes available for immunological studies are limited and as such must be carefully handled and used to their full extent. Single immune markers can easily be detected by a traditional Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), whereas multiple markers can be detected by a fluorochrome (Luminex) or electrochemiluminescence (MSD) technique.

5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or <b>celiac</b> <b>disease.</b> However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for <b>celiac</b> <b>disease</b> should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with <b>celiac</b> <b>disease).</b> Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E

50|$|A D-Xylose {{test can}} be performed, {{which is where}} the patient will consume 4.5g of D-xylose, a sugar, by mouth. The urine {{excretion}} of D-Xylose is then measured after 5 hours. The majority of D-Xylose is absorbed normally, and should be found in the urine. If the D-Xylose is found to be low in the urine, this suggests an intestinal malabsorption problem such as bacterial overgrowth of the proximal small intestine, Whipple's Disease, or an autoimmune with <b>diseases</b> such as <b>Celiac's</b> <b>Disease</b> (allergy to gluten) or Crohn's Disease (autoimmune disease affecting the small intestine). With empiric antibiotic treatment after an initial positive D-Xylose test, and if a follow-up D-Xylose test is positive (decreased urine excretion) after antibiotic therapy, then this would signify it is not bacterial overgrowth of the proximal small intestine. Since Whipple's disease is so rare, a follow-up positive D-Xylose test more likely indicates a non-infectious etiology and more likely an autoimmune etiology. Clinical correlation is recommended to rule out Whipple's disease.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dual X-ray {{absorptiometry}} is {{the common}} technique to determine bone mineral density. Because of high costs and limited availability, it is worthwhile to look for alternative diagnostic techniques. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the use of panoramic radiographs measurements as a predictor for bone mineral density and to identify the subjects with osteoporosis and the increased risk of osteoporotic fractures in celiac patients. The sample of this study consisted of 60 celiac patients (36 males and 24 females) aged 22 to 46 years. All patients were diagnosed with <b>celiac</b> <b>diseases,</b> according to criteria of European Society of Gastroenterology. bone mineral density values were measured by Dual X-ray absorptiometry equipment at the lumbar spine and were categorized according to World Health Organization classification. Panoramic radiographs were obtained at the same time for all celiac patients providing two essential measurements; mental index and panoramic index. It was found that the mental index and panoramic index measurements were significantly related to bone mineral density measured by Dual X-ray absorptiometry and therefore could be used as diagnostic indicators of mandibular bone mineral density and play a significant role in celiac patient screening for osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|T lymphocyte-mediated {{pathogenesis}} {{is common}} {{to a variety of}} enteropathies, including giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, bacterial enteritis, <b>celiac's</b> <b>disease,</b> food anaphylaxis, and Crohn's disease. In giardiasis as well as in these other disorders, a diffuse loss of microvillous brush border, combined or not with villus atrophy, is responsible for disaccharidase insufficiencies and malabsorption of electrolytes, nutrients, and water, which ultimately cause diarrheal symptoms. Other mucosal changes may include crypt hyperplasia and increased infiltration of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Recent studies using models of giardiasis have shed new light on the immune regulation of these abnormalities. Indeed, experiments using an athymic mouse model of infection have found that these epithelial injuries were T cell-dependent. Findings from further research indicate that that the loss of brush border surface area, reduced disaccharidase activities, and increase crypt-villus ratios are mediated by CD 8 + T cells, whereas both CD 8 + and CD 4 + small mesenteric lymph node T cells regulate the influx of intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Future investigations need to characterize the CD 8 + T cell signaling cascades that ultimately lead to epithelial injury and malfunction in giardiasis and other malabsorptive disorders of the intestine...|$|R

The major millets were procured from the local market. The present study was to develop and popularize bakery products using millets. The millets were cleaned, dried under the sun, milled into flour. Popular bakery products such as biscuits, cakes and cookies were developed using foxtail millet, finger millet, proso millet and pearl millet added with wheat flour in the ratios of 10 : 90, 20 : 80 and 30 : 70 for both biscuit and cake, whereas for cookies, the above flours were used in the ratios of 15 : 85, 20 : 80 and 25 : 75, respectively.

Pus 10 is present in Archaea and Eukarya. While most archaeal Pus 10 produce both tRNA Ψ 54 and Ψ 55, some produce only Ψ 55. Interestingly, human PUS 10 has been implicated in apoptosis and Crohn 2 ̆ 7 s and <b>Celiac</b> <b>diseases.</b> Homology models of archaeal Pus 10 proteins based on the crystal structure of human PUS 10 reveal that there are subtle structural differences {{in all of these}} Pus 10 proteins. These observations suggest that structural changes in homologous proteins may lead to loss, gain, or change of their functions, warranting the need to study the structure-function relationship of these proteins. Using comparison of structural models and a series of mutations, we identified forefinger loop (reminiscent of that of RluA) and an Arg and a Tyr residue of archaeal Pus 10 as critical determinants for its Ψ 54, but not for its Ψ 55 activity. We also found that a Leu residue, in addition to the catalytic Asp, is essential for both activities. Since forefinger loop is needed for both rRNA and tRNA Ψ synthase activities of RluA, but only for tRNA Ψ 54 activity of Pus 10, archaeal Pus 10 proteins must use a different mechanism of recognition for Ψ 55 activity. We propose that archaeal Pus 10 uses two distinct mechanisms for substrate uridine recognition and binding. However, since we did not observe any mutation that affected only Ψ 55 activity, both mechanisms for archaeal Pus 10 activities must share some common features...|$|R

Associate Professor, Department of Pathology, Faculty of medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences 4. Assistant Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences Abstract Background: Duodenal biopsies are {{routinely}} obtained from suspected patients as a screening tool {{to evaluate the}} possibility of <b>celiac</b> <b>diseases</b> (CD). An increase in Intra-Epithelial Lymphocytes (IELs) {{is important in the}} diagnosis of CD and even in the presence of normal villous architecture may reflect gluten intolerance. The aim of this study was the comparison of two different histological staining Methods (H&E and IHC) for the quantization of duodenal IELs. Materials and methods: This cross–sectional study was performed on 74 duodenal samples from April 2004 to September 2004 at Shariati hospital. All biopsies were stained with H&E and IHC Methods (LCA) and each one was twice examined for the quantization of IELs by pathologist taking use of single blinding. Results: The mean number of IELs/ 100 epithelial cells in the first and second observations was 15. 77 and 16. 72 on H&E stained sections whereas it was 21. 54 and 21. 18 on IHC study. There was a linear correlation between IELs in H&E and IHC Methods. The comparison of mean IELs on H&E and LCA stained slides revealed about 5 cells preference for LCA. Conclusion: Two-step analysis of IELs quantization was suggested: 1) Estimation of IELs on H&E stained sections, and 2) LCA staining and counting, if IELs are suspected (upper limit of normal). When IHC staining was not performed it was possible to use the following formula: IELs on H&E + 5 IELs on IH...|$|R
