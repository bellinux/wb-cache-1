The {{cost of the}} project was estimated to be around £29.2million, of which £25.2million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union <b>competition</b> <b>laws</b> and also a form of State aid towards Linfield. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed {{that they would not be}} welcome in the directors box or the boardroom during the game – an apparent reaction to Crusaders' legal challenge of the stadium redevelopment. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In September, Ofotbanen {{was one of}} six {{companies}} prequalified to bid for {{the first}} public service obligation tender on the Gjøvik Line. However, the company chose to not submit a bid, and the contract was won by the NSB subsidiary NSB Anbud. In September, the mechanical company Narvik Sentralverksted, that had provided maintenance for the Norwegian National Rail Administration in Narvik since 1999, accused the municipality of illegally subsidizing Ofotbanen through providing the company with subsidized rent for their workshops. Ofotbanen had just won the public tender for the contract, and the company threatened to take the municipality to court for violation of <b>competition</b> <b>laws.</b> The matter was soon resolved, without the courts being involved. In December, the government granted permission for Ofotbanen to operate charter trains throughout the entire railway network.|$|E

Granada wanted to consolidate with Yorkshire and Tyne Tees Television to 'counter the potential dominance of the south east', and the prospect of being taken over by Thames Television. Granada made a hostile bid for LWT in December 1993, but LWT believed Granada had little to offer despite having three times the market capitalisation; Granada, however, completed the take-over in 1994. Granada continued to expand by acquiring Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television for £652m in 1997 and bought UNM's television assets for £1.75 billion in 2000 – by which it acquired Anglia Television and Meridian Broadcasting and some divisions of HTV – the remaining divisions passing to rival company Carlton due to <b>competition</b> <b>laws.</b> A year later, it acquired Border from Capital Radio Group.|$|E

In the election ads Nader had criticized the corporate financing of both the Bush and Gore campaigns. Using the theme and some of the language behind the MasterCard [...] "Priceless" [...] campaign the election specified the dollar amounts contributed by corporate interests to both candidates and then summed it up with [...] "finding out the truth ... priceless". MasterCard sued Nader's campaign committee and filed a temporary restraining order to stop the ads. The TRO was not granted and Nader defended the ads by claiming they were protected under the fair use doctrine.|$|E
60|$|Political economists generally, and English {{political}} economists above others, {{have been}} accustomed to lay almost exclusive stress upon the first of [two] agencies [competition and custom]; to exaggerate the effect of competition, and to take into little account the other and conflicting principle. They are apt to express themselves as if they thought that competition actually does, in all cases, whatever it can {{be shown to be}} the tendency of competition to do. This is partly intelligible, if we consider that only through the principle of competition has political economy any pretension to the character of a science. So far as rents, profits, wages, prices, are determined by <b>competition,</b> <b>laws</b> may be assigned for them. Assume competition to be their exclusive regulator, and principles of broad generality and scientific precision may be laid down, according to which they will be regulated. The political economist justly deems this his proper business: and, as an abstract or hypothetical science, political economy can not be required to do, and indeed can not do, anything more. But {{it would be a great}} misconception of the actual course of human affairs to suppose that competition exercises in fact this unlimited sway. I am not speaking of monopolies, either natural or artificial, or of any interferences of authority with the liberty of production or exchange. Such disturbing causes have always been allowed for by political economists. I speak of cases in which there is nothing to restrain competition; no hindrance to it either in the nature of the case or in artificial obstacles; yet in which the result is not determined by competition, but by custom or usage; competition either not taking place at all, or producing its effect in quite a different manner from that which is ordinarily assumed to be natural to it.|$|E

This study analyses the main concerns when arbitrating <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> issues, such as jurisdiction, choice of law and, in particular, the position of national jurisdiction regarding {{the enforcement of the}} award conflicting national <b>competition</b> <b>law.</b> This study proposes the functional approach to choice of law problems according to which the arbitrator will decide on the applicable <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> bearing in mind the content of mandatory norm, its connection with a dispute and the consequences of its application and non-application. In that regard, this thesis will examine how an arbitrator should address the extraterritorial effect of the <b>competition</b> <b>law.</b> The study will suggest that if the <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> policies of states connected with a dispute serve opposing and conflicting goals, the arbitrator should, in order to preserve his/her neutral function refuse to decide whose competition policy is "better" and should consequently decline jurisdiction...|$|R

In particular, the thesis aims to prove that, contrary to the prevailing view, only direct victims of violation of EU competition rules should be compensated. The thesis is divided into four chapters; the first being devoted to the general methodology of the thesis, private and public enforcement of <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> and to the claim for damages under the EU law. The analysis of private and public enforcement of <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> is an important basis for the whole thesis. The question to which extent the damages claim are important for the enforcement of <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> determines the function of damages claims in the area of <b>competition</b> <b>law.</b> The thesis arrives at the belief that private enforcement is not the main tool fir the enforcement of EU <b>competition</b> <b>law.</b> However, it is a very important tool.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} one of {{the intricacies}} of international <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> enforcement, namely the diversification of legal instruments used for bilateral cooperation.

40|$|Personal {{data has}} both an {{economic}} and a dignitary value. This begs {{the question of whether}} <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> should respect the dual nature of personal data, given that the regulation of competition is chiefly dictated by economic concerns. This article addresses that question by mapping the potential intersections between EU data protection <b>law</b> and <b>competition</b> <b>law.</b> In particular, it argues that data protection law exercises an internal and an external constraint on <b>competition</b> <b>law.</b> On the one hand, <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> involves judgments about ‘normal competition’ and consumer welfare which may require a normative contribution by data protection law. Using data protection as a normative benchmark in this way does not depart from the logic of <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> as data protection still requires a competitive concern hook on which to hang. Data protection would thus act as an ‘internal constraint’ on <b>competition</b> <b>law.</b> On the other hand, regardless of such logic, competition authorities are bound to respect the fundamental right to data protection. This requires them to restrict the scope of <b>competition</b> <b>law</b> and to guarantee the effectiveness of that fundamental right. In this way, data protection acts as an ‘external constraint’ on <b>competition</b> <b>law.</b> Recognising these constraints would pave the way for a more coherent EU law approach to consumer concerns in a digital society...|$|R
