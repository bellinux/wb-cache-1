5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share of the settlement totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky, Patton proposed {{that half of the}} settlement be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops. One-fourth of the money would support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, a cause important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E

According to an analysis in the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, it is grown as an industrial <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> 15% of the nation's land.

5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand.

As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock.

5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> {{the south and}} wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E

5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} legume from the genus Vigna. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall {{it is an}} important <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E

Trees were blown down in the parks of Havana. Twenty {{people were killed in}} the city, while in Batabanó, nine people were killed, with many others missing. In Matanzas, the location of the United States' 28th Infantry, tents were destroyed and there was widespread damage. However, nobody was killed or injured in the city. In San Luis, tobacco crops were ruined, and 150 tobacco barns in the Alquízar municipality were destroyed. The sugar <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> Pinar del Río Province survived well during the hurricane. In the La Guria section of Cuba, the banana crops were completely destroyed. Rivers topped their banks throughout the country.|$|E

5|$|Rice cultivation: In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese group {{reported}} the discovery in eastern China of fossilised phytoliths of domesticated rice apparently {{dating back to}} 11,900 BC or earlier. However, phytolith data are controversial in some quarters due to potential contamination problems. It is likely that demonstrated rice was cultivated in the middle Yangtze Valley by 7000 BC, as shown in finds from the Pengtoushan culture at Bashidang, Changde, Hunan. By 5000 BC, rice had been domesticated at Hemudu culture near the Yangtze Delta and was being cooked in pots. Although millet remained the main <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> northern China throughout history, several sporadic attempts {{were made by the}} state to introduce rice around the Bohai Gulf as early as the 1st century.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of its economy was sugar, grown on cane plantations worked by slaves. The {{sale of the}} <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> Britain enjoyed preferential terms. There were 2,571 declared slaves working on 68 plantations in Essequibo, and 1,648 slaves in Demerara in 1762. These numbers {{were known to be}} much understated, as the slave headcount was the basis of taxation. By 1769, there were 3,986 declared slaves for Essequibo's 92 plantations and 5,967 for Demerara's 206 plantations. The slave labour was in short supply and expensive due to the trading monopoly of the DWIC, and smuggling from Barbados was rife. Dutch colonists ensured white dominance over their growing slave population through the collaboration of indigenous natives, who strongly resisted white domination but could also be relied upon to take up arms against any Spanish incursions. When slaves rose up in Berbice in 1763, natives blocked the border to prevent the disruption from spreading into Demerara.|$|E
5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch <b>crop</b> <b>in</b> winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E
