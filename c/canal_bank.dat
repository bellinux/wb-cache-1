5|$|The {{structure}} that stands {{on what is}} known locally as the <b>Canal</b> <b>Bank,</b> called Cromwell's Castle, primarily derives its current form from the Napoleonic Wars. Similar to the Martello Tower that stands opposite it, on the same bank of the river, Cromwell's Castle was largely reconstructed as a defensive position to repel any invading fleet coming upstream towards Banagher.|$|E
5|$|Having fallen {{somewhat}} into disrepair, {{the structure}} {{came under the}} care of the Banagher Branch of the Offaly Historical Society in the 1980s and considerable restoration work has been undertaken since then. The <b>Canal</b> <b>Bank</b> on which it stands, is the property of the people of Banagher and is held in trust as a public amenity. Considerable works around the castle have also taken place and the castle, park and riverside walk are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} <b>canal</b> <b>bank.</b> Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves {{in the center of}} a huge administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} addresses {{seepage flow}} through irrigation <b>canal</b> <b>banks.</b> The main {{objective of the}} research {{is to determine the}} seepage line (phreatic line) location within the <b>canal</b> <b>banks</b> expressed in terms of rationale scientific basis {{as an alternative to the}} thump rule approaches. The objective is extended to determine seepage quantities and resulting benefits, in different types of soils. Field data was obtained from the White Nile Irrigation Schemes. The data was obtained by direct measurements of the phreatic elevation of the seeping water through the <b>canal</b> <b>banks.</b> Also physical models representing <b>canal</b> <b>banks</b> were constructed and tested under different compaction efforts using the same soil at these irrigation schemes. It was found that proper determination of the location of the seepage line results in significant reduction in the volume of soil required for constructing the banks. This in turn reduces largely the amount of section over digging and hence improves the hydraulic efficiency of the section. The difficulty expected in the determination of the phreatic line in unconfined ground water flow using direct analytical method is also encountered in seepage flow through <b>canal</b> <b>banks</b> or embankments. The study adopted the approach of transforming the seepage complex physical plane into simple plane identifying clearly the seepage line. This was done by the use of complex variable functions and series of conformal mapping techniques. The mathematical model developed in the study involved non-linear relations and improper integrals. Numerical methods were used to arrive at the required solutions. Computer programs in FORTRAN language were developed to get model solutions. The output of the models was found in good agreement with the results obtained from field observations. The computer program was used further to develop tables and engineering charts that can be used easily for determination of the location of the seepage line and estimation of the seepage quantities for different soil permeability's of the <b>canal</b> <b>banks</b> and embankments. The application and use of the models developed in this study are demonstrated considering two different design cases of irrigation canals. The first case corresponds to the design of an elevated canal constructed on a fill as the case for main canals conveying water from the Nile to the upper terraces of the river. The second case corresponds to the situation where the canal section is partly cut and partly fills...|$|R

5|$|Just before dawn, Howard summoned his platoon {{commanders to}} a meeting. With their senior {{officers}} dead or wounded, numbers One, Two and Three Platoons were now commanded by corporals. Howard's second in command, Captain Priday and number Four Platoon were missing. Only Lieutenants Fox and Sweeney in Five and Six Platoons {{had a full}} complement of officers and NCOs. The landings at Sword began at 07:00, preceded by a heavy naval bombardment. At the bridges, daylight allowed German snipers to identify targets and anyone moving in the open was in danger of being shot. The men of number One Platoon who had taken over the 75mm anti-tank gun on the east bank of the canal used it to engage possible sniper positions in Bénouville, the Château de Bénouville and the surrounding area. At 09:00, two German gunboats approached the canal bridge from Ouistreham. The lead boat fired its 20mm gun and number Two Platoon returned fire with a PIAT, hitting the wheelhouse of the leading boat, which crashed into the <b>canal</b> <b>bank.</b> The second boat retreated to Ouistreham. A lone German aircraft bombed the canal bridge at 10:00, dropping one bomb. The bomb struck the bridge but failed to detonate.|$|E
5|$|All nine gliders {{carrying}} the troops assigned to Group Steel landed {{next to the}} bridge at Veldwezelt at 05:20, the barbed-wire wrapped around the landing skids of the gliders succeeding in rapidly bringing them to a halt. The glider belonging to Leutnant Altmann had landed {{some distance from the}} bridge, and a second had landed directly in front of a Belgian pillbox, which began engaging both groups of airborne troops with small-arms fire. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the troops from the second glider hurled grenades at the pillbox whilst one of his men laid an explosive charge at the door and detonated it, allowing the bunker to be assaulted and removed as an obstacle. Simultaneously, Altmann gathered his troops and led them along a ditch running parallel to the bridge until two men were able to reach the <b>canal</b> <b>bank</b> and climb onto the girders of the bridge and disconnect the demolition charges placed there by the Belgian garrison. Thus the airborne troops prevented the Belgians from destroying the bridge, though they still faced the rest of the Belgian defenders. The defenders held on until a platoon of German reinforcements arrived and forced them to retire to a nearby village. However, the assaulting force's small-arms fire could not overcome two field-guns located five hundred metres from the bridge, thus forcing Altmann to call for air support. Several Junkers Ju 87 Stukas responded and knocked out the guns. Group Steel was to be relieved by 14:30, but Belgian resistance delayed their arrival in strength until 21:30. During the fighting, the attacking force left eight airborne troops dead and thirty wounded.|$|E
5|$|The 47th Division {{planned to}} attack with two brigades, each {{reinforced}} by a battalion from the reserve brigade, along {{either side of}} the Ypres–Comines Canal. Large numbers of machine-guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry. An observation balloon was reserved for messages by signal lamp from the front line, as insurance against the failure of telephone lines and message-runners. The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade, where it was too close for the artillery to shell without endangering British troops. Wire-cutting began in mid-May, against considerable local retaliation by German artillery. At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at Steenvoorde, on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked, using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine-gun posts and hidden barbed wire. Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters. The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached, was to occupy White Château and the adjacent part of , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the spoil heaps and the <b>canal</b> <b>bank</b> to the left. On 1 June, the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench-destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 to 6 June.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} for 137th Brigade {{to capture the}} {{crossings}} and advance {{as far as the}} ‘Brown Line’, after which 138th and 139th brigades would pass through and continue to the ‘Yellow’ and ‘Green Lines’. At 05.50 the Staffords set off, with almost a mile to go before they reached the canal, following a fast-moving rolling barrage of field guns and machine-guns firing overhead. The canal defences had mostly been destroyed by the heavy artillery, which maintained fire until the last possible moment. The Staffords quickly stormed the outposts and the western trench line, and reached the <b>canal</b> <b>bank</b> on time, with few casualties, and having already taken 120 prisoners. There were 1000 German dead in the trenches, mainly from MG bullets. German reports after the battle complained that their ‘SOS barrage’ was late, but in fact it came down only five minutes after Zero – indiscriminately on British and Germans alike – yet the Staffords were advancing faster than anyone had predicted. The leading parties went over the canal with their improvised kit and by a single plank bridge left by the Germans. The mist protected the attackers from enfilade fire by MGs along the canal, and they seized the Bellenglise tunnel galleries, trapping hundreds of Germans inside.|$|E
