5|$|Transition-minimized {{differential}} signaling (TMDS) on HDMI interleaves video, {{audio and}} auxiliary data using three different packet types, called the Video Data Period, the Data Island Period and the <b>Control</b> <b>Period.</b> During the Video Data Period, the pixels {{of an active}} video line are transmitted. During the Data Island period (which occurs during the horizontal and vertical blanking intervals), audio and auxiliary data are transmitted within a series of packets. The <b>Control</b> <b>Period</b> occurs between Video and Data Island periods.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the <b>Control</b> <b>Period.</b> HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E

25|$|The mirror test allows {{scientists}} {{to determine whether}} birds are conscious of themselves and able to distinguish themselves from other animals by determining whether they possess or lack the ability to recognize themselves in their own reflections. European magpies are the only animals beside mammals that {{have been shown to}} be able to pass this test by trying to remove colored stickers from underneath their beaks when shown in a mirror. However, in 1981, Epstein, Lanza and Skinner published a paper in the journal Science in which they argued that pigeons also pass the mirror test. A pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it which it then turned to peck—food was the consequence of a correct choice (i.e., the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment). Next, the bird was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. This was done without a mirror. Then a small bib was placed on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A <b>control</b> <b>period</b> without the mirror yielded no pecking at the dot. But when the mirror was shown, the pigeon became active, looked into it and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2011, Peter Dearman of Network Rail {{suggested}} that the third-rail network {{will need to be}} converted into overhead lines. He stated, [...] "Although the top speed is 100 mph, the trains cannot go over 80 mph well and 25% of power is lost from heat". Agreeing that conversion would be expensive, he said that the third rail network is at the limit of its power capability, especially as trains become more advanced in technology. The July 2012 Department for Transport High Level Output Specification for Network Rail <b>Control</b> <b>Period</b> 5 includes the conversion of the South Western Main Line between [...] and [...] from 750 V DC third rail to 25 kV AC overhead as part of a scheme to improve rail freight capacity from Southampton Port.

2500|$|Pigeons {{are capable}} of passing a highly {{modified}} mirror test, but only after extensive training. In the experiment, a pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it, which the pigeon then turned to peck to obtain food. [...] Thus, the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment. Next, the pigeon was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. The latter training was accomplished {{in the absence of}} the mirror. The final test was placing a small bib on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A <b>control</b> <b>period</b> without the mirror present yielded no pecking at the dot. When the mirror was revealed, the pigeon became active, looked in the mirror and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib. However, untrained pigeons have never passed the mirror test.|$|E

40|$|Spacecraft {{equipped}} with a Reaction Control System (RCS) for attitude control typically utilize a "bang-off-bang" control algorithm for rotational maneuvers.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the differences in epidemiological and clinical manifestations of breast cancer during the war in Croatia and in peacetime. 660 consecutive patients were recorded (656 female and 4 male patients) from Po`e{ko -Slavonska County. The changes in histopathological features were recorded in war period (1991 – 1995, 156 patients) and through two <b>control</b> <b>periods,</b> before the war (1981 – 1990, 282 patients) and after the war (1995 – 2000, first five months, 223 patients). The relative predictive value was calculated using 2 -test. The survival was calculated according to Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival. The histopathological analysis showed an equal distribution of noninvasive cancer (in situ cancer) across periods. In the war period, the level of the most common invasive cancer, ductal breast cancer, was lower (57. 7 %), compared to <b>control</b> <b>periods</b> (71. 2 % : 63. 7 % : 68. 2 %). Opposite to that, invasive lobular cancer was more common in the war period (3. 2 %), compared to <b>control</b> <b>periods</b> (0. 7 %– 1. 3 %). Furthermore, mixed cancer was also increased in the war period (7. 1 %) compared to <b>control</b> <b>periods</b> (0. 7 %– 2. 2 %), as was medullar cancer (10. 9 % vs. 5. 5 %– 5. 9 %).
