Bot canker of oak kills trees in natural forests {{as well as}} in <b>cork</b> <b>plantations.</b> The <b>cork</b> industry in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Morocco has been dealing with declining oaks for several years from biotic and abiotic factors. [...] This disease has been seen in many <b>cork</b> <b>plantations</b> and is the most important contributor to the decline in the cork industry.When cork is harvested from the trees, the cork cambium is exposed creating a wound for the fungus to enter the trunk, and cause disease. Infection of other oaks is most likely through wounds, also. These wounds may be natural wounds, but there is evidence insect damage is involved, especially in coast live oak in California. [...] Botryosphaeria corticola infects the twigs, branches and stems of oaks and degrades the cambial tissues. With the degradation of vascular tissues the trees display wilting and dieback symptoms.|$|R
40|$|Available at SciVerse ScienceDirectCork oak stands {{are a part}} of the {{agroforestry}} ecosystem in Portugal, {{characterized by}} a low crown cover from cork oak trees, managed towards cork production, and sometimes in combination with grazing. In recent years, European Union policies gave impetus to a large area of new <b>cork</b> oak <b>plantations,</b> which have been established mainly for cork production purposes, and consequently with higher stand density than traditional agroforestry systems. These plantations are important not only for cork production but also for the carbon sequestered by these slow growing forests that won't be harvested for wood production. Thinning operations will be needed to avoid excessive inter-tree competition and wood extracted from these thinning may also provide income for the owners. In the present study, carbon sequestered and wood volumes resulting from thinning were estimated for the next 70 years. Three scenarios of different annual afforestation rates and different site indexes were tested. The resulting values for the considered scenarios show that, if the plantation rates are maintained, new <b>cork</b> oak <b>plantations</b> will have an important contribution to the Portuguese commitments to providing CO 2 offsets under the Kyoto protocol. Additionally, due to the increasing values of initial density in new <b>cork</b> <b>plantations,</b> <b>cork</b> oak forests will produce a significant volume of wood that may become an important contribution to the landowners' incom...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is to present sorne of the studies currently being carried out in Spain and Portugal which {{are concerned with the}} possibility of estimating the amount of carbon flxed by two of the main oak species in the lberian Peninsula; rebollo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) and cork oak (Quercus suber L.). Three different methodological approaches have been used. The first approach is to use growth models to evaluate the carbon sequestration in both cork and wood over the life of a <b>cork</b> oak <b>plantation.</b> This approach has been applied both for Spain and Portugal. The second approach involves using a yield table as a tool to estímate the carbon sequestration in Quercus pyrenaica forests based on Spanish National Forest lnventories. In a third approach, data from a network of plots is used to estímate the carbon sequestration in pure and mixed Quercus pyrenaica forests. The application of these different methodologies would allow us to forecast and improve the carbon sequestration in lberian oak forests as well as increase our understanding of their dynamics.

5000|$|Oak for cork: are {{trees with}} a slow growth, but long life, are {{cultivated}} in warm hill areas (min. temp. > -5°Celsius) in all the west area of Mediterranean shores. Cork is popular as a material for bulletin boards. Even if the production as stoppers for wine bottles is diminishing in favor of nylon stoppers, in the sake of energy saving granules of cork can be mixed into concrete. These composites have low thermal conductivity, low density and good energy absorption (earthquake resistant). Some of the property ranges of the composites are density (400-1500 kg/m³), compressive strength (1-26 MPa) and flexural strength (0.5-4.0 MPa). Because of this cork {{can be used as}} thermal isolation in buildings (as well in its natural form and as a mixture), useful also as sound insulation. In the shoe industry cork is used for soles and insoles. In the world there are 20,000 km² of <b>cork</b> oak <b>plantations,</b> and every year are extracted around 300,000 tons of cork, 50% in Portugal, 15,000 in Italy (12,000 in the island of Sardinia). The advantage of this natural industry is that the extraction of cork from layers outer to the cortex does not kills the tree.|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Florestal e dos Recursos Naturais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaSince {{mortality}} rates observed in new <b>cork</b> oak <b>plantations</b> are relevant for future productivity, {{it is important}} to be able to find out the locations where cork oak finds best conditions for development. As these conditions are related to edaphic, soil and climate local parameters, this work aims at modeling the proportion of dead trees in young <b>plantations</b> of <b>cork</b> oak, using a set of permanent plots established in different regions of Portugal (Coruche, Évora, Ponte de Sor and Castelo Branco). Three logistic regression models that allow the prediction of the proportion of dead trees (%) as a function of soil and/or climate variables were fitted, their difference lying in the need of opening a soil profile and the capacity to determine the presence of a waterproof layer were adjusted. The resulting parameters showed a reduction of dead tree proportion in stands when higher the site index, higher soil depth and in the presence of medium soil textures. The increase of the proportion of dead trees with the increase of medium annual temperature and in the presence of a waterproof layer was also demonstrated. The adjusted models will be included in the SUBER growth and yield model...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects on}} soil of {{different}} environmental strategies used for recovering a forest degraded area, located in south Sardinia (CA, Pula, Pixinamanna), at risk desertification, were assessed. The main characteristic of {{areas of study}} are: no managed area; self restoration; recent stone pine and <b>cork</b> oak <b>plantation</b> in areas affected by forest fire; reforestation of pine thinned. The assessment of capabilities of soils was carried out through the approach known as Landscape Function Analysis (LFA), based {{on the study of}} areas of accumulation of nutrients (patch) and areas with no nutrients accumulation (interpatch). Texture, bulck density, organic C, active C, total N, phosphates, pH, CSC and exchangeable cations were also determined. Both LFA indices and chemical indicators showed lower values in the burnt area. Self restoration area compared with Pinus sp. planted area showed lower but not statistically different LFA indices and higher accumulation of total N, organic C, active C, phosphates and exchangeable Ca. Comparing patch and interpatch LFA indices, the results showed significant statistically differences. The other physico-chemical indicators did not revealed differences from patch and interpatch. All LFA indices were correlated and with physico-chemical. While they were negatively correlated with bulk density. In conclusion, the integration of the two methods provides useful information to monitoring the soil status in different management areas...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado Mediterranean Forestry and Natural Resources Management (MEDfOR) - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - ULCork oak (Quercus suber L.) {{represents}} {{a crucial role}} on montado ecosystem. This work will contribute {{for the improvement of}} the SUBER model, a growth and yield model developed for cork oak stands in Portugal. In order for the SUBER model to allow the simulation of new stands, it requires the simulation of the model tree state variables. During the first years of tree growth the state variable used by the model is the tree total height. The purpose of this thesis is the modelling of the total heights distributions of young <b>cork</b> oaks <b>plantations.</b> For that, it uses tree measurements taken in 42 plots distributed throughout Portugal with ages between 6 and 22 years old. Following partial objectives were fulfilled: 1) selecting the best probability density function (pdf) to simulate total height distribution; 2) modelling the parameters recovery of the pdf selected, using stand and edaphoclimatic variables as input; 3) validation of the proposed framework, to estimate the total height distributions using the Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic. The results show: 1) the Johnson’s distribution was the best pdf; 2) the mean height, the standard deviation, the skewness and kurtosis were the moments and function of moments used in the parameter recovery; 3) the use of stand and edaphoclimatic variables in the proposed models allows to predict total mean height, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis with model efficiency values of 0. 91, 0. 61, 0. 35 and 0. 21, respectively; 4) 66 % of the simulated height distributions followed the real distribution according to the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test. The general behavior of the simulated Johnson’s distribution is acceptable to predict the total height distributions of new stands in SUBER model. N/...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{significant}} {{forestry activities}} {{have taken place}} in Sardinia thanks to EU Regulation 2080 / 92 funds. Some 80 % of the afforestated surface has been planted with holm oak and cork oak. The latter also characterizes 89 % of the reforestation area. Given the funding source, plantations have been established on farmlands. Growth performances of these recent cork oak stands have been quantitatively evaluated and compared with the performances of two experimental plots. In Gallura (north-east of Sardinia), that is the traditional cork production area and still is economically the most important cork district of the island, these new <b>cork</b> oak <b>plantations</b> have an average size of 28 ha. They have been established on lands that, before plantation, were either pastures (30 %) or arable lands (70 %). Plantation failures are limited to 8. 8 % of the total (in term of mass) and seem independent of environmental factors or plantations species composition (conifers have been frequently used as secondary species). Average growth of the stem, measured above cork at collar height, is in the range 4 to 8 mm/year with a mean value of 5. 5 mm/year. No correlation appears with either environmental conditions or species composition of the plantations. In the first experimental plot, soil management practices (natural vegetation removal vs its cutting and mulching) does not differentiate young plants growth trends. In the control subplots (no removal) stem collar diameter is 20 % smaller. Localized manual hoeing around trunk base increased the diameters by 13 % but reduced cork thickness by 21 %. The second experimental plot allows comparisons among 27 Mediterranean proveniences of cork oak. The trial exhibits reduced genetic influence: diameters and heights growth are significantly different only among extreme groups. In conclusion, reduced growth performances of the plantations established in farmlands is due, to some extent, to the limitations inherent with private land management (constrained to costs minimization) and, on the other hand, to the generally very limited thickness of Gallura soils. Demand for good quality commercial cork is steadily raising. To sustain the request, in the short term, it would be necessary to extend financial support for plantations care, from 5 to 10 years, or even up to the first stripping (virgin cork) ...|$|R
