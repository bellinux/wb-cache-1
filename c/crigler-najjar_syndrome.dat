40|$|SuMMARY The {{families}} of three patients with Crigler-Najjar hyperbilirubinaemia, type 2, whose plasma bilirubin levels {{had responded to}} phenobarbitone treatment, were investigated. All the parents and several relatives had mildly raised bilirubin levels. It is suggested that this condition may {{be an example of}} genetic heterogeneity and that the propositi had inherited two different abnormal genes. The separation of the Gilbert and type 2 <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndromes</b> is at present arbitrary. Patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia not due to haemolysis or to acquired disease have been divided into three types. Those patients with only mildly raised plasma levels, usually less than 5 mg per 100 ml, are the commonest, and are said to have Gilbert's syndrome. Those with plasma levels greater than 5 mg per 100 ml have been placed in two groups (Arias, Gartner, Cohen, Ben Ezzer, and Levi, 1969). Type 1 patients are rare an...|$|R
40|$|Uncontrolled cell {{proliferation}} is the hall mark of many cancers, and is typically manifested by a {{deregulation of the}} cell-division cycle. CDKs play critical roles in regulating cell cycle, apop- tosis and cell differentiation. AG- 024322 is a multitargeted CDK inhibitor that {{has been shown to}} induce cancer cell apoptosis and de- monstrate significant antitumor activity in hu-man tumor xenograft models. This compound is under clinical development as an intravenous anticancer agent. AG- 024322 exhibited moder-ate to high systemic clearance across preclini-cal species. In vitro metabolism in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes demonstrates that glucuronidation and oxidation represent the major metabolic pathways of AG- 024322. The experiments of chemical inhibition and micro-somes containing individual CYP or UGT iso-forms revealed that CYP 3 A and UGT 1 A 1 appear to predominantly mediate AG- 024322 oxidation and glucuronidation, respectively. Formation kinetics of the two pathways in human liver mi-crosomes suggested that the glucuronidation activity of AG- 024322 was approximately 3 -fold higher as compared to CYP-mediated oxidation, contributing approximately 37 % and 13 % of the total clearance, respectively, based on the pro-jected human clearance. UGT 1 A 1 is a poly-morphic isoform involved in glucuronidation of bilirubin. It is of concern if glucuronidation via UGT 1 A 1 {{plays a major role in}} the elimination of AG- 024322 in humans as competitive inhibition of UGT 1 A 1 has been associated with toxicity (Gilbert and <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndromes).</b> There-fore, this information was used to influence the clinical study design to only include subjects having constitutive expression of UGT 1 A 1 in the first human study, thereby decreasing the potential risk of toxicity to patients...|$|R
40|$|<b>Crigler-Najjar</b> (CN) <b>syndrome</b> is a {{recessive}} inherited disorder {{caused by}} deficiency of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1 A 1. This hepatic enzyme catalyzes the glucuronidation of bilirubin, an essential step in excretion into bile of this neurotoxic compound. As a result, CN patients suffer from severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and {{are at risk}} of bilirubin encephalopathy. Over the last decades ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy using viral and non-viral vectors has been used to correct hyperbilirubinemia in the relevant animal model for CN syndrome, the Gunn rat. Several of these approaches did result in long-term correction of serum bilirubin levels in this animal model. However, none have been translated into a clinical trial. In this review we will recapitulate the strategies used and discuss their suitability for clinical application in the near future. We will also address specific safety measures in the gene therapy protocol needed to prevent adverse effects such as bilirubin toxicity. Since CN seems an ideal model for other monogenetic inherited metabolic liver disorders, development of liver-directed gene-therapy has relevance beyond this rare diseas...|$|R

40|$|David G Levitt, 1  Michael D Levitt 2 1 Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2 Research Service, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, USAAbstract: Serum {{bilirubin}} {{measurements are}} commonly {{obtained for the}} evaluation of ill patients and to screen for liver disease in routine physical exams. An enormous research effort has identified the multiple mechanisms involved in the production and metabolism of conjugated (CB) and unconjugated bilirubin (UB). While the qualitative effects of these mechanisms are well understood, their expected quantitative influence on serum bilirubin homeostasis has received less attention. In this review, each of the steps involved in bilirubin production, metabolism, hepatic cell uptake, and excretion is quantitatively examined. We then attempt to predict the expected effect of normal and defective function on serum UB and CB levels in health and disease states including hemolysis, extra- and intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatocellular diseases (eg, cirrhosis, hepatitis), and various congenital defects in bilirubin conjugation and secretion (eg, Gilbert&# 39;s, Dubin–Johnson, <b>Crigler–Najjar,</b> Rotor <b>syndromes).</b> Novel aspects of this review include: 1) quantitative estimates of the free and total UB and CB in the plasma, hepatocyte, and bile; 2) detailed discussion of the important implications of the recently recognized role of the hepatic OATP transporters in the maintenance of CB homeostasis; 3) discussion {{of the differences between the}} standard diazo assay versus chromatographic measurement of CB and UB; 4) pharmacokinetic implications of the extremely high-affinity albumin binding of UB; 5) role of the enterohepatic circulation in physiologic jaundice of newborn and fasting hyperbilirubinemia; and 6) insights concerning the clinical interpretation of bilirubin measurements.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ex vivo liver {{gene therapy}} {{may be a}} future {{alternative}} to orthotopic liver transplantation {{for the treatment of}} some liver diseases. We previously described the transduction in suspension with lentiviral vectors and immediate hepatocyte transplantation (SLIT) protocol and its high transduction rate with normal human hepatocytes. We also reported SLIT efficiency in the animal model of <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> type 1 <b>syndrome</b> (CN- 1), the Gunn rat. Here, we evaluated SLIT efficiency with diseased human hepatocytes. METHODS: Hepatocytes of the liver from a 4 -year-old patient presenting CN- 1 were isolated. They were transduced with liver-specific lentiviral vectors expressing uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (hUGT 1 A 1) or green fluorescent protein, and then analyzed in vitro for transduction efficiency and hUGT 1 A 1 expression, or transplanted in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice to evaluate long-term survival of transplanted cells. RESULTS: More than 90 % of CN- 1 hepatocytes were transduced. Hepatocytes produced hUGT 1 A 1 protein after lentiviral transduction. After having been subjected to the SLIT, lentivirally transduced CN- 1 hepatocytes engrafted long term (up to 26 weeks posttransplantation) in recipient livers and expressed green fluorescent protein or hUGT 1 A 1 vector. CONCLUSION: The SLIT protocol allowed for a high transduction of CN- 1 hepatocytes and restoration of the expression of the deficient protein. Furthermore, long-term survival of lentivirally transduced CN- 1 hepatocytes in the liver of immunodeficient mice was demonstrated. This study is therefore an important step toward human application of lentiviral gene therapy...|$|R

50|$|More severe {{types of}} glucuronyl {{transferase}} {{disorders such as}} <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome</b> (types I and II) are much more severe, with 0-10% UGT1A1 activity, with sufferers at risk of brain damage in infancy (type I) and teenage years (type II).|$|E
50|$|The {{homozygous}} Gunn rat, which {{lacks the}} enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT), is an animal {{model for the}} study of <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Since only one enzyme is working improperly, gene therapy for Crigler-Najjar is a theoretical option which is being investigated.|$|E
50|$|Owens' {{research}} group has subsequently made multiple advancements regarding UGT enzyme biology. Her laboratory {{was the first}} to identify a genetic defect, in the gene UGT1A1, that leads to <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome.</b> <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a disorder that disrupts normal processing and excretion of bilirubin, leading to jaundice. Owens' {{research group}} also identified that UGT enzymes must be activated before they can detoxify foreign chemicals and that in some cases suppressing these enzymes could enhance the effects of therapeutic drugs. Owens' laboratory found that activity of UGT enzymes can be lessened by kinase inhibitors and that protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase enzymes can alter the enzyme specificity, likely contributing to their ability to detoxify a wide range of foreign chemicals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome,</b> type II is {{associated}} with other mutation(s) that lead to a reduced activity of the mutated UGT1A1 enzyme, which causes a hyperbilirubinemia with levels of total serum bilirubin from 6 to 20 mg/dL. In this case phenobarbital treatment helps to lower bilirubin lever by more than 30%.|$|E
50|$|About 5% of the {{population}} has Gilbert's syndrome, a mutation (or variation) in the UDP-glucuronyl-transferase promotor that manifests itself as jaundice when the individual is stressed (i.e. starves). Autosomal recessive knockouts of UDP-glucuronyl-transferase can lead to <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome</b> and elevations of unconjugated bilirubin. Defects in CMOAT (MRP2) results in Dubin-Johnson syndrome and elevations of conjugated bilirubin.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome</b> and Gilbert syndrome, routine liver {{function}} tests are normal, and hepatic histology usually is normal, too. No evidence for hemolysis is seen.

Prematurity results in higher levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome</b> or CNS {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} disorder {{affecting the}} metabolism of bilirubin, a chemical formed from {{the breakdown of the}} heme in red blood cells. The disorder results in a form of nonhemolytic jaundice, which results in high levels of unconjugated bilirubin and often leads to brain damage in infants. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.|$|E

He is best known for a collaboration with Ronald Davidson and Harold Nitowsky, which demonstrated random inactivation of one of the two X-chromosomes in mammalian female cells, a mechanism of dosage compensation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome,</b> type I is {{associated}} with mutation(s) that result in a complete absence of normal UGT1A1 enzyme, which causes a severe hyperbilirubinemia with levels of total serum bilirubin from 20 to 45 mg/dL. Phenobarbital treatment does not help to lower bilirubin level, because it only increases the amount of mutated UGT1A1 enzyme, which is still unable to catalyze the glucuronidation of bilirubin, which {{on the other hand}} makes phenobarbital treatment diagnostically relevant.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Charles Kenneth Gunn {{discovered}} a mutant rat in 1934 at the Connaught Laboratory in Toronto, Canada. These rats were jaundiced and the defect (a {{lack of the}} enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase) was transmitted as an autosomal recessive characteristic. Gunn, a geneticist, bred them at Connaught and later moved to Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada, to head up the Canadian Experimental Fox Ranch. This animal model has been extremely valuable {{for the development of}} experimental treatments for <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E

The children receiving {{treatment at the}} clinic are not exclusively Amish or Old Order Mennonites; about 15% of the children come from other backgrounds, including Africa, Asia, and South America. About 75% of the children seen by the clinic are considered treatable— Many, through techniques developed at the center. Of that 75%, one third are considered highly treatable. CSC staff are co-authors on nearly 100 scientific papers.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} several studies {{conducted}} on {{the potential benefits of}} using Amniotic epithelial cells {{in various parts of the}} body. One prospective use of these cells includes cellular therapies aimed at dropping inflammation and scarring. Models have shown that using these cells to reduce such inflammation has shown rewarding affects in the lungs and liver. More specifically, amniotic epithelial cells have been used in the past to treat genetic liver diseases such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia, and <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> These cells are being looked at by scientists as a new and more effiecient way to treat diseases of the liver particularly because of the problem arising from a lack of liver donors. Scientists are also working with genetically modified human amniotic epithelial cells in new experimental procedures and cellular therapies.|$|E
50|$|Glycosides {{resulting}} from glucuronidation are named β-D-glucuronides, its salts and esters are named glucuronates. The human body uses glucuronidation to make alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, mercaptans, {{primary and secondary}} aliphatic amines, and carbamates more water-soluble, and, in this way, allows for their subsequent elimination from the body through urine or faeces (via bile from the liver) at a significantly increased rate. The carboxyl group is ionized at physiological pH, making the conjugated compound water-soluble. Compounds with molecular masses > 60,000 are too large for renal excretion and will be excreted with bile into the intestine. Neonates are deficient in this conjugating system, making them particularly vulnerable to drugs such as chloramphenicol, which is inactivated {{by the addition of}} glucuronic acid, resulting in gray baby syndrome. Bilirubin is excreted in the bile as bilirubin diglucuronide (80%), bilirubin monoglucuronide (20%), and unconjugated bilirubin (< 1%). In the <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome</b> and the Gilbert syndrome, UDPGT activity is reduced or nearly absent due to mutations, resulting in jaundice.|$|E
50|$|Pre-hepaticular {{jaundice}} {{is caused}} by anything which causes an increased rate of hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells). Unconjugated bilirubin comes from {{the breakdown of the}} heme pigment found in red blood cells' hemoglobin. The increased breakdown of red blood cells leads to an increase in the amount of unconjugated bilirubin present in the blood and deposition of this unconjugated bilirubin into various tissues can lead to a jaundiced appearance. In tropical countries, severe malaria can cause jaundice in this manner. Certain genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, spherocytosis, thalassemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can lead to increased red cell lysis and therefore hemolytic jaundice. Commonly, diseases of the kidney, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, can also lead to coloration. Defects in bilirubin metabolism also leads to jaundice, as in Gilbert's syndrome (a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism which can result in mild jaundice, which is found in about 5% of the population) and <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Type I and II.|$|E
5000|$|Cholestasis means [...] "the slowing or {{stopping}} of bile flow" [...] {{which can}} be caused by any number of diseases of the liver (which produces the bile), the gallbladder (which stores the bile), or biliary tract (also known as the biliary tree, the conduit that allows the bile to leave the liver and gallbladder and enter the small intestine). When this occurs, conjugated bilirubin and the waste products that usually would be cleared in bile reflux back into the bloodstream. This causes a primarily conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice; the liver conjugates the bile to make it water-soluble and because the bile has already been processed by the liver, when it gets backed up because of a blockage and is refluxed into the blood, the blood will have high levels of conjugated bilirubin. This is in contrast to primarily unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia which is the water-insoluble form that is bound to serum albumin; the liver has not had a chance to conjugate the bilirubin yet and can be caused either because too much unconjugated bilirubin is made (such as in massive hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis) or because too little is conjugated (Gilbert's disease or <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome).</b> Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia does not typically cause pruritus.|$|E
30|$|The {{blue light}} {{phototherapy}} for the <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome</b> is less effective in grownup patients, as {{the blue light}} penetration through the skin is diminishing with ageing of the patient. Thus, {{there is a need}} for alternative approach to treatment of <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We propose to utilize the RRM approach to design peptides that would have only the established characteristic frequency related to bilirubin metabolism. Such peptide potentially can have UDP activity and thus can be used in treatment of <b>Crigler-Najjar</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
