25|$|Ras is {{a family}} of related {{proteins}} which is expressed in all animal cell lineages and organs. All Ras protein family members belong to a class of protein called small GTPase, and are involved in transmitting signals within cells (<b>cellular</b> <b>signal</b> transduction). Ras is the prototypical member of the Ras superfamily of proteins, which are all related in 3D structure and regulate diverse cell behaviours.|$|E
25|$|The iPhone 4 {{received}} generally positive reception, with critics praising its revamped {{design and}} more powerful hardware in comparison to previous models. While it was a market success, with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours, {{the release of the}} iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports that abnormalities in its new antenna design caused the device to lose its <b>cellular</b> <b>signal</b> if held in a certain way. Most human contact with the phone's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength.|$|E
25|$|The female {{determinant}} is a small, extracellular molecule, {{expressed in}} the stigma; {{the identity of the}} male determinant remains elusive, but it is probably some cell membrane receptor. The interaction between male and female determinants transmits a <b>cellular</b> <b>signal</b> into the pollen tube, resulting in strong influx of calcium cations; this interferes with the intracellular concentration gradient of calcium ions which exists inside the pollen tube, essential for its elongation. The influx of calcium ions arrests tube elongation within 1–2 minutes. At this stage, pollen inhibition is still reversible, and elongation can be resumed by applying certain manipulations, resulting in ovule fertilization.|$|E

40|$|The {{herpesvirus}} {{life cycle}} has two distinct phases: latency and lytic replication. The balance {{between these two}} phases is critical for viral pathogenesis. It is believed that <b>cellular</b> <b>signals</b> regulate the switch from latency to lytic replication. To systematically evaluate the <b>cellular</b> <b>signals</b> regulating this reactivation process in Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus, the effects of 26, 000 full-length cDNA expression constructs on viral reactivation were individually assessed in primary effusion lymphoma–derived cells that harbor the latent virus. A group of diverse <b>cellular</b> <b>signaling</b> proteins were identified and validated in their effect of inducing viral lytic gene expression from the latent viral genome. The results suggest that multiple <b>cellular</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways can reactivate the virus in a genetically homogeneous cell population. Further analysis revealed that the Raf/MEK/ERK/Ets- 1 pathway mediates Ras-induced reactivation. The same pathway also mediates spontaneous reactivation, which sets the first example to our knowledge of a specific cellular pathway being studied in the spontaneous reactivation process. Our study provides a functional genomic approach to systematically identify the <b>cellular</b> <b>signals</b> regulating the herpesvirus life cycle, thu...|$|R
