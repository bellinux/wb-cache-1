For the investigated furnace, energy balance calculations were performed for the currently operating status as well as following replacement of burners for modern devices with better parameters of combustion and recuperation, which showed {{a significant reduction in}} fuel consumption. The burners ensure uniform temperature distribution along the radiant tube, stable operation, high energy efficiency (also in high temperature furnaces) and low emissions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The term cold-drawing of tubes {{refers to}} forming {{when the final}} {{material}} (a tube) is formed in a pipe bell and its vertical cross-section is smaller, the tube wall is thinner or thicker and its length is greater. Steel is most commonly the final material. The forming proceeds in a few draws which depend on the final tube dimension. The selection of relative reduction for particular diameters {{plays an important role}} because an unbalanced reduction causes stress, and therefore also deformation or cracks during drawing. For <b>cold-drawn</b> <b>tubes</b> occurs to the deformation of hardening. In the technological process has an important role in recrystallization. In the paper we evaluate the microstructure of drawn tubes in the longitudinal direction between operating without recrystallization annealing. In the paper we evaluate the microstructure of drawn tubes in the longitudinal direction without interoperation recrystallization annealing- orientation of grain boundaries...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{influence}} of ultrasounds on the mechanical properties of OLT 35 carbon steel <b>tubes</b> <b>cold-drawn</b> on a plug ultrasonically activated by longitudinal waves. Experimental results indicate that: 1. The reduction in the values of the flow limit and tensile strength is proportional to the increase in acoustic energy introduced into the material subjected to deformation. 2. The diminution in influence of ultrasounds on tensile strength and flow rate that is due to an increased degree of deformation is explained by a reduction in specific density of the acoustic energy at the focus of deformation. 3. The relations calculated {{on the basis of the}} variation in the flow limit and tensile strength as a function of acoustic energy intensity was verified experimentally...|$|R
