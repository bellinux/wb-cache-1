McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although {{the great majority of}} Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic <b>communities</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> with strong support from many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{before and}} {{continuing}} into {{the time of}} the dissolution of the Soviet Union, waves of Armenians from the Republic of Armenia and other former Soviet republics arrived for political reasons and economic opportunities, settling in older established Armenian <b>communities</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> The 1988 Armenian earthquake and the energy crisis in Armenia during the Nagorno-Karabakh War caused an estimated number of 700,000 Armenians to leave the country, most of whom ended up in Russia, still others in the US, and some in Europe. Annually, on average 2,000 people from Armenia migrated to the US since 1994, not including ethnic Armenians from Middle Eastern countries. According to the 2000 US Census, there were 65,280 Armenian-born people in the US: 57,482 in California, 1,981 in New York and 1,155 in Massachusetts. According to the 2011 American Community Survey, there were 85,150 Armenian-born people in the US, about 20,000 more than in 2000. According to the US embassy in Yerevan, about 21,000 citizens of the Republic of Armenia have moved to the US for permanent residency in the period from 1995 to 2012. Meanwhile, Armenian immigration from the Middle East continues, contributing to California's distinction of having, by far, the highest Armenian American population of any state.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{polls showed}} {{opposition}} to Truman's civil rights efforts. They likely cost him some support in his 1948 reelection bid against Thomas Dewey. Although he narrowly won, Michael Gardner believes that his continued championing {{of civil rights}} as federal priority cost him much support, especially in the Solid South. White Democrats had long exercised outsize political power in Congress, having disfranchised most blacks there {{since the turn of}} the twentieth century, but benefiting by apportionment based on total population. Truman's efforts threatened other changes, since numerous <b>communities</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> had restrictive covenants that were racially discriminatory. Because of his low approval ratings and a bad showing in early primaries, President Truman chose not to seek re-election in 1952, though he could have done so.

25|$|Prior to World War II, {{there were}} 3,500,000 Jews in Poland, living {{predominantly}} in the cities; about 10% {{of the general}} population. Database of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews provides information on 1,926 Jewish <b>communities</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Following the conquest of Poland, and the 1939 murder of intelligentsia, the first German anti-Jewish measures involved the policy of expulsion of Jews from the territories annexed by the Third Reich. The westernmost provinces of Greater Poland and Pomerelia were turned into brand new German Reichsgaue named Danzig-West Prussia and the Wartheland, {{with the intention of}} their complete Germanization through settler colonialism (Lebensraum). Annexed directly to the new Warthegau district, the city of Łódź absorbed the influx of some 40,000 Polish Jews forced out from the surrounding areas. A total of 204,000 Jewish people passed through the ghetto in Łódź. Initially, they were to be expelled to the Generalgouvernement. However, the ultimate destination of the massive removal of Jews was left open until the Final Solution was set in motion two years later.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression in the United States {{hurt the}} Polish American <b>communities</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> as heavy {{industry}} and mining sharply cut employment. During the prosperous 1920s, the predominantly Polish Hamtramck neighborhood suffered {{from an economic}} slowdown in the manufacturing sector of Detroit. The Hamtramck neighborhood was in disrepair, with poor public sanitation, high poverty, rampant tuberculosis, and overcrowding, and {{at the height of}} the Depression in 1932, nearly 50% of all Polish Americans were unemployed. Those who continued to work in the nearby Dodge main plant, where a majority of workers were Polish, faced intolerable conditions, poor wages, and were demanded to speed up production beyond reasonable levels. As the industrial trades Polish Americans worked in became less financially stable, an influx of Blacks and poor southern Whites into Detroit and Hamtramck exacerbated the job market and competed directly with Poles for low-paying jobs. Corporations benefited from the interracial strife and routinely hired Blacks as strikebreakers against the predominantly Polish-American trade unions. The Ford Motor Company used Black strikebreakers in 1939 and 1940 to counter strikes by the United Auto Workers, which had a predominantly Polish-American membership. The mainly Polish UAW membership and pro-Ford Black loyalists fought at the gates of the plant, often in violent clashes. Tensions with blacks in Detroit was heightened by the construction of a federally funded housing project, the Sojourner Truth houses, near the Polish community in 1942. Polish Americans lobbied against the houses, but their political sway was ineffective. Racial tensions finally exploded in the race riot of 1943.|$|E

[...] However, the locus of the celebrations is the national capital, Ottawa, Ontario, where large concerts and cultural displays are held on Parliament Hill, with the governor general and prime minister typically officiating, though the monarch or another member of the Royal Family may also attend or take the governor general's place. Smaller events are mounted in other parks around the city and in Gatineau, Quebec.|$|E
