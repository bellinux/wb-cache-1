50|$|In South America, {{besides the}} Amazon Basin, the Guianas and the Guiana Shield, the <b>cocoa</b> <b>thrush</b> ranges into two areas.|$|E
50|$|The song is {{a musical}} warble, slower and lower pitched {{than that of}} the <b>cocoa</b> <b>thrush</b> (T. fumigatus), and it also {{produces}} a cat-like queeoow call and, when uncomfortable, emits a kereel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cocoa</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus fumigatus) is a {{resident}} breeding bird in South America from eastern Colombia {{south and east}} to central and eastern Brazil, and on Trinidad {{and some of the}} Lesser Antilles.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cocoa</b> <b>thrush's</b> range {{covers the}} {{downstream}} {{eastern half of}} the Amazon Basin; in the northeast Basin, it is in Pará and Amapá state with the Guianas. In the southeast Basin, it is in the Tapajos River and Xingu River drainages; also two thirds of the adjacent river system, the lower Araguaia - Tocantins River drainage.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cocoa</b> <b>thrush</b> mainly {{feeds on}} or near the ground on insects, {{especially}} ants, other invertebrates and some berries. It is a shy species, but on Trinidad it is much tamer, and will come to feeders. The song is a musical warble, and it also produces a variety of typical thrush chuck and chak calls.|$|E
50|$|The {{habitat of}} this large thrush is dense forest. The nest is a lined bulky cup of twigs low {{in a tree}} or treefern. Two to three reddish-blotched greenish-blue eggs are laid and {{incubated}} by the female for about 13 days to hatching. The young then fledge in another 13-15 days. The <b>cocoa</b> <b>thrush</b> is 22-24 cm long. It is dark rufous brown above and paler rufous brown below. There are five poorly defined races, differing mainly in {{the brightness of the}} plumage. Sexes are similar, but young birds are duller, having the scalloped underparts common in immature thrushes.|$|E
5000|$|Villa-Lobos {{emphasizes}} {{the beginning of}} the recapitulation in the first movement with a sudden change of register of the accompanying triplets. At bar 153 (rehearsal-number 12), over an augmentation of the first cyclic theme, he introduces {{for the first time a}} figuration evoking the call of a Brazilian bird called sabiá da mata (English name: <b>cocoa</b> <b>thrush).</b> This call occurs in several of Villa-Lobos's later works, including the Fourth and Eighth String Quartets, but most notably in the second movement (Dança: Martelo) of the Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5, where text by Manuel Bandeira names the bird. This is the only moment in this quartet where there is any hint of nationalism [...]|$|E
