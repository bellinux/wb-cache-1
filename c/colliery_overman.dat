5000|$|The <b>colliery</b> <b>overman,</b> John Greener, {{told the}} coroner {{that he had}} gone down the pit after the {{explosion}} and [...] "found the separation stoppings blown down, and the stables on fire". He penetrated up to 600 yd from the shaft before being overcome by foul air and forced to retreat and go home.|$|E
50|$|In 1814 the Hall Pit in Fatfield {{exploded}} {{with the}} loss of 32 lives. At 12:30 on Tuesday 28 September a fall of stone from the roof drove firedamp into contact with candles used by the miners for illumination. All the men below ground were killed, as was one of the four men in the shaft at the time. Contemporary reports refer to the survivors being affected by the afterdamp. Although the colliery was claimed (by, for instance, the <b>colliery</b> <b>overman)</b> to be safe and well worked, there had been three previous explosions of firedamp which had each killed three men.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, The Independent {{newspaper}} reported that {{officials from the}} UDM had advised ministers on how to cut miners' power - including attempting to weaken the National Association of <b>Colliery</b> <b>Overmen,</b> Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS).|$|R
50|$|The National Association of <b>Colliery</b> <b>Overmen,</b> Deputies and Shotfirers did not strike. Following some {{confrontations}} with NUM pickets, the National Coal Board adopted {{a policy of}} giving leave on full pay to any members of NACODS who faced aggressive intimidation {{on the way to}} work.|$|R
50|$|Born in the Rhondda, Walsh {{began working}} at a {{colliery}} and joined the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF) in 1904. In 1929, {{he was promoted to}} a more senior role at his workplace, and so left the SWMF, joining the National Association of <b>Colliery</b> <b>Overmen,</b> Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS).|$|R
50|$|The National Association of <b>Colliery</b> <b>Overmen,</b> Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) is an {{organisation}} representing former colliery deputies and under-officials in {{the coal}} industry. NACODS was established as a national trade union in 1910. Prior to that date, the union existed as a federation of autonomous areas which were collectively known as the General Federation of Firemen's, Examiners' and Deputies Association of Great Britain. The present title of NACODS was adopted in 1947 when the coal industry was nationalised.|$|R
25|$|No mining could legally be {{done without}} being overseen by an overman or deputy. Their union, the National Association of <b>Colliery</b> <b>Overmen,</b> Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) with 17,000 members in 1984, was less willing to take {{industrial}} action. Its constitution required a two-thirds majority for a national strike. During the 1972 strike, violent confrontations between striking NUM and non-striking NACODS members led to an agreement that NACODS members could stay off work without loss of pay if they were faced with aggressive picketing.|$|R
50|$|Although {{weakened}} by the strike, the NUM was still a significant force into the early 1990s. A major scheme of closures of deep mines was announced {{by the government in}} 1992. The NUM ran a national ballot on possible strike action, and this was passed by members. It worked with the National Association of <b>Colliery</b> <b>Overmen,</b> Deputies and Shotfirers to challenge the closures in the High Court; the court imposed an emergency injunction against the closures and the strike action was called off. However, from mid-1993, the mines started closing; the number of working miners and therefore also the membership of the union continued to fall.|$|R
5000|$|Crawford {{was active}} in the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives (NUBSO), and was elected as its President in 1944. [...] He became known as an expert on automation, and he led policy {{development}} on this across the entire trade union movement once {{he was elected to the}} General Council of the Trades Union Congress in 1949. [...] In 1950, he was appointed to the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and from 1955 served on the British Productivity Council. He joined the National Coal Board as a part-time member in 1956 then, the following year, resigned all his existing positions to become a full-time member, with special responsibility for industrial relations. His appointment was unpopular with the National Union of Mineworkers and the National Association of <b>Colliery</b> <b>Overmen,</b> Deputies and Shotfirers, who had hoped one of their own officials would win the role.|$|R
