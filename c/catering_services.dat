40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the association between}} accessibility of <b>catering</b> <b>service</b> venues and adolescents' alcohol use over the previous 30 days. The {{data were collected from}} cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2014, 2223 students at 27 high schools in Chaoyang and Xicheng districts, Beijing using self-administered questionnaires to collect the adolescents information on socio-demographic characteristics and recent alcohol experiences. The accessibility of, and proximity to, <b>catering</b> <b>service</b> venues were summarized by weights, which were calculated by multiplication of the type-weight and the distance-weight. All sampled schools were categorized into three subgroups (low, middle, and high geographic density) based on the tertile of nearby <b>catering</b> <b>service</b> venues, and a multi-level logistic regression analysis was performed to explore variance between the school levels. Considering the setting characteristics, the <b>catering</b> <b>service</b> venues weighted value was found to account for 8. 6 % of the school level variance of adolescent alcohol use. The odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of drinking over the past 30 -days among adolescents with medium and high accessibility of <b>catering</b> <b>service</b> venues were 1. 17 (0. 86, 1. 57) and 1. 47 (1. 06, 2. 02), respectively (p < 0. 001 for trend test).

Results suggest that the greater accessibility of <b>catering</b> <b>service</b> venues around schools is associated with a growing risk of recent drinking...|$|R
