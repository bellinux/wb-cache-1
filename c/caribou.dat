5|$|Several {{animal species}} inhabit Level Mountain, notably brown bears, wolves, long-tailed jaegers, <b>caribou,</b> {{mountain}} goats, ptarmigans, moose, long-tailed ducks and Stone sheep. Wolves occupy valleys {{and use the}} alpine areas for hunting and denning. Also common in the alpine are brown bears, which are potential predators of newborn <b>caribou</b> calves. The <b>caribou</b> at Level Mountain form a herd {{that is part of}} a larger population ranging west of the Dease River and north of the Stikine River into Yukon. More than 400 <b>caribou</b> were identified at Level Mountain in 1978, although the Ministry of Environment and Parks considered the herd to be declining due to poor recruitment. By 1980, the <b>caribou</b> population was estimated to have been roughly 350.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} walrus, bowhead whale, and <b>caribou</b> hunting are all real. Because the hunting season for <b>caribou,</b> polar bear, walrus, and whale {{occur at the}} same time, the {{production}} was forced {{to spend more than}} a year in the Arctic (covering two hunting seasons) {{in order to get the}} necessary footage.|$|E
5|$|Woodland <b>caribou</b> once {{inhabited}} the region but have disappeared due to predation by wolves, encroachment by deer, {{and the effects}} of a brainworm parasite carried by deer which is harmful to both <b>caribou</b> and moose populations. Very rare sightings have been reported in nearby areas.|$|E
5|$|Endangered {{species in}} Banff include the Banff Springs snail (Physella johnsoni) that {{is found in}} the hot springs of Banff, and the Woodland <b>caribou.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1989 two {{refurbished}} DHC-4 <b>Caribou,</b> {{a single}} Piper Aztec light twin and three IAI Arava STOL twins were delivered.|$|E
5|$|After being re-equipped with de Havilland Canada DHC-4 <b>Caribou</b> in 1964, No. 38 Squadron {{served as}} the RAAF's {{operational}} conversion unit for the type and also conducted transport tasks within Australia and its territories. Throughout Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, it prepared aircrew for operational service with No. 35 Squadron, and maintained a detachment in Papua and New Guinea to provide pilots with experience flying in tropical conditions. A <b>Caribou</b> was deployed to Pakistan from 1975 to 1978 to support United Nations peacekeepers, and detachments were established within Australia during the 1980s to provide search and rescue capabilities and work with Australian Army units. From 1999 until 2001, a detachment was deployed to East Timor {{as part of the}} Australian-led peacekeeping force in the newly independent nation. No. 38 Squadron continued to operate <b>Caribou</b> after No. 35 Squadron was disbanded in 2000, though the age of the aircraft increasingly affected its operations.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the <b>caribou</b> herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which <b>caribou</b> were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for <b>caribou</b> and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|In June 1962, the Atomic Energy Commission {{released}} its custody and {{ownership of the}} weapons to the Air Force. The personnel and property of the later named <b>Caribou</b> Air Force Station were absorbed into the adjacent Loring Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ecoregion}} remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} conservation challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of the trees {{that make up the}} forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain <b>caribou</b> and the Northern goshawk.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens are {{omnivorous}} {{and highly}} opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of <b>caribou</b> and ptarmigan carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of the <b>Caribou</b> from service in 2009, No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped with eight Beechcraft King Air 350 aircraft. The squadron is currently stationed at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland, and is responsible for training RAAF pilots to operate King Airs, and performing light transport tasks. It is also believed to have a ground surveillance capability.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his responsibilities as air support commander, Raw was also {{the commander of the}} RAAF units stationed at Vũng Tàu and the overall deputy commander of the RAAF force in South Vietnam. He regularly flew operational missions with the UH-1 Iroquois helicopter-equipped No. 9 Squadron as well as No. 35 Squadron, which operated DHC-4 <b>Caribou</b> tactical transports.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as <b>caribou,</b> martin, moose and <b>caribou</b> were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of large}} land mammals such as <b>caribou,</b> moose, deer, elk, have been declining {{dramatically}} since the reintroduction of wolves. Species almost entirely gone {{that were once}} common in the area include the white-tailed jackrabbit, pygmy short-horned lizard, band-tailed pigeon and passenger pigeon. After exploitation of the Kootenay basin by fur trappers, the beaver population was nearly exterminated as well.|$|E
5|$|Several {{animal species}} inhabit around the Itcha Range. Among them are cougars, wolves, grizzly bears, black bears, moose, mule deers, {{mountain}} goats, beavers, coyotes, red foxes, muskrats, martens, river otters, lynx and wolverines. Also present {{is the largest}} herd of woodland <b>caribou</b> in southern British Columbia, {{as well as the}} most northerly population of California bighorn sheep in North America.|$|E
5|$|Canada is home {{to about}} 52,000–60,000 wolves, whose legal status varies {{according}} to province and territory. First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In Alberta, wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist. Large-scale wolf population control through poisoning, trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government-mandated programs {{in order to support}} populations of endangered prey species such as woodland <b>caribou.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, but the RAAF regarded the <b>Caribou</b> as inadequate for the role and preferred a more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the omnivorous brown bear (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the Bluefish Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, <b>caribou,</b> wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E
5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} analysis, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and <b>caribou</b> specialists, and the other half were either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, {{but it is not clear}} if this was due to {{scavenging}} or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth was rare in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base. An extensive wild animal community once thrived {{in the area of}} Level Mountain. This included a wide range of animal species with <b>caribou</b> being the most abundant. Humans had arrived at Level Mountain by the early 1900s, followed by geological studies of the massif in the 1920s. This remote area of Cassiar Land District has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{was also}} home to many {{facilities}} that {{were a part of}} the base, or were nearby. <b>Caribou</b> Air Force Station was the weapons storage area that operated separately from Loring until it was absorbed in 1961. Caswell Air Force Station operated to the east, but had a unit associated with Loring before it became fully operational. On-base facilities included the Alert Area, which operated as a separate facility within Loring, due to crews being constantly stationed on alert. The Double Cantilever Hangar was the largest hangar at the facility, with the capacity to hold six parked B-52s, or five B-36s.|$|E
5|$|On 31March 1986, No.79 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Butterworth as a {{temporary}} measure to cover part of the period while the RAAF's three fighter squadrons were transitioning from MirageIIIs to F/A-18 Hornets. The squadron inherited all of No.3 Squadron's twelve MirageIII fighters {{and most of its}} personnel; the remainder of No.3 Squadron returned to Australia to be re-equipped with Hornets. As well as the Mirage IIIs, the squadron operated a single DHC-4 <b>Caribou</b> transport that was also based at Butterworth.|$|E
5|$|Beringia {{received}} more moisture and intermittent maritime cloud cover {{from the north}} Pacific Ocean {{than the rest of}} the Mammoth steppe, including the dry environments on either side of it. Moisture occurred along a north-south gradient with the south receiving the most cloud cover and moisture due to the airflow from the North Pacific. This moisture supported a shrub-tundra habitat that provided an ecological refugium for plants and animals. In this Beringian refugium, eastern Beringia's vegetation included isolated pockets of larch and spruce forests with birch and alder trees. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for Beringian wolves and their competitors. Steppe bison (Bison priscus), Yukon horse (Equus lambei), woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), and Wild yak (Bos mutus) consumed grasses, sedges, and herbaceous plants. <b>Caribou</b> (Rangifer tarandus) and woodland muskox (Symbos cavifrons) consumed tundra plants, including lichen, fungi, and mosses.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell began {{flying in}} Antarctica on 14January 1960, mapping {{sections}} of the continent claimed by Australia. The task was cut short on 3February, when the RAAF Antarctic Flight pressed his Beaver into service after three of its aircraft were lost in a blizzard at Mawson. De Havilland then assigned Cresswell to fly personnel and equipment for Australian Blue Metal in northern and central Australia. Between November 1960 and March 1961 {{he was involved in}} another Antarctic expedition, but in the end did little flying. De Havilland subsequently appointed Cresswell its sales representative in Canberra; in this capacity he travelled abroad and on one occasion flew the DHC-4 <b>Caribou,</b> shortly to be purchased by the RAAF for tactical transport in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the last}} glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} was dominated by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon, <b>caribou,</b> and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana as early as the Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and <b>caribou.</b>|$|E
5|$|In its new incarnation, No.79 Squadron {{continued}} the air defence and training duties for which No.3 Squadron had been responsible at Butterworth. It participated in routine training exercises in Southeast Asia, which included making regular deployments to Paya Lebar Air Base in Singapore to train with the Republic of Singapore Air Force. In May 1987 the squadron deployed to Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines {{to participate in}} the annual Cope Thunder exercise with USAF units. It also exercised with No. 77 Squadron's new F/A-18 Hornets in April 1988 when that unit visited Butterworth. The <b>Caribou</b> transport was used to support Australian Army units in Malaysia and also flew training sorties to neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Lasting {{impressions}} of the war experience are ever-prevalent on the island. In Canada, 1 July is celebrated as Canada Day, in recognition of Canadian confederation. In the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador the date is Memorial Day, in remembrance of the Newfoundland Regiment's losses at Beaumont-Hamel. Memorial University College, now Memorial University of Newfoundland, was originally established as a memorial to Newfoundlanders who {{had lost their lives}} in active service during the First World War. Lastly, the six <b>caribou</b> memorials and the National War Memorial erected following the First World War, and the establishment of the preserved battlefield park at Beaumont-Hamel which is visited by thousands of tourists a year. The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site also serves an informal ambassadorial function, educating visitors not only about the experience of the Newfoundland Regiment but also regarding the history of the island.|$|E
5|$|Lonely and needing {{someone to}} care for his {{children}} and help with the sewing and other chores, Mala takes the young girl Iva as his new wife. But Mala still longs for Aba, and their relationship is a cold one. The Eskimos go hunting <b>caribou</b> by stampeding the animals into a lake and then hunting them with bow and arrow and spears from boats. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after pouring out his grief through dance and prayer he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva softens dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala welcomed to the village the previous year returns to his village, and gives Kripik his wife in gratitude. The woman is {{more than happy to}} live with Mala, and Mala makes love to her as well.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{moved from}} Richmond to RAAF Base Amberley, west of Brisbane, in October 1992. At {{this time the}} {{squadron}} continued {{to be responsible for}} all <b>Caribou</b> conversion training, as well as conducting tactical transport operations. The permanent detachment of No. 38 Squadron aircraft to RAAF Base Pearce ceased in 1999, and Detachment B of the squadron was established at RAAF Base Townsville in North Queensland during 2000. From 1999 until early 2001, elements of No. 38 Squadron, designated No. 86 Wing Detachment C, were stationed in East Timor and supported the international peacekeeping force which had been deployed there to end the violence that had broken out following a successful referendum on independence conducted in August 1999. At its peak strength, four Caribous were assigned to the detachment. The air and ground crew deployed to East Timor endured difficult living conditions until their accommodation and recreation facilities were upgraded in mid-2000, and the pilots were regularly required to fly into poorly maintained air strips. Despite the age of the Caribous and shortages of spare parts, Detachment C's ground crew managed to maintain a high aircraft serviceability rate. In 2000 No. 35 Squadron was deactivated, leaving No. 38 Squadron the RAAF's sole <b>Caribou</b> operator. By September 2002, No. 38 Squadron was equipped with 14 Caribous. In July 2003, two aircraft were deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands peacekeeping force. Both Caribous were based at Honiara International Airport, and a detachment remained in the country until July 2004. All of No. 38 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Townsville during 2008.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron was re-equipped {{with new}} de Havilland Canada DHC-4 <b>Caribou</b> {{tactical}} transport aircraft during 1964. In January 1964 the unit's commanding officer, five other pilots and three navigators undertook conversion {{training on the}} type in Canada. At the completion of this course the personnel flew the RAAF's first three Caribous from Toronto to RAAF Base Richmond between 17 March and 22 April. The process of fully converting No. 38 Squadron to Caribous was delayed by the government's decision to deploy several of the aircraft to Vietnam; at the time this decision was made, in June 1964, the squadron had received six of its planned allocation of nine aircraft, and the next batch of three aircraft was sent directly to Vietnam. No. 38 Squadron was the last operational RAAF squadron to fly Dakotas, though several other units did so until the 1990s. After receiving its Caribous, No. 38 Squadron's main role was to train aircrews for operational service with the RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam (later redesignated No. 35 Squadron). On 1 July 1964, one of the squadron's Caribous suffered severe damage when it made a crash landing at HMAS Albatross; this aircraft was subsequently written off and its fuselage used for training purposes by the Army's 1st Commando Regiment. The squadron became an independent unit under Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond in August that year, following the disbandment of No. 86 Wing. On 13 October 1965, Detachment A of No. 38 Squadron began operations from Port Moresby in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, equipped with two Caribous. One of the detachment's tasks was to give <b>Caribou</b> pilots experience in tropical and mountainous conditions, and all aircraft captains were required to complete at least one two-month deployment to Port Moresby before serving with No. 35 Squadron in Vietnam. In addition to its training role, No. 38 Squadron undertook transport flights in and around Australia, taking part when required in relief efforts following natural disasters.|$|E
5|$|No.38 Squadron {{received}} the RAAF's first de Havilland Canada DHC-4 <b>Caribou</b> tactical transports in April 1964, replacing its Dakotas. The first six Caribous were despatched that August to South East Asia for {{service in the}} Vietnam War as RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam (RTFV). The same month, No.86 Wing was disbanded. Because the Caribous were primarily for support of the Australian Army, an overarching wing headquarters for the Caribous and Hercules was now considered inappropriate. No.486 Squadron was also disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons, which along with AMTF became independently operating units {{under the command of}} Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond. Following the re-establishment at Richmond of No.37 Squadron in February 1966, flying C-130E Hercules, No.486 Squadron was re-formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons. As No.36 Squadron's tasking was mainly tactical and No.37 Squadron's strategic (owing to the longer range of its C-130Es), forming the Hercules units into a new wing was not deemed necessary. Still based at Richmond, the Hercules provided long-range transport and medical evacuation services to and from South East Asia during the Vietnam War. No.36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced by C-130H models in 1978. RTFV was re-formed as No.35 Squadron in June 1966, and continued to serve in Vietnam until Australian forces were withdrawn in 1972; it was then based in Richmond until 1976, when it relocated to RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland. No.38 Squadron meanwhile continued to operate Caribous out of Richmond until 1992, when it transferred to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. In the Vietnam and post-Vietnam eras, along with their military transport duties, the Hercules and <b>Caribou</b> undertook disaster relief operations throughout Australia and the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Szymczyk {{was moved}} several times {{while working for}} ABC Records; first to Los Angeles when ABC {{acquired}} Dunhill Records and Szymczyk took over production for the West Coast operations, and later to Denver {{when he decided to}} form his own label, Tumbleweed Records. He worked for a while as a disc jockey at radio station KFML, and continued to produce albums in New York and Los Angeles, such as the J. Geils Band's 1971 album The Morning After, recorded at the Los Angeles Record Plant. He did extensive work at the Colorado studio <b>Caribou</b> Ranch, where would be the center of his operations {{for the rest of the}} 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Rockies {{ecoregion}} supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, <b>caribou,</b> Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|E
5|$|The base's origins {{began in}} 1947 with {{an order for}} {{construction}} of an airfield by the New England Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The chosen site, in northeastern Maine within both Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation, was the closest point in the continental U.S. to Europe, providing high strategic value during the Cold War. The base was originally named Limestone Army Air Field, and was renamed Limestone Air Force Base following {{the establishment of the}} Air Force in 1947. It was named in 1954 for Major Charles J. Loring, Jr., USAF, a Medal of Honor recipient during the Korean War. From 1951 to 1962, it was co-located next to <b>Caribou</b> Air Force Station.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. <b>Caribou</b> were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E
