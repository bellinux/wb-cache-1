5000|$|In {{multifunction}} or all-in-one <b>printers,</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> photocopiers and scanners, {{an automatic}} document feeder or ADF is a feature which takes several pages and feeds the paper one page {{at a time}} into a scanner or copier, allowing the user to scan, and thereby copy, print, or fax, multiple-page documents without having to manually replace each page. Most copiers allow scanning on the flatbed or platen (the [...] "glass") or through a document feeder. The vast majority of <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> have an ADF, allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes. Due to the ubiquity of ADF in <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> some <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> owners use the <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> as a scanner, faxing multi-page documents to themselves. Document feeders are described by speed, in pages per minute or ppm, and capacity, usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200.|$|R

50|$|UFPs {{are both}} {{manufactured}} and naturally occurring. Hot volcanic lava, ocean spray, and smoke are common natural UFPs sources. UFPs {{can be intentionally}} fabricated as are fine particles to serve a vast range of applications in both medicine and technology. Other UFPs are byproducts, like emissions, from specific processes, combustion reactions, or equipment such as printer toner and automobile exhaust. In 2014, an air quality study found harmful ultrafine particles from the takeoffs and landings at Los Angeles International Airport to be of much greater magnitude than previously thought. There are a multitude of indoor sources that include {{but are not limited}} to laser <b>printers,</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> photocopiers, the peeling of citrus fruits, cooking, tobacco smoke, penetration of contaminated outdoor air, chimney cracks and vacuum cleaners.|$|R

40|$|The 34700 is a compact, high-efficiency {{power supply}} with on-chip power MOSFETs that {{features}} three step-down switching regulators and one low dropout linear regulator. The switching regulators utilize {{voltage mode control}} with external compensation, allowing flexibility in optimizing {{the performance of the}} 34700 for a given application. The 34700 is ideal for space constrained applications where multiple power rails are required and simplicity of design and implementation of the power supply is necessary. Over-voltage, under-voltage, over-current, and over-temperature protection features ensure robust and reliable operation. Fixed switching frequency, internal soft-start, and internal power MOSFETs enable rapid power supply design and development. The 34700 is well suited for power supply designs in wide variety of applications, including set top boxes, cable modems, laser <b>printers,</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> point-of-sale terminals, small appliances, telecom line cards, and DVD players...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of 11 after-hours walk-throughs of offices in the San Francisco CA and Washington D. C. areas. The primary purpose of these walk-throughs was to collect data on turn-off rates for various types of office equipment (computers, monitors, <b>printers,</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> copiers, and multifunction products). Each piece of equipment observed was recorded and its power status noted (e. g. on, off, low power). Whenever possible, we also recorded whether power management was enabled on the equipment. The floor area audited was recorded as well, which allowed us to calculate equipment densities. We found that only 44 percent of computers, 32 percent of monitors, and 25 percent of printers were turned off at night. Based on our observations we estimate success rates of 56 percent for monitor power management and 96 percent for enabling of power management on printers...|$|R

Fromherz Xerox PARC, 3333 Coyote Hill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA fromherz@parc. xerox. com Following {{the trend}} of mass customization, reprographic <b>machines</b> (photocopiers, <b>printers,</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> etc.) are {{increasingly}} designed and assembled from standard components. For example, a system engineer may design a paper path for a new print engine configuration from components such as sheet transports, sheet inverters, gates, registration units, and trays. Similarly, customers may choose from and plug together different complex modules such as mark engines and feeder and finisher modules {{in order to get}} the desired functionality. One of the most complex steps in this composition of reprographic modules is the automatic configuration of the system control software.

50|$|Most of the ICT {{facilities}} in Kenya {{have been in}} urban areas, this has resulted in glaring disparities between {{urban and rural areas}} in the distribution of ICT facilities. To redress the disparities, the Kenya ICT Board has embarked on a Digital Villages project (DVP) under the Kenya Transparency Communications Infrastructure Project, which will see a creation of networks of information facilities across the country. Digital villages are centres that provide a suite of services to the public via computers connected to the internet, digital cameras, <b>printers,</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machines</b> and other communication infrastructure. The digital village project (DVP) {{is an integral part of}} an innovative public-private partnership (PPP) for taking ICTs to the rural communities in Kenya. DVP seeks to harness the vast untapped potential of the rural sector by making ICTs more accessible and affordable to the wider population through the development and utilisation of ICT {{facilities in}} the rural areas.|$|R

40|$|Almost {{everyone}} has them [...] an old relic 286 or 386 -based personal computer collecting dust; a {{dot matrix printer}} {{that has long been}} replaced by ink jets and laser jets; a <b>fax</b> <b>machine</b> or copier that is considered a dinosaur by current technology standards. Rapid hardware and software changes have resulted in the rapid obsolescence of computer systems and peripheral devices. This rapid turnover of computer systems generates increasing quantities of computer and electronic scrap. What is computer and electronic scrap? Computer and electronic scrap is defined as used and unwanted computers, mainframes, monitors, <b>printers,</b> <b>fax</b> <b>machines,</b> copiers and related accessories such as motherboards, keyboards, and disk drives. It is {{one of the fastest growing}} waste streams and is expected to continue increasing as society becomes more reliant on technology. What are the consequences of disposing computer and electronic scrap? Computer and electronic scrap contains many resources that can be recovered and reused. It also contains many toxic and hazardous substances that can be released to the environment when disposed in landfills. Currently, companies are losing millions of dollars each year because they do not recycle their computer and electronic assets which contain recoverable amounts of many materials, including precious metals such as silver and gold. By recycling computer and electronic scrap, you may be able to recover some of the initial costs of the computer system or qualify for potential tax deductions...|$|R
