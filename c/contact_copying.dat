40|$|Tartu University in Pictures: Negative {{collection}} of Tartu State University’s Film and Photography Laboratory at the University of Tartu History Museum MA Janet Laidla, UT History Museum   Photographs past events are deemed valuable source material and illustrations. As the photo industry is constantly evolving, the photographing process has become cheaper, simpler and more widely available, {{with more and}} more photos preserved as a result. Yet {{only a small number of}} photographs reaches museums because many images are discarded by their authors and owners. But what if number of photos is really large? Between 1997 - 1999 the University of Tartu History Museum received a {{collection of}} items that belonged to the Film and Photography Laboratory of the Tartu State University. Among these items was a collection of negatives that totals around 50, 000 negatives and a card index with some 3000 <b>contact</b> <b>copies.</b> Not all of the negatives are listed in the card index with the <b>contact</b> <b>copies,</b> and not all of the <b>contact</b> <b>copies</b> have the corresponding negatives preserved in the collection. The photographs are in small and medium-sized format and their average condition is quite good. One of the valuable factors of this collection of negatives is its integrity. The collection was created for the purpose of systematic perpetuation of university events and of the people and items associated with the university. The scope of topics recorded is wide. Represented are various university events (public ceremonies, anniversaries and visits by prominent guests), scientific activities (conferences, exhibitions, equipment, laboratories and experiments), administration and management aspects (construction work and employees) and student life (the Student Scientific Association, student construction crew, studies and hostels). There are also many views of Tartu and events in the city that are not directly connected with the university. In addition to the chronicling of events, the photo collection shows the society, fashion, technology and customs of the times. As this is an institutional collection, it offers a vivid imprint of the characteristic traits of the period, including public life in the Estonian SSR. The main problem with the collection of negatives is not that its arrangement, registration or description require a lot of time, but that use of the collection by a visitor or researcher is likely to be quite complicated. Assuming the collection is transferred to digital format and made accessible via a database, there may be thousands of images matching one title or keyword. For instance, we can predict that the titles of at least 20, 000 negatives are likely to include the phrase ‘Tartu State University’. Naturally, restrictions can be applied to displaying search results, but users might still experience difficulties, with no overview of the contents of the collection of negatives and no ability to discern the logic of the person who entered their descriptions (just as that person could not foresee the logic of the user’s search). At the same time, it is likely that no one is competent to decide in advance which negatives will be required by researchers in one, five or 50 years’ time, so it is not expedient to sort the negatives now. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a new digital evaluation method for photographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) recordings is described. Rather thanevaluating the recordings with optical systems, which require <b>contact</b> <b>copies,</b> high resolution scan of the actual negatives are digitally processed using a modified cross-correlation method. The primary advantages are a increased spatial resolution in the obtained velocity vector maps (due to smaller interrogation areas), increased evaluation speed, and a simple calibration procedure. The accuracy of the technique matches, {{and in some cases}} exceeds, the {{performance of}} the presently available optical PIV evaluation method under a variety of conditions. Important parameters are the particle image diameter, with an optimum at 2 to 3 pixels (typ. 10 - 30 microm. on film), the interrogation window size, and the number of pulses used in the generation of the PIV recording. The performance and limitations of the method are illustrated with several examples of applications of PIV in DLR wind tunnels: a cylinder wake, a wake behind a 2 -D car model and a transonic flow behind a flat plate...|$|R
50|$|The {{basic idea}} behind the newly founded archive {{is to create a}} broad-based {{collection}} of works by the featured photo artists. Such a collection should of course comprise the photographs themselves. But it is not merely a matter of cherry-picking seminal works for an exhibition: it is also about first prints, smaller versions of the photographs, and an overview of the series as a whole. Preliminary drafts and additional prints are just as important for the archive as the so-called first choice among the artist’s works. The aim of the archive is to document the artistic process in its entirety. And that of course includes the negatives and <b>contact</b> <b>copies,</b> or the original digital data illustrating the full breadth of the creative process involved. Other points of interest in a collection such as this include written drafts, texts, material documenting the history of the production and presentation, documents, and printed matter. Ideally, it then becomes possible not only to showcase and understand the artistic work, but also to gain an insight into the culture of the day.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} to {{highlight}} the importance of colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs for efficient inventory, monitoring and predicting the health status of forests in changed site conditions. CIR aerial photographs from two aerial surveys conducted in 1989 and 2008 were used to identify and analyze the damage in lowland pedunculated oak (Quercus robur L.) forests during each period, as well as to obtain a dieback trend in the observed period. Material and Methods: The research was conducted in lowland pedunculated oak forests of Josip Kozarac management unit. CIR aerial photographs (1989) of the research area were taken with a classical camera, while aerial images in 2008 were taken with a digital camera and then converted from digital to analogue form (<b>contact</b> <b>copy</b> - photograph) in order to perform photointerpretation with a SOKKIA MS 27 Carl ZEISS Jena mirror stereoscope, magnified by 8 x. The health status of particular trees (crowns) was assessed by means of photointerpretation keys in a stereomodel over a systematic 100 x 100 m sample grid on both 1989 and 2008 aerial photographs. The degree of damage of 4 individual trees was assessed at every grid point in the surveying strips covering the surveyed area. Damage indicators were calculated and thematic maps were constructed {{on the basis of the}} interpretation of data for all the grid points. Results: For the research area a damage index (IO) of 68. 36 % for oak was determined by photointerpreting individual trees (2008); in other words, this percentage of pedunculate oak trees in the surveyed area was found to be in the damage degree of 2. 1 and more. Of 68. 36 % trees classified in the damage degree of 2. 1 or more, mean damage (SO 1) amounted to 52. 16 % and could be classified in the damage degree of 2. 2. In 1989, the mean damage index (IO) for pedunculate oak was 48. 00 %, and pedunculate oak trees with mean damage degree of 2. 1 or more (SO 1) amounted to 36. 03 %. The comparison of photointerpretation results from 1989 and 2008 shows that the damage index (IO) for pedunculate oak increased by more than 20 %, whereas mean damage (SO) rose by almost 15 %. An increase of more than 15 % in mean damage of considerably damaged pedunculate oak trees can also be observed. Conclusions: The obtained results provide not only the current forest condition but also indicate the condition in the field and the purposefulness of aerial surveying, since aerial photographs allow an insight into the condition in the field in a short time period. This in turn enables the efficient application of measures to mitigate the consequences of dieback...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings: We have developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to analyze protein-protein interactions in vivo in S. pombe. The assay is based on the observation that N- and C-terminal subfragments of the Venus fluorescent protein can reconstitute a functional fluorophore only when they are brought into tight <b>contact.</b> Wild-type <b>copies</b> of the ctr 4 + and ctr 5 + genes were inserted downstream of and in-frame with the nonfluorescent C-terminal (VC) and N-terminal (VN) coding fragments of Venus, respectively. Co-expression of Ctr 4 -VC and Ctr 5 -VN fusion proteins allowed their detection at the plasma membrane of copper-limited cells. Similarly, cells co-expressing Ctr 4 -VN and Ctr 4 -VC in the presence of Ctr 5 -Myc 12 displayed a fluorescence signal at the plasma membrane. In contrast, Ctr 5 -VN and Ctr 5 -VC coexpressed in the presence of Ctr 4 -Flag 2 failed to be visualized at the plasma membrane, suggesting a requirement for a combination of two Ctr 4 molecules with one Ctr 5 molecule. We found that plasma membrane-located Ctr 4 -VC-Ctr 5 -VN fluorescent complexes were internalized when the cells were exposed to high levels of copper.

30|$|In DTN {{opportunistic}} routing (OPPT) [18 – 20] {{a source}} node delivers packet to the destination node {{only when the}} two nodes come into direct <b>contact.</b> This single <b>copy</b> mechanism offers a simple DTN routing approach in which the delay can be very large, especially in scenarios with low mobility or infrequent link formation between the source and destination. This protocol is simple to implement and suited well for the processing- and energy-constrained on-body sensors for which complex algorithms should be avoided. It is highly energy efficient due to the single transmission requirement for each packet delivery. However, the expected packet delivery delay for OPPT can be quite high, especially when the source and the destination nodes are rarely {{in direct contact with}} each other. The protocol is also very sensitive to the source-destination link quality since it relies only on that single direct link for all packet delivery. Opportunistic routing is modeled and analyzed in this section for estimating the worst case delay performance and for finding an upper-bound for packet delivery delay in a WBAN setting.|$|R
