40|$|A {{mutation}} (modD) {{was selected}} in a gene {{involved in the}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> protoplasmic <b>incompatibility.</b> Previous results (Labarere and Bernet 1979) showed that modD decreased the density of protoperithecia and caused a defect in ascospore germination. In addition, modD has a third defect: when modD stationary cells were isolated {{in order to obtain}} further development, renewal of growth rarely ensued. Instead, the modD cells lysed or produced microthalli from which normal growth never occurred. These defects were suppressed by β-phenyl pyruvic acid, a protease inhibitor, and by the presence of a mutation (modC) that suppresses the proteases associated with protoplasmic incompatibility. The stationary wild-type cells' regeneration was inhibited by β-phenyl pyruvic acid at levels that maintained modD cells' regeneration. These results suggest a biological role for the proteases associated with protoplasmic incompatibility...|$|R
40|$|In Podospora anserina {{previous}} investigations {{showed that}} mutations in genes {{involved in the}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> protoplasmic <b>incompatibility</b> cause defects at various stages of differentiation during the life cycle and also modify properties of the plasma membrane. To establish these relationships in another way, a new method for screening mutations has been developed as a first step. Eighty-five new mutants were selected for resistance to toxic products (sorbose or thiourea); in a second step these mutants were tested for modifications <b>of</b> protoplasmic <b>incompatibility</b> and cellular differentiation. Seven of the sorbose or thiourea resistant-mutants (i. e., 8 %) exhibited new patterns <b>of</b> protoplasmic <b>incompatibility.</b> Genetic analyses were carried out with three mutants. Mutation X 25 suppresses protoplasmic incompatibility resulting from all allelic interactions and restores the fertility of the crosses ♀ V x ♂ V 1 and ♀ Z 1 x ♂ Z 2. Mutation V 41 is an allele of the v locus with new properties. Mutation X 61 totally suppresses the V/V' 1 interaction and weakens {{all of the other}} allelic incompatibility systems; X 61 strains are defective in protoperithecia differentiation. Electrophoresis of plasma membrane proteins showed that X 61 strains lack two polypeptides whose apparent molecular weights are 41, 000 and 44, 000. This new screening method is especially efficient for obtaining new mutants and identifying additional genes involved in incompatibility. These results provide further support demonstrating the relationships between protoplasmic incompatibility, cellular differentiation and plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|Two sets of diploid {{cultures}} of S. commune were observed for sectoring due to haploidization or recombination. Each set consisted of compatible and common-AB diploids otherwise almost isogenic. One of the sets included two compatible diploids {{with a large}} proportion of dikaryotic cells. The sectors were isolated and analysed for evidence of aneuploidy and frequent crossing over to determine whether they arose via mitotic or meiotic-like events. It was found that the recombination process in both common-AB and compatible diploids was predominantly mitotic. However, the compatible diploids which developed a high frequency of dikaryotic components gave some evidence of meiotic-like activity. Thus, compatible mating-type factors are necessary for dikaryosis, but not sufficient in themselves to produce it. In compatible mycelia where dikaryosis does occur, meiotic-like recombination may also occur. It is proposed that both lapse into the dikaryotic state, and meiotic-like recombination was induced by different genes under <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>incompatibility</b> factors. Dikaryosis and meiosis are thus seen as tandem phenomena, neither causal of the other but both induced by action of compatible mating-type factors...|$|R
40|$|Distyly is {{a genetically}} {{controlled}} floral dimorphism, {{characterized by the}} reciprocal positioning of pin and thrum morphs, a heteromorphic incompatibility system and a balanced morph ratio (isoplethy). This study aimed to investigate the phenology, features of distyly, reproductive biology, and floral visitors of Psychotria goyazensis Mull. Arg. (Rubiaceae), an intramorph self-compatible species, in a tropical semideciduous forest in the municipality of Catalão, located {{in the state of}} Goiás, Brazil. The phenology was recorded for a sample of individuals, the floral morphology being described using fresh and fixed material. The incompatibility system was tested using controlled hand pollinations. Floral visitors were collected and identified. Blooming began in November 2009 and ended in April 2010. Fruits developed from December 2009 to March 2010. The population presented atypical distyly, because only plants with pin flowers were found. The intramorph and open pollinations set more fruits than did spontaneous self-pollinations. The main flower visitors were Systropus sp. (Diptera), as well as Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera species. Morphological variations in distyly can occur by breakdown/permutation of the gene that controls the polymorphism. However, some authors argue that, in Rubiaceae, genetic <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>incompatibility</b> system can operate independently of the morphological factor, and species might respond in different ways to the same selective pressures...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new way of}} quantifying the degrees <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> two ob- servables in a probabilistic physical theory and, based on this, a global measure of the degree <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> inherent in such theories, across all observable pairs. This opens up a novel and flexible way of comparing probabilistic theories with respect to the nonclassical feature <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility,</b> raising many interesting questions, some of which will be answered here. We show that quantum theory contains observables that are as incompatible as any probabilistic physical theory can have if arbitrary pairs of observables are considered. If one adopts a more refined measure of the degree <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility,</b> for instance, by restricting the comparison to binary observables, it turns out that there are probabilistic theories whose inherent degree <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> is greater than that of quantum mechanics.

40|$|International audienceIn fungi, {{heterokaryon}} incompatibility is a nonself recognition process occurring when filaments {{of different}} isolates {{of the same}} species fuse. Compatibility is controlled by so-called het loci and fusion of strains of unlike het genotype triggers a complex incompatibility reaction that leads to the death of the fusion cell. Herein, we analyze the transcriptional changes during the incompatibility reaction in Podospora anserina. The incompatibility response was found to be associated with a massive transcriptional reprogramming: 2231 genes were up-regulated by a factor 2 or more during incompatibility. In turn, 2441 genes were down-regulated. HET, NACHT, and HeLo domains previously found {{to be involved in the}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> heterokaryon <b>incompatibility</b> were enriched in the up-regulated gene set. In addition, incompatibility was characterized by an up-regulation of proteolytic and other hydrolytic activities, of secondary metabolism clusters and toxins and effector-like proteins. The up-regulated set was found to be enriched for proteins lacking orthologs in other species and chromosomal distribution of the up-regulated genes was uneven with up-regulated genes residing preferentially in genomic islands and on chromosomes IV and V. There was a significant overlap between regulated genes during incompatibility in P. anserina and Neurospora crassa, indicating similarities in the incompatibility responses in these two species. Globally, this study illustrates that the expression changes occurring during cell fusion incompatibility in P. anserina are in several aspects reminiscent of those described in host-pathogen or symbiotic interactions in other fungal species...|$|R

40|$|As a new {{software}} licensing model, software-as-a-service (SaaS) is gaining tremendous popularity across the globe. In this study, we investigate {{the competition between}} a new entrant and an incumbent in a SaaS market, and derive the optimal market entry strategy for the new entrant. One interesting finding is that, when its product quality is significantly {{lower than that of}} the incumbent, the new entrant should adopt an instant-release strategy, i. e., releasing its product {{at the start of the}} planning horizon. If the initial quality gap of the two products is small, the new entrant is better off adopting a late-release strategy, i. e., deferring the release of the new product until its quality surpasses that of the existing product. We also find that instant-release and late-release are essentially low-quality-low-price and high-quality-high-price strategies, respectively. In addition, we explore the scenario where the two competing products are partially compatible, and characterize the impact <b>of</b> asymmetric <b>incompatibility</b> on the two vendors’ market strategies at equilibrium. We find that the new entrant’s zero-profit region expands as the level <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> between the two competing products increases. Moreover, if the new entrant adopts the instant-release strategy, its profit decreases with the level <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> When the level <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> is sufficiently high, the instance-release strategy may not be viable for the new entrant. On the other hand, if the new entrant adopts the late-release strategy, its profit increases with the level <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> from its product to the incumbent’s, but decreases with the level <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> in the other direction...|$|R
