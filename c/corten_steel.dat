The urn sculpture is made out of <b>corten</b> <b>steel,</b> which blends in with the red-brick backdrop of the site. It is accompanied by some of Pope’s most famous quotes, carved into new curved wood seating and timber benches connecting new generations with his legacy.|$|E

The work, sited on a plaza of paving stones that measures [...] x , frames views of English Bay, the North Shore Mountains and the city. In their guide for public art in Vancouver, John Steil and Aileen Stalker suggested two sources for the sculpture's design: Chung Hung's training as a civil engineer, and the shapes of plane tables and quadrants, both navigational instruments used by George Vancouver. According to Chung Hung: [...] "The objective of the sculpture {{is to create a}} symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast." [...] The sculpture is owned by the City of Vancouver, with Parks Canada serving as the sponsoring organization.|$|E
500|$|Gate to the Northwest Passage is a 1980 {{sculpture}} by Alan Chung Hung, located {{adjacent to the}} Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vanier Park in the Kitsilano neighborhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The [...] sculpture of a square, cut and twisted [...] "like a paper clip" [...] to form an arch, is composed of weathered <b>Corten</b> <b>steel</b> that rusts to provide a protective layer. The work was installed in 1980 to commemorate the arrival of Captain George Vancouver in Burrard Inlet, following a competition sponsored by Parks Canada one year prior. Gate to the Northwest Passage received an adverse reaction initially, but reception has improved over time. The sculpture has been included in walking tours of the surrounding neighborhoods as a highlight of Vanier Park.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corten</b> <b>steels</b> have {{essentially}} the same yield stress ratios as Corten through 700°F. At 900°F, the yield stress ratio is 63%. At 1100°F, the yield stress ratio is 58% (AISC tables). <b>Corten</b> <b>steels</b> {{should not be used}} above 1100°F.|$|R
40|$|The {{weathering}} <b>steel</b> (<b>Corten</b> B) {{was exposed}} to out-door atmosphere of Hanoi (urban site) and Donghoi (marine site). The results showed the protective ability of corrosion product layer formed on weathering steel in the initial stage. The SEM-EDX analysis detected the presence of chromium and copper in the inner layers of corrosion product formed on weathering steel. These elements improved corrosion resistance of corrosion product layers. In addition, the dense α -FeOOH phase were appeared early in corrosion product which is detected by X-ray diffraction and Micro Raman investigations. The results of polarization and EIS measurements also demonstrated the protectiveness of the corrosion product of weathering steel. </p...|$|R

System models were constructed of 3 / 8 inch A 1 S 1 1020, low-alloy, high-strength U. S. <b>Steel</b> <b>Corten,</b> and quenched and tempered U. S. Steel T-l plates. These models were designed to resemble panel structures encountered in ship-building. Welding procedures for all samples were held constant. Point of application of the flame as well as quenching techniques, were varied in the experiments The results of testing are presented {{in the form of}} distor-tion plots of the samples. Plots were made as welding proceeded and as various flame straightening methods were tried. In this study, it was shown that for the same welding procedure, the amount of distortion decreased as the yield strength of the material...|$|R
40|$|If necessary, for {{a proper}} use of the building, {{completion}} of more extensive spatial and functional parts should reflect contemporary architecture». The statement taken from the Krakow Charter (2000) clearly defines the characters of the interventions made {{by the use of}} metal structures or devices in the restoration and the reuse of historic buildings. At the turn of the Twentieth and Twenty-First Century, the restoration interventions carried out by these techniques interpret the theme of the addition, or the filling of the lacuna, as a design opportunity in which the steel becomes an instrument of the architectural syntax. The use of building materials such as <b>steel,</b> <b>corten</b> and titanium allow the development of additions/integrations that arise as new stratigraphic layer of the historical building. These elements/structures aspire both to the highest reversibility and to a clear syntactic and formal distinction from the past, helping to minimize both the impact and the extension of the interface between the pre-existences and the new integrations. As the paper will highlight, starting from the second post-war period, many interventions carried out by these techniques in historical contexts are characterized by clear formal similarities. Nevertheless, the meanings and the architectural language of the integrations should be considered in terms of the inner coherence of the design choices, with particular attention to define the details that compose them. In fact, the working draft of the intervention and in particular the anchorage techniques used to connect historical masonries with new insertions allow to underline significant differences in the conservation of the built heritage...|$|R
