25|$|The northwestern wine {{regions are}} {{particularly}} prone {{to the effects}} of the hurricane force winds known as the Zonda which blows from the Andes during the flowering period of early summer. This fierce wind of hot, dry air can disrupt the flowering process and severely reduce potential yields. Most of the growing season is dry with the lack of humidity limiting the risk and hazard from various grape diseases and fungal rot. Many vineyards operate without the need for any chemical spraying, a condition conducive to organic viticulture. The periodic occurrence of the El Niño phenomenon can have a sharp influence on <b>climate</b> <b>condition</b> during a growing season-such as the case during the 1998 vintage when prolong heavy rains brought by El Niño led to widespread rot and fungal disease.|$|E

The sunflower {{is one of}} the main large culture crops in Romania and the most important oilseed plant, being on the third place as cultivated area, after corn and wheat. This makes the sunflower the most important melliferous crop plant, ensuring the last great production harvest before winter. This importance results both from the period and the duration of flowering, and from the large number of flowers per unit of area and the great nectar secretion. Yet, the melliferous capacity in sunflower is affected by the <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> [3], fact ascertained by beekeepers over great variations in time and space of honey productions. Likewise, the melliferous capacity in sunflower differs from one hybrid to another [1][2], the beekeepers being interested in the melliferous capacities specific to various sunflower hybrids cultivated in our country. The current work depicts the results of researches on the melliferous capacity on a variety of 4 sunflower hybrids cultivated over 5 periods, under the conditions of the southern part of Romania, (15 km North-East from Bucharest) and under the <b>climate</b> <b>conditions</b> of 2007.
