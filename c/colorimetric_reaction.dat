50|$|Traditional reagent strip {{testing for}} protein uses the {{principle}} of the protein error of indicators to produce a visible <b>colorimetric</b> <b>reaction.</b> Contrary to the general belief that indicators produce specific colours in response to particular pH levels, certain indicators change colour in the presence of protein even though the pH of the medium remains constant. This is so because protein accepts hydrogen ions from the indicator. The test is more sensitive to albumin because albumin contains more amino groups to accept the hydrogen ions than other proteins. Depending on the manufacturer, the protein area of the strip contains different chemicals. Multistix contains tetrabromophenol blue and Chemstrip contains 3’,3”,5’,5”-tetrachlorophenol, 3,4,5,6-tetrabromosulfonphthalein. Both contain an acid buffer to maintain the pH at a constant level. At a pH level of 3, both indicators appear yellow in the absence of protein. However, as the protein concentration increases, the colour progresses through various shades of green and finally to blue. Readings are reported in terms of negative, trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+ or the semi-quantitative values of 30, 100, 300 or 2000 mg/dL corresponding to each colour change.

We previously reported that Bougainvillea xbuttiana extract showed an immunomodulatory activity. Here we compare the activation of macrophages exposed to B. xbuttiana extract and compare it with the other treatments such as LPS, IL- 4, and IL- 10. The cytotoxic effect of extract on peritoneal macrophages was determined by the technique of violet crystal staining. To verify the activation of macrophages we used the tests of vacuolization, hydrogen peroxide production, and percentages of cellular expansion and phagocytosis.

Our results for these diseases are in harmony with earlier re-ports. Additional Keyphrases: quantitative two-dimensional elec-trophoresis on cellulose acetate #{ 149 } heritable disorder pediatric chemistry disease-characteristic patterns Understanding of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) 5 has been increased greatly by improved methods for character-izing and quantitating urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and by the demonstration of specific enzyme defects (1 - 3). To assess the individual GAGs in urinary specimens, relatively unspecific <b>colorimetric</b> <b>reactions</b> have been used. It {{should also be noted}} that for the semiquantitation of some of the GAGs by use of classical ion-exchange procedures, relatively large volumes of urine are required. Here we describe a two-dimensional electrophoretic method that permits the separation and quantitation of each GAG in 2 mL of urine. We used this technique to study a series of 18 patients with MPS in whom the specific enzyme defect has been determined...|$|R
