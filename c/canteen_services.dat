However, given the buyer 9 ̆ 2 s discretion in the design of SRAs, favouritism - with its potential positive (i. e. repeated cost-saving interactions) or negative (i. e. corruption) effects on social welfare - can arise. In this paper we empirically document potential favouritism in an original dataset of 196 SRAs for the procurement of <b>canteen</b> <b>services</b> in Italy over the period 2009 - 2013.

We find that SRAs can be distorted to favour the incumbent bidder, and that the victory of the incumbent is associated with less competition and higher prices; and no e¤ect by quality weight in the scoring function on the winning rebate.

40|$|Background: Recent {{shift in}} {{lifestyle}} and behavioral patterns in population have caused an obesity epidemic during formative years. Present study evaluated existing health and nutrition policies {{in a private}} school in an urban Indian city and assessed prevalence of obesity in adolescent children &amp; their association if any, with predictive behaviors of obesity. Methods: A private coeducational school located in an urban Indian city was selected and its existing health policies were evaluated using CDCâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s School Health Index (SHI). Further, 5 teachers were assessed regarding their knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of healthy dietary &amp; lifestyle practices. Critical evaluation of school <b>canteen</b> <b>services</b> was also done. Total 273 adolescents (10 - 13 years) were enrolled after taking informed consent. Prevalence of obesity &amp; its relationship with modifiable risk factors (fast food &amp; sweetened beverage intake, physical inactivity, low fruit &amp; vegetable intake and increased television viewing) was found by comparing behaviors amongst obese &amp; non-obese adolescents. Their biochemical profile for assessment of anemia, dyslipidemia and high fasting blood sugar levels was also determined. Results: Current framework of school lacked clear health &amp; nutrition policies. Canteen food service offered unhealthy food. Teachers had insufficient knowledge about healthy behaviors among children. Prevalence of overweight &amp; obesity was 23. 5 %. Cumulative presence of &gt; 3 risk behaviors of obesity {{was significantly associated with}} its development (OR 2. 07, 95 % CI).

40|$|To assess {{nutritional}} status of adolescents (10 - 12 years) from non government funded schools (private) of Gujarat, India. Teachers & parents of adolescent children were assessed regarding their knowledge, attitude {{and practices of}} healthy dietary & lifestyle behaviours. School <b>canteen</b> <b>services</b> were also critically evaluated. Parent’s willingness, to start a nutrition program in the school was also assessed. A cross sectional study was conducted on adolescents (10 - 12 years) from two selected private schools. Anthropometric, biophysical and hemoglobin estimations were done on all children. Lipid and glucose profile was conducted only on over weight (including obese) children. Results reveal that canteen offered unhealthy food. Teachers and parents had insufficient knowledge about healthy behaviors. Most (53. 5 %) of the parents agreed to the changes proposed for canteen menus. About 3 / 4 th of the subjects were malnourished (78. 9 %), with more (53. 7 %) being under weight than over weight and obese (25. 2 %). Similarly, more than half (55. 1 %) of the subjects were anemic. Central obesity as indicated by WHtR & WC was 21. 6 % and 9. 0 % respectively. The burden of sub optimal blood pressure was very high (26. 3 %) among adolescents (Pre hypertension 13. 7 % and hypertension 12. 6 %). Hence, malnutrition along with anemia {{and high blood pressure}} were significant problems in private schools.
