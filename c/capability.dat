40|$|Owing to the {{turbulence}} of entrepreneurial environment in recent years, {{the need to}} examine how technology entrepreneurship <b>capabilities</b> affect nascent graduate mindset toward creating new technology-based organizations is topical. Despite the fact that technological <b>capabilities,</b> relational <b>capabilities,</b> financial <b>capabilities,</b> and knowledge-sharing <b>capabilities</b> are central drivers of technology entrepreneurship, explicit gaps {{exist in the literature}} concerning their impact on technopreneurship intention. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the relationship between technology entrepreneurial <b>capabilities</b> and technopreneurship intention. A cross-sectional study was conducted with seven hypotheses in order to investigate the mediating role of knowledge sharing <b>capabilities</b> on the relationships between technology entrepreneurship <b>capabilities</b> (technological, relational, and financing) and technopreneurship intention. The hypotheses are tested based on data collected from 121 nascent graduates in Nigeria using multiple regression. Based on the output of the results, the study suggests direct and full mediating role of knowledge-sharing <b>capabilities</b> on technology entrepreneurship <b>capabilities</b> and technopreneurship intention. Thus, knowledge-sharing <b>capabilities</b> mediates the relation between technological <b>capabilities</b> and technopreneurship intention, as well as financial <b>capabilities</b> and technopreneurship intention.

Considering organizational learning as a mediator variable, this study tests the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and dynamic <b>capabilities,</b> and identifies paths to develop dynamic <b>capabilities</b> and the components of these <b>capabilities.</b> More specifically, the factor analysis method was employed to verify that dynamic <b>capabilities</b> are comprised of four dimensions, i.e. environmental sensing <b>capabilities,</b> change and renewal <b>capabilities,</b> technological and organizational flexibility <b>capabilities.</b> It was found that dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation have a significantly positive effect on dynamic <b>capabilities</b> to different extents, while organizational learning, which has significantly positive effect on dynamic <b>capabilities,</b> plays a partial mediating role between the two. These findings indicate that companies can build dynamic <b>capabilities</b> through different levels of organizational learning {{in the context of}} innovative and proactive atmosphere.|$|R

Second, we distinguish between project <b>capabilities</b> at the operational and dynamic <b>capabilities</b> at the strategic levels, arguing that firms depend on identifiable dynamic <b>capabilities</b> (e. g. portfolio management techniques) to know when and how to maintain current project <b>capabilities</b> and when to modify or replace them depending on the conditions encountered.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the relationship between dynamic <b>capabilities</b> and different types of online innovations.
