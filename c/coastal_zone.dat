40|$|Abstract. Economic {{aspects of}} {{possible}} land use strategies and protection measures in <b>coastal</b> <b>zones</b> {{as a response}} to global environmental change are examined. First, some key elements are mentioned that are of critical importance for water and land management in <b>coastal</b> <b>zones.</b> Next, various socio-economic repercussions are discussed. In this context, research needs will be addressed. Subsequently, these issues are considered for the case of The Netherlands. It is concluded that integrated modelling and analysis is just starting and needs to receive more attention in order to study long run economic costs, benefits and changes in <b>coastal</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

Thus, {{an understanding of}} sediment transport process in <b>coastal</b> <b>zones</b> is of crucial importance for accurate predictions of coast line evolution and sea-bed changes. However, the modeling of coastal sediment transport needs a compromise between two types of models: detailed mathematical models and engineering approaches.

Nevertheless the attraction of <b>coastal</b> <b>zones</b> is ever more in danger: their natural sources are extremely overworked, the lack of space causes fights in its employment, large season fluctuation of people and work.
