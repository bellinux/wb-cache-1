500|$|The <b>Closer</b> <b>You</b> Get..., {{released}} in March 1983, was certified platinum within two months, and {{also won the}} Grammy for Best Country Performance. Each of the album's singles—"Dixieland Delight", [...] "The <b>Closer</b> <b>You</b> Get", and [...] "Lady Down on Love"—were number ones in both the U.S. and Canada. Roll On was Alabama's next LP, and its four singles, [...] "Roll On (Eighteen Wheeler)", [...] "When We Make Love", [...] "If You're Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)", [...] "(There's A) Fire in the Night", all went to the top in both countries. 40-Hour Week (1985) continued the band's string of multinational successes, with [...] "40 Hour Week (For a Livin')" [...] and [...] "Can't Keep a Good Man Down" [...] peaking at number one in both territories, with only the lead single, [...] "There's No Way", falling short in Canada (although it peaked at number two). 40-Hour Week was one of Alabama's most popular albums, crossing over in the pop album charts. Alabama Christmas, a collection of nine holiday songs plus [...] "Christmas in Dixie", became Alabama's debut on the compact disc that September; {{it was also the}} centerpiece of a retail and television promotion (sponsored by the Nashville Network).|$|E

500|$|Mike Lechevaillier of Slate magazine, in {{a review}} of the fourth season, wrote that [...] "it's {{frequently}} astonishing to observe the confidence and wide-ranging appeal with which Adventure Time unswervingly depicts the many stages of infatuation." [...] The reviewer highlighted [...] "Hot to the Touch" [...] as an example of such an example, noting that Flame Princess represents [...] "an uncomplicated yet vastly pertinent metaphor for the hypothesis that the <b>closer</b> <b>you</b> cherish someone, the likelier they are to singe your soft exterior and the easier it is for them to affectionately melt your exposed heart." [...] Marc Snetiker of Entertainment Weekly awarded the episode a [...] "B", noting that [...] "the season four premiere of this inspired 'toon about a boy and his precocious dog is as colorful, clever, and unpredictably funny as ever." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in June 2001 at an {{airplane}} hangar at Los Angeles International Airport {{and at a}} Lifehouse show in London. It was directed by Marcos Siega, who is most notable for his work with Blink-182 and Papa Roach. In an interview with MTV, Wade talked about the idea behind the music video and said, [...] "This is the closest we'll probably ever come to being in a Tim Burton fantasy world. It was done in a real 'Jack and the Beanstalk' style. And Marcos used some camera tricks that make it look amazing. From far away, the stage set looked normal, {{but when you get}} <b>closer</b> <b>you</b> get smaller and it gets huge. We were being filmed in front of this bookcase that was like 150 feet high. It's a real visual trip." [...] It premiered on VH1.com on June 27, 2001.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the <b>closer</b> <b>you</b> get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E

500|$|Colin Stutz of Filter {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} 91% and stated: [...] "Wilco has {{constructed}} their most straightforward release in recent memory, which relies heavily on the inspired intricacies of a full-hearted band." [...] Richard Cromelin of Los Angeles Times gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it [...] "The most musically direct and down to earth of the band's six-album career." [...] Andrew C. Bradick of Prefix Magazine gave the album a favorable review and called it [...] "Wilco's first step toward aging well, but it transcends transition and is an album that sounds right in its place and time." [...] Alan Shulman of No Ripcord gave it a score of eight stars out of ten and said, [...] "Wilco {{has come up with}} 50% of a classic album and 50% of a merely decent one. Buy it for the moments you simply won’t hear anywhere else." [...] Will Hermes of Spin gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it [...] "A near-perfect album by a band that seems, finally, to have found their identity." [...] Alternative Press gave it four stars out of five and said, [...] "It's apparent it takes deft skill to sound this simple." [...] Tiny Mix Tapes also gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "While the elders will rejoice [...] this sober, satisfied, and craftily subdued effort, the younglings of the bunch, with their abbreviated attention spans, iPod shuffles, and demand for instant gratification, will declare the album a boring and lethargic affair." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine likewise gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "Though it may not fit comfortably alongside any other albums in Wilco's catalogue, Sky Blue Sky is further confirmation that, even at their most retro, they're among contemporary pop music's most vital acts." [...] Likewise, Graeme Thomson of The Observer gave it four stars and said, [...] "The <b>closer</b> <b>you</b> listen to the jazzy guitars, Beatles touches and easy, shuffling rhythms ... the more it transpires that Tweedy is simply allowing the songs sufficient room to speak up for themselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{put myself}} in the (Those who fear {{expansion}} of Government control) group, and do not {{hide the fact that}} I have a clear bias on Anthropogenic global warming (AGW). [...] My bias is based on fear of Government expansion and the observation of AGW data presentation fraud – not based on financial or any other personal benefit. [...] I merely have found that the <b>closer</b> <b>you</b> look at the data and alarmists’ [...] presentations, the more fraud you find and the less you think there is an AGW problem... For decades, as a professional experimental test engineer, I have analyzed experimental data and watched others massage and present data. [...] I became a cynic; My conclusion – “if someone is aggressively selling a technical product whose merits are dependent on complex experimental data, he is likely lying”. [...] That is true whether the product is an airplane or a Carbon Credit.|$|E

60|$|Nothing could {{appear more}} certain from {{the steps of}} St. Paul's than that each person is {{miraculously}} provided with coat, skirt, and boots; an income; an object. Only Jacob, carrying in his hand Finlay's Byzantine Empire, which he had bought in Ludgate Hill, looked a little different; for in his hand he carried a book, which book he would at nine-thirty precisely, by his own fireside, open and study, as no one else of all these multitudes would do. They have no houses. The streets belong to them; the shops; the churches; theirs the innumerable desks; the stretched office lights; the vans are theirs, and the railway slung high above the street. If you look <b>closer</b> <b>you</b> will see that three elderly men at a little distance from each other run spiders along the pavement as if the street were their parlour, and here, against the wall, a woman stares at nothing, boot-laces extended, which she does not ask you to buy. The posters are theirs too; and the news on them. A town destroyed; a race won. A homeless people, circling beneath the sky whose blue or white is held off by a ceiling cloth of steel filings and horse dung shredded to dust.|$|E
60|$|Let me {{give you}} a rough figure of what I am trying to convey in this first attack upon the {{philosophical}} validity of general terms. You have seen the results of those various methods of black and white reproduction that involve the use of a rectangular net. You know the sort of process picture I mean--it used to be employed very frequently in reproducing photographs. At a little distance you really seem to have a faithful reproduction of the original picture, but when you peer closely you find not the unique form and masses of the original, but a multitude of little rectangles, uniform in shape and size. The more earnestly you go into the thing, the <b>closer</b> <b>you</b> look, the more the picture is lost in reticulations. I submit the world of reasoned inquiry has a very similar relation to the world I call objectively real. For the rough purposes of every day the net-work picture will do, but the finer your purpose the less it will serve, and for an ideally fine purpose, for absolute and general knowledge that will be as true for a man at a distance with a telescope as for a man with a microscope it will not serve at all.|$|E
6000|$|In {{tendering}} {{his resignation}} to the Queen {{on the day}} following his parliamentary defeat (June 9), and regretting {{that he had been}} unable to prepare her for the result, Mr. Gladstone explained that though the government had always been able to cope with the combined tory and nationalist oppositions, what had happened on this occasion was the silent withdrawal, under the pressure of powerful trades, from the government ranks of liberals who abstained from voting, while six or seven actually voted with the majority. “There was no previous notice,” he said, “and it was immediately before the division that Mr. Gladstone was apprised for the first time of the likelihood of a defeat.” The suspicions hinted that ministers, or at least some of them, unobtrusively contrived their own fall. Their supporters, it was afterwards remarked, received none of those imperative adjurations to return after dinner that are usual on solemn occasions; else there could never have been seventy-six absentees. The majority was composed of members of the tory party, six liberals, and thirty-nine nationalists. Loud was the exultation of the latter contingent at the prostration of the coercion system. What was natural exultation in them, may have taken the form of modest satisfaction among many liberals, that they could go to the country without the obnoxious label of coercion tied round their necks. As for ministers, it was observed that if in the streets you saw a man coming along with a particularly elastic step and a joyful frame of (M80) countenance, ten to one on coming <b>closer</b> <b>you</b> would find that it {{was a member of the}} late cabinet.(124) ...|$|E
