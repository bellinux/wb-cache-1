The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the actual and desired degree of delegation of authority from boards of trustees to presidents in Illinois public community colleges as perceived by <b>current</b> and former <b>presidents.</b> A review of the literature was conducted to establish the questions in the six decision-making areas of facilities, finance, operations, planning, program, and personnel. The questionnaire was developed, validated by a panel of experts, and mailed to thirty-nine <b>current</b> <b>presidents</b> and thirty-nine former presidents. The response rate was 89. 7 % for <b>current</b> <b>presidents</b> and 76. 9 % for former presidents. Data were tested for statistical significance utilizing a Biomedical Computer Program P-Series (BMDP 2 V) using the. 05 level to establish significance. Planned comparisons were used to determine significant differences between mean responses. A simple effects analysis of variance was calculated where significant interactions were found. The key findings were: (1) <b>current</b> <b>presidents</b> desired significantly more decision-making authority in the area of personnel and significantly less decision-making in the area of program; (2) former presidents desired significantly more decision-making authority in the areas of facilities and operations; (3) all presidents as a group desired significantly more decision-making authority in the areas of facilities, operations and personnel. Presidents desired significantly less decision-making authority in the area of program. Findings with respect to size of institution, status of the <b>president</b> (<b>current</b> or former), or tenure of the president were as follows: (1) presidents of small colleges desired more decision-making authority in the area of operations as indicated by a significant difference between their responses regarding the actual and desired decision-making authority; (2) <b>current</b> <b>presidents</b> serving more than six years in small colleges desired significantly less decision-making authority in the area of program; (3) all <b>presidents</b> except <b>current</b> versus former <b>presidents</b> serving six years or more in large institutions and <b>current</b> versus former <b>presidents</b> serving five years or less in small institutions showed significant differences regarding actual authority in the area of program; (4) nine of the twelve categories for all presidents showed significant differences indicating that they desired less decision-making authority in the area of program...|$|R
