Back {{in the summer of}} 1975, Dorothy Denning and I, then still newlyweds, spent a month at Cambridge. During that time Roger Needham and I met daily to discuss topics in the design of operating systems. We were searching for fundamental principles for reliable systems.

The requirements obtained by this examination are used to define {{the concept of a}} nucleus for a computer system. A nucleus structure, based around an addressing scheme and a set of functions, is presented. This structure does not include processor and peripheral designs, but concentrates on the interaction between these components. The proposed addressing scheme is based on <b>capability</b> <b>addressing,</b> with the structure recognizing processors, peripherals, processes and files as addressable units. The functions proposed assist in scheduling of processes for processors and peripherals. These functions are also referenced through the addressing scheme which assists in the creation of virtual machine environments. Implementation techniques for the proposed nucleus are also examined in the context of validating the nucleus proposal. These implementation techniques are also discussed as final implementation methods...|$|E
40|$|Since most DSP {{applications}} access {{large amount}} of data stored in the memory, a DSP code generator must minimize the addressing overhead. In this paper, we propose a method for addressing optimization in loop execution targeted toward DSP processors with autoincrement /decrement feature in their address generation unit. Our optimization methods include a multi-phase data ordering and a graph-based address register allocation. The proposed approaches have been evaluated using a set of core algorithms targeted towards the TI TMS 320 C 40 DSP processor. Experimental results show that our system is indeed more effective compared to a commercial optimizing DSP compiler. 1 Introduction Most DSP processors' address generation units (AGU) {{have more than one}} address registers with autoincrement /decrement <b>capability.</b> <b>Addressing</b> optimization can be achieved via data ordering and address register allocation.

The complex study of kinetic turbulence, which can severely limit the energy confinement and impact the economic viability of fusion systems, requires simulations at extreme scale for such an unprecedented device size. Our newly optimized, global, ab initio particle-in-cell code solving the nonlinear equations underlying gyrokinetic theory achieves excellent performance with respect to "time to solution" at the full capacity of the IBM Blue Gene/Q on 786, 432 cores of Mira at ALCF and recently of the 1, 572, 864 cores of Sequoia at LLNL.

Information Systems (IS) literature has successfully demonstrated {{the relationship between}} the material technology and the social organization, and how both influnce each other. However, research has tilted in terms of favouring the explanatory power of either social or material agencies. To address this we suggest viewing the relationship as a sociomaterial <b>capability</b> <b>addressing</b> key organisational objectives. To understand the role of IS in such a capability, an approach addressing the bi-directional and flexible relationship is needed. We explore sociomateriality and draw empirically on a holistic case study in an international oil and gas company.

40|$|ISSN 1476 - 2986 This work {{presents}} CHERI, {{a practical}} {{extension of the}} 64 -bit MIPS instruction set to sup-port capabilities for fine-grained memory protection. Traditional paged memory protection has proved inadequate {{in the face of}} escalating security threats and proposed solutions include fine-grained protection tables (Mondrian Memory Protection) and hardware fat-pointer protection (Hardbound). These have emphasised transparent protection for C executables but have lacked flexibility and practicality. Intel’s recent memory protection extensions (iMPX) attempt to adopt some of these ideas and are flexible and optional but lack the strict correctness of these proposals. <b>Capability</b> <b>addressing</b> has been the classical solution to efficient and strong memory protection but it has been thought to be incompatible with common instruction sets and also with modern program structure which uses a flat memory space with global pointers.

40|$|Background: Community-based cluster-randomized {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) {{are increasingly}} being conducted to address pressing global health concerns. Preparations for clinical trials are well-described, as are the steps for multi-component health service trials. However, guidance is lacking for addressing the ethical and logistic challenges in (cluster) RCTs of population health interventions in low- and middle-income countries. Objective: We aimed to identify the factors that population health researchers must explicitly consider when planning RCTs within North–South partnerships. Design: We reviewed our experiences and identified key ethical and logistic issues encountered during the pre-trial phase of a recently implemented RCT. This trial aimed to improve tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention and care for health workers by enhancing workplace assessment <b>capability,</b> <b>addressing</b> concerns about confidentiality and stigma, and providing onsite counseling, testing, and treatment. An iterative framework was used to synthesize this analysis with lessons taken from other studies. Results: The checklist of critical factors was grouped into eight categories: 1) Building trust and shared ownership; 2) Conducting feasibility studies throughout the process; 3) Building capacity; 4) Creating an appropriate information system; 5) Conducting pilot studies; 6) Securing stakeholder support, {{with a view to}} scale-up; 7) Continuously refining methodological rigor; and 8) Explicitly addressing all ethical issues both at the start and continuously as they arise. Conclusion: Researchers should allow for the significant investment of time and resources required for successful implementation of population health RCTs within North–South collaborations, recognize the iterative nature of the process, and be prepared to revise protocols as challenges emerge...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} related to the subject of {{technical}} innovation, specifically to the activity of design in microenterprises operating in less industrialised economies. Design here is understood as a process, which is not the sole domain of formally trained categories such as engineers, architects or industrial designers. The 'professional boundary' discussion in this investigation is perceived as secondary as, in this context, products are designed, copied or adapted by workers, entrepreneurs themselves, or directly by the poor community. Design capacity at this level is considered to be important both in relation to the conception of capital and consumer goods and to the building up of technical knowledge. Although professional design emerged in Latin America little over three decades ago, this activity has remained marginalised throughout industry. Design activity tends to be concentrated in some product categories in the formalised industrial sector. For microenterprises operating informally, industrial design appears to be unknown. The existing literature pays little attention to 'informal design' capacity. Other areas of knowledge, such as development economies, recognise the importance of microenterprises and technological capability but neglect the potential role of industrial design in small manufacturing units. The management literature, though it focuses on technical innovation and design, has also paid little attention to 'informal design'. In less industrialised economies this neglect is felt by the lack of programmes specifically tailored to create or stimulate 'informal design'. There is a need for recognition of 'informal design' capacity and for the implementation of programmes which specifically target design as a central activity in the manufacturing firm, independent of their size and technological <b>capability.</b> <b>Addressing</b> 'design by the poor for the poor', requires a down-to-earth approach...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} using a tagged memory and a stack processor to implement a capability based computer. The hypothesis put forth here is that these two architectural features {{reduce the cost of}} the capability mechanism and result in a simpler implementation. We begin by motivating memory protection and protection systems as a basic need of modern computer systems. A brief historical survey is presented which begins with Dennis and Van Horn 2 ̆ 7 s paper on the semantics of multi-programmed computations and ends with a review of the major capability machines which resulted from this paper. ^ We then introduce the memory and processor organization proposed for this design and compare this organization with that used in previous architectures. This discussion shows that a tagged-memory organization reduces the number of segments used by a process by allowing segments to contain both pointer and data information. This reduces memory management overhead and allows a simpler representation of objects. Moreover, the tagged memory simplifies the mechanisms used to change domains, pass parameters, and address information in primary memory. The stack processor is shown to further reduce the cost of the capability mechanism by providing an inexpensive way to allocate procedure activation records, handle domain changes, and address objects on the stack. ^ Next we present the capability mechanism for the proposed design and discuss the process of mapping capability based virtual addresses into absolute primary memory addresses, and show how the abstract type concept is directly supported by the capability mechanism. ^ A discussion of the hardware facilities needed to support the design follows. This discussion presents a detailed view of the registers of the central processor, the organization of the process stack, the instruction set, and a possible firmware organization which could be used to implement the design. ^ The proposed architecture is then compared with two conventional machines and shown to be more efficient in representing programs. Moreover, evidence is presented which suggests that the performance of the proposed machine would be competitive with current state-of-the-art machines. Finally, two examples are presented which use the abstract type, process synchronization, and process communication facilities provided by the design. ^ The major contribution of this thesis is the thorough examination it provides of the tagged memory approach to <b>capability</b> <b>addressing.</b> Out research shows a tagged-memory capability machine is powerful enough to implement an operating system and the resulting operating system has a complexity about equal to that of the older generation of simple systems with little memory protection. This thesis also illustrates that advanced programming concepts can be implemented quite simply if the proper hardware support is provided. Finally, we show that the process control mechanism introduced in this thesis removes an important source of memory contention from the mutual exclusion mechanism. This is seen as a partial solution to the memory contention problem found on many multi-processor systems. ...|$|E
