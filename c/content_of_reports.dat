40|$|The Everyday Sexism Project {{documents}} everyday {{examples of}} sexism reported by volunteer contributors {{from all around}} the world. It collected 100, 000 entries in 13 + languages within the first 3 years of its existence. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> in various languages submitted to Everyday Sexism is a valuable source of crowdsourced information with great potential for feminist and gender studies. In this paper, we take a computational approach to analyze the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports.</b> We used topic-modelling techniques to extract emerging topics and concepts from the reports, and to map the semantic relations between those topics. The resulting picture closely resembles and adds to that arrived at through qualitative analysis, showing that this form of topic modeling could be useful for sifting through datasets that had not previously been subject to any analysis. The strength of the relationships between topics illustrates the fluid and ubiquitous nature of sexism, with no single experience being unrelated to another. Comment: preprint, under revie...|$|E

40|$|Objectives The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the effectiveness of significant event analyses (SEAs) undertaken by pharmacists as judged by a new system of independent peer feedback. Method The setting was a convenience sample of 37 pharmacists working in community pharmacy, secondary care and academic settings in NHS Scotland. Preliminary study involved the content analysis of pharmacists' SEAs and written feedback reports, which were generated by pharmacists trained in using a validated instrument to facilitate peer feedback. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> and feedback letters were systematically coded and categorised by identifying and quantifying key words and phrases. Data collected included the range and severity of significant events identified; the reported reasons for the events occurring; types of learning needs identified; action(s) taken; and learning issues raised by peer feedback. Key findings A total of 37 pharmacists submitted 43 SEA reports during the study period. All events submitted were classified as having a negative impact on the quality and safety of patient care. Most events related to prescribing, dispensing, administration, communication and patient-/relative-centred issues. Patients reportedly came to harm in 13...|$|E
40|$|Many processes, techniques, tools, methodologies, and {{approaches}} claim {{to facilitate the}} process of information systems development, but little empirical validation in support of these claims has been publicly reported. This research addresses this shortcoming in two ways. First, it develops and applies a promising experimental design for the comparison of systems analysis techniques. The design's objective was to external validity of experimental findings while maintaining high degrees of control and comparability. Secondly, our design, the &quot;transcript experiment, &quot; {{was used to evaluate}} two versions of an analysis procedure. This paper both presents and evaluates the transcript experiment as a research design and reports the results of an actual experiment. The study we report investigated the impact of a particular factor in the systems analysis process, which we term analysis perspective.

40|$|In recent decades, companies’ {{sustainability}} responsibilities {{have become}} a common topic of discussion. Today many companies produce sustainability reports to disclose information about their economic, environmental and social actions. However, few let these reports be assured. This thesis aims to explore if assurance affects the verifiability {{of the content of}} sustainability reports. The literature review reveals that quantitative information is more verifiable than qualitative information, and that assurance have the ability to affect the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports.</b> To answer the research question, a content analysis was performed on sustainability reports from 17 companies listed on NASDAQ OMX Nordic Large-cap. The results show that, in average, the proportion of quantitative information increased after assurance was introduced. This result was especially evident in the Environmental category, but the same trend was also visible in the Economic and Social categories. These findings are also confirmed by similar trends in the analysis of charts and graphs. The results are further related to previous research, whereby the conclusion of the study is that the introduction of assurance contributes to improved presumptions for verifiability of large-cap companies’ sustainability reports...|$|E

40|$|The {{manager of}} a small group of {{professional}} valuers within a Local Authority expressed concern about the inconsistent, and often conflicting, ways in which his officers described situations.

While it is clear there are a large number of possible explanations for the phenomenon, the manager concerned, and ourselves, became interested in the extent to which the officers might be attributing significantly different meanings to the situations they experienced. Our own interest was excited by the opportunity to experiment with a field application of grid techniques where the deliberate intention was to provide a vehicle for team development set within the context of the problem the manager has defined. Discussion with the eleven members of the department both reinforced our belief that it might be valuable to conduct an analysis of meanings and also provide an opportunity to negotiate our intervention and the prospect of team involvement after the elicitation and analysis of the grids...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{agendas of}} reform have been {{implemented}} in the Australian public sector including the adoption of accrual accounting. The public sector general purpose financial reporting model, like the private sector, is grounded in a ‘decision-useful’ framework. This model is premised {{on the existence of}} dependent users who are reliant on general purpose financial reports to make economic decisions. However, there have been doubts cast on the appropriateness of this premise for public sector organisations. This research determines the appropriateness of the model to government departments by empirically identifying users of government department general purpose financial reports and their information requirements. This research uses a survey methodology to directly access users of government department general purpose financial reports. The findings of this research are that general purpose financial reports are used to satisfy accountability needs rather than ‘decision-useful’ needs. These findings have important implications for policy makers since the choice of an accounting framework has the capacity to affect the information <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> – what is reported and how it is measured, and thus have a direct impact on the operations of government...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM) {{has been}} an {{integral}} part of the GATT/WTO since 1989 and shoulders a fundamental responsibility in making the regime more transparent. This paper asks: how has the TPRM responded to demands from developing countries for information and transparency? The paper uses a typology of information systems to explain the evolution of surveillance in the trade regime and asks whether the TPRM was assigned the functions of an ideal-type information system. The paper, then, evaluates the performance of the TPRM against its given mandate of increasing transparency to promote improved adherence with trade rules. It presents, for the first time, empirical evidence on the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> and the participation of countries, to highlight persisting content- and participation-related challenges. It discusses the capacity challenges within the WTO Secretariat and briefly outlines efforts made by developing countries to boost surveillance capacity at home. The paper ends by outlining priorities for monitoring in the trade regime: generating specific information that developing countries need, supporting domestic capacity for surveillance (including from non-official sources), and concentrating on improved peer review and follow-up procedures...|$|E

40|$|Concern {{has been}} raised about the rising {{influence}} of public relations on scientific news coverage and the potential role of institutional sources in shaping news reports. This study uses quantitative content analysis and qualitative interviews to {{explore the influence of}} public relations activities on newspaper coverage of “superfoods” and, in particular, to explore the transparency of reporting of the sources of research funding. Superfoods were chosen as a case study because the term is applied {{to a wide range of}} foods with potential health benefits (e. g. foods high in antioxidants). Furthermore, foods labelled as “superfoods” have seen sharp increases in sales, suggesting a potential commercial incentive for such labelling. Analysis of a sample of news articles reporting superfoods revealed a considerable influence for media releases in shaping the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports,</b> while less than a third of reports discussing research studies funded by organisations with a commercial interest in the findings mentioned the funding sources. Qualitative interviews confirmed the role of press offices in promoting research, particularly from scientific conferences, and suggest that scientific societies are applying less stringent criteria to studies selected for publication than in the past...|$|E
40|$|The thesis defended in this {{dissertation}} is {{that there}} is an objective, assertoric validity condition, or rationality constraint, on journalistic news judgments about reports that refer to events or states of affairs.;The dissertation locates such judgments in a Habermasian context of communicative action in which they are seen as making a unique, objective validity claim through the illocutionary force of published news narratives.;It is argued that neither truth of the information <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> judged to be newsworthy, nor alleged qualities of the events reported, nor journalistic conventions can establish the validity of news judgments.;Using concepts from the mathematical theory of information along lines suggested by Dretske, a 2 ̆ 2 core concept of news 2 ̆ 2 is developed. The assertoric validity of a news judgment is then accounted for in terms of a 2 ̆ 2 pragmatic information measure 2 ̆ 2 which, adapting arguments from Salmon, applies the frequentist concept of probability to single events in the determination of their objective surprisal value. Validity of a news judgment proper is then defined in terms of this core concept of news and the pragmatic information measure...|$|E
