40|$|Hopkins, Peterson & Fred (1930) found glucose and {{glucuronic acid}} as {{constituents}} of the exopolysaccharides of Rhizobium meliloti, R. trfolii and R. leguminosarum; Schliichterer & Stacey (1945) investigated {{the structure of}} the exopolysaccharide of R. radicicolum (Clover Bartel A strain) by methylation. Subsequently, composition was studied in relation to taxonomy (Humphrey & Vincent, 1959; Graham, 1965) and to antigenic properties (Dudman, 1964). Ljunggren & Fihraeus (1959) studied the effect of exopolysaccharides on root-hair invasion by rhizobia, while Clapp, Davis & Waugaman (1962) used Rhizobium exopoly-saccharides as model compounds for studying the importance of polysaccharides in <b>crumb</b> <b>stability</b> of soils. Various {{attempts have been made to}} relate the exopolysaccharide composition of Rhizobium strains with their specificity in cross-inoculation groups. In a qualitative chemical analysis of exopolysaccharides of Rhizobium leguminosarum, R. trifolii and R. phaseoli, Humphrey & Vincent (1959) found both glucose and glucuronic acid, while strains of R. meliloti were found to contain only glucose. Besides glucose (66 %), Dudman (1964) detected galactose (12 %) and smaller amounts of unidentified sugars in hydrolysates o...|$|E
30|$|In 2002 a {{group of}} Northern Rivers Region farmers develop a soil health {{monitoring}} tool named Northern Rivers Soil Health Card (NRSHC), based on United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) format. A major value of the exercise was the farmer involvement that allowed the card to be customized to fit {{the needs of the}} individual using it. It is simple and effective extension tool for soil quality monitoring using simple rating system that people can use to evaluate and monitor soil health or compare practice effects on soil health. In this process farmer participation was taken, which has facilitated engagement and increased awareness of soil health issues and enabled farmers to self diagnose and solve their own problems (Lobry de Bryun and Abbey 2003). To prepare SHC, soil health indicator of NRSHC method was used in this study. To prepare SHC ground cover percentage were assess using coat hanger quadrate, which put into the ground at random manner and estimated the proportion of bare soil within the frame and subtracted from 100 % (NRSHC 2002). For the infiltration test, the infiltrometer tube was pushed to the soil up to 1 – 2  cm into the soil, avoiding cracks and other holes in the ground. The tube was filled with water and the time was recorded by stopwatch how far the water level had fallen up to 5  min. The rate of infiltration then counted by ratio of water level decrease and time elapsed to infiltrate the total water (NRSHC 2002). For counting the diversity of macro life, the coat hanger quadrate was put on the ground at the undisturbed area and avoid the movement of varieties of soil animals such as ants, beetles, spiders, slaters, millipedes, mites and others were noted (NRSHC 2002). To measure the root development 15  cm square hole of soil surface was cut from the ground. The soil was lifted out as one block placing on the plastic sheet for observing the plant root and recorded on the card (NRSHC 2002). For observing soil structure, a handful of soil away {{from the surface of the}} block was dug up. The size and arrangement of the soil ‘aggregate or crumbs’ were examined under firm finger pressure (NRSHC 2002). To examine the <b>crumbs</b> <b>stability</b> 3 or 4 pea-sized soil crumbs were taken from 5  cm depth for avoiding small stones. The crumbs were merged into 125  ml water at a small wide mouthed jar for 1  min. After 1  min the crumbs were broke apart or stay intact (NRSHC 2002). To count the earthworm content, the total soil block was broken into small crumbs for observation if any worms were found into a jar. Any worm that was longer than 25  mm recorded on the sheet and let them return to the hole (NRSHC 2002). To measure soil pH, two small samples of soil were taken from the side of the hole-one from 5  cm and another from 15  cm depth. These samples were color matched with pH kit. Leaf color and plant growth crop, trees or pasture at the soil test site were observed visually (NRSHC 2002). Organic matter was determined in two soil sample collected from the surface (topsoil) and 25  mm (subsoil) depth. The soil color from the two depths was compared. When the surface color similar to the subsoil color the smell of the soil sample was taken for differentiate. A sweet earthy smell indicates the soil was rich in organic matter (SQCDG 1999). For the seedling emergence about 100 sections of seeded rows were measured with tape and the height of several plants within the row was measured randomly (PNSQCG 2004). Drainage capacity was examined from the farmers interview that how many days rainwater needs to erase from the field totally after a heavy rain such 2, 3, 5 or 7  days. Below 1  day it prefers good, 2 – 3  days indicates the medium and 5 – 7  days indicates the poor drainage capacity of the field (NRSHC 2002).|$|R
