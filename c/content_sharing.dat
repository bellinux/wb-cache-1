5|$|On December 19, 2007, Microsoft {{signed a}} five-year, $500 million {{contract}} with Viacom that included <b>content</b> <b>sharing</b> and advertisements. The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on Xbox Live and MSN. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and Windows. On the advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned web sites. Microsoft also purchased {{a large amount of}} advertising on Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks, and collaborated on promotions and sponsorships for MTV and BET award shows, two Viacom owned cable networks.|$|E

In 2014, DraftKings acquired DraftStreet, as well as StarStreet, and raised another $41 million in investment led by the Raine Group, bringing the company {{to a total of}} $75 million in outside funding.

25|$|Open Content {{licensing}} and Public Domain dedications {{provide the basis}} for open collaboration and <b>content</b> <b>sharing</b> across open-source projects of particular interest to Hebrew readers and students of Judaism. The importance of compatible licensing cannot be understated. In the summer of 2009, content across the Wikimedia Foundation adopted new Open Content licensing in response to incompatibilities between the GNU Free Document license and the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) copyleft license. After this, other non-Wikimedia Foundation projects using Open Content licensing were finally able to exchange content with Wikipedia and Wikisource under a common standard copyleft. This license transition was also significant because Wikisource provided a transcription environment available for multi-user collaboration. With the switch to an Open Content copyleft license, users could collaborate on transcriptions at Wikisource without concern for license incompatibility of the resulting digital editions.|$|E
2500|$|The National School Boards Association {{reports that}} almost 60% of {{students}} who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet {{the vast majority of}} school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school dayâ€”even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educator professional development, and <b>content</b> <b>sharing.</b> HASTAC is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; Ning supports teachers; TermWiki, Learn Central, TeachStreet and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, eportfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have <b>content</b> <b>sharing</b> and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online yearbooks, both public and private. One such service is MyYearbook, which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is [...] private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to Facebook's beginning within Harvard.|$|E

It has also been used for self-organizing sociopolitical activism such as protests, communication with politicians and active communities. Reddit has become a prime location for people worldwide to openly discuss politics.|$|E
