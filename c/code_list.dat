40|$|International audienceMedical {{encoding}} {{support systems}} for diagnoses and medical procedures are an emerging technology that begins {{to play a}} key role in billing, reimbursement, and health policies decisions. A significant problem to exploit these systems is how to measure the appropriateness of any automatically generated <b>list</b> of <b>codes,</b> in terms of fitness for use, i. e. their quality. Until now, only information retrieval performance measurements have been applied to estimate the accuracy of <b>codes</b> <b>lists</b> as quality indicator. Such measurements do not give the value of <b>codes</b> <b>lists</b> for practical medical encoding, and cannot be used to globally compare the quality of multiple <b>codes</b> <b>lists.</b> This paper defines and validates a new encoding information quality measure that addresses the problem of measuring medical <b>codes</b> <b>lists</b> quality. It is based on a usability study of how expert coders and physicians apply computer-assisted medical encoding. The proposed measure, named ADN, evaluates codes Accuracy, Dispersion and Noise, and is adapted to the variable length and content of generated <b>codes</b> <b>lists,</b> coping with limitations of previous measures. According to the ADN measure, the information quality of a <b>codes</b> <b>list</b> is fully represented by a single point, within a suitably constrained feature space. Using one scheme, our approach is reliable to measure and compare the information quality of hundreds of <b>codes</b> <b>lists,</b> showing their practical value for medical encoding. Its pertinence is demonstrated by simulation and application to real data corresponding to 502 inpatient stays in four clinic departments. Results are compared to the consensus of three expert coders who also coded this anonymized database of discharge summaries, and to five information retrieval measures. Information quality assessment applying the ADN measure showed the degree of encoding-support system variability from one clinic department to another, providing a global evaluation of quality measurement trends...|$|R
