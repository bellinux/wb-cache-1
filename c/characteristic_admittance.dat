The devices with different CdS buffer layer thicknesses, with a In 2 S 3 buffer or with a Schottky barrier junction all show the <b>characteristic</b> <b>admittance</b> step at shallow energies between 40 160 meV which has often {{been referred to as}} the N 1 defect. No correlation between the buffer layer thickness and the capacitance step is found, as it would be expected if the N 1 response could be related to an interface donor defect. Temperature dependent current voltage measurements show that the CdS layers are highly resistive at low temperatures where the N 1 step in admittance is observed, with a dielectric relaxation frequency smaller than the resonance frequency of the N 1 response. These results strongly contradict to the common assignment of the N 1 response to a donor defect at or close to the heterointerface. A new explanation for the N 1 response is outlined which assigns the admittance step to a non ohmic back contact acting as a second junction in the device. The effect of a Schottky contact at the Mo CIGS interface on admittance and CV measurements are substantiated with numerical device simulations.

40|$|This {{research}} project is {{primarily concerned with}} {{the development of a new}} generation of power transmission lines for both non-real-time and real-time electromagnetic transient studies. The method proposed is entirely formulated in phase co-ordinates, avoiding the use of modal transformation matrices at every stage in the analysis. In comparison, the phase domain models presented thus far in the open literature have all incorporated the concept of modal decomposition in the initial frequency domain formulation of the problem. Only the time domain analysis is conducted in the phase domain. These models can therefore be regarded as a hybrid between the phase and modal methodologies. Algorithms are presented which allow accurate and efficient determination of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>admittance</b> matrix, Yc(), and wave propagation matrix, H(), directly in phase co-ordinates. A Padé iteration scheme is used for evaluating the <b>characteristic</b> <b>admittance</b> matrix, derived by exploiting a relationship between the matrix sign function and the matrix square root. Padé techniques have also been used to approximate the matrix exponential in order to evaluate the wave propagation function. By evaluating Yc() and H() directly in phase co-ordinates, any imbalances naturally present in the line will intrinsically be taken into account in these functions. Both methods have been extensively tested using line configurations of different size and complexity and both algorithms are shown to be very robust, accurate and efficient in all cases. One of the main difficulties in formulating the analysis entirely in phase co-ordinates for multiconductor systems concerns the unwinding of the wave propagation matrix. This is addressed in this research by evaluating a matrix phase shift function in phase co-ordinates. Since the method inherently takes into account the coupled time delays of the line, the elements of H() can be successfully unwound, irrespective of the configuration of the line, e. g. single-circuit, multi-circuit or asymmetrical...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general methodology {{based on the}} matrix pencil method (MPM) for the fitting of frequency-domain responses {{in order to be}} properly represented in time-domain analysis. By virtue of the proposed method, a rational fitting of the frequency-domain responses can be inferred, which, in turn, helps with their inclusion into time-domain calculations. The proposed technique is well suited for the estimation of any type of function including the case of those with superimposed noise. The main feature of the method is its direct solution, hence avoiding any iteration in the estimation process. Moreover, the method does not require starting poles as opposed to the vector-fitting (VF) method. This paper presents the validation of the proposed approach by fitting the frequency responses of general a priori known functions, artificially created noisy functions and those of power components, namely: the elements of a power transformer admittance matrix and the <b>characteristic</b> <b>admittance</b> and propagation functions of a single-core sheathed cable.

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of HfO 2 -based metal-insulator- semiconductor capacitors have been systematically investigated {{by means of}} I-V and C-V <b>characteristics,</b> <b>admittance</b> spectroscopy, deep level transient spectroscopy, conductance transient, and flat band voltage transient techniques. Attention is also given {{to the study of}} the temperature dependence of the leakage current. HfO 2 films were grown on p-type silicon substrates by atomic layer deposition using hafnium tetrakis(dimethylamide) as hafnium precursor, and ozone or water as oxygen precursors. The growth temperature ranged from 150 to 350 Â°C. Low growth temperatures prevent decomposition and high growth rate, as well as high contamination levels. As a result, the leakage current is lower for lower deposition temperatures. Some of the deposited samples were submitted to a postdeposition annealing at 650 Â°C in N 2 atmosphere, showing a decrease in the leakage current and an increase in the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), whereas interfacial state density increases and defect density inside the dielectric bulk decreases. Regarding dielectric reliability, in our experimental conditions, HfO 2 layers grown at 150 Â°C exhibit the largest EOT and breakdown voltage. The electrical behaviour is clearly linked with structural properties, and especially with the formation of an interfacial layer between the HfO 2 layer and the silicon substrate, as well as with the presence of several impurities.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel parameterization {{scheme based on}} the generalized method of characteristics (MoC) formacromodels of transmission-line structures having a cross section depending on several free geometrical and material parameters. This situation is common in early design stages, when the physical structures {{still have to be}} finalized and optimized under signal integrity and electromagnetic compatibility constraints. The topology of the adopted line macromodels has been demonstrated to guarantee excellent accuracy and efficiency. The key factors are propagation delay extraction and rational approximations, which intrinsically lead to a SPICE-compatible macromodel stamp. We {{introduce a}} scheme that parameterizes this stamp as a function of geometrical and material parameters such as conductor-width and separation, dielectric thickness, and permettivity.

40|$|Summary The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to develope of an improved knowledge about recombination processes and device-limiting factors in Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells. This led to {{the investigation of the}} following main topics: (1) 	The interpretation of controversially discussed defect spectroscopy characteristics in CIGS thin-film solar cells and (2) 	The interpretation of metastable phenomena in CIGS solar cells. Chapter 6 deals with the interpretation of the commonly observed N 1 -admittance contribution which has often been interpreted as a defect contribution at or close to the p/n-heterojunction. For a systematic investigation of this admittance contribution different heterojunctions with a modified interface and modified n-side of the junction have been prepared. The characteristics of the N 1 -admittance step observed for these heterostructures are in contradiction to the previous interpretation of this N 1 -signal. Temperature dependent current-voltage measurements indicate a dielectric relaxation frequency in the CdS layers which is smaller than the N 1 -admittance resonance frequency at low temperatures (100 - 150 K), a fact which excludes a charging of defects at the heterointerface. A new interpretation for the N 1 -response is proposed, in which the N 1 -activation energy is related to a barrier at the CIGS back-contact acting as a second junction in the device. The second diode is also a natural explanation for the occurrence of the roll-over effect in IV curves at low temperatures. The model, which is substantiated with numerical device simulations, allows a unified explanation of <b>characteristic</b> <b>admittance</b> response (N 1), defect profiles (CV) and temperature dependent current-voltage features commonly observed in CIGS solar cells. Chapter 7 describes with light- and bias-induced metastabilities in CIGS thin film solar cells. It was found that the activation energy of the characteristic N 1 -admittance response exhibits metastable behavior. The different effects of metastable conditioning treatments on the admittance response allow the following classification of metastable phenomena: (1) Perturbations whose action is locally restricted to the heterointerface and cause no changes in the N 1 -characteristics; (2) Perturbations that inject electrons at the CIGS back-contact and affect on the N 1 response. The occurrence of the roll-over effect in IVT characteristics directly correlates with these changes of the N 1 -activation energy and an assumed barrier height at the back-contact. These findings support the reinterpretation of the N 1 -response. Red light soaking causes an enhanced space charge density as well as a reduced N 1 -activation energy which is in conflict with the earlier interpretation of the N 1 as a defect contribution at the heterointerface but is consistent with the new interpretation of N 1 contribution. The investigation of the relaxation dynamics clearly indicates that the physical origin of the red light soaking and reverse bias effect has to be distinguished and that both effects can not be explained within one model assuming an identical physical origin for both effects. As a consequence of the N 1 reinterpretation Fermi level pinning at the heterointerface is not required. This allows the description of the blue light soaking effect as a metastable change of the CdS buffer layer...|$|E
