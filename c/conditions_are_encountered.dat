50|$|Ideally, {{a shooter}} would acquire rounds {{from a single}} lot or batch of {{manufactured}} ammunition, zero the rifle to that lot, and then use only that ammunition until it runs out. This ensures that every bullet is as similar {{as possible to the}} previous one, and assists consistency. However, this is rarely practicable. A sniper will enter information into a Data On Previous Engagement (DOPE) book, such as lot number, temperature, wind speed/direction, humidity and altitude. If the same <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> <b>encountered</b> again, the data is available to assist in making an accurate shot.

5000|$|Alpine <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> <b>encountered</b> above 2,500m and {{the special}} {{features}} of high mountains are enhanced by the dryness of the climate.

The most important botanical characteristic is the presence of a hundred or so plants found nowhere else in Morocco, many of them endemic. The sub-alpine and alpine zones are both heavily overgrazed in many areas and this has left a mark on the vegetation. The success of plants such as Vicia canescens and Erodium trichomanifolium is undoubtedly {{due to the fact that}} they are unpalatable to goats.|$|E

50|$|The mud in the {{wellbore}} must exert enough {{hydrostatic pressure}} to equal the formation pore pressure. If the fluid’s hydrostatic pressure {{is less than}} formation pressure the well can flow.The most common reason for insufficient fluid density is drilling into unexpected abnormally pressured formations. This situation usually arises when unpredicted geological <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> <b>encountered.</b> Such as drilling across a fault that abruptly changes the formation being drilled.Mishandling mud at the surface accounts for many instances of insufficient fluid weight. Such as opening wrong valve on the pump suction manifold and allowing a tank of light weight fluid to be pumped; bumping the water valve so more is added than intended; washing off shale shakers; or clean-up operations. All of these can affect mud weight.|$|E

50|$|Podosphaera macularis overwinters on {{the soil}} surface in debris as fungal {{survival}} structures (chasmothecia) or as mycelia in plant buds. These chasmothecia are formed closer {{to the end of}} the growing season. The characteristic morphology of chasmothecia of Hop Powdery Mildew are spherical black structures with spiked appendages. When favorable <b>conditions</b> <b>are</b> <b>encountered</b> during early spring, the asci (sac-like structures) within chasmothecia will rupture and ascospores will be discharged. Specifically, the favorable conditions for ascospore release include low light, excess fertility, and high soil moisture. Additionally, optimal infection is observed when the temperature is between 18 and 25 °C. Furthermore, the ascospores act as the primary inoculum and are dispersed passively by wind. Upon encountering a susceptible host plant, the ascospores will germinate and cause infection. Following infection, masses of asexual spores (conidia) will be produced during the season. It is these masses of conidia that contribute to the characteristic white, powdery appearance of infected plants. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the disease can appear on any part of the plant that is above the ground. These conidia are dispersed through wind. Thus, Podosphaera macularis is a polycyclic pathogen as conidia are produced/dispersed during the growing season and can further infect additional host plants. Particularly, the disease will be noticeable on infected plants as soon as the hop shoots start to emerge with the latent period being approximately 10 days at 12 and 15°C compared to 5 days at 18-27°C. These spore-covered shoots that emerge from infected buds are called “flag shoots” and will be stunted with distorted leaves. Periods of rapid plant growth are the most favorable for infection. In addition, the period in which lateral branch development takes place within the plants is also very vulnerable to the development of the disease. Due to Podosphaera macularis causing local infection, only the location of the host plant tissue where spores have landed will develop the disease.|$|E
