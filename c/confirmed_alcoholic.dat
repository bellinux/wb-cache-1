50|$|For {{the next}} decade, Cooke was an erratic star in London. Already a <b>confirmed</b> <b>alcoholic</b> when he arrived, he grew {{steadily}} less reliable as his career progressed. Already in 1801, {{he was unable}} to perform because he was drunk; such failures became more frequent in later years. In 1807, after failing to appear for his summer season in Manchester, he was jailed in Westmorland for several months. In the last years of the decade, he managed to curb his excesses to some extent; he was, for instance, frequently on stage during the Old Price riots.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} hindrances to the {{treatment}} of alcoholics is their constant attempts to prove to us their ability to cope with their problems, when in fact they cannot cope with them. Such overestimation of subjective control is not often found in other cases of clinical practice. By contracting results from two psychometric tests - the MHLC (Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, Wallston, 1978; a questionnaire which investigates the subjective degree of control in relation to health) and the GEFT (Group Embedded Figures test, Witkin, 1971; a questionnaire which focuses more on actual behavior and field-dependency) - we attempted to highlight this overestimation phenomenon. The results of this study <b>confirm</b> that <b>alcoholics</b> are more prone to subjectively overestimating their sk ills compared to other subjects...|$|R
40|$|Previously, {{one of us}} (B. K. T.) {{developed}} an assay that measures levels of free ethanol and ethanol conjugates in urine and showed that the mean levels of these ethanol markers in <b>confirmed</b> <b>alcoholics</b> were at least 20 -fold higher than those levels in control subjects. In this study, we assessed the relationship of these biomarkers with self-reported levels of alcohol intake in a multiethnic sample of Los Angeles County residents who were male and {{over the age of}} 35 years (n 128; 40 non-Hispanic whites, 46 blacks, 17 Chinese, and 25 Japanese). Regardless of race, the mean levels of free, bound, and total (free plus bound) ethanol were lowest in nondrinkers, intermediate in weekly drinkers, and highest in daily drinkers (P 0. 0001 in all three statistical tests of differences in the three biomarkers). Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that of the three potential biomarkers, total ethanol best discriminates between the three classes of drinkers (non, weekly, and daily), and that additional inclusion of either free or bound ethanol in the discriminant function had negligible effect. Overall, mean level of total ethanol was 2. 2 times higher in weekly than in nondrinkers; daily drinkers, in turn, showed a 4. 2 -fold increase in mean total ethanol relative to weekly drinkers. However, there was no correlation between any of the three biomarkers and self-reported level (in grams of ethanol) of average consumption in either weekly or daily drinkers whose mean intake was about 13 and 42 g of ethanol/day, respectively. As the level of urinary free ethanol and ethanol conjugates showed extraordinary differences among racial groups for a given bevel of self-reported ethanol intake, the data suggest possible interracial differences in the in vivo elimination rate of ethanol; this latter finding needs to be confirmed in larger studies...|$|R

40|$|Alcohol {{continues}} {{to occupy a}} leading position in Europe as a popular substance of abuse. Together with cigarette smoking and obesity, alcohol is {{a major cause of}} preventable diseases. Harmful use of alcohol {{is one of the main}} factors contributing to premature deaths and disability and has a major impact on public health. The consequences of alcohol use on human health are enormous. Additionally, alcohol use can have harmful effects that do not directly affect the person who consumes alcohol (e. g. fetal alcohol syndrome, violations that are related to alcohol use…) Also, the harmful effects and consequences of alcohol use (e. g. acute and chronic illness, injuries in fights, at the workplace, in traffic, violent behavior, and death) create a great burden for the economic development of a society. Unfortunately, <b>confirmed</b> <b>alcoholics</b> that are still drinking are unlikely to be given a life insurance cover. On the other hand, if a person is now a recovering alcoholic with a considerable abstinence period, he/she may hope to get a good life insurance quote. Usually, a year or two is believed to be an adequate amount of time for a person to get a life insurance cover at an average price. However, this is only possible if the alcohol did not cause serious health issues to the person. Furthermore, relapsing after impatient rehabilitation can be viewed as an aggravating factor to get a life insurance. So far the research focused on the effects on the population level, such as the increase in taxes, advertising bans and the implementation of laws that prevent the use of alcohol in traffic. However, it seems that the problem may be viewed at the individual level. In any case, models of treatment should be tailored to the needs of the individual. These models should incorporate the reduction of alcohol intake, but also the path to abstinence. The plan should take into account the different (individual) needs for treatment, with regard to the degree of alcohol dependence and health status, but also include the needs of the family, community and broader society...|$|R
40|$|Attachment {{difficulties}} {{have been}} proposed as a key risk factor {{for the development of}} alexithymia, a multifaceted personality trait characterised by difficulties identifying and describing feelings, a lack of imagination and an externally oriented thinking style. The present study investigated the relationship between attachment and alexithymia in an alcohol dependent population. Participants were 210 outpatients in a Cognitive Behavioural Treatment Program assessed on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS- 20) and the Revised Adult Attachment Scale (RAAS). Significant relationships between anxious attachment and alexithymia factors were <b>confirmed.</b> Furthermore, alexithymic <b>alcoholics</b> reported significantly higher levels of anxious attachment and significantly lower levels of closeness (secure attachment) compared to non-alexithymic alcoholics.

40|$|Context: Heartwood of Pterocarpus {{marsupium}} {{has been}} widely reported for its effect on diabetes clinical or preclinically. However, role in diabetic complications {{is yet to be}} revealed. Aims: To investigate the effect of alcoholic extract of the heartwood of Pterocarpus marsupiumin experimentally induced diabetic nephropathy in rats. Methods: The streptozotocin (STZ) 55 mg/kg, i. p., once daily induced diabetes in Sprague-Dawley rats. These animals were treated orally with alcoholic extract of P. marsupium (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) or glimepiride (10 mg/kg) for 60 days. Body weight, blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA 1 c), biochemical markers of renal function were estimated on day 30 {{and at the end of}} study (day 60). Kidney weight measurement, oxidative stress markers such as lipid peroxidation (TBARS), catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione were estimated in kidney tissues, and histopathological evaluation was carried out at the end of study period. Results: The administration of an alcoholic extract of P. marsupium showed a decrease in blood glucose, HBA 1 c, kidney weight, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum uric acid, urea, urine volume, urine albumin and the level of TBARS. While the increase in urine creatinine, the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione were observed when compared to the diabetic control group. This effect was observed significantly at the highest dose of the plant extract. The histopathological study also <b>confirmed</b> that <b>alcoholic</b> extract prevented structural kidney damage. Conclusions: These results suggest that the alcoholic extract of P. marsupium has renoprotective effects against STZ induced diabetic nephropathy...|$|R
40|$|Using an {{indirect}} immunofluorescence technique, circulating liver membrane antibodies against normal rabbit hepatocytes and ethanol-altered rabbit hepatocytes have been sought {{in a series}} of patients with histologically <b>confirmed</b> <b>alcoholic</b> liver disease. Liver membrane antibodies against normal hepatocytes were found in 18 (28 %) of the 65 sera examined, but with ethanol-altered hepatocytes as substrate liver membrane antibodies were found in 48 (74 %) of the sera. Isolation of F(ab') 2 fragments confirmed that the positive results were due to antibody binding. Liver membrane antibodies against ethanol-altered hepatocytes are peculiar to alcoholic liver disease, and there is a similar incidence in the various histological types of alcoholic liver disease. Absorption studies suggest that the liver membrane antibodies are directed against new or altered antigens which are not present in normal hepatocytes. These new or altered antigens may also appear after pretreatment with other primary alcohols and seem likely to be induced by a haptenic effect of the alcohol or a metabolic break-down product.

40|$|Chronic alcohol induces {{acetylation}} and methylation of chromatin-associated histones {{that influence}} transcriptional activity of genes. Molecular chaperone {{heat shock protein}} 90 (hsp 90) is being recognized as mediator of chromatin remodeling and is upregulated in alcoholic liver disease. We hypothesize that hsp 90 plays {{a pivotal role in}} altered expression of chromatin modifying enzymes during alcoholic liver injury. To test our hypotheses, C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were fed Lieber-deCarli diet with 5 % v/v ethanol for 10 days followed by a binge containing 20 %v/v alcohol. A single injection of hsp 90 inhibitor, 17 -DMAG [17 -Dimethylamino-ethylamino- 17 -demethoxygeldanamycin] was administered (30 - 50 mg/kg BW) i. p. before the binge. Epigenetic PCR array analyzing chromatin modifying enzyme expression was employed to determine effect of chronic alcohol and 17 -DMAG treatment. Elevated ALT, triglycerides and steatosis <b>confirmed</b> <b>alcoholic</b> liver injury. Results show significant up-regulation of 5 genes including, ATF 2 (p= 0. 0003), a transcription factor with histone acetyltransferase activity, PRMT 6 (p= 0. 0001) and SETD 7 (p= 0. 002), protein methyltransferases, RPS 6 KA 3 (p= 4. 4 e- 6) kinase and HDAC 3 (p= 0. 0001) whereas HDAC 9 (p= 0. 002) was decreased in alcoholic whole livers. Further, ATF 2 was exclusively up-regulated in Kupffer cells (KCs) while PRMT 6 increased in alcoholic hepatocytes. HDAC 3, SETD 7 and RPS 6 KA 3 were increased in both, alcoholic KCs and hepatocytes. HDAC 9 was exclusively down regulated in alcohol exposed hepatocytes but not in KCs. Inhibition of hsp 90 by 17 -DMAG after chronic alcohol exposure alleviated liver injury as noted by significantly lowered serum ALT, TBARS and liver triglycerides. Interestingly, 17 -DMAG treatment prevented upregulation of ATF 2 (p= 3. 13 e- 5), PRMT 6 (p= 0. 001) and HDAC 3 (p= 0. 001) and inhibited down regulation of HDAC 9 (p= 2. 6 e- 8) without any effect on expression of SETD 7 and RPS 6 KA 3 genes in liver. In summary, our data indicate that chronic alcohol exposure regulates chromatin modifying epigenetic genes in a cell-specific manner likely via molecular chaperone, hsp 90. Inhibition of hsp 90 leads to modulation of chromatin modifying enzymes with resolution of liver injury. (Supported by the NIH/NIAAA # AA 179086...|$|E
40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) {{have revealed}} genetic determinants of iron metabolism, but correlation of these with clinical phenotypes is pending. Homozygosity for HFE C 282 Y is the predominant genetic {{risk factor for}} hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and may cause liver cirrhosis. However, this genotype has a low penetrance. Thus, detection of yet unknown genetic markers that identify patients at risk of developing severe liver disease is necessary for better prevention. Genetic loci associated with iron metabolism (TF, TMPRSS 6, PCSK 7, TFR 2 and Chr 2 p 14) in recent GWAS and liver fibrosis (PNPLA 3) in recent meta-analysis were analyzed for association with either liver cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis in 148 German HFE C 282 Y homozygotes. Replication of associations was sought in additional 499 Austrian/Swiss and 112 HFE C 282 Y homozygotes from Sweden. Only variant rs 236918 in the PCSK 7 gene (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7) was associated with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis (P = 1. 02 × 10 − 5) in the German cohort with genotypic odds ratios of 3. 56 (95 % CI 1. 29 - 9. 77) for CG heterozygotes and 5. 38 (95 % CI 2. 39 - 12. 10) for C allele carriers. Association between rs 236918 and cirrhosis was confirmed in Austrian/Swiss HFE C 282 Y homozygotes (P = 0. 014; ORallelic = 1. 82 (95 % CI 1. 12 - 2. 95) but not in Swedish patients.
