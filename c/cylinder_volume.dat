2500|$|The usual {{arrangement}} on {{a compound}} engine {{is that the}} steam is first expanded {{in one or two}} high-pressure (HP) cylinder(s), then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts into a larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinder, (or two, - or more), thus extending the cycle. Thus the cylinders can be said to work in [...] "series" [...] as opposed to the normal arrangement of a simple-expansion locomotive where they work in [...] "parallel", the steam being expanded just once in any one cylinder. In order to balance piston thrusts of a compound, the HP:LP <b>cylinder</b> <b>volume</b> ratio has to be carefully determined, usually by increasing the LP cylinder diameter and/or by lengthening the stroke. [...] In non-condensing engines, the HP:LP volume ratio is usually 1:2¼. [...] On geared locomotives, cylinder volumes can be kept more or less identical by increasing LP piston speed. [...] Strictly speaking compound only stands for double-expansion, but the term is loosely applied to any multiple-expansion engine. The instances where railway locomotives have employed triple-expansion with steam going from high-pressure (HP) cylinder, to medium-pressure (MP) cylinder and finally to a low-pressure (LP) one are rare, but triple-expansion engines were very common in steamships in the late 19th/early 20th centuries.|$|E

Kinematic relations were described for {{the calculation of}} hot and cold <b>cylinder</b> <b>volumes.</b> The instantaneous temperature distribution of the working fluid, through the heating–cooling passages and regenerator, was calculated by preparing a nodal analysis in FORTRAN. Effect of phase angle variation on work generation was examined. By using three different convective heat transfer coefficient, which were 200, 300, and 400 W/m 2 K, variation of work generation with working fluid mass was examined. For the same values of convective heat transfer coefficient, variation of engine power versus the engine speed was examined...|$|R

40|$|Suction {{pressure}} pulsations created when the suction valve opens {{are caused by}} unsteady mass flow through the valve exciting acoustic resonances in the suction plenum. These {{pressure pulsations}} influence valve dynamics, compressor performance and compressor noise. This paper will show the importance of including the <b>cylinder</b> bore <b>volume</b> in the flow path analysis in order to accurately calculate pressure pulsations. Pressure pulsations will be calculated using Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method in a quasi-static solution. The method models the impedance of the suction plenum flow path including <b>cylinder</b> bore <b>volume</b> using a static geometry condition just after the suction valve opens. The interaction between the suction plenum, suction valve port geometry, and <b>cylinder</b> bore <b>volume</b> influence acoustic resonances in this system. These resonances cause pressure pulsations that effect valve dynamics. This paper uncouples {{the dynamics of the}} suction valve from the pressure pulsation modeling. This was done to specifically look at pressure pulsation created due to refrigerant volume flow through the suction valve and suction plenum acoustic resonances without valve dynamics influencing pressure pulsation. The paper then compares simulated suction plenum pressure pulsations when the valve opens to measured pressure pulsation in a reciprocating residential HVAC compressor with good agreement...|$|R

40|$|Taking a {{partially}} penetrating vertical {{well as a}} uniform line sink in three-dimensional space, by developing necessary mathematical analysis, this paper presents unsteady-state pressure drop equations for an off-center partially penetrating vertical well in a circular <b>cylinder</b> drainage <b>volume</b> with constant pressure at outer boundary. First, the point sink solution to the diffusivity equation is derived, then using superposition principle, pressure drop equations for a uniform line sink model are obtained. This paper also gives an equation to calculate pseudoskin factor due to partial penetration. The proposed equations provide fast analytical tools to evaluate {{the performance of a}} vertical well which is located arbitrarily in a circular <b>cylinder</b> drainage <b>volume.</b> It is concluded that the well off-center distance has significant effect on well pressure drop behavior, but it does not have any effect on pseudoskin factor due to partial penetration. Because the outer boundary is at constant pressure, when producing time is sufficiently long, steady-state is definitely reached. When well producing length is equal to payzone thickness, the pressure drop equations for a fully penetrating well are obtained...|$|R
