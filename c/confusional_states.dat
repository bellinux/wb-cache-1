2500|$|Tobacco {{and alcohol}} {{are the most}} common {{substances}} that elderly people get a dependence on or misuse. The next-most-common substance that elderly people develop a drug dependence to or misuse is benzodiazepines. Drug-induced cognitive problems can have serious consequences for elderly people and can lead to <b>confusional</b> <b>states</b> and [...] "pseudo-dementia". About 10% of elderly patients referred to memory clinics actually have a drug-induced cause that most often is benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines have also been linked to an increased risk of road traffic accidents and falls in the elderly. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines are still not fully understood in the elderly or any age group. Long-term benzodiazepine use is associated with attentional and visuospatial functional impairments. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines can lead to improved alertness and decreased forgetfulness in the elderly. Withdrawal led to statistical significant improvements in memory function and performance related skills in those having withdrawn successfully from benzodiazepines, whereas those having remained on benzodiazepines experienced worsening symptoms. People having withdrawn from benzodiazepines also felt their sleep was more refreshing, making statements such as [...] "I feel sharper when I wake up" [...] or [...] "I feel better, more awake", or [...] "It used to take me an hour to fully wake up." [...] This suggests that benzodiazepines may actually make insomnia worse in the elderly.|$|E

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of cognitive rehabilitative {{treatment in the}} acute stages after brain injury seems questionable because patients in severe acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> early after coma clinically seem unable to learn and store new information. Therefore, the capability of patients in acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> to learn and retain associative information was assessed. On two occasions pairs of simple nouns were presented to six patients in severe acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state.</b> Stimuli were presented repeatedly either in written form only or with additional pictorial representations. Immediate and 20 minutes delayed recall was measured. Patients in acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> were able to learn progressively more word pairs across several presentations. They retained some information over an interval of 20 minutes. In addition, they learned and remembered pictorially supported associations better than pure verbal associations. Patients in severe acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> may retain some explicit information and may profit from an imagery mnemonic aid.

50|$|Fatal {{familial}} insomnia (FFI) is {{an extremely}} rare autosomal dominant inherited prion disease of the brain. It is almost always caused by a mutation to the protein PrPC, but can also develop spontaneously in patients with a non-inherited mutation variant called sporadic fatal insomnia (sFI). FFI has no known cure and involves progressively worsening insomnia, which leads to hallucinations, delirium, <b>confusional</b> <b>states</b> like that of dementia, and eventually, death. The average survival time for patients diagnosed with FFI after the onset of symptoms is 18 months.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, {{research}} conducted by US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found, on average, 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy. In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that - as some theorists argue - human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings. Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, <b>confusional</b> <b>states,</b> conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.|$|E
5000|$|Postpartum infective {{delirium}} {{was described}} by Hippocrates: 8/17 female cases in the 1st and 3rd books of epidemics suffered from postpartum or post-abortion sepsis, all complicated by delirium. In Europe and North America {{the foundation of the}} metropolitan maternity hospitals, together with instrumental deliveries and the practice of attending necropsies, led to epidemics of streptococcal puerperal fever, resulting in maternal mortality rates up to 10%. The peak was about 1870, after which antisepsis and asepsis gradually brought them under control. These severe infections were often complicated by delirium, {{but it was not until}} the nosological advances of Chaslin [...] and Bonhöffer [...] that they could be distinguished from other causes of postpartum psychosis. Infective delirium hardly ever starts during pregnancy, and usually begins in the first postpartum week. The onset of sepsis and delirium are closely related, and the course parallels the infection, although about 20% of patients recover from the infection, but develop chronic <b>confusional</b> <b>states.</b> Recurrences after another pregnancy are rare.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} seven {{patients}} with neurosurgical disease {{treated in a}} combined neurosurgical, neurological, and psychiatric unit within a psychiatric service were reviewed retrospectively. Most patients had acute <b>confusional</b> <b>states</b> or dementia without gross localizing signs and in only three cases did the neurosurgical illness closely resemble a non-organic psychiatric syndrome. The great majority showed abnormalities on physical examination and simple investigations. A past history of alcoholism and/or other psychiatric illness was common.

30|$|MICU {{delirium}} {{was assessed}} daily {{during the first}} week of admission by trained research staff using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) [29]. Using criteria previously validated in both ICU and non-ICU patients, research staff also performed daily patient chart review for evidence of delirium or acute confusion episodes by assessing flow sheets and physician and nursing notes [30, 31]. This involved chart abstraction for CAM-ICU documentation and evidence of key terms and descriptors suggestive of an acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state,</b> with coding based on the question “Is there any evidence from the chart of acute <b>confusional</b> <b>state</b> (for example, delirium, mental status change, inattention, disorientation, hallucinations, agitation, inappropriate behavior, or other)?” [30, 31].
