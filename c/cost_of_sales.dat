Sales are generally recorded at market value, i.e. the value at which the marketplace paid for the good or service provided by the firm. In the event that the firm had an exceptional year and the market paid a premium for the firm's goods and services then the numerator may be an inaccurate measure.

This study uses data from 34 samples during year 2007 – 2009. It is an empirical study using regression model with dummy variable. Therefore, before conducting hypothesis testing, the classic assumption testing was done. Beside that, t-test was done and shows there is significant average difference of profit or loss volatility in company using average method and FIFO method. The results show that: Inventory valuation method has significant influence toward profit or loss volatility. But, inventory valuation method doesn’t have significant influence toward ROA and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> volatility using 95 % level of confidence.
