5|$|Since exp(1) {{is equal}} to e and exp(x) {{satisfies}} this exponential identity, it immediately follows that exp(x) <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> the repeated-multiplication definition of e'x for integer x, and it also follows that rational powers denote (positive) roots as usual, so exp(x) <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> the e'x definitions {{in the previous section}} for all real x by continuity.|$|E

5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard. This sound generally <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> {{the death of a}} major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.|$|E

A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the Balmoral, the Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea.

5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 years ago, {{explosive}} activity {{occurred at}} Ciomadul. That timespan <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> the deposition of tephra from volcanoes in Italy in Europe; {{it is possible}} that tephra also came from Ciomadul. Indeed, the age of Ciomadul's last eruption overlaps with the age of the Campanian Ignimbrite. Some tephra layers found in two drilling cores of the Black Sea may have originated at Ciomadul.|$|E
5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda {{has been defined as}} the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E

5|$|Epiacum {{was built}} {{early in the}} 2nd century. It was at least partly {{demolished}} and rebuilt around 200; the destruction <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> an uprising of the northern tribes in 196. The fort was modified or wholly rebuilt about the year 300. It {{appears to have been}} preceded by an Iron Age fort, followed by a Roman camp before the permanent fort was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E

Between Kalamazoo and Marshall it passes through Comstock, Galesburg, Augusta, and Battle Creek intersecting I-194/M-66 in Battle Creek and I-94 in Emmett Township.|$|E

5|$|Route 139 is {{essentially}} three distinct, but connected highways: the upper level, the lower level, and the Holland Tunnel approach (the Interstate78 concurrency).

5|$|The Temple of the Warriors bears {{iconography}} depicting feathered serpents {{associated with}} Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This {{means that the}} building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it <b>coincides</b> <b>with</b> the rainy season) may be meaningful. However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.|$|E
