40|$|The present article aims to {{emphasize}} the potential inconsistencies which can occur in practice between a person’s <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> and the <b>civil</b> registry documents which prove the respective status. Jurisprudence in this domain shows that there are numerous situations when a person’s <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> is inconsistent with the <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>documents,</b> an inconsistency which must be corrected. The lawmaker provides the necessary tools, such as rectification, when the <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>documents</b> contain wrongful mentions, by way of administrative or civil action. In case the inconsistency occurs between the apparent <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> and the real one, the inconsistency must be corrected by legal action...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} article aims {{to present}} {{an analysis of the}} legislation related to the legal framework of the nullity in the matter of <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>documents.</b> The analysis begins with an overview of the legal provisions applicable to nullity in general, and it continues with the presentation of the cases in which the <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>documents</b> can be annulled, pointing out the specific characteristics of marriage nullity. Last but not least, a special attention is paid to the applicability of the principle error communis facit ius in the matter of <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>documents.</b> The article ends with a series of conclusions related to the theme chosen, stressing the need to concentrate the legal provisions governing public administration in an administrative code which is intended to be an easy tool in the hands of public functionaries. </p...|$|R

50|$|To be {{eligible}} for an apostille, a document must first be issued or certified by an officer recognised by the authority that will issue the apostille. For example, in the US state of Vermont, the Secretary of State maintains specimen signatures of all notaries public, so documents that have been notarised are eligible for apostilles. Likewise, courts in the Netherlands are eligible of placing an apostille on all municipal <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>documents</b> directly. In some cases, intermediate certifications may be required {{in the country in}} which the document originates before it will {{be eligible}} for an apostille. For example, in New York City, the Office of Vital Records (which issues, among other things, birth certificates) is not directly recognised by the New York Secretary of State. As a consequence, the signature of the City Clerk must be certified by the County Clerk of New York County to make the birth certificate eligible for an apostille. In Japan all the official documents are issued in Japanese language, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA, JAPAN) then provides an apostille for these documents. In India the apostille certification can be obtained from the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi, after authenticated by the administration of the Indian state where was issued the document (for educational documents).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the Tampere and Stockholm programmes have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and enforcement of civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the European enforcement order for uncontested claims, and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct enforcement of judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (abolition of exequatur). Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for refusal of recognition (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member State of enforcement. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> <b>documents...</b>|$|R
50|$|In Canada {{a person}} can informally call {{themselves}} whatever they want. In all provinces except Quebec, when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their Marriage Certificate as verification of the name change. It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for Ontario, British Columbia and New Brunswick, Canadians must be 18 to change their names and {{have lived in the}} province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In New Brunswick and British Columbia, Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in Ontario 16.) People younger than the province's age of majority can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a common law marriage. To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of <b>civil</b> <b>status.</b> A <b>document</b> such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province. British Columbia and Alberta need fingerprints to be submitted before one changes their name.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{measurement}} is {{a modern}} managerial instrument used to quantitatively express the outputs and outcomes of certain public organizations. These pieces of information are then used to make rational decisions about organization’s future functioning. Performance measurement is a highly advocated instrument whose importance has expanded since the 1980 s and it is being used by {{a growing number of}} countries. Croatia is presently at the beginning stage of performance measurement implementation. The purpose of the paper is to explain the legal regulation of performance measurement momentarily existing in Croatian state, regional and local administration de lege lata, and to assess the real effect which this regulation has led to. This is done by using the data provided by a number of conducted researches and the review of relevant literature. The purpose of the paper is also to suggest changes for further expansion of performance measurement in Croatian public administration. Methodologically, the paper is based on legal analysis of the regulation in five sectors: financial management and control, state audit, strategic planning, internal organization and <b>civil</b> servants’ <b>status,</b> secondary <b>documents</b> analysis and questionnaire research results...|$|R

50|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>status</b> {{and marital}} status are terms used in forms, vital records, and other {{documents}} to ask or indicate whether a person is married or single.

A person's specified <b>civil</b> <b>status</b> might also be married {{if they are in}} a civil union or common-law marriage.
