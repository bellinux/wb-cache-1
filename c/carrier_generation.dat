2500|$|In {{solid-state}} physics, a band gap, {{also called}} an energy gap or bandgap, is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist. In graphs {{of the electronic}} band structure of solids, the band gap generally refers to the energy difference (in electron volts) between {{the top of the}} valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors. [...] It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a conduction electron, which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. [...] It is closely related to the HOMO/LUMO gap in chemistry. If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty, then electrons cannot move in the solid; however, if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band, then current can flow (see <b>carrier</b> <b>generation</b> and recombination). Therefore, the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid. Substances with large band gaps are generally insulators, those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors, while conductors either have very small band gaps or none, because the valence and conduction bands overlap.|$|E
