40|$|Safety {{critical}} avionics {{software is}} a natural application area for formal verification. This {{is reflected in the}} formal method's inclusion into the <b>certification</b> <b>guideline</b> DO- 178 C and its formal methods supplement DO- 333. Airbus and Dassault-Aviation, for example, have conducted studies in using formal verification. A large German national research project, Verisoft XT, also examined the application of formal methods in the avionics domain. However, formal methods are not yet mainstream, and it is questionable if formal verification, especially formal deduction, can be integrated into the software development processes of a resource constrained small or medium enterprise (SME). ESG, a Munich based medium sized company, has conducted a small experimental study on the application of formal verification on a small portion of a real avionics project. The low level specification of a software function was formalized with ACSL, and the corresponding source code was partially verified using Frama-C and the WP plugin, with Alt-Ergo as automated prover. We established a couple of criteria which a method should meet to be fit for purpose for industrial use in SME, and evaluated these criteria with the experience gathered by using ACSL with Frama-C on a real world example.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} stress histories for the fatigue analysis {{is of utmost}} importance for the design process of wind turbine rotor blades. As detailed, transient, and geometrically non-linear three-dimensional finite element analyses are computationally weigh too expensive, it is commonly regarded sufficient to calculate the stresses with a geometrically linear analysis and superimpose different stress states {{in order to obtain}} the complete stress histories. In order to quantify the error from geometrically linear simulations for the calculation of stress histories and to verify the practical applicability of the superposition principal in fatigue analyses, this paper studies the influence of geometric non-linearity in the example of a trailing edge bond line, as this subcomponent suffers from high strains in span-wise direction. The blade under consideration is that of the IWES IWT- 7. 5 - 164 reference wind turbine. From turbine simulations the highest edgewise loading scenario from the fatigue load cases is used as the reference. A 3 D finite element model of the blade is created and the bond line fatigue assessment is performed according to the GL <b>certification</b> <b>guidelines</b> in its 2010 edition, and in comparison to the latest DNV GL standard from end of 2015. The results show {{a significant difference between the}} geometrically linear and non-linear stress analyses when the bending moments are approximated via a corresponding external loading, especially in case of the 2010 GL <b>certification</b> <b>guidelines.</b> This finding emphasizes the demand to reconsider the application of the superposition principal in fatigue analyses of modern flexible rotor blades, where geometrical nonlinearities become significant.

40|$|Abstract. Software {{for use in}} {{aviation}} requires certification. This certification {{is based on a}} safety argument.

Safety cases (sometimes called safety arguments) link claims and evidence in support of an overall safety argument. This paper argues that it is rational to have an adaptive safety argument for an adaptive system. This is illustrated by considering an adaptive controller that uses Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) to generate both control laws and a safety argument, represented using Goal-Structuring Notation. An adaptive safety argument, when coupled with analytical tools, could be used to form the adaptive portion of an otherwise standards-based certification argument. If the rest of the argument holds then the argument should hold for any state where the adaptive safety cases remain valid. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} RNP AR approach procedures {{which have}} been designed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Institute of Flight Guidance {{in the course of}} the LufoIV project HETEREX. The approaches purpose is to reduce the noise impact of approaching aircraft at an airport. Approaches with vertical guidance need a straight segment of about 10 NM prior to touchdown due to technical and operational, i. e. safety reasons. In case settlements are located on the extended centreline nearer than 10 NM to the airport, these settlements can not be circumnavigated. With GPS and vertical navigation based on the barometric system, approaches with vertical guidance do not need a straight segment of 10 NM prior to touchdown anymore. Those approaches have first been developed and certified for mountainous regions, where straight segments of up to 10 NM were impossible due to the terrain around the airport. Operations to these airports were limited to good weather situations only. With the precision of GPS in conjunction with a barometric vertical navigation system (BARO VNAV), those airports can now be operated to in much more inclement weather situations regarding visibility and cloud bases. In 2010, ICAO released a <b>certification</b> <b>guideline</b> for those approaches with curved segments nearer than 10 NM to the airport, called RNP AR for Required Navigation Performance, Authorization Required. In Germany, no airports with the need for RNP AR approaches due to mountainous terrain exist. Nevertheless, RNP AR approaches with their possibility of curved segments nearer than 10 NM prior to touchdown provide the possibility to design approaches which avoid settlements that lie under the extended centreline of a runway and are nearer than 10 NM to an airport. In this paper, five approaches to the airport of Nuremberg are presented which lead approaching aircraft around several towns near Nuremberg which with the currently applied approach procedures can not be circumnavigated and thus are impacted by the noise of arrival traffic. These approaches show how RNP AR can be used to improve airports’ acceptance by surrounding communities. The five example approaches at Nuremberg are presented together with the design rules that determine their exact shape as well as the population areas that can be circumnavigated with these approaches. Their potential to further reduce fuel consumption and thus production of CO 2 by shortening the length of approach procedures is also presented.
