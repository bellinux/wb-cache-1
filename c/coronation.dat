5|$|Banquets {{have not}} been held at Westminster Hall since the <b>coronation</b> of GeorgeIV in 1821. His <b>coronation</b> was the most {{elaborate}} in history; his brother and successor WilliamIV eliminated the banquet on grounds of economy, ending a 632-year-old tradition. Since 1901, a <b>Coronation</b> Fleet Review has also been held. To celebrate the <b>coronation,</b> a <b>coronation</b> honours list is also released before the <b>coronation.</b>|$|E

50|$|R. M.

5|$|Coronations may be {{performed}} {{for a person}} other than the reigning monarch. In 1170, Henry the Young King, heir apparent to the throne, was crowned as a second king of England, subordinate to his father HenryII; such coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but this {{is only one of}} two instances of its kind in England (the other being that of Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796, crowned whilst his father, Offa of Mercia, was still alive). More commonly, a king's wife is crowned as queen consort. If the king is already married {{at the time of his}} <b>coronation,</b> a joint <b>coronation</b> of both king and queen may {{be performed}}. The first such <b>coronation</b> was of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154; seventeen such coronations have been performed, including that of the co-rulers William III and MaryII. The most recent was that of GeorgeVI and the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1937. If the king married, or remarried, after his <b>coronation,</b> or if his wife were not crowned with him for some other reason, she might be crowned in a separate ceremony. The first such separate <b>coronation</b> of a queen consort in England was that of Matilda of Flanders in 1068; the last was Anne Boleyn's in 1533. The most recent king to wed post-coronation, CharlesII, did not have a separate <b>coronation</b> for his bride, Catherine of Braganza. In some instances, the king's wife was simply unable to join him in the <b>coronation</b> ceremony due to circumstances preventing her from doing so. In 1821, George IV's estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick was prevented from being crowned with him and when she showed up at Westminster Abbey she was denied entry and turned away. Following the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell declined the crown but underwent a <b>coronation</b> in all but name in his second investiture as Lord Protector in 1657. A Prince of Wales, usually the monarch's heir apparent, may also be crowned in a ceremony known as an investiture.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Coronations</b> in Poland officially {{began in}} 1025 and {{continued}} until 1764, {{when the final}} king of an independent Poland, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was crowned at St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw. Most Polish <b>coronations</b> {{took place at the}} Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, but crownings also occurred in Poznań and at Gniezno Cathedral. Whenever practical, Polish <b>coronations</b> were conducted as close as possible as to the date of the previous sovereign's funeral. This was explained by Joachim Bielski in the sixteenth century as osoba umiera, korona nie umiera, or [...] "the person dies, the crown dies not". [...] With the emergence of an independent, republican Poland after World War I, <b>coronations</b> in the Polish state have been rendered obsolete.|$|R

5|$|Hugh may {{not have}} {{attended}} the <b>coronation</b> of King Henry II of England and his queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Some sources place him at the <b>coronation,</b> others do not. He also {{did not attend the}} Council of Clarendon in 1164 that issued the Constitutions of Clarendon, that was the cause of the quarrel between the king and Thomas Becket. In the ensuing dispute between the king and Becket, Hugh did not take sides. He was, however, present with Roger de Pont L'Evêque the Archbishop of York at the <b>coronation</b> of the king's eldest son Henry the Young King in 1170, and consequently was suspended by Alexander III. The <b>coronation</b> of the Young King eventually led to Becket's martyrdom in December 1170.|$|E

5|$|The London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) <b>Coronation</b> Class is a {{class of}} express {{passenger}} steam locomotives designed by William Stanier. They were an enlarged and improved version of his previous design, the LMS Princess Royal Class. The locomotives were specifically designed for power as {{it was intended to}} use them on express services between London Euston and Glasgow Central; their duties were to include the hauling of a proposed non-stop express, subsequently named the <b>Coronation</b> Scot. The first ten locomotives of the <b>Coronation</b> class were built in a streamlined form in 1937 by the addition of a steel streamlined casing. Five of these ten were specifically set aside to pull the <b>Coronation</b> Scot. Although a later batch of five unstreamlined locomotives was produced in 1938, most of the ensuing <b>Coronation</b> class were outshopped as streamliners. Eventually, from 1944 to 1949, all new engines would be built in unstreamlined form and all the streamliners would have their casings removed. The very last of the 38 locomotives was completed in 1948.|$|E

5|$|The <b>coronation</b> of GeorgeVI in 1937 was {{broadcast}} on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), {{and parts of}} the service were filmed and shown in cinemas. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major outside broadcast. At ElizabethII's <b>coronation</b> in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the <b>coronation,</b> including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last <b>coronation.</b> It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The <b>coronation</b> contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.|$|E

5|$|The exact date of Stephen's <b>coronation</b> is unknown. According {{to later}} Hungarian tradition, he was crowned {{on the first}} day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001. Details of Stephen's <b>coronation</b> {{preserved}} in his Greater Legend suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or Székesfehérvár followed the rite of the <b>coronation</b> of the German kings. Accordingly, Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony. Stephen's portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor's diadem, was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones.|$|E
5|$|The general {{framework}} of the <b>coronation</b> service {{is based on the}} sections contained in the Second Recension used in 973 for King Edgar. Although the service has undergone two major revisions, a translation and has been modified for each <b>coronation</b> for the following thousand years, the sequence of taking an oath, anointing, investing of regalia, crowning and enthronement found in the Anglo-Saxon text have remained constant. The <b>coronation</b> ceremonies takes place within the framework of Holy Communion.|$|E
5|$|The {{music played}} at coronations has been {{primarily}} classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts from the Bible {{which have been}} used at coronations since King Edgar's <b>coronation</b> at Bath in 973 and are known as <b>coronation</b> anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for GeorgeII's <b>coronation</b> in 1727. It has featured in every <b>coronation</b> since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 <b>coronation</b> of CharlesII and Thomas Tomkins for CharlesI in 1621.|$|E
