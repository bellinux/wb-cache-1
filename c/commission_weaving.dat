50|$|The use {{of color}} and pattern is {{especially}} unique to the Finnish ryijy. Dating back to the 18th century, a ryijy was often used as a prayer rug during wedding ceremonies; the tapestry was then hung for display in the couple's home. Ryijy weavers traveled with their looms throughout the villages and towns getting <b>commissions</b> to <b>weave</b> a ryijy for special occasions. Different regions had designs specific to the event and colors specific to the local plants for dyes. Designs were often geometric shapes and florals, or figures of humans, animals, or birds. A very typical motif was the Tree of Life signifying family heritage.|$|R
50|$|In 1581 Frederick II <b>commissioned</b> Knieper's <b>weaving</b> {{workshop}} {{to design}} and weave a tapestry series of the Danish royal genealogy which would include 111 former Danish kings, {{as well as the}} king himself and the Crown Prince Christian III, and of some tapestries of hunting scenes. A similar Swedish tapestry cycle with no less than 143 kings had already been planned in 1560 by the Swedish king Erik XIV. In Denmark, the Swedish artist Antonius Samfleth had painted in 1574 a painted royal series totaling 117 portraits Knieper produced designs for 40 tapestries of the genealogy in 1584 that covered the entire walls of the ballroom at Kronborg Castle. Of these 14 still survive.|$|R
5000|$|Reich was {{commissioned}} to drape {{many of the}} key post-war projects of the 50’s. In 1954 Sir Hugh Casson and Sir Misha Black chose Tibor fabrics to drape The Royal Yacht Britannia and Time and Life Building. Other projects in the 1950s included London Airport (Heathrow), Arts Council UK, Berkeley and Washington Hotel, Renfrew Airport, Coventry Cathedral and the 1958 British Pavilion at the World's Fair, Brussels. In 1953 ICI <b>commissioned</b> Tibor to <b>weave</b> and design a tapestry for their coronation celebrations (also shown at the 10th Triennale Milan) [...] and in 1958 Sanderson commissioned five tapestries to celebrate their 100th year anniversary.|$|R
5000|$|After Helfman's tour of duty, {{they moved}} to New Haven, CT, where he {{received}} a Master of Fine Arts degree at Yale University and their two children, Ilisha and Jonathan were born. The family moved to St. Louis Missouri in 1960. The consequence of limited communication with her instructors in Germany became apparent as Nezhnie had to struggle through the technicalities of setting up the loom and learning what materials would work best. However she quickly began producing tapestries. By 1963, she completed a <b>woven</b> <b>commission</b> for a local Children's Hospital and in 1967, completed her first large commission, Genesis, 132" [...] x 84".|$|R

Lev Manovich, the author of The Language of New Media, lauded these 100 page [...] "mind bombs" [...] in the tradition of McLuhan and Fiore¹s The Medium is the Massage as a new operating system for the book.|$|R
40|$|Linda Florence’s initial {{research}} {{focused on}} how we trace our travels and mark our journeys with objects like embroidered badges or hillwalking shields. Interested in discovering new places in London she {{broke away from the}} familiar path. Working with computer programmer Julian Fenner, Florence designed a programme that interprets the data held on an Oyster card. This data is transformed into a woven pattern representing all of the London Underground stations visited by the user. The design changes by adding more destinations to the Oyster card when travelling in London. Each badge was designed based on a local landmark which would be recognisable when visiting the station. The designs included parts of the Paolozzi mosaics from Tottenham Court Road and the Egyptian mummy at Holborn station. Green Park was based on a satellite image taken of the park showing the paths crisscrossing, while Brixton was based on the iconic David Bowie image from the Aladdin Sane album. Children visiting the London Transport Museum took part in workshops to design their own tube station badge, these included everything from sunny Elephant and Castle to the more personal granny’s house. It is hoped that the programme can be adapted for online use so anyone could upload their data and see what their personal journey pattern could look like as a woven or printed textile. While comemorating our past routines, these illustrated histories of paths taken might encourage us to break away from the familiar. This project was <b>commissioned</b> for the <b>Weaving</b> Futures exhibition at the London Transport Museum highlighting the importance of woven textile design to the London Transport system – curated by Philippa Brock and Samuel Plant Dempsey. Each resident responded to a project brief about data and London Transport systems. The designs were interpreted live into digital woven works on a state-of-the-art TC 2 digital jacquard loom...|$|R
40|$|In December 2010, the National Post {{published}} an article discussing the rather costly enterprise of state-sanctioned official bilingualism in Canada. According to statistics provided by the Fraser Institute (2006), translation and interpretation represented 15 % of the total federal government budget spending allocated to bilingualism, a cost that many Canadian commentators deemed “unnecessary. ” Shifting demographics and diverse immigration flows (Census data, 2011) are also having {{a significant impact on}} Canada’s linguistic landscape, forcing policy-makers to consider whether the Official Languages Act (and thus translation) would benefit from innovative reform. Using this contextual backdrop as its main impetus, this dissertation argues that translation, as defined and practiced in Canada, needs to be broadened for a number of reasons, including accounting for technological advancements, for the increasingly web-based dissemination of translated materials, and for the reality of evolving markets. Tymoczko (2008) has championed *translation as an open-cluster concept, a theoretical perspective that has found resonance in this project, given that the notion is the central premise upon which three additional conceptualizations (i. e. *translation sub-types) are founded. The first sub-type, intersemiotic translation, is explained at length and constitutes {{the focal point of the}} project. Instead of using a Peircean approach, the dissertation develops a model based on visual social semiotics in order to facilitate the application of intersemiotic translation in not only professional settings but research contexts as well. The second sub-type, cultural translation, builds on insights from the 1980 s and 90 s cultural turn, with a specific focus on the relationship between the representation of Canadian micro-cultures and intersemiotic translation. In other words, the effects of these translation processes will also be analyzed. Finally, civic translation is proposed as a third *translation sub-type, which offers a potential framework for multicultural management in democratic countries facing the challenges of globalization. A case study using content from the 2006 - 2008 debate surrounding reasonable accommodation—with specific attention given to the activities of the Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences (also known as the Bouchard-Taylor <b>Commission)</b> —is <b>woven</b> through each chapter, illustrating all three sub-types of *translation. The case study provides compelling examples of why translation practices in Canada should move beyond verbal and state-sanctioned definitions. The novelty and contribution of this research project are manifold: it transcends traditional verbocentric approaches in TS; it responds to other scholars’ claims that there is a lack of case studies that involve text-image relationships and/or explore the role of translation in the news media in a Canadian context; it explores multimodality and its significance for TS in an era of increased Web presence; it showcases a Canadian case study; and, finally, it explores cultural representation through a translation-based framework...|$|R
