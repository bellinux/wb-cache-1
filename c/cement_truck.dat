5000|$|Wiking {{began to}} expand its line of {{vehicles}} during the 1950s, offering both trucks and cars. Some offerings were Henschel stake and <b>cement</b> <b>trucks,</b> Magirus trucks, the Borgward Arabella, and DKW two door sedan. Many of these were offered in packs of five trucks or ten cars (Model Descriptions 2000-2013). In the early 1960s, Volkswagen's Wolfsburg plant commissioned vehicles in a larger 1:40 scale with unique company designed packaging. These are rather rare today - and often worth more than $100, though some of these larger scaled models have been reissued by the company (Doty 1996, p. 88-89). Particularly interesting was a Wiking Beetle promotional molded in a clear plastic body. It was labeled [...] "Das Gläserne Auto" [...] and available in a special red and blue display box with body, wheels, interior and seats displayed apart from each other (Wiking No date). The presentation with clear plastic body hit a chord and the idea was copied by several other manufacturers - even in Britain where one manufacturer produced its own 'glass' car (Ralston 2007, p. 15).|$|R

The Kachin State government responded that the letter is a forgery. However, uncertainties exist as Chinese workers remain present in the area.
