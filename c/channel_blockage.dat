5000|$|Beyond an anti-vertigo treatment, {{cinnarizine}} {{could be}} also {{viewed as a}} nootropic drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium <b>channel</b> <b>blockage),</b> which happen mostly in brain {{and the fact that}} it is also used as a labyrinthine sedative. Cinnarizine inhibits the flow of calcium into red blood cells, which increases the elasticity of the cell wall, thereby increasing their flexibility and making the blood less viscous. This allows the blood to travel more efficiently and effectively through narrowed vessels in order to bring oxygen to damaged tissue. It is also effectively combined with other nootropics, primarily piracetam; in such combination each drug potentiates the other in boosting brain oxygen supply. [...] An animal study comparing the effectiveness of cinnarizine and flunarizine (a derivative of cinnarizine that is 2.5-15 times stronger [...] for treatment of transient global cerebral ischemia, it was found that cinnarizine helped to improve the functional abnormalities of ischemia, but did not help with damage to the neurons. Flunarizine, on the other hand, offered more neuronal protection, but was less effective in treating subsequent behavioral changes.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{therapeutics}} used clinically {{which can}} effect {{the activity of}} P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, nicardipine, and barnidipine. Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, flunarizine is another calcium antagonist {{which is used to}} treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. Flunarizine inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the [...] "cacna1a" [...] gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type <b>channel</b> <b>blockage.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{voltage-gated}} ion channels {{embedded in}} biological membranes play crucial roles on the generation and transmission of action potentials. Therefore, understanding of impacts of each ion channel {{is of great}} importance for the dynamics of neuronal networks. Among the others, one method on this way is to block a specific ion channel type while keeping the remaining ion channel types active across the membrane and to observe their impact on neuronal dynamics. In this study, we {{study the effects of}} sodium and potassium channels blockage on the collective spiking regularity of a scale-free neuronal network with stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, and investigate how the dependence of the collective spiking regularity on the membrane area or cell size varies with the coupling constant between neurons. Results reveal that the collective spiking regularity exhibits coherence resonance (CR) depending on the <b>channel</b> <b>blockage</b> scaling factor and the cell size, where potassium <b>channel</b> <b>blockage</b> enhances the collective spiking regularity whereas sodium <b>channel</b> <b>blockage</b> decreases it.

G 93 A mutant motor neurones were more vulnerable and wild-type SOD 1 motor neurones were more resistant to kainate toxicity than were controls. Voltage-gated Na <b>channels</b> <b>blockage</b> prevented G 93 A mutant SOD 1 motor neurone death. Cortical cultures exhibited fewer differences in their vulnerability to kainate toxicity.

50|$|The initial {{evidence}} for a ball and chain inactivation came in 1977 with Clay Armstrong and Francisco Bezanilla's work. The suggestion of a physical basis for non-conductance came from experiments in squid giant axons, showing that internal treatment with pronase disrupted the inactivation phenomenon. This suggested a physical, tethered mechanism for inactivation as the pronase was inferred to degrade the channel blocker and abolish the inactivation process. These experiments also showed that inactivation can only occur after {{the opening of the}} channel. This was done by hyperpolarising the membrane, causing the channel to open, and observing a delay in inactivation. Inactivation was not observed when the membrane was depolarised (closed). Introducing tetraethylammonium (TEA) on the intracellular side of the channel was found to mimic inactivation in non-inactivating <b>channels.</b> <b>Blockage</b> of the <b>channel</b> by TEA is mutually exclusive with peptide-mediate blockage, suggesting that TEA competes for an inactivation binding site.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of acid properties on the coke behavior and stability of butene aromatization, we prepared the AHZSM- 5 samples with various acid properties by the methods of hydrothernial treatment and K addition. The reaction of butene aromatization was carried out at 350 degrees C and 0. 5 MPa in a continuous flow fixed bed. The characterization of the fresh/coked catalysts with NH 3 -TPD, N- 2 adsorption-desorption measurement, and TG techniques has shown that {{a large amount of}} acid sites (high acid density) of the AHZMS- 5 catalyst can cause a large quantity of coke deposit and serious <b>channel</b> <b>blockage,</b> and so result in a rapid loss of aromatization activity. On the contrary, after a great reduction in strong acid sites of AHZSM- 5 catalyst resulting from some K-modification, the presence of only many weak acid sites also could not lessen the formation of coke nor improve the reaction stability of butene aromatization. Interestingly, the simultaneous reduction in the strong and weak acid sites to a desirable level by hydrothermal treating the AHZSM- 5 catalyst at a proper temperature can effectively suppress the coke formation and <b>channel</b> <b>blockage,</b> and thus improve its olefin aromatization stability.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{incompressible}} Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computations {{are performed}} for water flow past an actuator disk model (representing a tidal turbine) {{placed in a}} rectangular channel of various blockages and aspect ratios. The study focuses {{on the effects of}} turbulent mixing behind the disk, {{as well as on the}} effects of <b>channel</b> <b>blockage</b> and aspect ratio on the prediction of the hydrodynamic limit of power extraction. To qualitatively account for the effect of turbulence generated by the turbine (rather than by the shear flow behind the turbine), we propose a new approach, called a blade-induced turbulence model, which does not use any additional model coefficients other than those used in the original RANS turbulence model. Results demonstrate that the power removed from the mean flow by the disk increases as the strength of turbulent mixing behind the disk increases, being consistent with the turbulent shear stress on the interface between the bypass and core flow passages acting in such a way as to decelerate the bypass flow and accelerate the core flow. The channel aspect ratio also affects the flow downstream of the disk but has less influence upstream of the disk; hence its effect on the limit of power extraction is relatively minor compared to that of the <b>channel</b> <b>blockage,</b> which is shown to be significant but satisfactorily estimated using one-dimensional inviscid theory previously reported in the literature. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|E

40|$|To {{quantify}} small molecule penetration {{into and}} eventually permeation through nanopores, we applied an improved excess-noise {{analysis of the}} ion current fluctuation caused by entering molecules. The kinetic parameters of substrate entry and exit are derived from a two-state Markov model, analyzing the substrate concentration dependence of the average ion current and its variance. Including filter corrections allows one to detect the transition rates beyond the cutoff frequency, fc, of the instrumental ion-current filter. As an application of the method, we performed {{an analysis of the}} single-channel ion current of Meropenem, an antibiotic of the carbapenem family, interacting with OmpF, the major general outer membrane channel of Escherichia coli bacteria. At 40 Â°C we detected the residence time of Meropenem inside OmpF of about 500 ns - more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than fc- 1 and close to the diffusion limit of few hundred nanoseconds.

40|$|Depending {{on their}} {{mechanism}} of action, anticonvulsant drugs in clinical use may {{be divided into}} three groups: those drugs which facilitate γ-aminobutryic acid (GABA) ergic neurotransmission; those which block neuronal ion channels; and those whose mechanism of action is unresolved. The compounds acting on GABAergic systems may be further subdivided into those which modulate transmission through chloride channels, e. g. the barbiturates and the benzodiazepines; those compounds, in particular vigabatrin, which reduce the degradation of GABA by blocking GABA transaminase; and those which inhibit the re-uptake of GABA into the presynaptic terminal. The other group of compounds whose mechanism of action is known are those which block neuronal ion <b>channels.</b> <b>Blockage</b> of voltage-operated sodium channels by lamotrigine, phenytoin or carbamazepine leads to decreased electrical activity and, probably, a subsequent reduction in glutamate release.

Of those drugs in which the mechanism of action is unknown, sodium valproate is the prime example.

40|$|In area CA 1 of hippocampal slices, {{a single}} 1 -sec train of 100 -Hz {{stimulation}} generally triggers a short-lasting long-term potentiation (S-LTP) of 1 – 2 h. Here, {{we found that}} when such a train was applied 45 min after application of the small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SK) channel blocker apamin, it induced a long-lasting LTP (L-LTP) of several hours, instead of an S-LTP. Apamin-induced SK <b>channel</b> <b>blockage</b> is known to resist washing. Nevertheless, the aforementioned effect is not a mere delayed effect; it is metaplastic. Indeed, when a single train was delivered to the Schaffer’s collaterals during apamin application, it induced an S-LTP, like in the control situation. At the moment of this LTP induction (15 th min of apamin application), the SK <b>channel</b> <b>blockage</b> was nevertheless complete. Indeed, at that time, {{under the influence of}} apamin, the amplitude of the series of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) triggered by a stimulation train was increased. We found that the metaplastic effect of apamin on LTP was crucially dependent on the NO-synthase pathway, whereas the efficacy of the NMDA receptors was not modified {{at the time of its}} occurrence. We also found that apamin produced an increase in paired-pulse facilitation not during, but after, the application of the drug. Finally, we found that the induction of each of these two metaplastic phenomena was mediated by NMDA receptors. A speculative unitary hypothesis to explain these phenomena is proposed.
