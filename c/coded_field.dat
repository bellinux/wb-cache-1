40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the Point Source Location Accuracy (PSLA) for the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope based on analysis of archival in-flight data. Methods: Over 40000 individual pointings (science windows) of INTEGRAL/IBIS data were analysed using the latest Off-line Science Analysis software, version 7. 0. Reconstructed source positions were then compared against {{the most accurate}} positions available, determined from focusing X-ray telescopes. Since the PSLA is a strong function of source detection significance, the offsets from true position were histogrammed against significance, so that the 90 % confidence limits could be determined. This has been done for both sources in the fully <b>coded</b> <b>field</b> of view (FCFOV) and partially <b>coded</b> <b>field</b> of view (PCFOV). Results: The PSLA is found to have improved significantly since values derived from early mission data and software for both FCFOV and PCFOV. Conclusions: This result has implications for observers executing follow-up programs on IBIS sources since the sky area to be searched is reduced by > 50 % in some cases...|$|E

40|$|A stream health {{monitoring}} training {{was conducted in}} the six communities of Drawa block namely Batiri, Drawa, Keka, Lutukina, Nayarailagi and Vatuvonu that highly depend on riverine ecosystem. Rivers provide a lot of natural resource for these inland communities. The training was aimed to improve the understanding of villagers on the basic biotic structure and functioning of streams and rivers. It also raised awareness on the impacts of day to day activities around the catchments and how these threaten the ecological state of these freshwater bodies. The training consisted of an interactive theoretical workshop in the community hall {{during the first half}} of the day and then field work in nearby streams after lunch hour. Participants from each of the six communities comprised of men, women, youths and children. As part of the interactive workshop, the villagers were taught about the stream physical structure, biological communities, stream {{health monitoring}} using bioindicators and threats to streams and rivers. The participants were introduced to the usage and importance of the color <b>coded</b> <b>field</b> guide of bioindicators of stream health and the stream habitat assessment sheet. Freshwater macroinvertebrate sampling equipment was provided by Live and Learn. The equipment comprised of a sieve, a bucket and a white tray. Threats to the village streams were identified by the villagers and these included gravel extraction, removal of riparian forest, farming, logging, alteration of channel for bridge construction, dumping of rubbish and presence of livestock close to water source or stream bank. The field work involved: I. Site selection for rapid assessment of streams whereby sites were chosen in relation to point of disturbance. Three sites per village stream were selected for stream health monitoring. Site one was below the village/settlement. Site two was above the village and farm zone. Site three was a reference site, an upstream near intact and or unimpacted section of the stream furthest from the village. II. Sampling of freshwater macroinvertebrates and identification of biological indicators using the color <b>coded</b> <b>field</b> guide and completion of the stream habitat assessment sheet at the selected sites. 6 Upon the completion of field work, a stream health monitoring plan was developed by the villagers. Two groups per village were established; group one and group two. Group one would be assessing the selected three sites per village in the second week of each month while group two would be assessing in the last week of each month. The data would be recorded in the habitat assessment sheet and deposited with the village headman.

40|$|We {{are working}} on the {{development}} of a new balloon-borne telescope, MARGIE (minute-of-arc resolution gamma ray imaging experiment). It will be a coded aperture telescope designed to image hard x-rays (in various configurations) over the 20 - 600 keV range with an angular resolution approaching one arc minute. MARGIE will use one (or both) of two different detection plane technologies, each of which is capable of providing event locations with sub-mm accuracies. One such technology involves the use of cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) strip detectors. We have successfully completed a series of laboratory measurements using a prototype CZT detector with 375 micron pitch. Spatial location accuracies of better than 375 microns have been demonstrated. A second type of detection plane would be based on CsI microfiber arrays coupled to a large area silicon CCD readout array. This approach would provide spatial resolutions comparable to that of the CZT prototype. In one possible configuration, the coded mask would be 0. 5 mm thick tungsten, with 0. 5 mm pixels at a distance of 1. 5 m from the central detector giving an angular resolution of 1 arc-minute and a fully <b>coded</b> <b>field</b> of view of 12 degrees.

40|$|INTEGRAL has two {{sensitive}} gamma-ray {{instruments that}} have detected 46 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) up to July 2007. We present the spectral, spatial, and temporal {{properties of the}} bursts in the INTEGRAL GRB catalogue {{using data from the}} imager, IBIS, and spectrometer, SPI. Spectral properties of the GRBs are determined using power-law, Band model and quasithermal model fits to the prompt emission. Spectral lags, i. e. the time delay in the arrival of low-energy gamma-rays with respect to high-energy gamma-rays, are measured for 31 of the GRBs. The photon index distribution of power-law fits to the prompt emission spectra is consistent with that obtained by Swift. The peak flux distribution shows that INTEGRAL detects proportionally more weak GRBs than Swift because of its higher sensitivity in a smaller field of view. The all-sky rate of GRBs above ~ 0. 15 ph cm^- 2 s^- 1 is ~ 1400 yr^- 1 in the fully <b>coded</b> <b>field</b> of view of IBIS. Two groups are identified in the spectral lag distribution, one with short lags 0. 75 s. Most of the long-lag GRBs are inferred to have low redshifts because of their long spectral lags, their tendency to have low peak energies and their faint optical and X-ray afterglows. They are mainly observed {{in the direction of the}} supergalactic plane with a quadrupole moment of Q=- 0. 225 +/- 0. 090 and hence reflect the local large-scale structure of the Universe. The rate of long-lag GRBs with inferred low luminosity is ~ 25 % of Type Ib/c supernovae. Some of these bursts could be produced by the collapse of a massive star without a supernova or by a different progenitor, such as the merger of two white dwarfs or a white dwarf with a neutron star or black hole, possibly in the cluster environment without a host galaxy.

40|$|INTEGRAL is ESA's high-energy {{astrophysics}} {{mission to}} be launched into a high eccentric orbit early in the next decade. One of the two mission's main telescopes is the #gamma#-ray spectrometer SPI. This instrument features a compact array of 19 high-purity Germanium detectors shielded by a massive anticoincidence system. A coded aperture of the HURA type modulates the astrophysical signal. We present the spectrometer system and its characteristics and discuss the choices {{that led to the}} present design. The instrument properties like imaging capability, energy resolution and sensitivity have been evaluated by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The expected performance for narrow-line spectroscopy is characterized by an energy resolution of #approx# 1. 6 keV at 1 MeV, an angular resolution of #approx# 2 within a totally <b>coded</b> <b>field</b> of view of #approx# 15, and a sensitivity of (2 - 5). 10 "-" 6 #gamma#/(cm" 2 s) for 4. 10 " 6 s observation time in the nominal energy range from #approx# 20 keV -#approx# 8 MeV. With these characteristic features it will be possible {{for the first time to}} explore the #gamma#-ray sky in greater depth and detail than it was possible with previous #gamma#-ray telescopes like SIGMA, OSSE and COMPTEL. In particular the field of nuclear astrophysics will be addressed with an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and energy. Especially the high-energy resolution allows for the first time measuring #gamma#-ray line profiles. Such lines are emitted by the debris of nucleosynthesis processes, by the annihilation process near compact objects and by the nuclear interaction between cosmic rays and interstellar matter. Lines of all these processes have been measured so far, but, owing to the relatively poor energy resolution, details of the emission processes in the source regions could not be studied. With the high-resolution spectroscopy of SPI such detailed investigations will be possible opening a wealth of astrophysical investigations. (orig.) 42 refs.

40|$|We {{successfully}} {{carried out}} the first high-altitude balloon flight of a wide-field hard X-ray coded-aperture telescope ProtoEXIST 1, which was launched from the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility at Ft. Sumner, New Mexico on October 9, 2009. ProtoEXIST 1 is the first implementation of an advanced CdZnTe (CZT) imaging detector in our ongoing program to establish the technology required for next generation wide-field hard X-ray telescopes. The CZT detector plane in ProtoEXIST 1 consists of an 8 x 8 array of closely tiled 2 cm x 2 cm x 0. 5 cm thick pixellated CZT crystals, each with 8 x 8 pixels, covering a 256 cm^ 2 active area with 2. 5 mm pixels. A tungsten mask, mounted at 90 cm above the detector provides shadowgrams of X-ray sources in the 30 - 600 keV band for imaging, allowing a fully <b>coded</b> <b>field</b> of view of 9 Deg x 9 Deg with an angular resolution of 20 arcmin. To reduce the background radiation, the detector is surrounded by semi-graded (Pb/Sn/Cu) passive shields on the four sides {{all the way to}} the mask. On the back side, a 26 cm x 26 cm x 2 cm CsI(Na) active shield provides signals to tag charged particle induced events as well as >~ 100 keV background photons from below. The flight duration was only about 7. 5 hours due to strong winds (60 knots) at float altitude (38 - 39 km). Throughout the flight, the CZT detector performed excellently. The telescope observed Cyg X- 1 for ~ 1 hour at the end of the flight. Despite a few problems with the pointing and aspect systems that caused the telescope to track about 6. 4 deg off the target, the analysis of the Cyg X- 1 data revealed an X-ray source at 7. 2 sigma in the 30 - 100 keV energy band at the expected location from the optical images taken by the onboard daytime star camera. The success of this first flight is very encouraging for the future development of the advanced CZT imaging detectors (ProtoEXIST 2, with 0. 6 mm pixels).
