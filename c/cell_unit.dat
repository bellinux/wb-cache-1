40|$|INTRODUCTION: Comparatively to open repair, {{endovascular}} aneurysm repair {{has reduced}} transfusion rates but thereâs no recommendation about number of red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> to be crossmatched preoperatively. Our aim is {{contribute to the}} analysis of red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> needs in endovascular and hybrid aortic aneurysm repair and developing a protocol for maximum surgical blood orders schedule. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed our prospective database of elective endovascular aneurysm repair from 2001 to 2012. We analyzed patients' age, gender, ASA classification, maximum surgical blood orders schedule, red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> transfused and timings, types of endoprosthesis, red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> consumption/endoprosthesis' type ratio, crossmatch to transfusion ratio, conversion to open repair, hemoglobin concentrations before surgery and discharge. RESULTS: We selected 187 patients, 90 % men, mean age 73. 1, ASA mode III. The endoprosthesis were aorto-bi-iliac in 71 %, aorto-uni-iliac in 23 % and thoracic in 6 %. Of these, 72, 6 % of the patients did not require blood transfusion. We transfused 171 red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units.</b> Crossmatch to transfusion ratio was 10. 1 until 2010 and 7. 3 after. The ratio of red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> consumption/endoprosthesis in the first 24 hours was 0. 21 red blood cells units/aorto-bi-iliac, 0. 46 red blood cells units/aorto-uni-iliac, 0. 8 red blood cells units/thoracic, 1. 3 red blood cells units/hybrid-thoracic and 2 red blood cells units/hybrid-aorto-bi-iliac. A statistical correlation was observed between red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> transfused postoperatively and type of endoprosthesis (p < 0. 001) and between ASA classification and red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> transfused after 24 hours (p < 0. 01). DISCUSSION: Guidelines from the British Society of Haematology are based on a crossmatch to transfusion ratio of 2 : 1. Our crossmatch to transfusion ratio was 10. 1 until 2010 and 7. 3 from 2011 to 2012. CONCLUSION: These results changed our policy of maximum surgical blood orders schedule for endovascular aneurysm repair. We now type and screen aorto-bi-iliac and aorto-uni-iliac. We crossmatch two red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> for thoracic, three red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> for hybrid thoracic and four red blood <b>cells</b> <b>units</b> for hybrid abdominal procedures. This may lead to financial savings, improved efficiency and reduce workload in hematology department. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundExperimental {{data have}} shown that the {{transfusion}} of older red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> causes alloimmunization, but the clinical applicability of this statement has never been properly assessed in non-sickle cell patients. It has been hypothesized that older units have higher numbers of cytokines, increasing the risk of alloimmunization related to antigen-presenting events. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association between the transfusion of older red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> subjected to bedside leukodepletion and alloimmunization. MethodsAll patients submitted to transfusions of bedside leukodepletion red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> proven to have become alloimmunized in one oncologic service between 2009 and 2013 were enrolled in this study. A control group was formed by matching patients without alloimmunization in terms of number of transfusions and medical specialty. The median age of transfused units, the percentage of transfused red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> > 14 days of storage in relation to fresher red <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> (≤ 14 days of storage) and the mean age of transfused units older than 14 days were compared between the groups. ResultsAlloimmunized and control groups were homogeneous regarding the most relevant clinical variables (age, gender, type of oncological disease) and inflammatory background (C-reactive protein and Karnofsky scale). The median age of transfused red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units,</b> the ratio of older units transfused compared to fresher units and the mean age of transfused units older than 14 days did not differ between alloimmunized and control patients (17 vs. 17; 68 / 32 vs. 63. 2 / 36. 8 and 21. 8 ± 7. 0 vs. 21. 04 ± 7. 9; respectively). ConclusionThe transfusion of older red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> subjected to bedside leukodepletion is not a key risk factor for alloimmunization. Strategies of providing fresh red <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> aiming to avoid alloimmunization are thus not justified...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveCardiac {{surgery is}} {{a major cause of}} acute kidney injury. In this setting, receipt of blood transfusions seems to be {{associated}} with a higher risk of acute kidney injury, as measured using serum creatinine values. We examined this association further by using urinary biomarkers of kidney injury. MethodsA total of 1210 adults underwent cardiac surgery and were divided into 3 groups {{on the basis of the}} receipt of intraoperative packed red blood cell units: no blood (n =  894), 2 or less packed red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> (n =  206), and more than 2 packed red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> (n =  110). Acute kidney injury was defined as (1) doubling of serum creatinine from the preoperative value; (2) first postoperative urinary interleukin- 18 in the fifth quintile; and (3) first postoperative urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in the fifth quintile. We determined the relative risk for acute kidney injury outcome according to packed red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> group after adjusting for 12 preoperative and surgical variables. By using the Sobel test for mediation analysis, we also evaluated the role of biomarkers in causing acute kidney injury through alternative pathways. ResultsAcute kidney injury was more common in those who received more than 2 packed red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units.</b>  In patients receiving more than 2 packed red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units,</b> the adjusted relative risks were 2. 3 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 - 4. 4, P. 01), 1. 36 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 1. 9, P. 05), and 1. 34 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 1. 8, P. 06) for doubling of serum creatinine, urinary interleukin- 18 in the fifth quintile (> 60 pg/mL), and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in the fifth quintile (> 102 ng/mL), respectively. Furthermore, the effect of packed red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> transfusion on acute kidney injury was partially mediated by interleukin- 18. ConclusionsReceipt of 2 or more packed red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> during cardiac surgery is associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury defined by serum creatinine and kidney injury biomarkers...|$|R
40|$|Although {{some studies}} have {{suggested}} that transfusion recipients may have better medical outcomes if transfused with red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> stored for a short time, the overall body of evidence shows mixed results. It is important to understand how using fresher stored red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> for certain patient groups may affect blood availability. Based on the Stock-and-Flow simulation model of the US blood supply developed by Simonetti et al. 2014, we evaluated a newly implemented allocation method of preferentially transfusing fresher stored red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> to a subset of high-risk group of critically ill patients and its potential impact on supply. Simulation results showed that, depending on the scenario, the US blood total supply might be reduced between 2 - 42 %, when compared to the standard of care in transfusion medicine practice. Among our simulated scenarios, we observed that the number of expired red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> modulated the supply levels. The age threshold of the required red blood <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> was inversely correlated with both the supply levels and the number of transfused units that failed to meet that age threshold. To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to develop a comprehensive framework to evaluate the impact of preferentially transfusing fresher stored red blood cells to the higher-risk critically ill patients on supply. Model results show the difficulties to identify an optimal scenario...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Apart {{from the}} visual assessment, {{measurement}} of plasma hemoglobin in the supernatant from red <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> provides an objective {{measure of the}} extent of hemolysis during storage. Study Design and Methods: Packed red cells (N= 50), 25 units each in triple (CPD-A 1 and SAGM) and quadruple (CPD-A 1 and ADSOL) blood bags were evaluated for plasma hemoglobin by the tetramethylbenzidiene (TMB) method on day 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 of collection. The hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, LDH and potassium levels were also noted. Whole blood units (N= 25) were used as controls. Results: Hemolysis increased in all the stored red <b>cell</b> <b>units.</b> Plasma hemoglobin increased significantly {{in the first week of}} storage. The hemolysis, LDH and potassium levels were found to be significantly higher in the red <b>cell</b> <b>units</b> harvested from the triple blood bags.
