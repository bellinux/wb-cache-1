5|$|Like {{the other}} services, the Congolese Air Force is {{not capable of}} {{carrying}} out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> restored to service and {{it is unclear whether}} the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E

5|$|The {{absolute}} {{minimum requirement}} of any body of Freemasons {{is that the}} candidate must be free, and considered to be of good character. There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying assumption is that the candidate should be a mature adult.|$|E
5|$|After {{successful}} athletics {{events at}} the Commonwealth Games, conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe as, at the time, the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability of installing an athletics track having been dropped from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Had {{either of the two}} larger stadium proposals developed by Arup been agreed for funding, then Manchester would have ended up with a venue <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> adapted to hosting large-scale athletics events through the use of movable seating.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a study {{to determine if the}} development objectives were feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> developed to meet the objectives. In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E
5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes {{because they were too}} difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.|$|E
5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce baby food <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> consumed by the child during the weaning process. The chewed food {{in the form of a}} bolus is transferred from the mouth of one individual to another, either directly mouth-to-mouth, via utensils, hands, or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding.|$|E

5000|$|So {{what is it}} that {{a modern}} English triolet {{normally}} aims at achieving? The answer must be various.

5|$|Salo {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman, <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> matched up against {{opposing}} team's top players, while also contributing offensively. His offensive game is characterized by his powerful slapshot. He has won numerous hardest shot titles with the Canucks in the team's SuperSkills competitions, clocking one shot at 102.7 miles-per-hour (163.5 kph) in 2012. As a result, he is used frequently on the powerplay, being set up by teammates for shots from the point. A well-rounded defenceman, Salo also earns time on the penalty kill.|$|E
5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Streisand's vocals {{and found the}} record <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> extremely successful. However, some critics felt the album was not carefully planned out and Streisand was acting out the tracks rather than actually singing them. Commercially, The Way We Were topped the Billboard 200 in the United States and reached the top ten on album charts in Australia and Canada. It also entered the charts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Due to strong sales, it has since been certified 2x Platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E

5|$|The {{criticism}} {{did little}} to dissuade Etty from attempting to reproduce the success of Cleopatra, and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} disc {{is a very}} dynamic environment. Because {{they are}} still <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> perturbed by Neptune, SDOs' orbits are always in danger of disruption; either of being sent outward to the Oort cloud or inward into the centaur population and ultimately the Jupiter family of comets. For this reason Gladman et al. prefer {{to refer to the}} region as the scattering disc, rather than scattered. Unlike Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), the orbits of scattered-disc objects can be inclined as much as 40° from the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E

5000|$|The GP14 was {{designed}} by Jack Holt in 1949. The idea behind the design was to build a General Purpose (GP) 14-foot dinghy which could be cruised, raced or rowed, <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> also <b>being</b> powered effectively by a small outboard motor, able to be towed behind a small family car and able to be launched and recovered reasonably easily, and stable {{enough to be able}} to lie to moorings or anchor when required.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{decision}} to replace Melbourne with HMS Invincible, the postponed refit was cancelled outright. The Australian carrier was prepared for disposal, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 30 June 1982. She was towed to the mooring dolphins near Bradley's Head, where she remained until 1985. Melbourne was <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> reactivated as a helicopter-equipped anti-submarine warfare carrier within 26 weeks, but was never required to do so. A Sydney-based group proposed in 1984 to purchase Melbourne and operate her as a floating casino moored in international waters off Eden, New South Wales, but nothing came of this. Melbournes air wing was disbanded at HMAS Albatross on 2 July 1982, with the transfer of 805 Squadron's Skyhawks to 724 Squadron and 816 Squadron being absorbed into 851 Squadron. The Skyhawks remained in service as fleet support aircraft until 30 June 1984, while the Trackers were withdrawn from service on 31 August 1984 after being used as land-based maritime patrol aircraft.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland {{became a}} part of the Scottish {{division}} of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), who received a total of 122 locomotives, 100 4-4-0 tender locomotives and 22 tank engines, all <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> used on either passenger or goods trains. Forty-four locomotives were still in service when the railway was nationalised in 1948, and the last two Great North locomotives to be withdrawn were two of the Aberdeen harbour tanks in 1960. No. 49, Gordon Highlander was restored to Great North green in 1958, although it had not previously carried the green livery as it appeared in Heywood's lined black. It was used on special trains before becoming a static exhibit at the Glasgow Transport Museum in 1965, and is currently on loan to the Scottish Railway Museum at Bo'ness.|$|E
