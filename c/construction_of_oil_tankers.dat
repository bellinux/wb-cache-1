40|$|In 1997, Samsung Heavy Industries became {{interested}} in applying its expertise {{in the design and}} <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tankers</b> to the specialized construction of ice class vessels for oil transportation in the Arctic Ocean and Baltic Sea. This interest was motivated by the potential development of several offshore and near shore oil and gas reserves together with increased shipping of oil through the Baltic Sea from Russia. Since at that time, Samsung Heavy Industries had little experience with performance prediction for ships in ice, they entered into a collaborative project with the Institute for Ocean Technology to apply and refine the modelling techniques required for predicting the performance of large tankers in ice. This paper describes the modelling methods used. One important technique is the preparation of the model ice, and the scaling of the ice forces. Equally important is the preparation of the ship model and its propulsion system. The two models are combined to predict the powering and manoeuvring performance for large tankers in a range of ice conditions including level first year ice, pack ice and rubble ice. The results of experiments on four hull designs, with single and twin-screw propulsion arrangements, are presented and discussed and some suggestions are made for refining the modelling techniques for future projects.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} total-system design {{methodology}} that includes three important com-ponents {{necessary for a}} systematic approach to ship concept design. These are: · An efficient and effective search of design space for optimal or non-dominated de-signs · Well-defined and quantitative measures of objective attributes · An effective format to describe the design space and to present non-dominated con-cepts for rational selection by the customer The methodology is described {{in the context of}} an Optimal Risk Tanker design project con-ducted by senior undergraduate design students at Virginia Tech. A Pareto-Genetic Algo-rithm (PGA) is used to search design parameter space and identify non-dominated design concepts based on total ownership cost and oil outflow risk. A simplified ship synthesis model balances the designs and assesses their feasibility. A cost model estimates total own-ership cost which is defined to include construction cost, and discounted operational and maintenance costs. A risk model calculates the probability of grounding and collision and the resulting oil outflow in bottom and side damage. The oil outflow model is based on the International Maritime Organization (IMO) "Interim Guidelines for the Approval of Alter-native Methods of Design and <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>Tankers</b> ” [1]. The optimization considers hull form characteristics, producibility, cargo block subdivision and double hull dimen-sions, propulsion and power redundancy, manning and automation, structural design mar-gins, and trade route and port characteristics. The emphasis of this paper is on process. 2 Four sets of results are generated and examined based on different metrics for oil outflow risk. Future applications of this methodology will consider tanker crashworthiness in colli...|$|E
