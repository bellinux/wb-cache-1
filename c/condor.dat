5|$|In Peru, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} shot, {{but more often}} revered and used for ceremonial purposes. The Yawar Fiesta is a celebration, the pinnacle {{of which is the}} tying of an Andean <b>condor</b> to the back of a bull, allowing the <b>condor</b> to kill the bull with its talons before being released. This ceremony is a symbolic representation {{of the power of the}} Andean peoples (the <b>condor)</b> over the Spanish (the bull). There is also a ceremony known as the arranque del <b>condor</b> in which a live Andean <b>condor</b> is suspended from a frame and is punched to death by horsemen as they ride by.|$|E
5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} <b>condor</b> recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the <b>condor</b> as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that <b>Condor</b> seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. <b>Condor</b> then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when <b>Condor</b> paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the <b>condor</b> sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the <b>condor</b> was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.|$|E
5|$|There are two sanctuaries {{dedicated}} to this bird, the Sisquoc <b>Condor</b> Sanctuary in the San Rafael Wilderness and the Sespe <b>Condor</b> Sanctuary in the Los Padres National Forest. These areas were chosen {{because of their}} prime <b>condor</b> nesting habitat.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the opening}} of MTR's Island Line in the 1980s, CMB didn't buy many Dennis <b>Condors.</b> Between 1989 and 1997, CMB bought only 46 12m non {{air-conditioned}} <b>Condors,</b> 28 11 metre non air-conditioned <b>Condors</b> and 92 11 metre air-conditioned <b>Condors.</b> It is rumoured that CMB's last ten air-conditioned <b>Condors</b> were bought due to unpredictable delivery time of the Dennis Trident 3s ordered. All the CMB's Dennis <b>Condors</b> were sold to New World First Bus when CMB lost its franchise in 1998, three of the 12 m <b>Condors</b> were subsequently converted to training buses.|$|R
50|$|The Southern California <b>Condors</b> are an International Fight League team {{based in}} Orange County, California. Coached by MMA legend Marco Ruas, the <b>Condors</b> {{were one of}} four new teams {{established}} {{at the beginning of}} the 2007 season. The <b>Condors</b> have an assistant coach, female MMA star Debi Purcell.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Condors</b> {{advanced}} {{past the}} 1st Round {{of the playoffs}} {{for the first time in}} their history in the 2005-06 season. They defeated the Long Beach Ice Dogs in seven games. The <b>Condors</b> lost in the seventh game of the next round against the Fresno Falcons, making it the longest playoff run in <b>Condors</b> history at the time. The <b>Condors</b> did it again the following year, defeating Fresno, but then lost in round 2 to the Alaska Aces in four games. However, in the 2013-14 season, the <b>Condors</b> had their furthest playoff run in team history, getting to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the Alaska Aces in 6 games, winning 2 and losing 4.|$|R
5|$|The Andean <b>condor</b> is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuelan Andes states. It is the national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from c. 2500 BCE onward, and they are a part of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, the Andean <b>condor</b> was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. The Andean <b>condor</b> is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the bones and organs of the Andean <b>condor</b> possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting, a <b>condor</b> is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The <b>condor</b> generally survives and is set free.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, and follows a rōnin named Shiren and his companion, the talking weasel Koppa, on a quest for the Land of the Golden <b>Condor.</b> They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the Blinder, a travelling woman who has the power to blind people and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden <b>condor</b> from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the <b>condor,</b> flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople look up at the <b>condor</b> and make a wish. The <b>condor</b> lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking away into the night.|$|E
5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent <b>condor</b> populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors {{have been trained to}} avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of <b>condor</b> deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead waste is not as much of a problem for other avian scavengers such as the turkey vulture and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree <b>Condor</b> Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree <b>Condor</b> Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California <b>condor.</b> There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the <b>condor</b> currently resides.|$|E
50|$|On December 18, 2015, the <b>Condors</b> {{participated in}} the AHL's first outdoor game in California, called the Golden State Hockey Rush, at Raley Field in West Sacramento against the Stockton Heat. The Heat would defeat the <b>Condors</b> 3-2 in front of 9,357 fans. Despite not making the playoffs in their first season, the <b>Condors</b> still contributed to the overall {{increase}} in AHL attendance {{with an average of}} 5195 per night, an increase of about 1900 spectators compared to the former Barons and similar to the former ECHL <b>Condors.</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the California <b>condor</b> was widespread across North America; <b>condor</b> bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, {{at the end of}} the last glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna that led to a subsequent reduction in range and population. Five hundred years ago, the California <b>condor</b> roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|The Andean <b>condor</b> is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions.

5000|$|As {{the season}} progressed, {{attendance}} dropped below 1,000 fans per game, fueling speculation the <b>Condors</b> would fold before Christmas. While they {{did manage to}} survive into the New Year, Haven finally had seen enough and announced the <b>Condors</b> would be playing elsewhere for the 1972-73 season. In the meantime, they began relocating home games, first to other cities in Pennsylvania, and then to farther-away places. On March 24, 1972 the <b>Condors</b> hosted the Kentucky Colonels in Birmingham, Alabama; four days later, the <b>Condors</b> hosted the Colonels again, this time in their last ever 'home' game, in Tucson, Arizona.|$|R

It has also appeared on the coins and banknotes of Colombia and Chile. The <b>condor</b> is featured in several coats of arms of Andean countries {{as a symbol of}} Andes mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Andean <b>condor</b> is {{the only}} {{accepted}} living species of its genus, Vultur. Unlike the California <b>condor</b> (Gymnogyps californianus), which is known from extensive fossil remains and some additional ones of , the fossil record of the Andean <b>condor</b> recovered to date is scant. Presumed Plio-Pleistocene species of South American condors were later recognized to be not different from the present species, although one known only from a few rather small bones found in a Pliocene deposit of Tarija Department, Bolivia, {{may have been a}} smaller palaeosubspecies, V. gryphus patruus.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed <b>condors</b> feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the <b>condor's</b> extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the reintroduction of <b>condors</b> to the Grand Canyon was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.|$|R

5|$|All five ships served {{extensively}} in Germany's colonial possessions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Seeadler {{participated in the}} suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Falke participated in the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03, and <b>Condor</b> and Cormoran helped to defeat the Sokehs Rebellion in the Caroline Islands in 1911. Bussard and Falke were scrapped in 1912, while Seeadler and <b>Condor</b> returned to Germany in 1914 to be decommissioned. Cormoran and Geier remained in the Pacific at the outbreak of World War I; the former's engines were worn out and she was scuttled in Tsingtao. Geier briefly attacked British shipping in the Pacific but put into Hawaii after running out of fuel. She was interned, seized by the US Navy in 1917, and commissioned as USS Schurz; she briefly served in the US Navy before she was accidentally rammed and sunk by a freighter in June 1918. Meanwhile, Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. <b>Condor</b> was {{the only member of the}} class to survive the war; she was broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath {{is home to}} 45 Commando of the Royal Marines, {{who have}} been based at RM <b>Condor</b> since 1971. The barracks were {{originally}} built in 1940 and commissioned as RNAS Arbroath/HMS <b>Condor,</b> a Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) until 1971. The Royal Marines moved to Arbroath in 1971 and remain {{a major contributor to}} the local economy, in addition to the Marines stationed at Arbroath, around 600 residents are employed by the Ministry of Defence. The Royal Marines from 45 Commando were recently engaged on operations in Afghanistan and have deployed in support of operations in Iraq and the Falklands War. In 2004, there was speculation that RM <b>Condor</b> would be transferred to the Army as a replacement for Fort George and that the barracks would become a permanent base for a battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. These plans never went beyond the planning stage and in 2005 it was confirmed the Royal Marines would remain based at the site.|$|E
5|$|<b>Condor</b> bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have <b>condor</b> feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E
