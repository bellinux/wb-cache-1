500|$|The {{popularity}} of SpongeBob translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country as a method of the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Nickelodeon also expanded the merchandising of the show, bringing it around $500 million revenue. It was reported that SpongeBob-themed goods are the best-selling character merchandise at Hot Topic store at Park City Center. T-shirts, pillows, shoelaces, pins, sunglasses, and air fresheners were sold [...] "extremely well if they have SpongeBob's likeness on them," [...] said Erin Aguirre, lead sales associate of Hot Topic. He added [...] " [...] <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> just jump right into it. [...] "Did you see last week's episode?' They totally talk all about it, just that it's funny, that it's hilarious." ...|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks was {{recorded}} during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing {{the studio and}} the recording process, said, [...] "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." [...] The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.|$|E
2500|$|According to Christian, the Millennium Falcon set was {{the most}} {{difficult}} to build. Christian wanted the interior of the Falcon to look like that of a submarine. He found scrap airplane metal [...] "that no one wanted in those days and bought them". He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to [...] "stick it in the sets in specific ways". It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as [...] "the most encrusted set") in the hold of the Falcon. The garbage compactor set [...] "was also pretty hard, because I knew I had actors in there and the walls had to <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> had to be in dirty water and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around". A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them. The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at Shepperton Studios; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time.|$|E
25|$|<b>And</b> <b>they</b> {{were some}} of the most unassuming, laid-back people to ever work with. I mean, they had no {{attitude}} at all. <b>They</b> just <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were just really polite and very thankful, <b>and</b> then when <b>they</b> turned on the amps and made that noise, it was just unbelievable that it was coming from them.|$|R
500|$|The band also {{recorded}} interludes with Primus bass player and singer Les Claypool and MTV VJ Matt Pinfield. Claypool stated, [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> {{wanted me to}} write some sort of intro for the record. I got stoned <b>and</b> got <b>in</b> front of the mic and started babbling <b>and</b> <b>they</b> ended up not using the intro and using that instead." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bruttenholm is {{preparing}} for his trip to Transylvania where rumors have it {{that there is a}} vampire on the loose. As he is packing, his colleague <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> discuss the [...] "right hand of doom" [...] (Hellboy's stone hand); Bruttenholm asserts that so long as evil exists, good will rise up against it, before revealing an image of Hellboy's right hand, signifying that he will be responsible for the destruction of the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "First," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, [...] "you {{should have}} some new clothes to <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You'll want some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?" ...|$|E
60|$|Roger and Phil {{had not yet}} <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> {{had left}} Billy Dill at the depot {{to watch out for}} them. On {{returning}} to the station, Dave and Mr. Wadsworth met the three at the doors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but, you see, it {{is pretty}} certain that that curtain will not be drawn until they <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> would notice it at once. If we took out a pane in the front window the shutter would prevent our seeing or hearing, and the man would be sure to notice the pane was missing as he walked up from {{the gate to the}} house." ...|$|E
50|$|The Driggs family <b>came</b> to Arizona <b>in</b> 1921 after trading {{everything}} they owned - a bank, drugstore, hotel, <b>and</b> wheat farm <b>in</b> Driggs, Idaho - for {{a section of}} cotton land in Maricopa County. Their timing was unfortunate as cotton prices plummeted just as their crop <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were forced to take jobs selling building <b>and</b> loan certificates. <b>In</b> 1929, the Driggs family pooled $5,000 to found the Western Building and Loan Association, which became Western Savings.|$|R
25|$|Bowie County Sheriff W. H. Presley, {{leader of}} the investigation, was with his old friend Texas City Police Chief Jack N. Runnels when the call <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> sped to the scene. They {{immediately}} launched a citywide investigation along with the Texas and Arkansas city police, the Department of Public Safety, Miller and Cass County sheriffs' departments and the FBI. No money was found on Griffin, nor was any found in Moore's purse. Family members claimed {{that they did not}} carry much money with them. By Monday morning, the Texas Rangers were called in.|$|R

60|$|As soon as {{the wedding}} invitations were issued, the {{presents}} began to <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were fully as numerous and as costly as had been the gifts bestowed upon Dora and upon Nellie. From Mr. Rover came, as was to be expected, a bankbook containing an amount written therein which was the duplicate of that he had bestowed upon Dick and Dora and likewise upon Tom and Nellie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fanny Robin--Miss Everdene's {{youngest}} servant--can't be found. They've {{been wanting}} to lock up the door these two hours, but she isn't <b>come</b> <b>in.</b> <b>And</b> <b>they</b> don't {{know what to do}} about going to bed for fear of locking her out. They wouldn't be so concerned if she hadn't been noticed in such low spirits these last few days, and Maryann d' think the beginning of a crowner's inquest has happened to the poor girl." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{a little}} {{surprised}} at their conversation. Aunt Louisa told him to <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> entered the hall. It was paved with red and yellow tiles, on which alternately were a Greek Cross and the Lamb of God. An imposing staircase led out of the hall. It was of polished pine, with a peculiar smell, and had been put in because fortunately, when the church was reseated, enough wood remained over. The balusters were decorated with emblems of the Four Evangelists.|$|E
50|$|The Ancients live {{in peace}} until the Morphs arrive. The Ancients think that <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> peace <b>and</b> <b>they</b> welcome them. However, the Morphs attack the ancients. The Ancients put their souls in the pyramid, which is then {{captured}} by the Morphs.|$|R
50|$|Damage to {{the pulp}} of {{permanent}} teeth usually requires a Root Canal Treatment or Endodontic Therapy. The pulp of primary or deciduous teeth, which {{only have to}} survive until an adult teeth <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> because <b>they</b> have a better blood supply, can sometimes be saved.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Kay {{time after}} time failed in getting rid of zombie Charity. She used the book of spells to try and destroy Zombie Charity but failed when Zombie Charity Stopped Kay. She once {{followed}} zombie Charity to Miguel's house where {{they were about to}} make love. She started a fire which burnt and destroyed the entire Lopez-Fitzgerald home. At another stage Kay prayed and asked the angels to destroy her but however Miguel <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> disappeared. Another stage they were at a grave yard and zombie Charity tried to make love and kill Miguel but Kay used holy water and stopped her. After Charity’s 18 birthday they went to the hotel and stayed but Kay once again stopped them.|$|R
60|$|Having {{walked up}} and down the main street, and {{procured}} a box of chocolates and a few other things, the two Rovers wandered off {{in the direction of the}} railroad station. A train had just <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> watched the passengers alight and then others get aboard. They were particularly interested in the discomfiture of a fat traveling salesman who came puffing up on the platform, a suitcase in each hand, just in time to see the train depart. The fat man was very angry, but this availed him nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They said so last night, Captain, {{but they}} began just about seven. I heard {{there was another}} ship <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> wanted {{to get us out}} of the way. I was one of the fust ashore, and it didn't take many minutes afore I was out of the shed where they looks at the things. I says to the first chap I meets, [...] "Where can I take a 'bus to the Metropolitan Hotel?" [...] "You won't get no 'bus here," [...] says he. [...] "How far is it?" [...] "Better than two miles," [...] he says. That settled it, and I started off to walk. I ought to have been here sooner, but some one I asked the way of put me wrong, I suppose, and a box like this feels {{wonderful}} heavier the second mile than it does the first.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Aunt Sally {{she was one}} of the mixed-upest-looking persons I {{ever see}} --except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> told it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a {{rattling}} ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn't a understood it. So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer--she chipped in and says, [...] "Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it now, and 'tain't no need to change"--that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it--there warn't no other way, and I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.|$|E

25|$|It was {{formerly}} a common custom {{to wear a}} cross made of paper or ribbon on St Patrick's Day. Surviving examples of such badges <b>come</b> <b>in</b> many colours <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were worn upright rather than as saltires.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bellby applauded his forethought with a dip of his nose. But Soames and Winifred looked with dismay {{at their}} light lunch of gravified brown masses, {{touching}} them gingerly with their forks {{in the hope}} of distinguishing the bodies of the tasty little song-givers. Having begun, however, they found they were hungrier than they thought, and finished the lot, with a glass of port apiece. Conversation turned on the war. Soames thought Ladysmith would fall, and it might last a year. Bellby thought it would be over by the summer. Both agreed that they wanted more men. There was nothing for it but complete victory, since it was now a question of prestige. Winifred brought things back to more solid ground by saying that she did not want the divorce suit to come on till after the summer holidays had begun at Oxford, then the boys would have forgotten about it before Val had to go up again; the London season too would be over. The lawyers reassured her, an interval of six months was necessary--after that the earlier the better. People were now beginning to <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> parted--Soames to the city, Bellby to his chambers, Winifred in a hansom to Park Lane to let her mother know how she had fared. The issue had been so satisfactory on the whole that it was considered advisable to tell James, who never failed to say day after day that he didn't know about Winifred's affair, he couldn't tell. As his sands ran out; the importance of mundane matters became increasingly grave to him, as if he were feeling: 'I must make the most of it, and worry well; I shall soon have nothing to worry about.' ...|$|E

50|$|The Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps {{was formed}} {{initially}} as the Lancaster Town Police Ambulance Service. Residents {{at the time}} were concerned due to delayed response times of ambulances coming from the nearby city of Buffalo, New York. Initially, the Dresser Railcar Factory in Depew donated a used 1947 Mercury ambulance to be used for the new ambulance service. On duty police officers were summoned when a rescue call <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> would drive to the police station to pick up the ambulance and go to the call. However, the Auxiliary police officers were invaluable to this operation as well. They would be called at home or spend time at the garage where the ambulance was quartered. Generally during daytime hours the active police would respond and at night the auxiliary police would respond to requests for the ambulance. The last surviving founding member, former Auxiliary police officer and Director At Large Paul Welker is still active in the Corps. In those initial years, the ambulance fleet included over the years a 1955 Cadillac ambulance, a 1955 Ford Emergency Truck and a 1962 Pontiac ambulance to just name a few.|$|R

He began a relationship with Adélaïde Riberon, by whom he would have two sons. His father, Jean-Baptiste, died on 13 July 1870. He married Riberon in February 1871.|$|R
