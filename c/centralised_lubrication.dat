40|$|In Australian industry, <b>centralised</b> <b>lubrication</b> {{systems are}} used to deliver grease to various {{mechanical}} components, usually bearings. In many situations, {{the length of the}} delivery lines is in excess of 20 metres. These lines meander through other pieces of equipment and infrastructure. In some situations when these lines are attached to support devices that are subject to vibration, the delivery pipes have become “plugged” because the oil in the grease has leaked/separated from the grease matrix. This scenario is very costly to the owner/operator of the equipment as a lack of lubrication can cause major repair/maintenance costs. A laboratory test procedure has been devised to evaluate the suitability of various greases to remain stable under these conditions...|$|E

50|$|The August 1935 {{announcement}} from Daimler {{was that}} the coachwork of the standard saloons was redesigned. The swept tail of the new six-light saloon now covered the spare wheel. The new bodies were appreciably wider. The special independent assembly of the radiator and front wings {{was applied to the}} Fifteen as previously applied to the new Daimler Light Twenty announced on the 12 July 1935.A number of important improvements were made to the front part of the chassis though it retained the same dimensions. Suspension and steering were changed. To reduce fore and aft movement as much as possible the front springs were lengthened and made more supple in order to bring their periodicity nearer that of the rear springs. Steering was changed to the worm and nut system. The steering column was made adjustable for reach. <b>Centralised</b> automatic chassis <b>lubrication</b> and easy jacking facilities were now installed.|$|R
