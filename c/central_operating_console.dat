50|$|Lego Star Wars II is an action-adventure game whose {{gameplay}} consists {{primarily of}} shooting enemy Stormtroopers {{and ensuring that}} all teammates {{reach the end of}} each level. Teammates are often stranded from each other; pushing blocks and <b>operating</b> <b>consoles</b> allows the team to be reunited, adding an element of puzzle gameplay. The object of the game is to escape the Death Star. The player initially controls Luke, who is armed with a blaster. The player soon rescues R2-D2, and later Leia, and can switch between the three at will. Once Leia is rescued, Luke gives her his blaster; pushing blocks, shooting, and <b>operating</b> <b>consoles</b> are handled by Luke, Leia, and R2-D2 respectively.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Compared {{with the}} {{conventional}} dimming system of LED stage light which uses the heavy light <b>operating</b> <b>console</b> {{to adjust the}} brightness of stage light, a portable LED stage lighting control system is designed in this paper. In this system a adjust handle is introduced to adjust {{the brightness of the}} LED stage light instead of the <b>operating</b> <b>console,</b> accordingly the novel dimming system is portable and easy to carry compared with the conventional one. The key technologies of the system such as high power LED driving circuit,LED dimming and the heat dissipation of LED are analyzed here in detail. Simulation and experiment results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed system. Keywords—high power LED; LED driving circuit; PWM; LED thermal analysi...|$|R
