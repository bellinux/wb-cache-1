5|$|All seven PCI Express x16 {{slots in}} the Asus P6T7 {{motherboard}} {{were used in}} the building of the Fastra II computer. However, the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough to require two such slots each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express <b>cables,</b> <b>and</b> Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.|$|E
5|$|Only {{moderate}} {{force is}} needed to insert or remove a USB cable. USB <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> small USB devices are {{held in place by}} the gripping force from the receptacle (without need of the screws, clips, or thumb-turns other connectors have required).|$|E

Lombardo used Tama Drums, Paiste cymbals, Pro-Mark drum sticks, and Evans drum heads.|$|E
5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work {{needed to be done}} on the armament, but it had to wait until she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E

5|$|Like Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Ruby and Sapphire {{keep track}} of real-life time; this {{influences}} events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike their predecessors, Ruby and Sapphire do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to {{the differences in the}} technical specifications of Game Boy link <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> Game Boy Advance link cables, Ruby and Sapphire cannot be linked with Pokémon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade to the previous generations.|$|E
5|$|Mobile High-Definition Link (MHL) is an {{adaptation}} of HDMI intended to connect mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and displays. Unlike DVI, which is compatible with HDMI using only passive <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> adapters, MHL requires that the HDMI socket be MHL-enabled, otherwise an active adapter (or dongle) is required to convert the signal to HDMI. MHL is developed by a consortium of five consumer electronics manufacturers, several of which are also behind HDMI.|$|E
5|$|Monster re-entered {{the auto}} audio {{market in the}} early 1990s with {{a new line of}} speaker <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> its first speaker product, the Persona One. Its {{high-end}} M-series product line was introduced in 1992. It also expanded internationally, especially in Asia. Monster had a Taiwanese distributor file its trademark in the region, which led to the distributor continuing to sell products under the Monster brand after their agreement with Monster was terminated. This led to a lengthy legal battle and eventually a settlement. Monster acquired the Entec in-car audio brand in 1998.|$|E

In 1988 <b>Cable</b> <b>and</b> Wireless (Hong Kong) Limited merged with Hong Kong Telephone Company as Hong Kong Telecom.

5|$|One major {{challenge}} was {{the approach to}} the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E

The architect of this suspension structure that is supported by s, <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> counterweights was César Pelli, who {{is best known as}} the architect of the Petronas Towers.|$|E
5|$|The Micro plug {{design is}} rated {{for at least}} 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles, {{which is more than}} the Mini plug design. The Micro {{connector}} is also designed to reduce the mechanical wear on the device; instead the easier-to-replace cable is designed to bear the mechanical wear of connection and disconnection. The Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB <b>Cables</b> <b>and</b> Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB receptacles (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs), and Micro-B plugs and receptacles, along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, <b>Cable</b> <b>and</b> Wireless {{sold its}} 52.5 {{percent stake in}} <b>Cable</b> <b>and</b> Wireless Optus, which was the second-largest telecom company in Australia, to SingTel. The deal {{was said to be}} the second largest {{corporate}} deal in Australian history.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new 8 -fiber aerial <b>cable</b> <b>and</b> a new aerial optical closure for areas of small-scale optical demand. Closures can be installed arbitrarily {{at a later date}} and thus the time needed for installation and service order work can be reduced. The <b>cable</b> <b>and</b> closure make it possible to realize efficient construction, operation and investment, and they contribute to the “full-scale FTTH era”. This article reports the development of our new aerial optical <b>cable</b> <b>and</b> closure...|$|R
5|$|The Sutton Wick air crash {{occurred}} on 5 March 1957 when a Blackburn Beverley C Mk 1 heavy transport aircraft, serial number XH117, of 53 Squadron Royal Air Force crashed at Sutton Wick, Drayton, Berkshire, England, following a shut-down of one engine and partial {{loss of power}} on another. Shortly after take-off, No. 1 engine was shut down as a precautionary measure then whilst on final approach back to RAF Abingdon, No. 2 engine {{failed to respond to}} throttle inputs. The aeroplane struck <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> trees 18minutes after lifting off.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which has replaced legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters which perform active conversion from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C chipsets {{are not required to}} include Dual-mode trasnmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters would not work with Type-C sources.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} proposals {{at the time}} to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using <b>cables</b> <b>and</b> would hang from steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.|$|E
