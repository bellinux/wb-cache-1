Beyond its connection to boosting, <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> {{has been interpreted}} as a learning-based approach to iterative optimization methods like the Newton’s method. However, in prior work, the connection to optimization theory is limited only in learning a mapping from image features to problem parameters. In this paper, we consider the problem of facial de-formable model fitting using <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> and make the following contributions: (a) We propose regression to learn a sequence of averaged Jacobian and Hessian matri-ces from data, and from them descent directions in a fashion inspired by Gauss-Newton optimization. (b) We show that the optimization problem in hand has structure and devise a learning strategy for a <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> approach that takes the problem structure into account. By doing so, the proposed method learns and employs a sequence of aver-aged Jacobians and descent directions in a subspace or-thogonal to the facial appearance variation; hence, we call it Project-Out <b>Cascaded</b> <b>Regression</b> (PO-CR). (c) Based {{on the principles of}} PO-CR, we built a face alignment system that produces remarkably accurate results on the challeng-ing iBUG data set outperforming previously proposed sys-tems by a large margin.

40|$|<b>Cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> {{has been}} {{recently}} applied to reconstructing 3 D faces from single 2 D images directly in shape space, and achieved state-of-the-art performance. This paper investigates thoroughly such <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> based 3 D face reconstruction approaches from four perspectives {{that are not}} well studied yet: (i) The impact {{of the number of}} 2 D landmarks; (ii) the impact of the number of 3 D vertices; (iii) the way of using standalone automated landmark detection methods; and (iv) the convergence property. To answer these questions, a simplified <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> based 3 D face reconstruction method is devised, which can be integrated with standalone automated landmark detection methods and reconstruct 3 D face shapes that have the same pose and expression as the input face images, rather than normalized pose and expression. Moreover, an effective training method is proposed by disturbing the automatically detected landmarks. Comprehensive evaluation experiments have been done with comparison to other 3 D face reconstruction methods. The results not only deepen the understanding of <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> based 3 D face reconstruction approaches, but also prove the effectiveness of proposed method.

Unlike the conventional <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> approaches that {{start with an}} initial shape and refine the shape in a cascaded manner, our ap-proach begins with a coarse search over a shape space that contains diverse shapes, and employs the coarse solution to constrain subsequent finer search of shapes. The unique stage-by-stage progressive and adaptive search i) prevents the final solution from being trapped in local optima due to poor initialisation, a common problem encountered by <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> approaches; and ii) improves the ro-bustness in coping with large pose variations.

40|$|<b>Cascade</b> <b>regression</b> {{framework}} {{has been}} shown to be effective for facial landmark detection. It starts from an initial face shape and gradually predicts the face shape update from the local appearance features to generate the facial landmark locations in the next iteration until convergence. In this paper, we improve upon the <b>cascade</b> <b>regression</b> framework and propose the Constrained Joint <b>Cascade</b> <b>Regression</b> Framework (CJCRF) for simultaneous facial action unit recognition and facial landmark detection, which are two related face analysis tasks, but are seldomly exploited together. In particular, we first learn the relationships among facial action units and face shapes as a constraint. Then, in the proposed constrained joint <b>cascade</b> <b>regression</b> framework, with the help from the constraint, we iteratively update the facial landmark locations and the action unit activation probabilities until convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the intertwined relationships of facial action units and face shapes boost the performances of both facial action unit recognition and facial landmark detection. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to the state-of-the-art works.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the details of}} our method in at-tending the 300 Faces in-the-wild (300 W) challenge. We build our method on <b>cascade</b> <b>regression</b> framework, where a series of regressors are {{utilized}} to progressively refine the shape initialized by face detector. In <b>cascade</b> <b>regression,</b> we use the HOG feature in a multi-scale manner, where the large pose validation is handled in early stages by HOG feature at large scale, and then shape is refined at later stages with HOG feature at small scale.

To handle the problem, we propose to generate multiple hypotheses, and then learn to rank or combine these hypotheses to get the final result. The parameters in both learn to rank and learn to combine can be learned in a structural SVM framework.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel real-time algorithm for facial landmark tracking. Compared to detection, tracking has both additional challenges and opportunities. Arguably {{the most important}} aspect in this domain is updating a tracker's models as tracking progresses, also known as incremental (face) tracking. While this should result in more accurate localisation, how to do this online and in real time without causing a tracker to drift is still an important open research question. We address this question in the <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> framework, the state-of-the-art approach for facial landmark localisation. Because incremental learning for <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> is costly, we propose a much more efficient yet equally accurate alternative using continuous regression. More specifically, we first propose cascaded continuous regression (CCR) and show its accuracy is equivalent to the Supervised Descent Method. We then derive the incremental learning updates for CCR (iCCR) and show that it is an order of magnitude faster than standard incremental learning for <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression,</b> bringing the time required for the update from seconds down to a fraction of a second, thus enabling real-time tracking.

Given a sizeable training set, <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> learns a set of generic rules that are sequentially applied to minimise the least squares problem. Despite the success of <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> for problems such as face alignment and head pose estimation, there are several shortcomings arising in the strategies proposed thus far. Specifically, (a) the regressors are learnt independently, (b) the descent directions may cancel one another out and (c) handcrafted features (e. g., HoGs, SIFT etc.) are mainly used to drive the cascade, which may be sub-optimal for {{the task at hand}}. In this paper, we propose a combined and jointly trained convolutional recurrent neural network architecture that allows the training of an end-to-end to system that attempts to alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks. The recurrent module facilitates the joint optimisation of the regressors by assuming the cascades form a nonlinear dynamical system, in effect fully utilising the information between all cascade levels by introducing a memory unit that shares information across all levels. The convolutional module allows the network to extract features that are specialised for the task at hand and are experimentally shown to outperform hand-crafted features.

40|$|Facial Landmark Tracking (Face Tracking) {{is a key}} {{step for}} many Face Analysis systems, such as Face Recognition, Facial Expression Recognition, or Age and Gender Recognition, among others. The goal of Facial Landmark Tracking is to locate a sparse set of points {{defining}} a facial shape in a video sequence. These typically include the mouth, the eyes, the contour, or the nose tip. The {{state of the art}} method for Face Tracking builds on <b>Cascaded</b> <b>Regression,</b> in which a set of linear regressors are used in a cascaded fashion, each receiving as input the output of the previous one, subsequently reducing the error with respect to the target locations. Despite its impressive results, <b>Cascaded</b> <b>Regression</b> suffers from several drawbacks, which are basically caused by the theoretical and practical implications of using Linear Regression. Under the context of Face Alignment, Linear Regression is used to predict shape displacements from image features through a linear mapping. This linear mapping is learnt through the typical least-squares problem, in which a set of random perturbations is given. This means that, each time a new regressor is to be trained, <b>Cascaded</b> <b>Regression</b> needs to generate perturbations and apply the sampling again. Moreover, existing solutions are not capable of incorporating incremental learning in real time. It is well-known that person-specific models perform better than generic ones, and thus the possibility of personalising generic models whilst tracking is ongoing is a desired property, yet to be addressed. This thesis proposes Continuous Regression, a Functional Regression solution to the least-squares problem, resulting in the first real-time incremental face tracker. Briefly speaking, Continuous Regression approximates the samples by an estimation based on a first-order Taylor expansion yielding a closed-form solution for the infinite set of shape displacements. This way, it is possible to model the space of shape displacements as a continuum, without the need of using complex bases. Further, this thesis introduces a novel measure that allows Continuous Regression to be extended to spaces of correlated variables. This novel solution is incorporated into the <b>Cascaded</b> <b>Regression</b> framework, and its computational benefits for training under different configurations are shown. Then, it presents an approach for incremental learning within <b>Cascaded</b> <b>Regression,</b> and shows its complexity allows for real-time implementation.

Instead of learning the mapping between the whole parameters and image features directly with a <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> framework in current methods, we learn individual sets of parameters mappings separately step by step by a coordinate descent mean. Because different parameters make different contributions to the displacement of facial landmarks, our method is more discriminative to current whole-parameter <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> methods.

The proposed end-to-end system relies on distance-aware softmax functions and dual-pathway proposal-refinement architecture. Results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art cascaded regression-based methods on multiple in-the-wild face alignment databases. The model achieves 1. 84 normalized mean error (NME) on the AFLW database, which outperforms 3 DDFA by 61. 8 %.

In this work, we propose a unified robust <b>cascade</b> <b>regression</b> framework that can handle both images with severe occlusion and images with large head poses. Specifically, the method iteratively predicts the landmark occlusions and the landmark locations. For occlusion estimation, instead of directly predicting the binary occlusion vectors, we introduce a supervised regression method that gradually updates the landmark visibility probabilities in each iteration to achieve robustness. In addition, we explicitly add occlusion pattern as a constraint to improve the performance of occlusion prediction. For landmark detection, we combine the landmark visibility probabilities, the local appearances, and the local shapes to iteratively update their positions. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method is significantly better than state-of-the-art works on images with severe occlusion and images with large head poses.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of context on regression-based methods for facial landmarking. Regression based methods have revolutionised facial landmarking solutions. In {{particular}} those that implicitly infer the whole shape of a structured object have quickly become the state-of-the-art. The most notable exemplar is the Supervised Descent Method (SDM). Its main characteristics are {{the use of}} the <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> approach, {{the use of the}} full appearance as the inference input, and the aforementioned aim to directly predict the full shape. In this article we argue that the key aspects responsible for the success of SDM are the use of <b>cascaded</b> <b>regression</b> and the avoidance of the constrained optimisation problem that characterised most of the previous approaches. We show that, surprisingly, it is possible to achieve comparable or superior performance using only landmark-specific predictors, which are linearly combined. We reason that augmenting the input with too much context (of which using the full appearance is the extreme case) can be harmful. In fact, we experimentally found that there is a relation between the data variance and the benefits of adding context to the input. We finally devise a simple greedy procedure that makes use of this fact to obtain superior performance to the SDM, while maintaining the simplicity of the algorithm. We show extensive results both for intermediate stages devised to prove the main aspects of the argumentative line, and to validate the overall performance of two models constructed based on these considerations...|$|E

Face expression reconstruction from a single image is a challenging task in computer vision. Most state-of-the-art methods fit the input image to a 3 D Morphable Model (3 DMM).

In each iteration, residues between the current 3 DMM parameters and the ground truth are estimated and then used to update the 3 D shapes. The mapping matrices are also calculated based on the updated shapes and 2 D landmarks. HOG features of the local patches and displacements between 3 D landmark projections and 2 D landmarks are exploited.

We perform a detailed evaluation by proposing our evaluation protocol derived from two unconstrained datasets: (1) IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A) and (2) WIDER FACE. From our study, we find that the multiple model based detector achieves superior detection rates across most of the domains studied and requires more computational power. However, the unique combination of normalised pixel difference, soft <b>cascade</b> and <b>regression</b> trees within a face detector can achieve similar performance with much less computation...|$|R

Recently, <b>cascaded</b> shape <b>regression</b> has been proposed to accurately locate facial landmarks. A large number of weak regressors are cascaded in a sequence to fit face shapes to the correct landmark locations. In this paper, we propose to improve the method by applying gradual training. With this training, the regressors are not directly aimed to the true locations. The sequence instead is divided into successive parts each of which is aimed to intermediate targets between the initial and the true locations. We also investigate the incorporation of pose information in the cascaded model. The aim is to find out whether the model can be directly used to estimate head pose. Experiments on the Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild database have shown that the proposed method is able to improve the localization and give accurate estimates of pose...|$|R
40|$|Ear as a {{biometric}} modality {{presents a}} viable source for automatic human recognition especially in surveillance scenarios where face {{is not seen}} frontally. In recent years local description methods have been gaining on popularity due to their invariance to illumination and occlusion. However, these methods require that images are well aligned and preprocessed as good as possible. This causes {{one of the greatest}} challenges of ear recognition: sensitivity to pose variations. In this paper we test the influence of alignment on recognition performance on images from recently presented Annotated Web Ears dataset with alignment methods Random sample consensus (RANSAC) and <b>Cascaded</b> Pose <b>Regression</b> (CPR). We prove that alignment improves recognition rate but only on images with small angle on roll and yaw axis. On other pictures RANSAC and CPR fails to align ears and recognition rate is therefore lower versus unaligned pictures. Those pictures should be addressed with more advanced alignment methods in order to improve recognition rate...|$|R
