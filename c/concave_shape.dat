5|$|Wok: The {{cast-iron}} Wok {{was invented}} in China during the Han dynasty. The round-bottomed cooking vessel is central to Chinese cooking and soon spread to other Asian culinary spheres due to its unique <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> and ability to sear food at a fast pace.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E
25|$|Mannette is {{credited}} with several innovations which {{have proven to be}} essential for the evolution of steel pan. He was the first to use a 55-gallon oil barrel instead of biscuit tins or soap boxes. Furthermore, Mannette was the person to sink the top of the drum into a <b>concave</b> <b>shape,</b> thus having more space to place notes as well as achieving a better isolation between the different pitches. Ellie Mannette has developed many instruments of the steel pan family. His use of the whole tone scale on two resonance bodies has become a widely common standard.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{anisotropic}} 3 D surface evo-lution model for detecting protrusion shape based colonic polyp on the curved surface. The {{important feature of}} the proposed model {{is that it can}} detect protrusions with both convex and <b>concave</b> <b>shapes.</b> Protrusion shapes are defined as the exten-sion beyond the usual limits or above a plane surface. Based on Gaussian and mean curvature flows, the approach works by locally deforming the convex or concave surface until the sec-ond principal curvature goes to zero. The diffusion directions are changed to prevent convex surfaces from converting into <b>concave</b> <b>shapes,</b> and vice versa. The deformation field quan-titatively measures the amount of protrudeness. The proposed method has been evaluated by using synthetic phantoms and real colon datasets...|$|R
25|$|The tall {{chimneys}} and <b>concave</b> <b>shaped</b> {{cooling towers}} of the many power stations are a dominant and familiar presence within the open landscape of the Trent valley, which has been widely used for power generation since the 1940s.|$|R
25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> to hold the disc into the soil– unless something hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll {{up and over the}} obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E
25|$|The African threadfish (Alectis alexandrina) (also {{known as}} the Alexandria pompano) is a species of large marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is {{distributed}} {{along the coast of}} tropical Africa in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, extending to the Mediterranean Sea. Adults live predominantly in shallow waters shallower than 70 m deep, often forming small schools. The African threadfish is similar in appearance to the closely related and co-occurring African pompano, with the slightly <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> of the species head profile the most definitive feature of the species. Like other members of the genus Alectis, the juveniles of the species have long trailing dorsal and anal fins. The African threadfish is of minor commercial importance, and is also considered to be a game fish.|$|E
25|$|The African pompano (Alectis ciliaris) (also {{known as}} the pennant-fish and {{threadfin}} trevally) is a widely distributed species of tropical marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is found in tropical waters worldwide, with adults often inhabiting coastlines, while juveniles are usually pelagic, floating with ocean currents. The adult African pompano is similar in appearance to {{the other members of}} the genus Alectis, with the <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> of the head near the eyes the clearest distinguishing feature. The juveniles are similar to other members of Alectis, having long, filamentous dorsal and anal fin tips which are thought to discourage predators. The species lives in depths less than 100 m, consuming a range of crustaceans and small fishes. The species is of minor economic importance, often taken amongst other tropical midwater fishes by hook and line, while juveniles are occasionally caught in beach seines. African pompano are also highly rated game fish, often considered one of the strongest of the jacks in larger sizes.|$|E
50|$|The Transitional Period {{followed}} the Beringian Period from 13,000 B.P. to 9,500 B.P. Two types of Chindadn points {{are associated with}} this time period, Chindadn point two being triangular shaped and Chindadn point three having a <b>concave</b> <b>shaped</b> base.|$|R

40|$|Various {{tests showed}} a {{significant}} side load peak for low nozzle pressure ratios during engine start-up and shut down phase. DLR Lampoldshausen carried out tests to examine the flow field in a truncated ideal contour nozzle for low NPR. For NPR 20 a slight <b>concave</b> <b>shaped</b> Mach disk was found. Its curvature {{is limited to the}} centre and its height trend correlates with measured side loads. A <b>concave</b> <b>shaped</b> Mach disk being responsible for re-attached flows at low NPR could be excluded. The experiments were accompanied by numerical simulations of the flow field on various pressure ratios with regards on the shock pattern. The predicted Mach disk shape compares well with the experiments...|$|R
500|$|Lookout Mountain {{was created}} through a {{combination}} of seismic activity and erosion. It was uplifted during the period of mountain building that formed the Appalachians, known as the Appalachian orogeny. Over 200million years ago, the modern-day parklands lay beneath an ocean. When first formed, the entire mountain was underwater, but the rim of the canyon eventually became a beach {{along the edge of the}} receding ocean. [...] As the ocean dried up, Sitton Gulch Creek and its tributaries, particularly Daniel Creek, eroded the rock. The sandstone forming the bluffs has a tendency to fracture into blocks, creating unusual boulder formations. The <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> of the top of Lookout Mountain also drains rainwater through fissures into the underlying limestone, forming miles of subterranean caves in the area.|$|E
2500|$|Subdural hematomas occur {{most often}} around the tops {{and sides of}} the frontal and parietal lobes. They also occur in the {{posterior}} cranial fossa, and near the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli. [...] Unlike epidural hematomas, which cannot expand past the sutures of the skull, subdural hematomas can expand along {{the inside of the}} skull, creating a <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> that follows the curve of the brain, stopping only at the dural reflections like the tentorium cerebelli and falx cerebri.|$|E
2500|$|The {{house is}} a raised, one-storey, brick and masonry {{residential}} structure on {{the northwest corner of}} Salud and Aurora streets, in Ponce's Historic Zone. The is oriented on a diagonal axis with respect to the street corner. [...] The main facade of the house face the street corner. At both ends of this frontal facade, the house plan turns an angle so that the front facade becomes first perpendicular and then parallel to the corresponding side street. The property is surrounded by a 4-foot plastered masonry wall with an 18-inch high wrought iron railing above. The small, diagonal front chamfered gate is also built in wrought-iron. The frontal facade consists of a <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> and incorporates a podium porch, Ionic columns, a recessed loggia, and a cornice with a battlement parapet above. [...] The raised loggia porch incorporates concrete balustrades the full length of the balcony. The loggia porch is reached from the front gardens via a wide [...] masonry stairway. The loggia incorporates five bays that establish the central section of the frontal concave facade. The front is highlighted by five arched windows.|$|E
40|$|A fault ring is a {{connection}} of only nonfaulty adjacent nodes and links such that {{the interior of the}} ring contains only faulty components. This paper proposes two wormhole routing algorithms that deal with more relaxed shapes of fault rings than previously known algorithms [1, 2, 3] in the mesh networks. As a result, the number of components to be made disabled would be reduced considerably in some cases. First algorithm, called F 4, uses four virtual channels and allows all four sides of fault rings to contain <b>concave</b> <b>shapes.</b> Second algorithm, F 3, permits up to three sides to contain <b>concave</b> <b>shapes</b> using only three virtual channels. Both F 3 and F 4 are free of deadlock and livelock and guarantee the delivery of messages between any pair of nonfaulty and connected nodes in the network. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{numerical}} simulations {{were performed on}} reinforced concrete cladding panels with different curvatures subjected to explosive loading. The LS-DYNA finite element program along with the Concrete Damage Model was used to develop the numerical model and calibrated using the results of existing explosive trials. Both convex and <b>concave</b> <b>shaped</b> single curvature panels were assessed along with standards flat panels for the blast performance. Two different connection types were considered for the evaluation, which were identical to those used in the original explosive trials, named as dowelled type and angle cleat type connections. Improved performance with reduced transverse deformations was observed for the convex shaped panels {{in comparison with the}} original flat panel. However, <b>concave</b> <b>shaped</b> panels exhibited a more flexible response. Connection forces did not exhibit a significant variation although the panel response was different with change in curvature...|$|R

2500|$|The Māori camp {{had been}} {{established}} just four days earlier, in hilly, bush-covered country below the high wooded tableland of Okutuku, a village that had been raided in January 1866 {{as part of a}} [...] "bush-scouring" [...] campaign by Major-General Trevor Chute during the earlier hostilities. About 100 metres of 3.6m-high loose palisading had been hastily erected in a <b>concave</b> <b>shape,</b> blocking the path to the pā, while other defensive works included a long trench 2m wide and 2m deep behind the palisade, as well as hidden rifle pits and three taumaihi, 6m-high towers built of packed soil and ferns. While men in the trenches could fire through a gap beneath the palings of the palisade, others on an earth bank behind the trenches could fire through gaps in the palings, while a third line of fire could be effected from the taumaihi. Tītokowaru had placed his men on high alert and in the misty dawn, sentries caught sight of Whitmore's advance guard moving through the bush. The Moturoa defenders were silently roused and took their firing positions without being seen by the attacking force.|$|E

He dragged me up from the deep water in the seal cave, and now someone may drift in there again as I did,' {{and he was gone}} into the darkness. The projecting rock hid the light on the Flagstaff Rock, but he knew his way too well to miss it. His boldness and sureness of foot standing to him, he shortly stood on the great round-topped rock cut away beneath by the action of the waves over the entrance of the seal cave, where the water was fathomless. There he stood in comparative safety, for the <b>concave</b> <b>shape</b> of the rock beat back the waves with their own force, and though the water below him seemed to boil like a seething cauldron, just beyond the spot there was a space of almost calm. The rock, too, seemed here to shut off the sound of the gale, and he listened as well as watched. As he stood there ready, with his coil of rope poised to throw, he thought he heard below him, just beyond the whirl of the water, a faint, despairing cry. He echoed it with a shout that rang into the night Then he waited for the flash of lightning, and as it passed flung his rope out into the darkness where he had seen a face rising through the swirl of the foam. The rope was caught, for he felt a pull on it, and he shouted again in his mighty voice: ...|$|E

The streets were filled with the expanded figures of gayly dressed women, acknowledging with coy glances the respectful salutations of beaux as they gracefully raised their remarkable cylindrical head-coverings, a model of which is still preserved in the Honolulu Museum. The brokers had gathered at their respective temples. The shopmen were exhibiting their goods. The idlers, or 'Bummers,'--a term applied to designate an aristocratic, privileged class who enjoyed immunities from labor, and from whom {{a majority of the}} rulers are chosen,--were listlessly regarding the promenaders from the street-corners or the doors of their bibulous temples. A slight premonitory thrill runs through the city. The busy life of this restless microcosm is arrested. The shopkeeper pauses as he elevates the goods to bring them into a favorable light, and the glib professional recommendation sticks on his tongue. In the drinking-saloon the glass is checked half-way to the lips; on the streets the promenaders pause. Another thrill, and the city begins to go down, a few of the more persistent topers tossing off their liquor at the same moment.
