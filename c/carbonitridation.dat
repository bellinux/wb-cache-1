40|$|It {{is known}} that <b>carbonitridation</b> is a more {{efficient}} process than direct nitridation for the transformation of alumina into aluminium nitride. The simple mechanical mixture of carbon and alumina reduces both the temperature and time of reaction. However, {{the role of the}} carbon and the mechanism of the transformation are not clearly established. Evidence of the formation of hydrogen cyanide from the reaction of carbon with ammonia, and the gas-solid reaction between HCN and alumina for the synthesis of AlN is presented. Anglai...|$|E
40|$|Alternative Al {{production}} methods: Part 1 - {{a review}} of indirect carbothermal routes The production of Al from its ores at present relies on the Bayer (alumina production) and the Hall- Heroult (Al production) process. The cost associated with alumina production and apparent disadvantages of the Hall-Heroult process have led to intensive research to find alternative routes for Al production. The direct carbothermal reduction process has been thoroughly investigated as an alternative technique. Another alternative includes the indirect carbothermal reduction route where alumina (or aluminous ores) is first reduced to intermediate Al compounds before reduced further to Al. The present study reviews and provides systematic thermodynamic analyses of alternative Al production routes. In this paper (Part 1), {{a comprehensive review of}} alternative Al production techniques focusing on the indirect carbothermal reduction routes is presented. These include carbochlorination, <b>carbonitridation</b> and carbosulphidation route...|$|E
