5|$|A combativity {{award was}} also {{attributed}} for the rider who had ridden the most aggressively {{in the eyes}} of the judges at the end of every stage. It <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> rider who featured in breakaways or a cyclist who attacked often.|$|E
5|$|This kid was a {{conservative}} {{when he was}} 17 years old. An archconservative Catholic. He <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> member of the Curia. He was the top student in the class. He was brilliant, way above everybody else.|$|E
5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills. The {{one at the}} hall was once used to churn butter. The foundations of what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E

50|$|Alinda <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} city {{since the}} second millennium BC and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> associated with Ialanti that appears in Hittite sources (J. Garstang, p. 179).|$|R
50|$|Durlabha-raja III, {{also known}} as Duśala, succeeded his father Chamundaraja on the Chahamana throne. The Bijolia {{inscription}} places one Simhata between the two. Historian Dasharatha Sharma theorizes that Simhata <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> elder brother of Durlabharaja.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively, Dawn Landua-McCormack {{suggested}} that the Southern South Saqqara pyramid <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> candidate for Neferhotep's burial site. This pyramid, datable to the middle 13th Dynasty, was provided with two elaborate sarcophagus chambers {{which might have been}} destined for two wealthy brother kings of the dynasty such as Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV.|$|E
5|$|Cane later {{explains}} to Rose that Polk {{had been his}} commander of an artillery battery at a battle which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> victory but that Polk panicked and ran, depressing his men, with those who didn't desert their positions being decimated, including Cane's brothers, or captured like Cane himself. Rose makes Cane promise not to harm Polk, but still has Polk placed in protective custody.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms {{was one of his}} motivations.|$|E
50|$|Eve {{comes under}} {{particular}} scrutiny as it <b>is</b> considered she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> accomplice of either Toby or Ned. It falls to Kinross {{to unravel the}} actual chain of events and arrive at the correct solution.|$|R
50|$|Chamundaraja was {{succeeded by}} his son Durlabharaja III, who was succeeded by his other son Vigraharaja III. The Bijolia {{inscription}} places one Simhata between the Chamundaraja and Durlabharaja III. According to Dasharatha Sharma, Simhata <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> elder brother of Durlabharaja.|$|R
5|$|Nelson {{began to}} develop severe stomach pains, but refused to see a doctor. He distrusted them because his {{brother-in-law}} had died after having a pacemaker installed. It was speculated among friends that the pains were from cancer, but they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> acid condition.|$|R
5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} explosion, and in tandem, was the development of syntactic language that evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse. Syntax would have {{played a key role in}} this process and its full adoption <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> crucial element of the symbolic behavioral package in the MSA.|$|E
5|$|Reznor {{followed}} The Fragile {{with another}} remix album, Things Falling Apart, released in November 2000 to poor reviews, {{a few months}} after the 2000 Fragility tour which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as And All That <b>Could</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Been.</b> <b>A</b> deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc Still, containing stripped-down versions of songs from the Nine Inch Nails catalog along with several new pieces of music.|$|E
5|$|Despite injury troubles, Totti {{recovered}} {{in time to}} join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, {{despite a lack of}} match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti's desire to work even harder to overcome what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> career-ending injury and make it to the World Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media's opinion).|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of Haig {{occurred}} in the memoirs of politicians. Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime, suggested that greater use of tanks, as at Cambrai, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> alternative to blocking enemy machine-gun fire with [...] "the breasts of brave men".|$|R
25|$|The {{derivation}} of {{this word}} remains uncertain. It could {{be related to}} the Greek word γρυπός (grypos), meaning 'curved', or 'hooked'. Also, this <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> Anatolian loan word, compare Akkadian karūbu (winged creature), and similar to Cherub. A related Hebrew word is כרוב (kerúv).|$|R
50|$|Dennis Rodman {{was confronted}} in the {{boardroom}} by Trump and the KOTU teammates as they were all concerned over his drinking. At one point before the announcement of who won, Trump said that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> fired Dennis even if Athena lost, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> Apprentice show first.|$|R
5|$|Following the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest, Armenian media {{claimed that}} Azerbaijan's {{broadcaster}} had {{cut off the}} broadcast when {{it became apparent that}} Armenia had won; however, it was disputed whether the contest was even broadcast in Azerbaijan as they had not yet participated. Accordingly, as Azerbaijan prepared to host the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest following its victory in 2011, a group of Armenian musicians led a boycott effort, and the country would ultimately withdraw from the contest, causing the broadcaster to be fined for the late notice. Armenia returned in the 2013 edition, which was held in Sweden. The move was criticized by an Azeri politician and a representative of the country's state broadcaster, who felt that Armenia's participation <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> symbol of peace between the two nations, and that the decision would further damage the country's reputation.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December 1888, {{his body}} was found {{floating}} in the River Thames, off Thornycroft's torpedo works, Chiswick, by a waterman named Henry Winslade. Stones in Druitt's pockets had kept his body submerged for about a month. He was {{in possession of a}} return train ticket to Hammersmith dated 1 December, a silver watch, a cheque for £50 and £16 in gold (equivalent to £ and £ today). It is not known why he should have carried such a large amount of money, but it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> final payment from the school.|$|E
5|$|SCE Cambridge {{wanted the}} game to possess a unique lead character, thus Sorrell worked with script doctor Martin Pond whilst {{creating}} an expansive backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque. Pond {{came up with the}} idea that Sir Daniel <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> pompous failure in life whose reincarnation was his one shot at redemption. This idea, along with the player-character's unusual appearance, turned appealing to some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be endearing, and was considered a sex symbol in France.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 October 1968 E Evangelia was sailing {{in ballast}} from Rijeka in Yugoslavia to Constanța in Romania {{when she ran}} aground in the Black Sea off Costinești about [...] south of Constanța.

2500|$|Critic Kevin McDonough argues that, [...] "in less talented hands, Two of Us, {{like any}} Beatles-reenactment movie, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> awful {{exercise}} in bad wigs and Liverpool accents.

2500|$|His critics {{claim that}} Recto's {{brilliance}} is overshadowed by {{his inability to}} capture nationwide acceptance. He <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> exceptional leader, perhaps a great president, but his appeal {{was limited to the}} intellectual elite and the nationalist minority of his time. In the same article, political editorialist, Manuel L. Quezon III, laments this fact: ...|$|R
5|$|Strabo {{married into}} equally illustrious families. He may have married a {{daughter}} of Quintus Aelius Tubero, allying himself with the more prestigious Aelian gens. Lucius Seius Tubero, who became suffect consul in AD 18, was probably his son. Strabo's last wife was Cosconia Gallita, sister of Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis (suffect consul in AD 10) and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio (suffect consul in AD 2) and perhaps half-sister of Quintus Junius Blaesus (suffect consul in AD 10). Sejanus <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> child of this marriage. He was later adopted into the Aelian gens by Gaius Aelius Gallus, and by Roman custom became known as Lucius Aelius Seianus or simply as Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{controlled}} {{the ball for}} 41 of 60 minutes. An inability to complete long passes, combined with fumbles, prevented the Buccaneers from taking what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> large early lead. Isaac Hagins' fumble to Atlanta's Tom Pridemore set up a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers maintained a halftime lead, despite having held the ball for only six minutes and 18 seconds in the first half. Falcon blitzing disrupted Doug Williams' passing, and Ricky Bell and Jerry Eckwood were held to 72 yards rushing. Eckwood's fumble led to Atlanta's go-ahead touchdown with 11:10 remaining. Bubba Bean's 60-yard run with 1:22 remaining clinched the game for the Falcons. A 69-yard Williams-led drive brought the Buccaneers to within three points with 28 seconds left, but the Buccaneers failed to recover the ensuing onside kick.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} their {{contention}} that Kinne {{had been so}} interested in seeing her husband removed {{that she had been}} willing to pay for his murder, supported by the grand-jury testimony of John Boldizs. Boldizs, though nominally a witness for the prosecution, weakened his testimony on the stand during the trial by claiming that Kinne's offer to pay him $1,000 in return for James Kinne's murder <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> joke, and Hill was forced to attack his own witness's credibility. Further prosecution testimony alleged that the Kinne's marriage had been on the verge of dissolution at the time of James Kinne's death, that Sharon Kinne's adultery had been a cause of this, and that Sharon Kinne had known that she would collect her husband's $29,000 in life insurance policies only if she were still his wife.|$|E
50|$|All four Courland sisters <b>are</b> {{known to}} <b>have</b> had illegitimate children, Johanna at age sixteen. Because of her unknown origin (even {{the date of}} her birth is disputed) and the favour shown her by the duchess, several historians believe that Němcová <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> illegitimate {{daughter}} of Wilhelmine and either Metternich, Count Karel Clam-Martinic or Windischgrätz.|$|R
2500|$|Furthermore, Bruce Forrest, who <b>was</b> {{quoted in}} <b>a</b> Wired article as a self-proclaimed [...] "double agent", <b>was</b> <b>an</b> active {{correspondent}} for The Scene series. While Jun Productions claim that Forrest had no {{involvement in the}} ninth episode (he supposedly left {{on his own terms}} after the eighth episode), some speculate that it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> elaborate warning by Forrest about the impending Federal arrests.|$|R
50|$|Crazylegs's primary {{military}} {{specialty is}} infantry, and his secondary military specialty is parachute rigger. Crazylegs <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> organist if his fingers hadn't been too short; instead {{he applied for}} the Airborne Rangers with a willingness {{to jump out of}} a helicopter into a hot landing zone with nothing but a rifle and a couple of grenades. Aside from being Airborne Ranger qualified, he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> cross-trained as <b>a</b> forward artillery observer.|$|R
5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never {{played a significant role in}} the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E
5|$|Back at Paramount, Cooper {{returned}} to a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938) with Claudette Colbert. In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France {{who falls in love}} with an impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife. Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert, American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. After all, it succeeded only in the European market. In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter's romantic comedy The Cowboy and the Lady with Merle Oberon, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady's maid. The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> fine vehicle for Cooper. While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.|$|E
5|$|Enrique {{steadily}} intensified and {{by early}} on July 16, the National Hurricane Center was anticipating {{for the system}} to reach hurricane intensity. Continuing to strengthen, it reached hurricane status On July 17. However, this was {{for a short period}} of time as it developed an eye. Due to uncertainty in the storm's intensity that day, it is possible that it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> hurricane earlier than originally estimated. Wind shear associated with a trough and passage over cooler waters caused Enrique to begin weakening and the cyclone center soon became exposed. Enrique was downgraded to a depression on July 19 and the weakening cyclone crossed into the central Pacific on July 20. Enrique dissipated shortly thereafter. Enrique's remnants managed to maintain a very weak center as it passed well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands and then passed near Midway Island. As the storm approached the International Dateline, the system started to redevelop. Shortly after crossing the dateline, Enrique became a tropical storm again on August 1. It lasted for less than 24 hours before it lost its convection and thus the cyclone began to dissipate. No damages or casualties were caused by Enrique.|$|E
2500|$|In any event, {{if any of}} the [...] "big three" [...] hierarchsIakovos (GOA), Theodosius (OCA) or Philip (AOA)had {{been elected}} as the American Orthodox primate, the reign would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> short one. [...] All three were old men (two have since retired). [...] None of these three men <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> [...] "empire builder," [...] but rather only a [...] "transitional figure" [...] (ibid., 182). [...] There was no attempt to make such a move, however.|$|R
2500|$|Mehrdad Bahar {{regards the}} {{etymology}} {{of the name}} to be [...] "Ruta-staxma", i.e. the river that descends, and argues that Rostam <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> ancient god of the river Helmand. The fact that Rostam's mother is called Rudabeh (i.e. The river of water) and his father <b>is</b> Zal who <b>has</b> white hair, Bahar continues the argument to say that Zal <b>is</b> <b>a</b> metaphor for mountains from which the river forms, whose head is always white with snow.|$|R
25|$|A further deity with nanism, {{but rarely}} {{depicted}}, was Ptah-Pahtaka ("Ptah, the strong"). He <b>was</b> worshipped as <b>a</b> special form of Ptah, {{the god of}} art, crafts and creativity. Another form of Ptah that was also depicted as <b>a</b> dwarf <b>was</b> Ptah-segem-panem ("Ptah, the listener"). The deity Thoth, god of time, knowledge, mathematics and the moon, was sometimes depicted as a baboon {{with the head of}} <b>a</b> human. This <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> allusion to dwarfs.|$|R
