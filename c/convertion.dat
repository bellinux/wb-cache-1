[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Son yıllarda kentler nüfusun artması, sosyal gelişimdeki yetersizlikler, doğal afetler, savaşlar, yer seçim hataları, eskime, köhneme gibi bir çok nedenden ötürü yenilenme, iyileştirme kısacası kentsel dönüşüme ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır. Ülkemizde özellikle doğal afetler sonrasında bunlara önlem alınabilmesi adına, bu dönüşümü teşvik edici yasal mevzuat oluşturularak dönüşüme altlık hazırlanmaya çalışılmaktadır. Ancak kentlerin sorunlu alanlarının yenilenmesinde, uygun arazi kullanımı ve entegre ulaşımın planlaması faktörlerinin dönüşümle beraber gelen bu yenilenme hareketine ne derece uygun ve paralel planlandığı değerlendirildiğinde bazı yetersizlikler ve problemler görülmektedir. Bu problemler de önlenmediği ve dikkate alınmadığı takdirde, gelecek yıllara sürdürülebilir kaliteli yaşanabilir kentler bırakmaktan yoksunluğu beraberinde getirmektedir. Ulaştırma ağının genişleyip ve ulaşım hizmetlerinin çoğalması ile kentsel gelişmenin çok hızlı bir şekilde arttığı açıktır. Ulaşım ve arazi kullanım birbirlerinden ayrılmaz ikililerdir ve birbirlerini hem tetiklemekte, hem tamamlamaktadırlar. Dolayısı ile başarılı bir kentsel dönüşüm ve yenilenme ile yapılan planlarda ulaşım ve arazi kullanım ilişkisi birlikte ele alınması gerekmektedir. Bununla birlikte bireylerin algı ve düşünceleri de büyük önem taşımaktadır.  Sahip oldukları yapıların yenilenmesi ve ikamet ettikleri bölgelerin geçireceği önemli değişime karşı, idari süreç,  ekonomik değerleme ve kentsel planlama açısından bilgi ve beklentilerinin de irdelenmesi gerekecektir. Bu tez kapsamında kentsel dönüşüm kavramı özellikle 6306 sayılı yasa kapsamında irdelenirken, yeniden yapılanma sürecinde olan bu bölgelerde arazi kullanım planlaması ve ulaşım faktörünün ne şekilde ele alınması gerektiği ve başarılı ve etkili bir kentsel dönüşüm için olması gereken birleşenler ele alınmıştır. Literatür araştırmasının ardından İstanbul’un Pendik ilçesi Taşlıbayır ve Batı Burnu riskli alanları özelinde ulaşım, arazi kullanımı, mekansal planlar ele alınarak, yapılan anket çalışmaları ile toplumsal algı ve halkın katılımı ortaya konulmuştur. Yapılan değerlendirme ile de dönüşümün bir fırsata çevrilerek halkında katılımının sağlanması ile bölgenin ihtiyaçlarına göre mevcut potansiyelleri fırsatlara çevrilerek sürdürülebilir bir ulaşım planlamasının nasıl sağlanacağı hakkında önerilerde bulunulmuştur. In recent years, the {{increase}} in metropolitan population, natural disasters, wars, lack of social improvements, locational misselections and aging resulted in the need to embrace urban transformation projects. As a consequence of recent natural disasters in Turkey, the Turkish Government support urban transformation projects {{in order to take}} precautionary actions and prepare infrastructure for future developments. Especially, in the process of transforming chaotic mass of city land, problems and insufficiencies have aroused from the mis-planning of proper land allocation according to integrated transportation vision and inhabitant’s ideal urban needs. If these problems and lack of planning are not prioritized and taken seriously into consideration, then our cities will suffer in sustaining quality of urban living. It is for sure that, urban development increased very quickly with {{the increase}} in transport network and transport services. Transportation and land use are inseparable from each other and they are provoking and completing each other. Therefore, transportation and land use must be considered together for the plans that were made after a successful urban transformation and renewal. However, citizen perception and thoughts are also having great importance. Citizien information and expectations should be taken in to considerence on administrative process, economic valuation and urban planning, for renowation of their properties and significant change where theyresides.   The purpose of this study is, to show how the land use and transportation planning should be in urban renewal areas, to expose the importance of social perception concept and through selected sample areas current structure and made surveys to measure social perception to propose A methodology for sustainable urban planning. Urban transformation and the urban renewal law is intended only to physical transformation and only includes destroying andrestructuring of buildings. However, the capacity problems resulting from the use of existing transport infrastructure, raises issues complicate to access to services,of accessibility with increase in the population. In this regard,identification of deficiencies in the legislation, with the requirements and regulations will be introduced and mixed land use development, land use and transportation policies, solving the parking problem and strength of transport infrastructure, with the encouragement of mobility should be provided public transport and sustainable transport (cycling, walking) accessibility should be increased and should be integrated into the urban transformation. For a sustainable transport planning; urban transformation projects which increased the density and strike of the transportation routes should be avoided, transportation decisions in the field of urban renewal should be introduced prior to the conversion application. The urban planning areas should be selected from regional areas, larger areas instead of segmented <b>convertions.</b> Therefore, integration of transport planning and urban renewal studies should be created accessible and sustainable urban space organizations. However, increasing the awareness of individuals, are also issues will be highlighted within the general planning principles to respond to the expectations. Within scope of this thesis, The concept of urban transformation evealuated specially 6306 under Law No and specifically two different sub locations declared risky areas in Pendik municipal, and identified, one type urban transformation for different needs in different socio-economic structure is not possible, the social perception should not be disgard, planning must be done in accordance {{to the needs of the}} people and needs of the city had been emphsysed. In this study first work on the theoretical framework had been evealuated and the relationship between transport, land-use planning and urban regeneration has been demonstrated theoretically. Therefore, in this section we have been applied toliterature. Content of Law No. 6306, its applications and possible outcomes were assessed by comparative literature and academic articles. Land use and transportation problems of present application were also studied within the scope of urban transformation. By visiting the web sites of universities and other institutions on the topics specified in screening resources made available in the library, and the relevant international and national resources to be accessed. Has also benefited from foreign and national resources and books. Again, depending on their thesis work outside of the various international and regional issues of national and international symposiums articles have also taken place between sources. Resources were classified according to the thesis content, depending on the subject studied. Sample plots in Pendik municipal, covering Orta District and Dumlupınar district, specially Taşlıbayır area and Batı Batı district physical analyzes performed and maps were producedon by using Netcad And Photoshop programs. Moreover, access of datas of current, ongoing and planned tranportation systems from Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, Pendik also had been provided. A survey was carried out in the sixth chapter forTaşlıbayır and Batı Burnu with A methodology of sampling 1 % of households living in the survey area. In addition to face to face, the method is also provided through the district self governing to do the survey. Interviews are conducted in a systematic survey study methodology and substitution is not used. Insan addition to all this datas, face to face interviews also held with citizens,the self governings, Pendik municipaliy, and the real estate agents and detailed information had tranformed. The main reason for the law is renewal of structures under disaster risk; this requires priority to be given the regions located at 1 st degree earthquake zone. Pendik municipality remains in the 1 st degree earthquake zone. Reasons for choosing the sample area of the Pendik mucipality are; remains at 1 st degree earthquake zone, one of the important sub-center of city, does have different modes in terms of transportation (including in city and intercity sea, rail, road and air way systems), increase of the population and the share of the economy in Istanbul as well as in the county 's growth, it’s potential for development, hosting many illegal and outdated structuring and availiblity of owners intension for transformation, local municipal efforts is to transform these localities and announced risky areas in accordance to law no. 6306 Disaster Risk Areas, the focus of the main transport networks international and nationally (trunk). This study draws attention to; urban transformation projects, renewal projects are not only for renewal of the city, with evaluation of planning, transport and social perception it should be converted transformation to a potential for sustainable form of cities, especially realized renowation-tranformation practices done in accordance to Law No. 6306. This study also ensures the absence of the law and regulations were identified and by literature review sustainable transportation planning criterias. In this respect, Municipal Pendik as an example; which is an important subcenter for Istanbul and also one of the most risky areas announced under scope of Law No. 6306; by creating data provides a concrete contribution to field applications. Emphasizing the importance of datas in the planning stage; problems of community socio-economic differences in conversion areaas in terms of transportation and access, their demand, community perception by making survey in two smaple areas. This study concludes with its analysis and proposals for; how sustainable cities can be created with efficient transport planning and public participation, this law should be seen as an opportunity to renew the urbans deliberately, emphasis on the importance of social perception, transport planning and spatial planning transforming urban areas in context of Law No. 6306.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate effect of feeding time pattern that supplemented by several ascorbic acid level on production performance and physiological organs of broiler. Variables observed were average daily gain (ADG), feed consumption, feed <b>convertion,</b> relative growth rate, income over feed cost (IOFC), production index, weight of tyroid gland, liver, kidney and feather percentage. Two hundreds unsex broiler CP 707 COBB strain were used. These Chickens housed per cage; dimensions were 1 x 1 x 0, 6 m. Metabolizable energy and crude protein content in diet were 3000 ccal/kg and 20 %. Water was suplied for ad libitum. Treatments were arranged as a Completely Randomized Designs in Factorial Designs. There are two factor; factor A; feeding time (W 09 and W 18) and factor B; ascorbic acid levels (L 0, L 50, L 100, L 150 mg/l water), with fifth replication. Result of this experiment indicated there are zero interaction between feeding time and ascorbic acid levels, and feed consumption, weight of tyroid, liver, kidney, and feather percentage were no influenced (P > 0. 05) by treatments. However, relative growth rate were affected (P < 0. 05) and highly affected (P < 0. 01) on average daily gain and feed <b>convertion.</b> 15 hours feeding time pattern with 100 mg/l ascorbic acid level gived the best response on income over feed cost (IOFC) and production indexs.
