The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components (resistors, capacitors etc.) can be created at a microscopic level.

25|$|Dynamic color {{convergence}} and purity {{are one of}} {{the main}} reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major <b>circuit</b> <b>components)</b> also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex raster geometry parameters through electronics under user control.|$|E

500|$|The {{topology}} of {{an electronic}} circuit is the form {{taken by the}} network of interconnections of the <b>circuit</b> <b>components.</b> [...] Different specific values or ratings of the components are regarded as being the same topology. [...] Topology is not concerned with the physical layout of components in a circuit, nor with their positions on a circuit diagram. [...] It is only concerned with what connections exist between the components. [...] There may be numerous physical layouts and circuit diagrams that all amount to the same topology.|$|E
500|$|An ideal {{transmission}} line {{will have no}} loss, which implies that the resistive elements are zero. [...] It also results in a purely real (resistive) characteristic impedance.

[...] Materials and components that obey Ohm's law are described as [...] "ohmic" [...] which means they produce the same value for resistance (R = V/I) regardless of the value of V or I which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is DC (direct current) of either positive or negative polarity or AC (alternating current).|$|E
2500|$|Cosmic rays have {{sufficient}} energy {{to alter the}} states of <b>circuit</b> <b>components</b> in electronic integrated circuits, causing transient errors to occur (such as corrupted data in electronic memory devices or incorrect performance of CPUs) {{often referred to as}} [...] "soft errors." [...] This has been a problem in electronics at extremely high-altitude, such as in satellites, but with transistors becoming smaller and smaller, this is becoming an increasing concern in ground-level electronics as well. Studies by IBM in the 1990s suggest that computers typically experience about one cosmic-ray-induced error per 256 megabytes of RAM per month. To alleviate this problem, the Intel Corporation has proposed a cosmic ray detector that could be integrated into future high-density microprocessors, allowing the processor to repeat the last command following a cosmic-ray event.|$|E
2500|$|Semi-resonant start {{circuits}} {{are mainly}} restricted {{to use in}} commercial installations because of the higher initial cost of <b>circuit</b> <b>components.</b> However, there are no starter switches to be replaced and cathode damage is reduced during starting making lamps last longer, reducing maintenance costs. Due to the high open circuit tube voltage, this starting method is particularly good for starting tubes in cold locations. Additionally, the circuit power factor is almost 1.0, and no additional power factor correction is needed in the lighting installation. As the design requires that twice the supply voltage must be lower than the cold-cathode striking voltage (or the tubes would erroneously instant-start), this design cannot be used with [...] AC power unless the tubes are at least [...] length. [...] Semi-resonant start fixtures are generally incompatible with energy saving T8 retrofit tubes, because such tubes have a higher starting voltage than T12 lamps and may not start reliably, especially in low temperatures. Recent proposals in some countries to phase out T12 tubes will reduce the application of this starting method.|$|E

Experimental results show that, the proposed algorithm performs much better than traditional GA. HME-GA is an efficient tool for analog circuit design.
