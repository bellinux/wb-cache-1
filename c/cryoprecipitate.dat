40|$|Sera and {{synovial}} fluids from thirty-seven {{patients with}} {{various types of}} arthropathy were studied {{for the presence of}} <b>cryoprecipitates.</b> The isolated, washed <b>cryoprecipitates</b> were analysed for immunoglobulins, antiglobulins, antinuclear antibody and DNA content. <b>Cryoprecipitates</b> were detected in the synovial fluids, but not in the matched serum specimens of twenty-six subjects, twenty-four of whom had rheumatoid arthritis. The precipitates consisted of either IgG—IgM complexes or IgG alone. Antiglobulin activity was present in the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from nineteen rheumatoid patients; of these nineteen, fifteen had antiglobulins present in serum and fourteen had antiglobulins in their whole synovial fluids. Antinuclear antibody was detected in the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from ten rheumatoid patients; only three patients had antinuclear antibodies in serum and/or whole synovial fluid. DNA was demonstrated in three <b>cryoprecipitates</b> and seven whole synovial fluids using an antiserum specific for calf thymus single strand DNA. When the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> were heat-denatured prior to testing, seventeen were shown to contain DNA antigens. The synovial fluids from one patient with Reiter's syndrome and one subject with psoriatic arthropathy also formed <b>cryoprecipitates,</b> but neither contained antiglobulin or antinuclear antibody activity. These observations suggest that the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> in rheumatoid synovial fluids contain several different antibodies and antigens, including antiglobulins, immunoglobulins, antinuclear antibody and DNA. It is postulated that these <b>cryoprecipitates</b> may represent cold insoluble antigen—antibody complexes...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{association}} of cryoglobulinemia with hypocomplementemia and tissue injury in systemic lupus erythematosus is well recognized, composition of <b>cryoprecipitates</b> in terms of circulating antigens and antibodies in this disease is less clear. To clarify this question, <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from patients with SLE were examined with sensitive assay techniques for certain antipolynucleotide antibodies and DNA antigen. DNA antibodies were highly enriched relative to serum levels {{in the majority of}} <b>cryoprecipitates.</b> DNA antigen was also demonstrable. Antibody to ribonucleoprotein, although less frequently present, was similarly enriched in certain <b>cryoprecipitates.</b> In contrast, anti-double strand RNA, which was commonly detectable in relatively high titer in serum, was only minimally concentrated in a minority of <b>cryoprecipitates.</b> Absorption experiments using red blood cells heavily coated with polynucleotide antigen indicated that a major proportion of the IgG in certain <b>cryoprecipitates</b> was specific antibody. The data strongly suggest that the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> in systemic lupus erythematosus represent circulating immune complexes that are soluble at 37 degrees C and come out of solution in the cold. The marked concentration of immune complexes in the cryoglobulin offers a simple and direct method for determination {{of the nature of the}} complexes. The accumulated evidence obtained in the present study indicates that these complexes closely reflect, in their composition, the circulating immune complexes which are most significant pathogenetically in renal tissue injury...|$|R
40|$|Sera {{were tested}} for {{cryoglobulin}} precipitates from 206 consecutive patients with renal disease, ninety-eight normals and sixteen patients with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) without evident renal disease. <b>Cryoprecipitates</b> were detected in 17 % of test subjects overall and 2 % of normals; the incidence was highest in patients with SLE, regardless of detectable renal disease. <b>Cryoprecipitates</b> usually were comprised of IgG and IgM or IgG, IgM, and IgA in thirty-six out of forty-two instances, although a single immunoglobulin class was detected in five patients. Co-precipitation experiments showed IgG-binding by virtually all sera forming cryoprecipitates; isolated <b>cryoprecipitates</b> bound radiolabelled homologous IgG, and Fc fragment and sometimes IgG subclass proteins preferentially. Freshly forming <b>cryoprecipitates</b> sometimes co-precipitated DNA, whereas all isolated <b>cryoprecipitates</b> co-precipitated DNA from dilute solutions. The data are compatible with the current hypothesis that cryoimmunoprecipitates are immune complexes that are insoluble in vitro in the cold, that they usually comprise mixed immunoglobulins with anti-IgG activity, and may contain a mixture of antigens and antibodies...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cryoprecipitate,</b> {{also called}} cryo for short, is a frozen blood product {{prepared}} from blood plasma. To create <b>cryoprecipitate,</b> {{fresh frozen plasma}} is centrifuged and the precipitate is collected. It is often transfused as a four- to six-unit pool instead of as a single product. One {{of the most important}} constituents is factor VIII (also called antihaemophilic factor or AHF), which is why <b>cryoprecipitate</b> is sometimes called, or refined into, cryoprecipitated antihaemophilic factor or cryoprecipitated AHF. In many clinical contexts, use of whole <b>cryoprecipitate</b> has been replaced with use of clotting factor concentrates made therefrom, but the whole form is still routinely stocked by many hospital blood banks.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to {{their role in the}} thrombotic manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), autoimmune antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies may also be responsible for direct injury to the blood vessel wall, although the mechanism is unclear. Cryoglobulinemia has been reported infrequently in patients with APS and is one potential means of blood vessel injury. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if autoimmune aPL antibodies and their target antigens contribute to the formation of <b>cryoprecipitates.</b> Cryoglobulins were identified and isolated from 5 of 8 patients with autoimmune aPL antibodies. Using identical concentrations of immunoglobulins isolated from matched sera and washed <b>cryoprecipitates</b> there was a significant enrichment (at least 100 %) of aCL antibodies in the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from 4 of 5 patients. This involved IgG, IgM and IgA isotypes with specificity for both b 2 -glycoprotein I (GPI) and prothrombin (PT). The target antigens were detected in <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from all 5 aPL positive patients and in <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from 3 controls. These results suggest that anti-b 2 -GPI and anti-PT antibodies in association with their target antigens are integrally involved in the formation of <b>cryoprecipitates</b> in patients with autoimmune aPL antibodies and provide insight into a potential mechanism for blood vessel injury...|$|R

It was distinct from IgM anti-IgG, which was also variably concentrated in the <b>cryoprecipitates.</b> The question whether the antilymphocyte antibodies appear in the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> as complexes because of interaction with surface membrane antigens, or simply because of cold reactive properties, remains to be determined.

Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated specific binding of IgG along endothelial surfaces, in glomeruli, and also in vessels. After reimplantation, complement fixation and tissue damage occurred in a similar pattern. There was some correlation between the severity of the histological damage and subsequent function of the kidneys.|$|R

50|$|Safe and {{effective}} alternative treatment often exists so that FFP {{is no longer}} the therapy of choice in many conditions. <b>Cryoprecipitate</b> should be used when fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor is needed.

The factor IX concentrate carries the additional hazard of thrombogenicity.Crystalloid, colloid solutions containing human serum albumin or plasma protein fraction, hydroxyethyl starch, and dextran are preferable to FFP for volume replacement. The practice of administering both packed red cells and FFP to the same patient should be discouraged, as this adds to the cost and doubles the infection rate.

40|$|Circulating immune {{complexes}} (CIC) {{have been}} investigated in 100 normal subjects; the RIA-Raji and the C 1 q-BA conventional methods, {{as well as a}} new solid phase microassay utilizing purified C 1 q and the systematic search of <b>cryoprecipitates</b> were employed. CIC serum levels did not differ in regards to sex; in relation to age, values for C 1 q-BA were identical in subjects from 0 to 60 years and also in those beyond age 60; the differences encountered by RIA-Raji or by the C 1 q-SP microassay in these two main groups were not statistically significant. <b>Cryoprecipitates</b> were present in 100 % of the 68 examined subjects.

40|$|A {{previous}} {{case report}} described {{the formation of}} a complex between a monoclonal IgA with cryolabile properties and C-reactive protein (CRP). Our study provides the first evidence for the frequent occurrence of CRP in cryoglobulins (Cg) of all three types according to Brouet's classification. We performed a systematic immunochemical analysis of cryoglobulins from 18 patients by Western blotting and in 15 of 18 <b>cryoprecipitates</b> a single band (23 KD), immunoreactive with anti-CRP antibody, was demonstrable irrespective of the clonal composition of the cryoglobulins. This band was detectable in 4 / 5 of type I, in 6 / 8 of type II, and in 5 / 5 of type III <b>cryoprecipitates,</b> classified according to Brouet et al. In addition, the complement proteins C 1 q and C 3 were present in nearly all CRP-containing cryoglobulins, presumably reflecting previous activation of the classical complement pathway at least. All three CRP-negative <b>cryoprecipitates</b> were derived from sera with low cryoglobulin content (1 – 2 g/l). Longitudinal investigation of 23 <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from seven patients confirmed that successful detection of CRP by Western blotting depends on the protein concentration of the cryoglobulins. Since complexed CRP was previously shown to be an effective activator of complement, via C 1 q binding, CRP may modulate pathophysiologic effects mediated by cryoglobulins in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{has been}} detected {{in a large}} proportion of patients with mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC). Circulating ‘free’ non-enveloped HCV core protein has been demonstrated in HCV-infected patients, and this suggests its possible involvement in the formation of cryoprecipitable immune complexes (ICs). Thirty-two anti-HCV, HCV RNA-positive patients with type II MC were evaluated. Non-enveloped HCV core protein, HCV RNA sequences, total IgM, rheumatoid factor (RF) activity, IgG and IgG subclasses, C 3 and C 4 fractions, C 1 q protein and C 1 q binding activity were assessed in both <b>cryoprecipitates</b> and supernatants. Non-enveloped HCV core protein was demonstrated in 30 of 32 (93 · 7 %) type II MC patients. After separation of cold-precipitable material, the protein was removed completely from supernatant in 12 patients (40 %), whereas it was enriched in the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> of the remaining 18. In addition, HCV RNA and IgM molecules with RF activity were concentrated selectively in the <b>cryoprecipitates.</b> Differential precipitation was found for both total IgG and IgG subclasses, as they were less represented in the cryoglobulins and no selective enrichment was noted. Immunological characterization of HCV core protein-containing <b>cryoprecipitating</b> ICs after chromatographic fractionation showed that the IgM monoclonal component had RF activity, whereas anti-HCV core reactivity was confined to the IgG fraction. C 1 q enrichment in addition to high avidity of ICs for C 1 q binding in the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> suggest that complement activation may occur through the C 1 q protein pathway.

40|$|Circulating immune {{complexes}} {{were identified}} in cryoproteins isolated from serial samples of serum from six patients with acute viral hepatitis with and without arthritic symptoms. <b>Cryoprecipitates</b> were analyzed {{for the presence of}} hepatitis-B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis-B surface antibody (anti-HBs) by hemagglutination inhibition and hemagglutination. Complement components were detected by counter electrophoresis, and immunoglobulins were detected by gel diffusion. HBsAg, IgG, and IgM {{were identified in}} <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from all hepatitis patients, but were higher in concentration in patients with arthritis. Only <b>cryoprecipitates</b> from hepatitis patients with arthritis contained IgA and complement components C 3, C 4, and C 5 as well as IgG and IgM, which disappear with resolution of the arthritis. The subtypes of IgG in these <b>cryoprecipitates</b> were predominantly the complement-fixing IgG 1 and IgG 3, HBsAg and anti-HBs were concentrated several-fold in the <b>cryoprecipitates</b> when compared to the serum concentration. Sequential studies in two patients demonstrated that the initial appearance of anti-HBs in the cryoprotein complex was associated with the detection in the complex of IgM suggesting a primary immune response to HBsAg. The C 3 activator fragment (C 3 A) of the properdin complex was found in fresh serum obtained from three hepatitis patients with arthritis and not in uncomplicated hepatitis. The cryoprecipitable immune complexes from patients with arthritis converted C 3 PA in fresh normal sera to C 3 A in vitro whereas cryoprotein isolated from patients with uncomplicated hepatitis had no such effect. Thus, the transient appearance of circulating complement-fixing immune complexes in patients with the arthritis of acute hepatitis is associated with activation of both classical and alternate complement pathways and suggests that they {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of these serum sickness-like extrahepatic symptoms...|$|R
