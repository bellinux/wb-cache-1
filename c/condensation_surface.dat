40|$|Mold in {{dwellings}} is a persisting complaint in moderate climates. Nine parameters {{define the}} likeli-hood for mold to develop: (1) climate, (2) inside temperature, (3) vapor release, (4) ventilation, (5) lay out, (6) envelope thermal performance, (7) moisture buffer capacity inside, (8) presence of preferential <b>condensation</b> <b>surfaces</b> and (9) type of finish. Exterior climate acts as boundary condition while inside temperature, vapor release and ventilation belong to living habits. The five others parameters are de-sign and construction related. Thirty five mold {{cases have been}} reanalyzed with as major objective to evaluate if the nine parameters explained the problem. The answer is yes. Especially lack of ventilation, large surfaces of exterior walling, low inside temperatures and poor envelope thermal performance rank high. A low inside tem-perature anyhow is typically {{the result of a}} rebound effect, the fact that the dwelling has such poor thermal performance that people accept lower comfort to keep heating payable. Ventilation in turn is to a large extent building-related. In most cases, no intentional ventilation system is provided. In insu-lated dwellings, thermal bridging is the main cause. If inside buffer capacity, preferential <b>condensation</b> <b>surfaces</b> and type of finish have an impact, could not be confirmed...|$|R

In addition, measures to prevent <b>surface</b> <b>condensation</b> are more important, because of the various and irregular latent loads in residential buildings.

50|$|The {{complete}} {{channel configuration}} {{consists of a}} condenser channel with inlet and outlet and an evaporator channel with inlet and outlet. These two channels are separated by the hydrophobic, micro porous membrane. For cooling, the condenser channel is flooded with fresh water and the evaporator e.g. with salty feed water. The coolant enters the condenser channel at a temperature of 20 °C. After passing through the membrane, the vapour condenses in the cooling water, releasing its latent heat and leading to a temperature increase in the coolant. Sensible heat conduction also heats the cooling water through {{the surface of the}} membrane. Due to the mass transport through the membrane the mass flow in the evaporator decreases whilst the condenser channel increases by the same amount. The mass flow of pre-heated coolant leaves the condenser channel at a temperature of about 72 °C and enters a heat exchanger, thus pre-heating the feed water. This feed water is then delivered to a further heat source and finally enters the evaporator channel of the MD module at a temperature of 80 °C. The evaporation process extracts latent heat from the feed flow, which cools down the feed increasingly in flow direction. Additional heat reduction occurs due to sensible heat passing through the membrane. The cooled feed water leaves the evaporator channel at approximately 28 °C. Total temperature differences between condenser inlet and evaporator outlet and condenser inlet and evaporator outlet are about equal. In a PGMD module, the permeate channel is separated from the condenser channel by a <b>condensation</b> <b>surface.</b> This enables the direct use of a salt water feed as coolant, since it does not come into contact with the permeate. Considering this, the cooling-or feed water entering the condenser channel at a temperature T1 can now also be used to cool the permeate. Condensation of vapour takes place inside the liquid permeate. Pre-heated feed water that was used to cool the condenser can be conducted directly to a heat source for final heating, after leaving the condenser at a temperature T2. After it has reached temperature T3 it is guided into the evaporator. Permeate is extracted at temperature T5 and the cooled brine is discharged at temperature T4.|$|E

The combination of surface energy heterogeneity, reduced oil-water interfacial energy, and surface structuring enabled drastically increased nucleation densities while maintaining easy condensate removal and low contact angles.

40|$|Considering all {{building}} components, windows {{typically have}} the lowest surface temperature, and will consequently be the primary location for interior <b>surface</b> <b>condensation.</b> Those <b>surface</b> temperatures can easily be calculated using thermal finite-element-models (FEM), {{and there is an}} ISO standard with guidelines for condensation risk assessment. However, both the FEM-simulations as the ISO standard generally omit the effect of air flows in and around window frames. When cold air is drawn into the construction, the airflow might cool down specific components of the window-wall interface depending on the location of the airflow path. Consequently, the current evaluation method for condensation risk assessment based on FEM-simulations might underestimate the actual risk.
