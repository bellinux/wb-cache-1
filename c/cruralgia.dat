This case report describes the managing of a patient with right <b>cruralgia</b> without strength lost. The CT- scan had failed to highlight a lesion corresponding to the symptoms of the patient. A MRI was therefore realized, {{and was able to}} show a lumbar intradural tumor. The MRI signal of neurinoma is usually typical. However, in this case, the histo-pathological analysis has been necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The patient underwent laminectomy and tumor resection with nearly complete resolution of symptoms, excepting a right perineal hemihypoesthesia, probably corresponding to the location of the concerned nervous root. The MRI is the best method to explore <b>cruralgia</b> or a sciatica not responding to treatment, and without precipitating factor such as disc herniation explaining the symptoms. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSTUDY DESIGN: Prospective {{study of}} self-assessed symptom severity. OBJECTIVES: To {{carry out a}} {{comparative}} semiological analysis of pain in scoliotic and nonscoliotic adults with low back pain, and to study the factors that correlate with the severity of pain in scoliotic patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Low back pain is a frequent complaint in subjects with adult lumbar scoliosis. Few studies have taken {{an interest in the}} semiological specificities of lumbar pain in such patients. METHODS: Fifty adults with lumbar scoliosis and suffering from chronic low back pain and 50 nonscoliotic adults with chronic low back pain, matched for age and gender underwent a standard examination. The characteristics of the pain described in the 2 groups were compared. Relationships between the features of the scoliosis and the intensity of the pain were sought. RESULTS: There was no difference between the 2 groups with regard to pain severity (duration and intensity). The pain evolved more steadily in scoliotic patients. Inguinal pain (P < 0. 001) and <b>cruralgia</b> (P < 0. 05) were particularly associated with scoliosis. In scoliotics, the severity of the low back pain correlated well with the radiologic aspects: Cobb angle (P < 0. 05), vertebral rotation (P < 0. 05) and rotatory olisthesis (P < 0. 05). <b>Cruralgia</b> was significantly associated with the presence of rotatory dislocation (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: The pain felt by scoliotic adults has several semiological features, in particular the frequency of inguinal pain and <b>cruralgia.</b> Lumbar scoliosis with a great curvature and/or rotatory olisthesis increases the intensity of low back pain in adults. These findings suggest that the magnitude of the curvature and the existence of rotatory olisthesis must be targeted for prevention and treatment of the chronic low back pain in subjects with a lumbar scoliosis...|$|E
40|$|Osteoid osteoma is {{a common}} benign lesion, that occurs in {{children}} and young adults. The authors report the observation of a multifocal lesion which is infrequently reported in the literature. S. A., a 10 -year-old female came to our observation complaining of spontaneous pain in her right hip and <b>cruralgia</b> radiating to the homolateral knee over the last 6 months; the symptoms, which increased during the night, were relieved by treatment with NSAIDS. Clinical examination and imaging studies confirmed a diagnosis of osteoid osteoma with a double nidus; the lesion was treated by CT-guided thermo-ablation with radiofrequency under general anaesthesia. Complete regression of symptoms was observed at 2 -year follow-up...|$|E

Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is a rare and serious disorder mainly affecting elderly patients. It {{is caused by the}} production of autoantibodies directed against coagulation factors; patients present with spontaneous bleeding, potentially fatal, in the absence of familial or personal history. Autoimmune disorders, infections, solid and hematologic tumors, and drugs are predisposing factors, but up to 50 percent of cases remain unexplained. The diagnosis of AHA is confirmed by specific laboratory tests; and the therapy is a clinical challenge, {{due to the fact that}} older patients are often affected by comorbidities. By passing agents may be used when persistent bleeding or haemodynamic instability is observed; corticosteroids, alone or with immunosuppressive therapy, are necessary to inhibit the production of the autoantibodies. We describe a case in which steroids in monotherapy successfully, safely, and persistently inhibited the production of anti-Factor VIII antibodies, in an old patient admitted after rheumatologic consult. 1. Case Report We report a 75 -year-old woman who was admitted to our internal medicine division with multiple spontaneous ecchymoses at lower limbs and right <b>cruralgia</b> associate...|$|E
