The event was organized by the First Somali Bank to showcase improvements in business, development and security to potential Somali and international investors. A second consecutive TEDx entrepreneurial conference was held the following year in the capital, highlighting new enterprises and <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities,</b> including {{the establishment of the}} city's first dry cleaning business in several years.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} Mary's reign were {{consistently}} wet. The persistent rain and subsequent flooding led to famine. Another {{problem was the}} decline of the Antwerp cloth trade. Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from Spain's enormously lucrative trade with the New World. The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not condone illicit trade or piracy against her husband. In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued Northumberland's policy of seeking out new <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities.</b> She granted a royal charter to the Muscovy Company, whose first governor was Sebastian Cabot, and commissioned a world atlas from Diogo Homem. Adventurers such as John Lok and William Towerson sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the overall}} Vietnamese {{military}} performance {{was not as}} successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary Phan Thanh Giản and another official, Lam Duy Hiep, signed the Treaty of Saigon. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of Gia Định, Định Tường and Biên Hòa to France; they became the colony of Cochinchina. The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> for European merchants. Militarily, {{the withdrawal of the}} Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces found it easier to recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or too embarrassed to serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty. Định then allied himself with Võ Duy Dương to form the Movement of Popular Self Defense (Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve), creating an operations base in Đồng Tháp.|$|E

5|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} {{was invented by}} physicists Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. The pair worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories specializing {{in the development of}} cathode ray tubes that used electronic signal outputs to project a signal onto television screens. Goldsmith, who had received a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 1936 with a focus on oscilloscope design, was {{at the time of the}} device's invention the director of research for DuMont Laboratories in New Jersey. The two inventors were inspired by the radar displays used in World War II, which Goldsmith had worked on during the war. The patent for the device was filed on January 25, 1947 and issued on December 14, 1948. The patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used by either the inventors or DuMont Laboratories, and the device was never manufactured beyond original handmade prototype. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers historian Alex Magoun has speculated that Goldsmith did not make the prototype with the intent for it to be the basis of any future production, but only designed the device as a demonstration of the kind of <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> DuMont could pursue. Goldsmith did not work on games after the invention of the device; he was promoted to vice president in 1953 and left DuMont—by then split up and sold to other firms—to become a professor of physics at Furman University in 1966. Goldsmith kept the device and brought it with him to Furman; in a 2016 interview fellow physics professor Bill Brantley recalled Goldsmith demonstrating the game to him.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{indigenous}} people {{were the only}} inhabitants of Boa Vista. Boa Vista had the highest growth rate of any Brazilian capital in the 1970s, at 3% per year. What attracts immigrants most to this city are employment opportunities that generated by public service jobs for Brazilians.

25|$|In late 1979, a consortium, {{members of}} which {{included}} recording entrepreneur Bill Armstrong, band manager Glenn Wheatley and stockbroker Bill Conn, successfully bid {{on one of}} two Melbourne FM licenses and set about creating a commercial FM radio station.

25|$|In 1933, {{the port}} was modernized, and the Stockton Deepwater Channel, which {{improved}} water passage to San Francisco Bay, was deepened and completed. This created <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> that fueled the city's growth. Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot was established, placing Stockton in a strategic position during the Cold War. During the Great Depression, the town's canning industry became the battleground of a labor dispute {{resulting in the}} Spinach Riot of 1937.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, Bert Greeves adapted a {{motorbike}} {{with the}} help of his paralysed cousin Derry Preston-Cobb as transport for Derry.

50|$|A Voyage of Consolation (1897) was {{a sequel}} to internationally themed An American Girl in London. The autobiographical On the Other Side of the Latch (1901) was set in Duncan's garden in Simla, {{where she had been}} forced to spend seven months while {{recovering}} from her tuberculosis infection. Warkentin sees this work as an example of her eye for a <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunity.</b>|$|R
25|$|In spring 2011, Simborg Development revitalized {{plans for}} a $60 million {{renovation}} of the 72-acre Lake Business Center site fronting Calumet Avenue that will open new <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> for the Town of Munster. This development, originally to be named Munster Town Center that would have created a mixed-use center of retail shops and restaurants, commercial offices, medical facilities {{as well as an}} extended-stay hotel, was modified to maintain the warehouse facility and maintain a high-tech image exterior for the development.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan will}} result in the {{complete}} reconstruction of most of the town centre, and will also focus on the redevelopment of the Victorian era train station, which is seen by many as in need of updating. The implementation, which will take place over about half a century, also includes the construction of two hotels, the widening of a major artery road through the centre of the town, {{and the creation of a}} communal space as well as many new <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities.</b>|$|E

25|$|Under the French regime, {{a variety}} of {{activities}} were given encouragement. The Church sent missionaries, who were directed from the new cathedral in Tunisia, south across the Sahara to what became Francophone Black Africa where many mission communities were established. Yet the Eucharistic Congress of 1930 in Tunis drew the public reproach of Muslims. Protectorate projects enlisted civil engineers and city planners who developed designs from which were built many public improvements. These served community needs for water, communication, health, sanitation, travel and transportation. Civic comfort was enhanced. Business and <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> were multiplied.|$|E
25|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> in {{the capital}} of the Dutch colony {{attracted}} Indonesian and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740 and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number which changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded, fabrics, especially imported cotton, batik and clothing worn by Arab communities.|$|E
50|$|The {{literature}} has provided very diverse interpretations and definitions {{of a business}} model.

25|$|The {{majority}} of the Syrian community of Brazil come from Beirut, Lebanon, where they had lived since their expulsion from Syria following {{the creation of the}} State of Israel in 1948 and the subsequent violent anti-Jewish pogroms perpetrated by their Muslim neighbours. They left Beirut in wake of the first Lebanese Civil War. Most Syrian Jews established themselves in the industrial city of São Paulo, being attracted there by the many <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> it offered. The community became very prosperous, and several of its members are among the wealthiest and the politically and economically most influential families in São Paulo. The community first attended Egyptian synagogues, but later founded their own synagogues, most notably the Beit Yaakov synagogues in the neighbourhoods of Jardins and Higienopolis. The community has its own school and youth movement, and claims a strong Jewish identity and low assimilation rate. The {{majority of}} the community affiliates itself institutionally with Orthodox Judaism, though few could be described as personally fully Orthodox. There are approximately 7,000 Syrian Jews in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The present Eritrean Jewish {{community}} {{is believed to}} be started by Yemenite Jews from Yemen attracted by new <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> driven by Italian colonial expansion in the late 19th Century. The Jewish population then later increased from European refugees coming to Eritrea to escape the anti-Semitic regimes in Europe at the time. Many returned to Israel in 1948. During British administration, Eritrea was often used as a location of exile for Irgun and Lehi guerrillas. Among those imprisoned was future Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir and Haim Corfu, a founder of Beitar Jerusalem. In 1961 the Eritrean War of Independence began after Eritrea was annexed by Ethiopia. It was then that Jews began to leave Eritrea. In the early 1970s, Jewish emigration increased because of ensuing violence between Eritrea and Ethiopia (up to and beyond Eritrea's official declaration of independence in 1993). Judaism {{is not one of the}} four religions recognized by the Eritrean government and indeed, as of 2006 there was only one last native Jew left in Eritrea - Sami Cohen, who attends to the Asmara Synagogue and cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Lord Hasting was not {{averse to}} {{exploiting}} any <b>commercial</b> <b>opportunities</b> {{that access to}} the Himalayan region might offer. He knew that these would gratify his employers and silence his critics, because the East India Company was {{at this time in}} the throes of a cash-flow crisis. It needed substantial funds in Britain, in order to pay overheads, pensions, and dividends; but there were problems about remitting the necessary assets from India. Traditionally the Company had bought Indian produce and sold it in London; but this no longer made economic sense. The staple Indian export was cotton goods, and demand for these was declining as home-produced textiles captured the British market. So the Company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way. It was having to ship its Indian textiles to Canton; sell them on the Chinese market; buy tea with the proceeds; then ship the tea for sale in Britain (all tea at this time came from China. It was not grown in India until the 1840s).|$|E
