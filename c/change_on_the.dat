5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small <b>change</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Washington Post {{linked with}} {{approval}} to Romm's {{review of the}} scientific literature on climate change. Time magazine explored Romm's critique of Matthew Nisbet and praised {{his analysis of the}} decline of media coverage regarding climate change. National Geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public. The same year, Technology Review quoted Romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies, and the Toronto Star quoted him regarding President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address. In 2012 in The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and The Atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the Democrats to discuss climate change. National Geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate <b>change</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> polar bear, and Current TV's Bill Press interviewed Romm about record-breaking heat.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{enjoys a}} large range and a big {{population}}. Its population trend is currently increasing. This species was ranked as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2012. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the black-throated blue warbler in its tropical wintering areas. A report in 2000 discussed the impact of global climate <b>change</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> population dynamics of the black-throated blue warbler by an observation from 1986 to 1998. In particular, the effect of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied {{in relation to the}} survival, fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird. It was found that El Niño years (the warm South Pacific oceanic phase) were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground, Jamaica, lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in New Hampshire of the United States, and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds. All the three factors were relatively higher during La Niña years (cold South Pacific Ocean) when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant. Long-term global warming can aggravate the ENSO effect, adding to the fluctuation of the black-throated blue warbler population.|$|E

5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick <b>change</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with no music, lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E

The biggest consequence of climate <b>change</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dispersal of pathogens is that the geographical distribution of hosts and pathogens could shift, which would result in more crop losses. This could affect competition and recovery from disturbances of plants. It has been predicted that the effect of climate change will add a level of complexity to figuring out how to maintain sustainable agriculture.|$|E

25|$|In {{cases where}} the {{diameter}} of a trapped particle is significantly greater than the wavelength of light, the trapping phenomenon can be explained using ray optics. As shown in the figure, individual rays of light emitted from the laser will be refracted as it enters and exits the dielectric bead. As a result, the ray will exit in a direction different from which it originated. Since light has a momentum associated with it, this change in direction indicates that its momentum has changed. Due to Newton's third law, {{there should be an}} equal and opposite momentum <b>change</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> particle.|$|E
