50|$|The PPV&FR Act, 2001 {{was enacted}} to grant {{intellectual}} property rights to plant breeders, researchers and farmers who have developed any new or extant plant varieties. The Intellectual Property Right granted under PPV&FR Act, 2001 is a dual right - one is for the variety {{and the other is}} for the denomination assigned to it by the breeder. The rights granted under this Act are heritable and assignable and only registration of a plant variety confers the right. Essentially Derived Varieties (EDV) can also be registered under this Act and it may be new or extant. Farmers are entitled to save, use, sow, re-sow, exchange or sell their farm produce including seed of a registered variety in an unbranded manner. Farmers' varieties are eligible for registration and farmers are totally exempted from payment of any fee in any proceedings under this Act. The period of protection for field crops is 15 years and for trees and vines is 18 years and for notified varieties it is 15 years from the date of notification under section 5 of Seeds Act, 1966. Annual fee has to be paid every year for maintaining the registration and renewal fee has to be paid for the extended period of registration. Farmers can claim for compensation if the registered variety fails to provide expected performance under given conditions. The rights granted under this Act are exclusive right to produce, sell, market, distribute, import and export the variety. Civil and criminal remedies are provided for enforcement of breeders' rights and provisions relating to benefit sharing and <b>compulsory</b> <b>licence</b> in case registered variety is not made available to the public at reasonable price are provided. Compensation is also provided for village or rural communities if any registered variety has been developed using any variety in whose evolution such village or local community has contributed significantly.

40|$|For {{many years}} {{pharmaceutical}} patents {{and their impact}} on prices have been at the centre of the international debate over insufficient access to lifesaving HIV/AIDS medicines in developing countries. The conflict has largely revolved around the implementation of an intellectual property system in the developing world, subsequent the adaptation of the TRIPS Agreement, which has made a 20 year pharmaceutical patent protection mandatory for these countries and consequently contributed to high drug prices for patented medicines as well as limited the use of generic drugs. Developing countries, where patents are already in place, have sought to reduce high drug prices by making use of compulsory licensing, a safeguarding practice allowing the production or importation of a generic medicine without the consent of the patent holder. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>licences</b> are allowed under the TRIPS Agreement, but disagreements about the conditions, under which <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences</b> are available for ‘essential medicines’, have restricted their use. A definition {{of the extent to which}} compulsory licensees can export generic drugs to developing countries unable to manufacture their own has been missing, but on 30 August 2003 the WTO announced that it had resolved this problem by lifting the TRIPS Agreement’s restrictions on exports and permitting exports of drugs produced under a compulsory license as an exception to a patent right. The main question is whether the compulsory licensing system as prescribed in the recent Decision is an ample means of improving access to patented AIDS medicines in the developing world. By means of legal and economic reasoning this master thesis argues that the 30 August Decision on lifting TRIPS’ restrictions on exports of patented pharmaceuticals produced under <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences</b> provides complex and uncertain rules, rendering an unreliable employment of compulsory licensing. It is desirable that further recommendations are given on which generic producing companies should be awarded <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences</b> and also on which premises. In reality, the debate about compulsory licensing is part of a much wider structural problem in development policy. The solution to the inaccessibility problem requires a mix of courses of action with a functioning compulsory licensing system included. However, disagreements such as how necessary funding should be divided equitably between developed countries could protract the reaching of a pragmatic solution...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{background information}} for an inquiry on the compulsory licensing {{provisions of the}} Patents Act 1990 (Cwlth). Key points: Like most countries, Australia has legislated a system of compulsory licensing so that patent owners can be compelled to license their inventions to others in a limited range of circumstances. 	Survey data and participants’ comments confirm {{that this is a}} safeguard which only needs to be invoked in exceptional cases. In response to surveys, patent owners indicate that often they would prefer to license more than they do. 	There have been few applications for a <b>compulsory</b> <b>licence</b> in Australia, and none have been successful. While this is consistent with its status as a rarely needed safeguard, another factor may be the costly and time-consuming process involved in obtaining a <b>compulsory</b> <b>licence</b> order from the Federal Court. 	There are no clear alternatives to the Federal Court that would make <b>compulsory</b> <b>licence</b> applications significantly less costly and time consuming, without also raising concerns about the quality of outcomes and scope for appeals. 	There is, however, a clear case to reform the criteria for a <b>compulsory</b> <b>licence.</b> 	There are currently provisions in both the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cwlth) and Patents Act 1990 (Cwlth) to address anticompetitive behaviour. To remove overlap and inconsistency, when a patent is used to engage in unlawful anticompetitive conduct, a <b>compulsory</b> <b>licence</b> should only be available under the Competition and Consumer Act. 	A public interest test should replace existing criteria based on the ‘reasonable requirements of the public’ in the Patents Act. This would provide an access regime when greater use of a patented invention would deliver a substantial net benefit to the community. 	To reduce uncertainty about international treaty obligations on compulsory licensing, the existing general requirement in the Patents Act to satisfy such obligations should be deleted, and the obligations should be incorporated directly into the Patents Act or its subordinate legislation. 	To improve awareness of compulsory licensing, IP Australia and the ACCC should jointly develop a plain English guide and make it available on their websites. 	The Patents Act contains a less costly and time-consuming alternative to compulsory licensing — termed ‘Crown use’ — that can be invoked when an invention is used for the services of a government. Two key reforms are proposed in this regard. 	 		  		 			To reduce uncertainty about the scope of Crown use, the Patents Act should be amended {{to make it clear that}} Crown use can be invoked for the provision of a service that the Australian, State and/or Territory Governments have primary responsibility for providing or funding. 			To improve transparency and accountability, governments should be required to first seek a negotiated outcome, and publicly state the reasons for invoking Crown use in advance, except in emergencies. Governments should in all cases be required to obtain Ministerial approval to invoke Crown use, and be subject to the same pricing principles as for compulsory licensing...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is limited to {{defining}} the differences of the functions and of the operation of <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences,</b> which typically are available under patent law, on one hand, or, on the other, are imposed {{as a matter of}} enforcing the antitrust laws. The thesis of this contribution is that each of patent law’s compulsory licensing rules does (and ought to) follow its own distinct rationale. Their common denominator is that they are specific to the systematic operation of patent protection as an incentive mechanism for innovation. By contrast, competition law constitutes part of the framework regulation of the market. Where its application results in imposing licensing obligations on patentees, it does so in order to correct an unjustified restriction of competition. This remedial function of antitrust-related licensing obligations is complementary to but different from patent law’s rules on compulsory licensing. The different functions of system-supportive or system-intrinsic mandatory licensing rules and competition-related obligations also mean that before introducing new or broadening existing provisions on <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences</b> a proper diagnosis has to be made of the ill that they are supposed to cure...|$|R

Technology can facilitate almost total access to digitally stored information, but paradoxically the law has been developing a potential to give right owners the capacity to control that access. This is an aspect of both the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Copyright in the Information Society Directive. Leaving any 'right' of access to the laws of competition may be an inadequate response to the protection/access conundrum at the heart of copyright law. Three other mechanisms might be employed: <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences,</b> a 'copy-duty', or expanded exceptions to copyright and database right. The current review of the Database Directive by the Commission seems unlikely to reconsider the application of <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences</b> to the right.

This paper suggests a WIPO Information Treaty and Tribunal (incorporating the results of WIPO commissioned studies) to address these issues.

This is an Open Access article {{distributed}} {{under the}} terms of the Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial NonDerivatives Unported License 3. 0 (CC BY-NC-ND 3. 0) [URL] paper attempts a critical examination of the doctrine of legitimate expectations in relation to non-violation complaints with a view to underlining its doctrinal significance for developing countries to justify the use of TRIPS flexibilities, such as <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences,</b> for public health considerations.

This argument rests on the presumption that TRIPS allows for the substantive protection of legitimate expectations based on the balance of rights and obligations, and presently the agreement overly protects patents on essential medicines.

It focus on how such remedy have been provided by the European Commission {{as a solution to}} bring to an end the abusive use of copyright by copyright holders enjoying a dominant position. It further explores if such European development represents an option for developing countries and if Mexico is prepared to benefit from such development. The First Chapter presents four legal and social developments that suggests why <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences,</b> as a remedy provided by competition law traditionally agaisnt patent holders abuse of rights, are increasingly targeting today copyright holders, particularly those within the knowledge industries. The Second Chapter provides an outline of the main compulsory licenses schemes, both within and outside the IP universe. Such outline aims to offer the reader an overview of the rationale and efficacy of the remedy and the public objectives pursued by its provision. The Third Chapter explores the legal grounds and the rationale that supports the <b>compulsory</b> <b>licences</b> ordered by the European Commission in the Magill, IMS Health and Microsoft cases, where such application created an obligation to license a copyrighted work. It further assess if such a remedy represents an option for developing countries. The last chapter discusses Mexico’s readiness to benefit from such legal doctrine developed by the European Comission and the European Court of Justice. Options are submitted to appear in two directions. The first explores the possibilities and hurdles that Mexico might face if choosing to build a compulsory license regime under the TRIPS agreement. The second path explores the possibilities of using such licenses without a substantial copyright reform, merely by applying Mexican competition law rules. The Thesis concludes, inter alia, that the European doctrine is not a product suitable for export.

40|$|Although {{intellectual}} property rights do not automatically confer a dominant market position, they may put the right holder {{in the position to}} behave more or less independently of his or her competitors, customers, and ultimately consumers. The extent of the relative immunity from competition depends on a number of factors, from the specific characteristics of the protected subject matter through to the structure of the relevant market. In extreme cases, an {{intellectual property}} right will constitute an “essential facility” and therefore enable the right holder to control access to, and thus competition in, the market. In such cases, a refusal to license may lead to an abuse of market dominance within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the abuse may consist in a discrimination of trading partners, an unjustified foreclosure of competitors, a negligence of market needs, or an expansion of market power to another related market.

Information and knowledge can be communicated in an instant across the globe, cheaply and with good quality, by {{even the most basic}} Internet user. In short, recent developments in digital technology have opened up a vast new landscape for knowledge management. However copyright law which takes definition from international conventions and is similar in most countries provides that you cannot reproduce or communicate copyright material (literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, films and sound recordings) without the permission of the copyright owner subject to exceptions for fair use/dealing, private use and educational use. Private use and educational use exceptions are usually subject to the payment of a statutory levy, royalty or licence fee. Therefore while the technology has the capacity, the legal restrictions on the reuse of copyright material, hampers its negotiability in the digital environment.
