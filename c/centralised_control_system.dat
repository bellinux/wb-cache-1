40|$|As {{demand for}} {{renewable}} energy sources increases so does the pressure exerted on the transmission grid. Variable sources strain the existing power lines and the control system needs to incorporate faster response times when redirecting power flow. Using HVDC grid technology multiple AC networks can be concatenated across longer distances. This creates op- portunity for solar- or wind power plants to be constructed further away from consumers. However this technology calls for a SCADA system being developed {{to bridge the gap}} between fast changing voltages throughout an HVDC grid and less frequent control rate of the underlying AC networks. This paper suggest an architecture where a <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> receives data from substation measurement units localised throughout the grid. A database and a GUI, created in Microsoft SQL Server and Zenon respectively, are developed in order to store, process and display the communicated information, such as voltages, currents and power flows. The control center would work on an update frequency of about one second up to a minute, thus being able to implement directions given by the AC grid control systems on the faster changing HVDC grid. The proposed architecture is applied to a real time simulation of an HVDC grid connected to multiple wind parks and AC networks where events were displayed as expected. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of transfer pricing strategy and performance in terms of how this provides for a strategic business advantage. A further aim was to assess the extent that transfer pricing is primarily tax-driven or business strategy-driven. The reason for choosing this research problem was based on the gap that exists in the theory and literature on the link between transfer pricing being utilised strategically for a multinational. This study was best served as a single quantitative exploratory case study to gain an understanding of how the implementation of transfer pricing can provide for a strategic business advantage. The non-probability sampling technique of judgment (purposive) sampling was used for this study in which primary data was collected. Relevant statistical analyses was performed in order to answer the research questions and involved descriptive statistics as well as correlation analysis. Based on the findings it was confirmed that transfer pricing is considered to be part of the business strategy in the Process Automation division at ABB.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for higher power, higher voltage {{electrical}} conversion systems increases, it becomes less and less feasible to use two-level power electronic converter topologies in these applications because of rating limits with semi-conductor devices and demands on their harmonic performance. Multilevel converters are an elegant solution to these constraints; they allow the series connection of semi-conductor devices, thereby increasing the overall voltage rating of the converter, {{and at the same}} time they can limit the voltage stress across individual devices while simultaneously achieving substantially improved harmonic performance. One approach to the design of these converters is the concept of modularisation, which packages hardware and software into reusable building blocks. This approach allows more flexible and extendable designs. However, while hardware modularisation of multilevel converters has been quite successful, the control system for these converters typically remains highly centralised and reliant on a high bandwidth communication network. This thesis proposes a strategy to decentralise the open loop control and closed loop current regulation of a modular multilevel converter. The main concept is to give the responsibility for determining the converter’s switched outputs to local controllers in each converter module, using local sensors, a separate current regulator and a local modulator. These local controllers then coordinate to achieve the overall control objective of the multilevel converter. This thesis focuses on two key aspects of this approach. The first is an in-principle theoretical development, which begins by evaluating existing open and closed loop control strategies to select the most appropriate strategies and then adapting and extending them to suit the decentralised application. The intra-converter communication system is then enhanced to determine the minimum communication requirements for this system. The second aspect of this work is the practical implementation of this control system. This required a detailed analysis of the non-ideal circuit conditions which can adversely affect the performance of the system, and the development of techniques to manage them. The control strategies developed in this thesis have been tested extensively in both simulation and in practice using an experimental 12 -kVA three-phase 5 -level modular cascaded converter. The resultant performance of the system matched the best state of the art <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> in terms of transient and steady state output, while also achieving the same levels of harmonic distortion in the switched output voltage waveforms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Airport Baggage Handling is a {{field of}} {{automation}} systems that is currently dependent on <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> and conventional automation programming techniques. In this and other areas of manufacturing and materials handling, these legacy automation technologies are increasingly limiting for the growing demand for systems that are reconfigurable, fault tolerant and easy to maintain. IEC 61499 Function Blocks is an emerging architectural framework {{for the design of}} distributed industrial automation systems and their reusable components. A number of architectures have been suggested for multi-agent and holonic <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> that incorporate function blocks. This paper presents a multi-agent control approach for a baggage handling system using IEC 61499 Function Blocks. In particular, it focuses on demonstrating a decentralised <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that is scalable, reconfigurable and fault tolerant. The design follows the Automation Object approach, and produces a function block component representing a single section of conveyor. In accordance with holonic principles this component is autonomous and collaborative, such that the structure and the behaviour of a baggage handling system can be entirely defined by the interconnection of these components within the function block design environment. Simulation is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the agent-based <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and a utility is presented for real-time viewing of these systems.

40|$|A {{distributed}} system {{is defined as}} a collection of autonomous computers connected by a network, and with the appropriate distributed software for the system to be seen by users as a single entity capable of providing computing facilities. Distributed systems with centralised control have a distinguished control node, called leader node. The main role of a leader node is to distribute and manage shared resources in a resource-efficient manner. A {{distributed system}} with centralised control can use stream processing networks for communication. In a stream processing system, applications typically act as continuous queries, ingesting data continuously, analyzing and correlating the data, and generating a stream of results. Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to process the information, even if it happens any failure or anomaly in the system. Fault tolerance has become an important requirement for distributed systems, due to the possibility of failure has currently risen to the increase in number of nodes and the runtime of applications in distributed system. Therefore, to resolve this problem, it is important to add fault tolerance mechanisms order to provide the internal capacity to preserve the execution of the tasks despite the occurrence of faults. If the leader on a <b>centralised</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> fails, it is necessary to elect a new leader. While leader election has received a lot of attention in message-passing systems, very few solutions have been proposed for shared memory systems, as we propose. In addition, rollback-recovery strategies are important fault tolerance mechanisms for distributed systems, since that it is based on storing information into a stable storage in failure-free state and when a failure affects a node, the system uses the information stored to recover the state of the node before the failure appears. In this thesis, we are focused on creating two fault tolerance mechanisms for distributed systems with centralised control that uses stream processing for communication. These two mechanism created are leader election and log-based rollback-recovery, implemented using LPEL. The leader election method proposed is based on an atomic Compare-And-Swap (CAS) instruction, which is directly available on many processors. Our leader election method works with idle nodes, meaning that only the non-busy nodes compete to become the new leader while the busy nodes can continue with their tasks and later update their leader reference. Furthermore, this leader election method has short completion time and low space complexity. The log-based rollback-recovery method proposed for distributed systems with stream processing networks is a novel approach that is free from domino effect and does not generate orphan messages accomplishing the always-no-orphans consistency condition. Additionally, this approach has lower overhead impact into the system compared to other approaches, and it is a mechanism that provides scalability, because it is insensitive to the number of nodes in the system...|$|E

This thesis addresses {{the problem of}} how to design robust decentralised <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> such as those used to control event-driven, real-time processes in time-critical environments. Emphasis is placed on studying the dynamical behaviour of a system and identifying ways of partitioning the system so that it may be controlled in a distributed manner. A structural partitioning technique is adopted which makes use of natural physical sub-processes in the system, which are then mapped into the software processes to <b>control</b> the <b>system.</b> However, communications are required between the processes because of the disjoint nature of the distributed (i. e. partitioned) state of the physical system. The structural partitioning technique, and recent developments in the theory of potential controllability and observability of a system, are the basis for the design of controllers. In particular, the method is used to derive a decentralised estimate of the state vector for a continuous-time system. The work is also extended to derive a distributed estimate for a discrete-time system. Emphasis is also given to the role of communications in the distributed control of processes and to the partitioning technique necessary to design distributed and decentralised systems with resilient structures. A method is presented for the systematic identification of necessary communications for distributed control. It is also shwon that the structural partitions can be used directly in the design of software fault tolerant concurrent controllers. In particular, the structural partition can be used to identify the boundary of the conversation which can be used to protect a specific part of the system. In addition, for certain classes of system, the partitions can be used to identify processes which may be dynamically reconfigured in the event of a fault. These methods should be of use in the design of robust distributed systems...|$|R
