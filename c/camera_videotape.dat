One such skill is visual attention, which is beneficial for athletes, but less commonly researched for sport officials. For this dissertation, three data collection procedures assisted in examining the visual behaviors of elite, intermediate and novice ice hockey referees. In phase one, 2 elite, 2 intermediate, and 2 novice referees wore helmet cameras for one game and subsequently participated in stimulated recall interviews to address visual behaviors that occurred during that game. The four resultant themes that emerged were: Divided Attention, Selective Attention, Positioning and Context, and Influences of Visual Attention. Within each of these major themes there were several similarities and differences amongst the referees. In phase two, 2 elite, 2 intermediate, and 2 novice focus groups watched one elite and one intermediate helmet <b>camera</b> <b>videotape</b> and discussed what they thought the referee was attending to and where they would direct their visual attention. The focus group transcripts were deductively coded to search for potential differences between the elite and intermediate referees based on the themes identified in phase one. It was evident that the elite referee was superior to the intermediate in several areas including: Maintaining a focus on the majority of players, knowing when to focus away from the puck, having better post-whistle attention, and being better positioned. Discussion related to how these advantages might be gained by learning through experience. For phase three, 10 elite, 10 intermediate, and 10 novice referees wore an eye-tracking device and made penalty decisions on ice hockey infractions presented on a computer screen. In this experiment, decision accuracy, decision type, number of fixations, and fixation duration were calculated. MANOVA results indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} across participant groups. The global discussion includes data excluded from the three main papers, alternative methods for further interpretation of the results, integration of the results of the three papers, and proposals for future research...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} the relationship between inter-arm coordination and the energy cost of locomotion in front crawl and breaststroke and explored swimmers' flexibility in adapting their motor organization away from their preferred movement pattern. DESIGN: Nine front-crawlers performed three 300 -m in front crawl and 8 breaststrokers performed three 200 -m in breaststroke at constant submaximal intensity and with 5 -min rests. Each trial was performed randomly in a different coordination pattern: freely chosen, 'maximal glide' and 'minimal glide'. Two underwater <b>cameras</b> <b>videotaped</b> frontal and side views to analyze speed, stroke rate, stroke length and inter-limb coordination. METHODS: In front crawl, inter-arm coordination was quantified by the index of coordination (IdC) and the leg beat kicks were counted. In breaststroke, four time gaps quantified the arm to leg coordination (i. e., time between leg and arm propulsions; time between beginning, 90 ° flexion and end of arm and leg recoveries). The energy cost of locomotion was calculated from gas exchanges and blood lactate concentration. RESULTS: In both front crawl and breaststroke, the freely chosen coordination corresponded to glide pattern and showed the lowest energy cost (12. 8 and 17. 1 Jkg(- 1) m(- 1), respectively). Both front-crawlers and breaststrokers were able to reach 'maximal glide' condition (respectively, + 35 % and + 28 %) but not 'minimal glide' condition for front crawl. CONCLUSIONS: The freely chosen pattern appeared more economic because more trained. When coordination was constrained, the swimmers had higher coordination flexibility in breaststroke than in front crawl, suggesting that breaststroke coordination was easier to regulate by changing glide time...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of the use of a video camera and video printer compared to a 35 -mm camera on learning by student teachers of the documentation panel-making and revisiting processes as methods of enhancing student teachers 2 ̆ 7 teaching skills, and to determine which medium better assisted pre-service teachers in expanding their understanding of the role of the teacher. This study consisted of two major parts: The first studied documentation panel-making processes, and the second part studied revisiting processes. ^ Eight hypotheses were raised in this study. It is assumed that the quality of documentation panel and revisiting would be constrained or enhanced by the medium of documentation. ^ The participants were 12 undergraduate education majors who were in the process of completing the final preschool practicum. The participants were equally divided in two groups, the video and video printer users, and the videotaped episode and 35 -mm camera users. Six student teachers used a 35 -mm <b>camera</b> and <b>videotaped</b> episodes and the other six teachers used a video camera and video printer to create documentation panels and to revisit. Student teachers created two documentation panels and had two revisiting experiences. ^ The data for this study were derived from 24 documentation panels, 24 interview tapes, and 24 revisiting tapes. ^ Two-way analysis of variance showed that there were no statistically significant differences found in all seven dependent variables by treatment and practice conditions and their interactions. This might be because of the small number of subjects studied. As regards revisiting, the video printer group showed higher scores for both revisiting I and revisiting II than the 35 -mm camera group on the quality of revisiting skills and the degree of temporality on revisiting. ^ The results of analysis of interview responses showed that the unique aspects of each technology affected student teachers 2 ̆ 7 learning in different ways in the documentation panel-making and revisiting processes. The groups using a video camera and video printer displayed a process orientation of children 2 ̆ 7 s learning compared to the use of a 35 -mm <b>camera</b> and <b>videotaped</b> episode group. Also, the video printer group demonstrated better revisiting skills than the 35 -mm camera group when they used their photographs to facilitate children 2 ̆ 7 s construction of knowledge and interpretation of learning processes.

5000|$|Other {{than these}} rare cases, larger {{birds of prey}} such eagles are not usually harassed by Verreaux's eagle-owl and are more aptly viewed as competitors. In fact, the martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), in most regards the largest eagle in Africa, is {{sometimes}} regarded as the diurnal ecological equivalent of the Verreaux's eagle-owl. The martial eagle has rather similar habitat preferences to the eagle-owl and has a similarly broad, opportunistic diet. At roughly 4200 g in average body mass, the martial eagle is roughly twice as heavy so Verreaux's eagle-owl and takes correspondingly large prey, its average prey weight range being 1000 to 5000 g and the eagles are capable of exceptionally taking prey up to nearly nine times their own weight, whereas quantitatively most of the eagle-owls prey does not exceed 1000 to 1500 g. Verreaux's eagle-owl are likely to give martial eagles a respectful amount of space during daytime {{and there are no}} records of the two species harassing one another. Another particularly large and aggressive eagle, the crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), is largely a forest-dweller and so is less directly a diurnal equivalent. There a single recorded instance of an immature crowned eagle being aggressively displaced at night by an adult Verreaux's eagle-owl when it happen to encroach on the eagle-owl's territory but without bloodshed and eagle-owls would do well to avoid the exceptionally powerful eagle. Taken together, the Verreaux's, the Shelley's and the cape eagle-owls could be seen as nocturnally replacing the eagle species of martial, crowned and Verreaux's eagles in the respective habitats of savanna, forest and rocky areas but their increasingly diminishing size in comparison to the diurnal eagles means that, generally speaking, less large-bodied prey is likely to be attacked. [...] Despite its place {{near the top of the}} nocturnal avian food chain, in 2013 a remote wildlife <b>camera</b> <b>videotaped</b> a black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) attacking and killing a Verreaux's eagle owl at a watering hole. Similar rare successful attacks on great horned owls and Eurasian eagle-owls by smaller red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have been reported but in these cases the owls were mysteriously grounded in the horned owl and distracted by nesting into too-easily accessed sea cliffs in the eagle-owl. More often foxes are prey rather than predators for northern Bubo owls. Given that the Verreaux's eagle-owl is surprisingly bold about coming to their ground to, among other things capture beetles, feed on prey too large to carry in flight or, as is likely the case in the jackal attack, drink water, it is possible that the jackal was simply able to ambush an incautious eagle-owl rather than a grounded one.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{reliability}} and validity of a scoring instrument for the assessment of neonatal resuscitation skills in a training setting. METHODS: Fourteen paediatric residents performed a neonatal resuscitation on a manikin, while being recorded with a video <b>camera.</b> The <b>videotapes</b> were analysed using an existing scoring instrument with an established face and content validity, adjusted for use in a training setting. Intra- and inter-rater reliability were assessed by comparing the ratings of the videotapes of three raters, one of who rated the videotapes twice. Intra-class coefficients (ICC) were calculated for the sum score, percentages of agreement and kappa coefficients for the individual items. To study construct validity, the performance of a second resuscitation of by residents was assessed after they had received feedback on their first performance. RESULTS: The ICC were 0. 95 and 0. 77 for intra- and inter-rater reliability, respectively. The median percentage of intra-rater agreement was 100 %; inter-rater agreement 78. 6 - 84. 0 %. The median kappa was 0. 85 for intra-rater reliability, and 0. 42 - 0. 59 for inter-rater reliability.

He and fellow activists used bullhorns to protest rodeos organized by the Wauconda Chamber of Commerce in Wauconda, Illinois, and the Lake County sheriff's police union. In a 2004 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Hindi said he and his group had been protesting the Wauconda Rodeo since 1993. In 1997, he sent antagonistic messages with the letterhead [...] "An animal abuser's worst nightmare". Hindi used a video camera capable of recording footage from the distance of over a block to videotape rodeo workers bending animals' tails, flinging sand into their faces, and jabbing them in their sides. The Wauconda Rodeo video showed horses with injuries to their haunches, a steer getting kicked, another steer's tail getting yanked, and children traveling around on sheep. His video received coverage in the TV news, and Lake County State's Attorney Mike Waller launched an investigation into Hindi's animal abuse accusation. Waller asked the Illinois Department of Agriculture and three veterinarians to review the video. The veterinarians said no animal cruelty was shown in the video because the methods used by the rodeo workers were commonly used with sizable animals. Waller dismissed the activists' complaints against the rodeo, saying that the veterinarians unanimously concluded that Illinois' Humane Care for Animals Act was not violated.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} an accurate and practical method for measuring intracellular Ca 2 + concentration [(Ca 2 +]i) in single cells in monolayer culture using the fluorescent Ca 2 +-binding dye quin 2. Quin 2 was loaded into cells as a membrane-permeant ester which is hydrolyzed in the cytoplasm to the impermeant free acid, which is the indicator form (Tsien, R. Y., T. Pozzan, and T. J. Rink, 1982, J. Cell Biol., 94 : 325 - 334). The method involves the measurement of fluorescence at 340 - nm excitation (I 340), where dye fluorescence is dependent on Ca 2 +, and at 360 -nm excitation (I 360), where dye fluorescence is independent of Ca 2 +. The ratio of these two values (I 340 /I 360) is thus related to the concentration of Ca 2 + but independent of dye concentration {{and can be used}} as a measure of [Ca 2 +]. To test the ratio method in the microscope, we measured [Ca 2 +]i in GH 3 cells in monolayer culture. We found a resting [Ca 2 +]i of 44 +/- 28 nM (mean +/- SD, n = 34), as compared with a suspension value (Gershengorn, M., and C. Thaw, 1983, Endocrinology, 113 : 1522 - 1524) of 118 +/- 18 nM. We also measured [Ca 2 +]i during stimulation of the cells with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and found a 2. 4 -fold increase above resting levels within 20 s, a trough at 73 % of resting at 90 - 100 s, and a peak slightly above resting at 3 min. Depolarization of the plasma membrane with KCl produced a sustained increase in [Ca 2 +]i. All of these data are in good agreement with the results of Gershengorn and Thaw on suspension cultures. When measuring both resting [Ca 2 +]i and the effects of TRH and KCl on small groups of cells, we found some variation among experiments. Using an image intensifier-video <b>camera,</b> we <b>videotaped</b> cells during TRH stimulation. Digital image analysis of these pictures demonstrated that there was a large variation in responsiveness from cell to cell. The microscope ratio method offers the possibility of resolving regions of differing [Ca 2 +] within the cytoplasm...|$|R
