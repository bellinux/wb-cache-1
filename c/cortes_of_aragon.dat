50|$|The {{electoral system}} for the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> was {{regulated}} under transitory provisions in the 1982 Statute of Autonomy of Aragon and, subsidiarily, under the general provisions of the Electoral Rules Decree-Law 20/1977. The Cortes was composed of 66 seats, allocated to Huesca (18), Teruel (16) and Zaragoza (32). Deputies were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 3% of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution.|$|E
50|$|The {{succession}} to the Castilian and Aragonese crowns now fell to Joanna. Because Ferdinand {{could produce}} another heir, the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> refused to recognize Joanna as heir presumptive to the Kingdom of Aragon. In the Kingdom of Castile, however, the succession was clear. Moreover, {{there was no}} Salic tradition which the Castilian Cortes could use to thwart the succession passing to Joanna. At this point, the issue of Joanna's supposed mental incompetence moved from courtly annoyance {{to the center of}} the political stage, since it was clear that Philip and his Burgundian entourage would be the real power-holders in Castile.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} notable Mudéjar towers <b>of</b> <b>Aragón</b> is the 15th-century bell tower of the collegiate church of Santa María, which {{was built on the}} site of a mosque. The Muslim {{fortress}} is the biggest and oldest one on the Iberian peninsula. The church of [...] "San Pedro" [...] was founded by Ferdinand II <b>of</b> <b>Aragón</b> and it was there that the first <b>cortes</b> (parliament) <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> was held in 1411.|$|R
50|$|The {{parties had}} agreed to a {{parliamentary}} process to resolve the issue, but coordinating deliberations between the <b>cortes</b> (parliaments) <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> Valencia and Catalonia was made difficult by their diverging interests. Thus, a general cortes was demanded by the governor of Catalonia to meet in Montblanch, but the meeting was delayed {{and ended up in}} Barcelona, starting in October 1410 and only being <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> the Principality of Catalonia. As the Cortes dragged on, the situation became violent.|$|R
25|$|Perales was an Aragonese Party politician.

50|$|The {{electoral system}} for the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> was {{regulated}} under the Autonomous Community of Aragon Electoral Law 2/1987 and, subsidiarily, under the general provisions of the General Electoral System Organic Law 5/1985 (LOREG). The Cortes was composed of 67 seats, allocated to constituencies corresponding to the provinces of Aragon. Each constituency was entitled to an initial minimum of 13 seats, with the remaining 28 allocated {{in proportion to the}} provincial populations on the condition that the inhabitants/seat ratio in the most populated province did not exceed 2.75 times that of the less populated one—otherwise, the size of most populated district would be limited to such a ratio—. Deputies were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 3% of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution.|$|E
50|$|In November 1592, the Parliament (<b>Cortes)</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aragón</b> revolted {{against another}} {{breach of the}} realm-specific laws, so the Attorney General (Justicia) of the kingdom, Juan de Lanuza, was {{executed}} on Philip II's orders, with his secretary Antonio Perez taking exile in France. In Navarre the major strongholds of the kingdom were garrisoned by troops alien to the kingdom (Castilians) in conspicuous violation {{of the laws of}} Navarre, and the Parliament had long been refusing to pledge loyalty to Philip II's son and heir apparent without a proper ceremony. On 20 November 1592 a ghostly Parliament session was called, pushed by Philip II, who had arrived in Pamplona at the head of an unspecified military force, and with one only point on his agenda—attendance to the session was kept blank on the minutes: unlawful appointments of trusted Castilian officials and an imposition of his son as future king of Navarre at the Santa Maria Cathedral. A ceremony was held before the bishop of Pamplona (22 November), but its customary procedure and terms were altered. Protests erupted in Pamplona, but they were quelled.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> kingdoms {{retained}} {{their power}} to control the king's spending {{with regard to the}} finances of those kingdoms.

50|$|In 1321 the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> Girona {{accepted}} the offer by Sancho of Majorca of twenty galleys, two hundred horses, {{and a large}} number of workers useful to undertake the conquest of Sardinia, other support came from the Kingdom of Valencia and the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b>|$|R
25|$|Financially, Philip's {{situation}} did {{not appear}} much better. He had inherited huge debts from his father, Philip II, and an unhelpful tradition that the kingdom of Castile bore the brunt of royal taxation – Castile carried 65% of total imperial costs by 1616. Philip III received no money from the <b>cortes,</b> or parliaments, <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> the Basque provinces or Portugal; Valencia only provided one contribution, in 1604. Philip did not openly challenge this situation, but instead depended more and more heavily on the Castilian cortes; in turn, the cortes increasingly began to tie new grants of money to specific projects, subtly but steadily altering {{the relationship between the}} king and cortes. By the financial crisis <b>of</b> 1607, the <b>cortes</b> had even insisted that it be recalled every three years, and that Philip take an oath – on pain of excommunication – to promise that he had spent the royal funds in line with the promises made previously to the cortes.|$|R

50|$|In 1283, {{the nobles}} and burgers <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> held a <b>cortes</b> in Zaragoza {{at which they}} swore to uphold each other's rights.

50|$|With the {{marriage}} <b>of</b> Ferdinand <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> and Isabella <b>of</b> Castile, Cagliari {{and the whole}} of Sardinia were bound {{more and more to}} the nascent Spanish state. The Catalan language was the official language <b>of</b> the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> the Kingdom, but its active use gradually died out in the city, overwhelmed by Sardinian in everyday use in every social class, even in the nobility, and it was replaced by Spanish as the language of culture and government.|$|R
50|$|Catherine {{was born}} on 5 October 1422 in Illescas, Toledo. She was the first child of King John II of Castile and his first wife, Maria <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b> Named after her aunt and grandmother, the Duchess of Villena and Catherine of Lancaster, she {{immediately}} became heiress presumptive to the throne of Castile upon her birth. The Infanta was formally recognised as successor to the throne of the kingdom and sworn in as Princess of Asturias on 1 January 1423 by the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> Toledo.|$|R
50|$|Eleanor {{was born}} an infanta of Castile. She {{was the second}} child of King John II of Castile and his first wife, Maria <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b> Eleanor's elder sister, Catherine, Princess of Asturias, died seven days after Eleanor's first birthday. Thus, the one-year-old infanta became heir {{presumptive}} to the throne. Her father had her recognised as successor to the kingdom and as Princess of Asturias by the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> Valladolid shortly after her sister's funeral. The new Princess of Asturias received homage {{in the presence of}} her father, the King, in City of Burgos.|$|R
5000|$|In the Castilian <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> Valladolid in 1506 and of Madrid in 1510, Charles {{was sworn}} as the Prince of Asturias, heir-apparent {{to his mother}} the Queen Joanna. On the other hand, in 1502, the Aragonese Corts {{gathered}} in Saragossa and pledged an oath to Joanna as heiress-presumptive, but the Archbishop of Saragossa expressed firmly that this oath could not establish jurisprudence, that is to say, modify {{the right of the}} succession, except by virtue of a formal agreement between the Cortes and the King. So, upon the death of King Ferdinand II <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> on 23 January 1516, Joanna inherited the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> which consisted <b>of</b> Catalonia, Valencia, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia, while Charles became Governor General. Nevertheless, the Flemings wished Charles to assume the royal title, and this was supported by his grandfather the emperor Maximilian I and Pope Leo X.|$|R
50|$|This Council {{was rather}} {{ineffective}} and the Catholic Monarchs, King Ferdinand II <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> and Isabella I, sought {{to change it}} in their drive to centralize the country and bring it more firmly in line with national interests rather than the nobles. In 1480, they passed the Act of Resumption at the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> Toledo. This act would allow Ferdinand and Isabella to directly appoint bureaucrats, rather than letting the independent and erratic nobles rule. The Royal Council would control both a royal army and manage tax disputes, which would place nobles more securely {{under the control of}} the Crown.|$|R
50|$|During {{medieval times}} Monzón was a stronghold of the Knights Templar {{because of its}} {{strategic}} location between the Segre and Cinca valleys. It was also as an important center for joint legislative sessions for the various segments <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> especially between the 13th and 17th centuries because of its location between Zaragoza and Barcelona.During the 12th century Monzón was ruled by the infant Ramiro de Navarra, Tizón and García Ramírez before his proclamation as King of Navarre among others. When in 1143 the Knights Templar assigns its rights to the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> receives in exchange the Castle of Monzón among others, where the main task of the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> happened. The most historically important event in this period is the enforced residence of James I ("The Conqueror") who spent part of his youth Monzón. After his father Peter II ("The Catholic") died in the Battle of Muret (1213); the Knights Templar in Monzon served as the young king's guardians and tutors. When the Pope Clement V extinguishes the Knights Templar, some parcels like Monzón resisted, {{and it was not}} until 1309 when it was conquested. In 1317 passes to sanjuanistas hands, although the hosts will lose its power gradually. Monzón also hosted numerous times the <b>Cortes</b> <b>of</b> the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> between the 13th to 17th centuries. The Cathedral of Santa María del Romeral of Romanesque and the castle with its origins in the 9th century (Torre del Homenaje) welcomed the king and his nobles.|$|R

50|$|The dynastic {{union in}} 1137 between Petronila, Queen <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> and Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, {{produced}} a son, Alfonso II <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> who inherited all their respective territories creating the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> which included all lands and people, titles and states previously {{outside of the}} Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b> The Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> was effectively abolished after the dynastic union with Castile (1469, see below) but the title continued to be used until 1714.

50|$|The throne <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> fell vacant in 1410 (Louis {{was then}} 6 years old) when king Martin I <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> died.

50|$|As the {{surviving}} daughter of King John I <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> she claimed the throne <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> after {{the deaths of}} her elder sister Joanna, Countess of Foix, and her uncle, King Martin I. However, unclear though they were, the laws <b>of</b> succession for <b>Aragon</b> and Barcelona at that time were understood to favour all male relatives over the females (which is how Yolande's uncle Martin <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> came to inherit the throne <b>of</b> <b>Aragon).</b> Martin died without surviving issue in 1410, and after two years without a king, the Estates <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> elected Ferdinand, the second son <b>of</b> Eleanor <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> and John I of Castile, as the next King <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b>|$|R
25|$|At the 2004 Athens Games, aged 27, Perales won two gold medals, {{the first}} {{gold medals in}} her Paralympic career. She also earned three bronze medals and a silver at the 2004 Games.

The King <b>of</b> <b>Aragón</b> was the direct King of the Aragonese region, and held also the title of Count of Provence, Count of Barcelona, Lord of Montpellier, and Duke of Athens and Neopatria.
