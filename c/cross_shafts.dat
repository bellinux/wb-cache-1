25|$|There was {{demonstrable}} {{continuity in}} the south, {{even though the}} Danish settlement represented a watershed in England's artistic tradition. Wars and pillaging removed or destroyed much Anglo-Saxon art, while the settlement introduced new Scandinavian craftsmen and patrons. The result was to accentuate the pre-existing distinction between {{the art of the}} north and that of the south. In the 10th and 11th centuries, the Viking dominated areas were characterised by stone sculpture in which the Anglo-Saxon tradition of <b>cross</b> <b>shafts</b> took on new forms, and a distinctive Anglo-Scandinavian monument, the 'hogback' tomb, was produced. The decorative motifs used on these northern carvings (as on items of personal adornment or everyday use) echo Scandinavian styles. The Wessexan hegemony and the monastic reform movement appear to have been the catalysts for the rebirth of art in southern England {{from the end of the}} 9th century. Here artists responded primarily to continental art; foliage supplanting interlace as the preferred decorative motif. Key early works are the Alfred Jewel, which has fleshy leaves engraved on the back plate; and the stole and maniples of Bishop Frithestan of Winchester, which are ornamented with acanthus leaves, alongside figures that bear the stamp of Byzantine art. The surviving evidence points to Winchester and Canterbury as the leading centres of manuscript art in the second half of the 10th century: they developed colourful paintings with lavish foliate borders, and coloured line drawings.|$|E

Situated {{beside the}} old ridgeway between Disley and Macclesfield {{overlooking}} Lyme Park, the Cheshire Plain, the city of Manchester and the hills of the Peak District, they are a scheduled monument.|$|E
5000|$|Two [...] Lycoming T53 shaft-turbines {{were used}} to drive the two 14 ft {{four-bladed}} propellers. The engines were interconnected by <b>cross</b> <b>shafts,</b> {{so that in the}} event of the failure of one engine, it would automatically disconnect (through torque spring clutches) and both propellers would be driven by the remaining engine.|$|E

5000|$|Some of its Saxon origins {{can be seen}} in its carved stone Saxon font, and in two stone <b>cross</b> <b>shafts</b> in the churchyard. Arthur Mee {{records that}} the church was {{restored}} in the 19th century by Sir Gilbert Scott, with three chapels, but [...] "still has the 13th century base of its tower, and a wall of the same age. Its most ancient jewel is the wonderful font, so old that it is Saxon or Norman, the round bowl carved with humans and dragons." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the churchyard}} are two monuments, {{each of which}} has been scheduled. One is known as the Giant's Grave, and dates from the 10th century. [...] It {{consists}} of two Anglo-Saxon <b>cross</b> <b>shafts</b> and four hogbacks, which have been in their present arrangement since at least 1664-65. [...] The other, known as the Giant's Thumb, also dates from the 10th century. It consists of a single sandstone Anglo-Saxon cross shaft set on a modern sandstone base, which was erected here in 1887. It has a wheel head, and carving on its sides. [...] Also in the churchyard is a monument dated 1846 to the memory of those who built the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway in Gothic Revival style, listed at Grade II, and a war memorial dated 1919 {{in the form of a}} Celtic cross.|$|E
50|$|The arcades are {{supported}} by piers, {{some of which are}} circular, others octagonal. On {{the north side of the}} chancel is a double aumbry; on the south side is a single aumbry and a damaged piscina. In the south aisle is a recess dating from the middle of the 14th century with a crocketed canopy, a finial at the apex and pinnacles at the sides; it had possibly been an Easter Sepulchre. The monuments include a 13th-century effigy of a knight with chain mail, a sword and a shield; a grave cover carved with a foliated cross, a man's head, and hands in prayer; and two Anglo-Saxon <b>cross</b> <b>shafts</b> dating from about 800. The single manual organ was built by Bryceson and Company. There is a ring of four bells. The oldest of these was cast in about 1370, the next in 1718 by Edward Seller I, and the latest two in 1875 by John Warner & Sons.|$|E

50|$|James Nutter had {{space at}} Calf Hall Shed, {{a room and}} power mill, while his mill was built. His mill was {{designed}} by W M Atkins of Colne in 1914, but construction was suspended because of the Great War. The weaving shed was completed in 1920 and the opening ceremony was performed in March 1920. About 50 Lancashire looms were installed and weavers from Calf Hall were brought in on a standard wage to loom-in. In 1920, all four-loom weavers were on piece work expected to weave six pieces each of 100 yards a week for 6s each. Bedding in a new shed was too problematic to rely on piece work wages so a standard wage was paid. When all the looms were installed and everything was running six weeks later, the company reverted to the Uniform List of Weaving Prices. The shed opened with {{part of the first}} double row of looms closest to the warehouse, eventually 80 pairs of looms on this row ran from one cross shaft. Eventually there were 19 <b>cross</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} realize rapid custom design for <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> {{universal}} coupling products, enterprises need a parametric CAD system. On {{the basis of}} analyzing its functional requirements, this paper proposed the overall functional framework of <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> universal coupling CAD system, which mainly includes user management, product drawing, product design, document management and technical interface functional modules, etc. Based on UML modeling method, analyzed its use cases models, key class diagrams and activity diagrams of the CAD system. Then, by using Visual Basic 6. 0 ActiveX Automation technology and SQL Server database technology, a parametric CAD software for <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> universal coupling was successfully developed, which {{has been used in}} enterprise’s design. Its application shows that the parametric CAD software is convenient to operate, and can rapidly realize parametric design of <b>cross</b> <b>shaft</b> universal coupling parts, so it helps to reduce the labor intensity of designers, and improve the quality and efficiency of design...|$|R
