5|$|Muhammad Ahmad Hussein is {{the head}} imam and manager of the al-Aqsa Mosque and was {{assigned}} the role of Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in 2006 by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Ownership of the al-Aqsa Mosque is a contentious issue in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel claims sovereignty over the mosque along {{with all of the}} Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary), but Palestinians hold the <b>custodianship</b> of the site through the Islamic waqf. During the negotiations at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in East Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|In 855, Michael III turned {{fifteen and}} thus came {{nominally}} of age. His mother and Theoktistos both underestimated the young emperor's desire to free himself from their <b>custodianship,</b> and antagonized him further when they arranged a bride show and selected Eudokia Dekapolitissa as his bride, disregarding Michael's attachment to his mistress, Eudokia Ingerina. Theodora's brother Bardas {{was able to}} use Michael's resentment for the high-handed manner in which he was treated and began to turn him against the regency. With Michael's backing, Bardas was allowed to return to the capital, and on 20 November 855, Theoktistos was murdered. Theodora was compelled to retire to a monastery a few months later, bringing the regency officially to an end.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had <b>custodianship</b> over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The Trustees of the Baltimore City College Scholarship Funds, Inc., was {{established}} and incorporated in 1983, and replaced a similar entity that {{was established}} in 1924. The Trustees manage endowments, most of which provide annual scholarships to graduating seniors based on criteria stipulated by the donors. Combined endowment assets are currently valued at or around $1.68 million (adjusted for inflation) covering thirty-four annual scholarships. To recognize the <b>custodianship</b> provided by the Trustees, the BCCAA has placed a bronze plaque in the main hall of the school which carries an individually cast nameplate {{for each of the}} thirty-four permanent endowments held by the Trustees.|$|E
5|$|During the reigns of HenryIV (1399–1413) and his {{successor}} HenryV (1413–1422), Rochester Castle was in the guardianship of William, Earl of Arundel and his brother Richard. The castle was given to HenryV's widow, Catherine of Valois, in 1423 {{as part of her}} dower to support her financially. She died in 1437, at which point the castle came under the <b>custodianship</b> of the clerk of the King's works. Despite this, there are no records of building work during the 15thcentury and almost nothing is known about Rochester Castle between then and {{the second half of the}} 16thcentury. The decline of the castle's military significance is marked by the leasing of the surrounding ditch, beginning in 1564 at the latest. Between 1599 and 1601 stone from Rochester Castle was reused to build nearby Upnor Castle, an artillery fort.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human <b>custodianship</b> of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Rochester was besieged for {{the third}} time in 1264 during the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). The castle's royal constable, Roger de Leybourne, held Rochester in support of Henry III. Rebel armies led by Simon de Montfort and Gilbert de Clare entered the city and set about trying to capture the castle. Again the castle's {{defenders}} resisted, though this time with a different outcome. After a week, the rebel armies raised the siege in the face of relief from Henry himself. Although the garrison did not surrender, the castle suffered extensive damage that was not repaired until the following century. The castle saw military action for the last time in 1381 when it was captured and ransacked during the Peasants' Revolt. As Rochester Castle fell out of use its materials were reused elsewhere and <b>custodianship</b> relinquished by the Crown. The castle and its grounds were opened to the public in the 1870s as a park. At various points during the 19th and 20thcenturies repairs were carried out. The castle is protected as a GradeI listed building and Scheduled Monument. Today the ruins are in the guardianship of English Heritage and open to the public.|$|E
5|$|She {{learned to}} draw during her {{schooling}} at Papunya and Haasts Bluff, but her first {{experience as a}} painter came working on backgrounds for the pictures created by her father. From the Pintupi/Luritja language group, Daisy Jugadai {{was one of a}} range of artists who came to painting through the Ikuntji Women's Centre in the early 1990s. She is credited with {{a significant role in the}} centre's establishment. She began with screen printing and linocut printmaking, but quickly shifted to acrylic painting, producing many of her best works during the mid-1990s. Western Desert artists such as Daisy Jugadai will frequently paint particular 'dreamings' or Tjukurrpa for which they have personal responsibility or rights. A complex concept, Tjukurrpa refers to the spiritual knowledge of the landscape and <b>custodianship</b> of it; it also refers to laws, rules or stories that people must maintain and re-produce in their communities. Daisy Jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility, and those of her late husband and late father. These included honey ant, spinifex and emu dreamings; geographical locations that were the settings for these paintings included Muruntji waterhole and Talabarrdi, and other locations around Kungkayunti, where her family had lived for many years.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali {{spent his}} last years in Umbai, Malacca, and {{supported}} {{himself with a}} small monthly stipend which the British East India Company had granted him. He built a palace for himself and lived with his third wife, Cik' Sembuk {{until his death in}} June 1877, and was buried in a Mausoleum {{within the confines of the}} Umbai mosque. Shortly before his death, Sultan Ali willed the Kesang territory to Tengku Mahmood, his 11-year-old son with Cik' Sembuk. His decision was met with considerable disproval among the some Malays in Singapore, who felt that Tengku Alam should be the heir to the Kesang territory as he was the oldest son with Daing Siti, who was the daughter of a Bugis nobleman, while Cik' Sembuk was a commoner. At the time of Sultan Ali's death, custody of the Kesang territory lay in the hands of Ungku Jalil, Sultan Ali's elder brother. Ungku Jalil handed over the <b>custodianship</b> of the Kesang territory to Maharaja Abu Bakar, after the British government held an election for the Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar and the territory's chieftains to decide on the destiny of the Kesang territory, and voted unanimously for Maharaja Abu Bakar as their leader. The British Governor handed over administrative charge of the Kesang territory over to the Maharaja, which upset Tengku Alam and many of his supporters. Their continued claims to the Kesang territory led to the instigation of the Jementah Civil War in 1879.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{campaign}} by 3801 Limited to retain <b>custodianship</b> of the locomotive, on 26 November 2006 the <b>custodianship</b> passed {{back to the}} New South Wales Rail Transport Museum. The locomotive continued to haul day trips and longer excursions until withdrawn from service for a major overhaul {{at the end of}} 2007.|$|E
25|$|In May 1919 Jerusalem's Association {{informed}} the Reich's commissioner on Germans as enemy nationals abroad, that its loss of {{property in the}} Holy Land amounted to 891,785 marks at its pre-war rate (about £44,589.25 or $212,329.76). The Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, finally became effective on 10 January 1920 and thus legalised the existing British <b>custodianship</b> of {{the property of the}} congregation, the parishioners and Jerusalem's Association. The schools of Jerusalem's Association were reopened under British government management in 1920. In April 1920 the Allies convened at the Conference of San Remo and agreed on the British rule in Palestine, followed by the official establishment of the civil administration on 1 July 1920. From that date on Keith-Roach transferred the collected rents for property in <b>custodianship</b> to the actual proprietors. The League of Nations legitimised this by granting a mandate to Britain in 1922 and Turkey, the Ottoman successor, finally legalised the British Mandate by the Treaty of Lausanne, signed on 24 July 1923 and becoming effective on 5 August 1925. Thus the public <b>custodianship</b> ended in the same year and the prior holders achieved the fully protected legal position as proprietors. Jerusalem's Association applied for registration as Palestinian legal entity, granted in 1928.|$|E
25|$|While some Hindus {{consider}} Buddha as an {{incarnation of}} Vishnu, Buddhists in Sri Lanka venerate Vishnu as the custodian deity of Sri Lanka and protector of Buddhism. Vishnu {{is also known}} as Upulvan or uthpala varna, meaning Blue Lotus coloured. Some postulate that Uthpala varna was a local deity who later merged with Vishnu while another belief is that Uthpala Varna was an early form of Vishnu before he became a supreme deity in Puranic Hinduism. According to Chronicles Mahawamsa, Chulawamsa and folklore in Sri Lanka, Buddha himself handed over the <b>custodianship</b> to Vishnu. Others believe that Buddha entrusted this task to Sakra (Indra) and Sakra delegated this task of <b>custodianship</b> to god Vishnu. Many Buddhist and Hindu shrines are dedicated to Vishnu in Sri Lanka. In addition to specific Vishnu Kovils or devalayas, all Buddhist temples necessarily house shrine rooms (Devalayas) closer to the main Buddhist shrine dedicated to Vishnu.|$|E
25|$|A <b>custodianship</b> of his {{original}} paintings and drawings was established with Rockwell's help {{near his home in}} Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and the Norman Rockwell Museum still is open today year round. The museum's collection includes more than 700 original Rockwell paintings, drawings, and studies. The Rockwell Center for American Visual Studies at the Norman Rockwell Museum is a national research institute dedicated to American illustration art.|$|E
25|$|Between 1992 and 1994, the Jordanian {{government}} undertook {{the unprecedented}} step of gilding {{the dome of}} the Dome of the Rock, covering it with 5000 gold plates, and restoring and reinforcing the structure. The Salah Eddin minbar was also restored. The project was paid for by King Hussein personally, at a cost of $8 million. The Temple Mount remains, {{under the terms of the}} 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, under Jordanian <b>custodianship.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1949 and 1950, the Jewish {{villages of}} Arbel and Kfar Zeitim were {{founded on the}} lands of Hittin. In the 1950s, the Druze {{community}} in Israel was given official <b>custodianship</b> over the Jethro shrine and 100 dunams of land around it. A request to build housing there for Druze soldiers was rejected. The Druze annual pilgrimage continued to be held and was officially recognized as a religious holiday by Israel in 1954.|$|E
25|$|In April 1920 the Allies convened at the Conference of San Remo {{and agreed}} on the British rule in Palestine, {{followed}} by the official establishment of the civil administration on 1 July 1920. From that date on Keith-Roach transferred the collected rents for property in <b>custodianship</b> to the actual proprietors. On June 29, 1920, the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, informed the British Upper House that Great Britain agreed in principle to their return to Palestine.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the investigation, in 2011, a state law was passed, signed by then-governor Rick Perry, to {{transfer}} <b>custodianship</b> of the Alamo from the DRT to the Texas General Land Office. The transfer was officially enacted in 2015. While the DRT initially objected to the Attorney General's report, and {{even went so far as}} to file a lawsuit to prevent the transfer, the organization eventually said that it would work with the Texas GLO to preserve the Alamo for future generations.|$|E
25|$|In July and August 1918 the British sent 850 Templers to an {{internment}} camp at Helwan near Cairo in Egypt. In April 1920, 350 of these internees were deported to Germany. All {{the property of}} the Templers of enemy nationality (thus except of that of a few US citizens among them) was taken into public <b>custodianship.</b> With the establishment of a regular British administration in 1918 Edward Keith-Roach became the Public Custodian of Enemy Property in Palestine, who rented out the property and collected the rents.|$|E
25|$|On May 11, 2001, the Speaker of the House in Nova Scotia, Canada, the Hon. Murray Scott reaffirmed {{official}} {{recognition of}} the order in Canada as grant of the province under the <b>custodianship</b> of the Nova Scotia Ministry of Heritage. According to resolution 1111, the minimum condition of membership to the order is that a pledge to visit Nova Scotia must be made. The order is generally presented in recognition of individuals valued by the Province of Nova Scotia or in honour of the Acadian tradition in Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{site of the}} Shalimar Gardens {{originally}} {{belonged to}} the Arain Mian Family Baghbanpura. The family was also given the royal title of 'Mian' by the Mughal Emperor, for its services to the Empire. Mian Muhammad Yusuf, then {{the head of the}} Arain Mian family, gave the site of Ishaq Pura to the Emperor Shah Jahan, after pressure was placed on the family by the royal engineers who wished to build on the site due to its good position and soil. In return, Shah Jahan granted the Arain Mian family governance of the Shalimar Gardens. The Shalimar Gardens remained under the <b>custodianship</b> of this family for more than 350 years. During the Sikh era, much of the garden's marble was pillaged and used to decorated the Golden Temple in Amritsar.|$|E
25|$|After the begin of the Second World War in September 1939 all {{property}} of the Jaffa congregation, of its parishioners of German or other enemy nationality and of Jerusalem's Association were submitted to the Custodian of Enemy Property, Keith-Roach again, and the schools were supervised by the Committee for Supervision of German Educational Institutions under the Anglican bishop of Jerusalem, George Francis Graham Brown. With the internment of all Jaffa parishioners of German or other enemy nationality in 1940 the premises and houses in Jaffa were confiscated by the Mandatory government. Later the Anglican Church's Ministry Among Jewish People used the Immanuel Church for its services until 1947. The State of Israel, with Jaffa belonging to its state territory, succeeded the mandatory government in this <b>custodianship</b> in May 1948, however, excluding the building of Immanuel Church proper, since the new state did not seize places of worship.|$|E
25|$|By 7 June {{fighting}} led the Jordanians {{to withdraw}} from the West Bank, and Jerusalem's Old City and the Dome of the Rock were abandoned after desperate fighting. Israel blew up the bridges between the two banks to consolidate its control. Jordan suffered a severe setback with the loss of the West Bank, which contributed 40% to Jordan's GDP in the tourism, industrial, and agricultural sectors. Around 200,000 Palestinian refugees fled to Jordan, destablizing Jordan's demographics. The loss of Jerusalem was critical to Jordan, and specifically for Hussein who held the Hashemite <b>custodianship</b> of Muslim and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem. Al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam, believed to be where Muhammad ascended to heaven. By 11June Israel had decisively won the war by capturing the West Bank from Jordan, Gaza and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from Syria. Nasser and Hussein, recognizing their defeat, sought to work together towards a more moderate stance.|$|E
500|$|Boddingtons largely eschewed {{above the}} line {{advertising}} until 1987, {{when it was first}} advertised on Granada television in the North West of England. The tagline from 1987 until 1991 was [...] "If you don't get Boddies, you'll just get bitter". Under Whitbread's <b>custodianship</b> the comedian Frankie Howerd fronted the campaign in a series of six television advertisements which mainly aired in the North West in 1990–1991. Lowe Howard-Spink was the advertising agency responsible for the Howerd advertisements.|$|E
500|$|In 1922 Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland, granted <b>custodianship</b> of {{the castle}} to the Office of Works which had been made {{accountable}} for the guardianship of ancient monuments. The Duke's Chambers remained under direct control of the Percys. The Office of Works undertook excavations in the moat in 1924 and removed the custodian from the gatehouse. English Heritage, who now manage and maintain the site, succeeded as the castle's custodians in 1984, and three years later the Duke's Chambers were given over to their care. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, a [...] "nationally important" [...] historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a GradeI listed building (first listed in 1985) and recognised as an internationally important structure.|$|E
500|$|The Chancery's {{jurisdiction}} over [...] "lunatics" [...] came from two sources: first, the King's prerogative {{to look after}} them, which was exercised regularly by the Lord Chancellor, and second, the Lands of Lunatics Act, which gave the King (and therefore the Chancellor) <b>custodianship</b> of lunatics and their land; the Lord Chancellor exercised the first right directly and the second {{in his role as}} head of the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction applied to any [...] "idiots" [...] or [...] "lunatics", {{regardless of whether or not}} they were British, or whether their land was within England and Wales. They were divided into two categories– idiots, [...] "who have no glimmering of reason from their birth and are, therefore, by law, presumed never likely to attain any", and lunatics, [...] "who have had understanding but have lost the use of it". Lunatics and idiots were administered separately by the Lord Chancellor under his two prerogatives; the appeal under the King's prerogative went directly to the King, and under the Lands of Lunatics Act 1324 to the House of Lords.|$|E
500|$|In 1625 Charles I {{brought his}} court to Richmond Palace to escape an {{outbreak}} of plague in London and turned the area on the hill above Richmond into a park for the hunting of red and fallow deer. It was originally {{referred to as the}} king's [...] "New Park" [...] to distinguish it from the existing park in Richmond, which is now known as Old Deer Park. In 1637 he appointed Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland as keeper of the new park for life, with a fee of 12 (old) pence a day, pasture for four horses, {{and the use of the}} brushwood– later holders of that office were known as [...] "Ranger". Charles's decision, also in 1637, to enclose the land was not popular with the local residents, but he did allow pedestrians the right of way. To this day the walls remain, although they have been partially rebuilt and reinforced. Following Charles I's execution, <b>custodianship</b> of the park passed to the Corporation of the City of London. It was returned to the restored monarch, Charles II, on his return to London in 1660.|$|E
2500|$|The League of Nations legitimised the British {{administration}} and <b>custodianship</b> by granting {{a mandate to}} Britain in 1922, which Turkey, the Ottoman successor, finally ratified by the Treaty of Lausanne, signed on 24 July 1923 and becoming effective on 5 August 1925.

2500|$|The {{origins of}} this {{may well have}} been in the Ferrers family's long held claims on the estate of Peverel Castle through the {{marriage}} of Margaret Peverel to Robert the second earl. [...] King John had assigned stewardship of the estate to the fourth earl, Robert's grandfather, but King Henry had taken it back and awarded it to Prince Edward. Finally there was Edward's <b>custodianship</b> during Robert's minority and the fact that some land had not been relinquished. Be that as it may, Robert of Gloucester observed that [...] "Of no one was Edward more afraid." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{relationship}} with Josephine Brunsvik deepened {{after the death}} in 1804 of her aristocratic first husband, the Count Joseph Deym. Beethoven wrote Josephine 15 passionate love letters from late 1804 to around 1809/10. Although his feelings were obviously reciprocated, Josephine was forced by her family to withdraw from him in 1807. She cited her [...] "duty" [...] {{and the fact that}} she would have lost the <b>custodianship</b> of her aristocratic children had she married a commoner. After Josephine married Baron von Stackelberg in 1810, Beethoven may have proposed unsuccessfully to Therese Malfatti, the supposed dedicatee of [...] "Für Elise"; his status as a commoner may again have interfered with those plans.|$|E
