40|$|Abstract—Two {{methods of}} {{compensation}} of thermal lensing in high power terbium gallium garnet (TGG) Faraday isolators {{have been investigated}} in detail: compensation {{by means of an}} ordinary negative lens and compensation using FK 51 Schott glass possessing a negative dn/dT. Key thermo-optic constants for TGG crystals and FK 51 glass were measured. We find that the contribution of the photo-elastic effect to the total thermal lens cannot be neglected either for TGG or for FK 51. We define a figure of merit for compensating glass and show that for FK 51, an ordinary negative lens with an optimal focus is more efficient, but requires physical repositioning of the lens for different laser powers. In contrast, the use of FK 51 as a <b>compensating</b> <b>element</b> is passive and works at any laser power, but is less effective than simple telescopic compensation.

40|$|The {{main problem}} in {{extending}} continuous-time filtering to higher frequencies is {{the sensitivity of}} high-frequency filters to analog integrator nonidealities such as finite dc gain and parasitic poles. The use of a cascode stage introduces internal nodes, and hence a nondominant pole, in the signal path. This has been overcome using a novel phase compensation scheme which does not require tuning of the <b>compensating</b> <b>element,</b> and is itself unaffected by tuning of the integrator’s unity-gain frequency or quality factor. The scheme is based upon a MOS version of the “multi-tanh principle” where the linear range of a transconductor is divided between at least two unbalanced differential pairs operating in parallel. The common-source node of an unbalanced differential pair is not ac ground and the associated pole–zero pair may be harnessed to cancel the parasitic pole introduced by the cascode stage.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} method to {{evaluate}} and quantify in a precise way the peripheral refraction induced by an ophthalmic lens. The motivation for this work stems from the progression of myopia and its possible causes; {{two of them are}} particularly key for this PhD: (a) Peripheral refraction of the eye may have {{an important role in the}} progression of myopia and (b) ophthalmic lenses are the <b>compensating</b> <b>element</b> more used in children and teenagers. These two elements fully justify the need for a reliable method to quantify the induced peripheral refraction by an ophthalmic lens. This method is based on two pillars: first, it must accurately assess the design of the ophthalmic lens and, second, it should consider what peripheral refractive pattern is acting, that is, without <b>compensating</b> <b>element.</b> The proposed method takes the advantages provided by the ray tracing strategies used in the classic design of ophthalmic lenses but applying them in parallel with amendments to evaluate the peripheral refraction. Thus, the simple scheme used in the classic design of ophthalmic lenses containing a remote sphere and a small aperture at the center of rotation of the eye becomes a scheme where the retina conjugate surface (RCS) and the nodal point of the eye play equivalent roles. In our case, the reference for ray tracing is the nodal point of the eye and the reference for measuring the induced peripheral refraction is the RCS. Ray tracing is based on a finite ray tracing (FRT) from the image space to the object space and on a generalized ray tracing (GRT) from object space to image space. Both have been implemented in a Matlab program and validated to provide a powerful tool for our purpose. GRT allows a quick and accurate assessment of the oblique astigmatism, ie the tangential and sagittal focal lens, in wide field of view considering accurately the lens design. This considers that each ray has a small wavefront associated traveling perpendicular to it. By GRT we are able to know how the wavefront shape changes when is propagated and refracted. Therefore, it is mandatory to have a locally description of the geometry of both the wavefront and the refractive surface at the point where the ray arrives to the refractive surface. This local description is determined by the normal and by the principal curvatures and directions of these surfaces at the point of interest; they can be obtained from a parametric description of the surface and then using Gaussian fundamental forms. This ray tracing procedure has been developed for the general case of any geometry to the surfaces of the ophthalmic lens and has been detailed for the case of an astigmatic lens. For calculating the induced peripheral refraction, a surface is modeled reflecting the peripheral refractive initial values before entering the lens; this is the aforementioned RCS. Two methods have been proposed to model this RCS. One is based on the trends observed in the different studies and uses three-dimensional surfaces power vectors associated with peripheral refraction. The second method uses experimental measurements obtained along four meridians of the retina to interpolate a surface. The expression of these surfaces by power vectors can easily be combined with the results obtained by tracing rays through the lens for the calculation of the induced peripheral refraction. We present in this manuscript some specific examples of how variations on the lens geometry modified the induced peripheral refraction. This opens up the possibility of custom designs ophthalmic lenses to prevent the progression of myopia. Esta Tesis tiene como objetivo la propuesta de un método para la evaluación cuantitativa de la refracción periférica inducida en el ojo de un paciente por una lente oftálmica. La motivación del trabajo radica en la importancia de este fenómeno en el progresión de la miopía y sus causas. La existencia de una refracción periférica hipermetrópica se ha relacionado directamente con la progresión de la miopía, y las lentes oftálmicas son el elemento compensador preferenteen niños y adolescentes, los sujetos más relevantes en cuanto al control de la progresión de l amiopía, en sí misma y como antesala d eotros problemas oculares más graves. Hasta la realización de esta Tesis no existía un método preciso, próximo a los métodos convencionales del diseño de lentes oftálmicas, que permitiera el cálculo de la refracción periférica inducida por la lente oftálmica y el análisi de los diseños de lente utilizados. Dicho diseño debe considerar tanto los efectos asociados a a óptica y la geometría del ojo, como al propio diseño de la lente compensadora. El método que se propone sigue una metodologia próxima a la del diseño convencional de lentes oftálmicas, sustituyendo el rol del centro de rotación del ojo por el de su punto nodal, y el rol de la esfera del remoto por lo qque se ha denominado la superfície conjugada de la retina (RCS, de retinal conjugate surface, en el texto). Con este enfoque se han implementado algoritmos detallados de trazado de rayos finito y generalizado que permiten el trazado detallado de rayos en un conjunto de direcciones alrededor de la fóvea. Los algoritmos de trazado generalizado permiten el análisis de lentes oftálmicas de manera más eficiente que el trazado intensivo típico del software de diseño óptico, utilizando el concepto de trazado de frente d eonda, que analiza las deformaciones del frente de onda que acompaña a un rayo principal. Dichos algoritmos se han implementado y validado para un conjunto de lentes oftálmicas de diferentes geometrías en un software científico estándard (Matlab(R)) como parte de los trabajos desarrollados en esta Tesis. Mediante el uso de los algoritmos descritos es posible calcular la superficie refractada que induceuna lente oftálmica. A continuación se hen desarrollado modelos teóricos y experimentales para la RCS que permiten tener en cuanta la variabilidad de patrones de refracción periférica existente, y se ha propuesto el uso de vectores de potencia (M J 0 y J 45) para el cálculo de la refracción periférica inducida por la lente, mediante la combinación de la superficie refractada por la lente y la modelada para una determinada RCS.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{utilization}} of extra-high-voltage underground power cables over distances greater than 100 miles presents serious problems {{relative to the}} voltage and current limits of such cables. These problems are directly associated with the fixed amount of capacitance inherent in long cable lines. As a result, large charging currents are characteristic with long cable line operation when energized under steady-state conditions.

40|$|In the {{semiconductor}} industry, optical lithography is presently {{the most widespread}} technology used to print a geometrical pattern on a semiconductor wafer. Because of the plans imposed by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for more powerful and smaller chips, new printing technologies capable of printing smaller features on the wafer need to be developed. Extreme UltraViolet Lithography (EUVL) is a promising candidate for the next-generation of pattern technology beyond the current machines that operate at wavelength of 193 nm based on optical lithography. EUVL uses photons of 13. 5 nm wavelength to carry-out the imaging and therefore it is suitable for addressing not only the 22 nm half-pitch nodes but also several nodes beyond that. However, material properties at the EUV range make this technique completely different from present-day lithography. EUV radiation is strongly absorbed in all materials and gases and therefore multilayer (ML) aspherical mirrors have {{to be used in}} the projection optics. Moreover, because of the partial reflectivity of a ML mirror (about 70 %), part of the radiation is absorbed by the mirrors causing thermally induced aberrations in the optical projection box. Adaptive optics (AO) is an attractive technology that could be implemented in lithography machines as a method to compensate these aberrations and achieve high quality diffraction-limited imaging. Since the aberrations we aim to correct are very small, a significant amount of research has been done to develop metrology techniques that can measure them with extreme accuracy and in high speed. Most accurate wavefront sensing are usually done using interferometry techniques, but these require extremely stable setups and laborious measurement interpretations. In this thesis, we focus alternatively on another technique, called phase retrieval, which can be a valid substitute for interferometry. In the first part of this thesis, we show how phase retrieval can be employed as a method to increase the accuracy of an already established wavefront measuring technique based on an Hartmann wavefront sensor (HWS). The HWS technique relies on the assumption that the wavefront slope can be locally approximated by a linear function which is sensed on each sub-aperture of the sensor. Departures from this linearity assumption is the main limiting factor in the accuracy of the reconstructed wavefront. The implementation of the phase retrieval method presented here aims to recover the nonlinearities in the phase distribution and therefore achieves an improved reconstruction. Simulations showed that the RMS wavefront reconstruction has an accuracy of the order of 10 ? 4 ?. This value is typically one order of magnitude lower than the linear slope computational method. Experiments have been carried-out to compare the retrieved results with an independent wavefront measurement showing good agreement with the theoretical predictions. In the second part of this thesis, we focus our attention on phase retrieval from the intensity distributions of the field in the focal region. This method has already been demonstrated to be capable to estimate the phase aberrations of an optical system. However, the conventional implementation requires the measurement of intensity distributions in several different planes in the focal region in order to obtain a stable phase estimation. As an alternative, we develop here a method where phase retrieval from a single plane of measurement is achieved. Hence, our task is to reduce the measurement time and the amount of data to be analysed. As a result, we show that using a statistical approach, an optimal plane of measurement at one focus depth according to the axial Rayleigh criteria, can be identified. The analysis of the statistical uncertainties and correlation coefficients shows that the phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plane at said out-of-focus distance leads to a stable phase estimation with minimum uncertainties and minimum RMS wavefront deviation. The concept of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plane is further investigated. By expanding the exponential term in the exit pupil function in Taylor series up to the first order we are able to describe, with proper approximations, the contribution of the aberration functions to the intensity distribution in the focal region. This allows us to show that aberration functions characterised by an even spatial distribution do not contribute to the intensity distribution of the field in the Gaussian focal plane. Hence, the problem of retrieving phase information from intensity measurements in such a plane is impossible. Moreover we show that, also in this approximation, it is possible to identify an optimal plane of measurement. By looking at the contribution of the aberrations to the intensity distribution as a function of the out-of-focus distance, we have found analogous results. Namely, the aberrations contribute to the intensity distribution in a minimal manner for distances close to the focal plane. Conversely, the contribution is maximised for a distance of one focus depth (Rayleigh criteria), confirming the previous findings. To exploit these results, a new experimental AO system based on the phase retrieval method has been built. In particular, this has been possible by joining the knowledge of the optimised phase retrieval method together with an innovative type of control strategy for the AO system. These two key elements need to work in perfect symbiosis: phase retrieval has to provide the accurate measurement of the phase, and the control strategy needs to translate the phase information to an electrical signal that drives the <b>compensating</b> <b>element</b> (e. g., a deformable mirror) in a correct and efficient way. For this reason, we also provide a complete analysis of the control algorithm employed in our setup, focusing on the convergence speed, shape quality and voltage saturation. This allows us to demonstrate that aberrations can be corrected in real-time up to ?/ 100 with a simple optical bench and a standard computer. Finally, the last chapter of this thesis is dedicated to the feasibility analysis of the phase retrieval method implemented on a patented EUVL optical design. Thermally induced phase aberrations are modelled in the system on the basis of a thermo-elastic Finite Element Model (FEM) simulation. A metrology procedure using different operational wavelengths i. e., 13. 5 nm 193 nm and 633 nm has been proposed. Simulations have shown that the RMS wavefront reconstruction scales in general with the wavelength. Nevertheless, wavefront metrology at 193 nm has shown an accuracy below 650 pm RMS wavefront. This result is sufficient to fulfil the requirements and moreover allows relaxed experimental conditions for the metrology procedure. IST DepartmentApplied Science...|$|E

Short and long cavity filters were designed for the spectral ranges of 5. 0 … 3. 7 µm and 4. 3 … 3. 0 µm respectively. Spectral flat, blackened pyroelectric chips are arranged behind the filters in both the multi-colour and tunable-colour detectors. Beam splitting results in a time parallel split-up and filtering of the incident radiation flux, whereas in the tunable-colour detector, the filtering is a time serial process...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{radiation}} effects to electronics circuits has been ongoing {{almost as long}} as there have been satellites and spacecraft in space. The response to radiation over the planned life of the space system is of great concern to system designers. Operational amplifiers {{are one of the most}} basic elements in all electronic systems. This research examines radiation effects of part of a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) operational amplifier and is applicable to Complimentary MOS (CMOS) technology as well. More specifically, it is pertinent to MOS capacitors used to internally compensate op amps. First, a review of semiconductor theory is presented followed by a discussion of damage mechanisms to MOS capacitors and a brief look at operational amplifier fundamentals. MOS capacitors, constructed by previous research efforts using the MOSIS technique, were selected as the internally <b>compensating</b> <b>elements</b> for simple low pass filters. Using the Naval Postgraduate School linear accelerator, these capacitors were irradiated with pulsed electrons possessing energies of up to 26 MeV for varying times. In-situ measurements were taken to immediately determine the capacitance value via the measured filter break frequency as a function of fluence. Separate irradiation runs were performed on three MOSIS capacitors and were terminated upon filter failure. This research concludes with a hypothesis of the filter fallure mechanism and suggested areas for expansion of continuing research efforts. This is believed to be the first time such an experiment has been performed. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

Modal dispersion during propagation in the waveguide then provides group velocity dispersion to the signal. The large modal dispersion inherent to multimode waveguides enables the dispersion per unit length of a chromo-modal dispersion device to be several orders of magnitude {{higher than that of}} diffraction grating or dispersion <b>compensating</b> fiber-based dispersive <b>elements.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results of}} transmission experiments using optical solitons in a dispersion managed optical fibre recirculating loop. The basic concepts of pulse propagation in optical fibre are introduced before optical solitons {{and their use}} in optically amplified fibre systems are discussed. The role of dispersion management in such systems is then considered. The design, operation and limitations of the recirculating loop and soliton sources which were used and the experimental techniques are described before the experimental work is presented. The experimental work covers {{a number of areas}} all of which used dispersion management of the transmission line. A novel ultra-long distance propagation scheme which achieved low timing jitter by suppression of the amplifier noise and by working close to the zero dispersion wavelength has been discovered. The use of fibre Bragg gratings as wavelength filters to suppress noise and reduce timing jitter has been investigated. The performance of the fibre grating cornpared favourably with that of a bulk device and was in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The upgrade of existing standard fibre systems to higher bit rates is currently an important issue. The possibility of using solitons with dispersion compensation to allow an increase in data rate of existing standard fibre systems to 10 Gbit/s over 5000 km has been demonstrated. The applicability of this technique to longer distances, higher bit rates or longer amplifier spans is also investigated by optimisation of the dispersion management scheme. The use of fibre Bragg gratings as the dispersion <b>compensating</b> <b>elements</b> in such standard fibre transmission experiments has been examined and the main problem that these devices currently have, high polarisation mode dispersion, is discussed. The likely future direction of optical communications and what part solitons and dispersion management will play in this development is discussed in the thesis conclusion...|$|R
