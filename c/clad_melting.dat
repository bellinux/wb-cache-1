A series of experiments performed in the past (CABRI/SCARABEE experiments) were chosen to validate the developed ASTEC-Na code. One of the in-pile experiments considered during ASTEC-Na validation phase is CABRI-BI 1; loss-of-flow transient without Transient Over Power (TOP) using low burn-up MOX fuel pin.

The results of the ASTEC-Na calculation performed within the present work were in good agreement with the steady state and the overall fuel-pin disruption behaviour, which were characterised by a thermal pin-failure mode, observed in the CABRI-BI 1 experiment. This paper describes the outcome of the analysis using ASTEC-Na as well as findings for future code improvements.

The corrosion products from this accumulated in some of the fuel channels. One of the 73 vertical fuel channels was sufficiently blocked by it to impede the flow of carbon dioxide coolant so that the magnesium alloy <b>cladding</b> <b>melted</b> and further blocked the channel. The increase in temperature and exposure of the uranium metal fuel to the coolant eventually caused the fuel to catch fire in the carbon dioxide coolant atmosphere. The pressure tube surrounding the fuel channel split because of overheating and bowing of the burning fuel assembly, and the carbon dioxide coolant leaked out of the reactor.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parametric study of thermal hydraulic and structural mechanic analyses of accidental blockages {{of the hottest}} sub-assembly of the 50 MWth gas-cooled fast reactor, ETDR. The blockage ratios were 60 % and 100 % of the sub-assembly flow cross-section located at the first row of grid spacers. Temperature profiles in the fuel and cladding were calculated {{as a function of}} time using computational fluid dynamics. The results were incorporated into finite elements analyses to evaluate thermal and mechanical stresses and strains in the cladding and fuel. 2 D simulations with generalized plane strains were used in the structural analyses applying the maximum power density in the pellet as calculated by CFD. The thermal analyses showed that a 60 % partial blockage increases the maximum cladding temperature by 130 ◦C within a time period of 50 s, whereas a full blockage will lead to <b>clad</b> <b>melting</b> (1320 ◦C) in about 8 s after accident initiation. In the finite element analyses several, mainly conservative, assumptions have been made to incorporate the phenomena occurring in the pellet–cladding interaction. The results of the finite element analyses represent a first study of the pellet–cladding mechanical interface under given transients, exploring the development of a methodology to be used for future analyses. The model has been verified to predict realistic contact stresses in line with analytical solutions during partial or full blockages. However, more elaborate 2 D and 3 D contact models, with creep and irradiation creep material models for both fuel and clad, together with parametric studies on friction coefficients and number of fuel fragments are foreseen for future work on failure criteria.

40|$|Detailed reactor design {{calculations}} {{have been performed}} for a 10 MW swimming pool type Pakistan Research Reactor-l (P ARR-I) utilizing low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel and a 2 ' kW tank in pool type Pakistan Research Reactor- 2 (P ARR- 2) utilizing highly enriched(uranium (HEU) fuel. These calculations were aimed at: enhancing power level of P ARR-. from 9 to 10 MW, demonstrating inherent safety of P ARR- 2, developing mathematical models for thermal hydraulic and accident analysis of P ARR- 2 and their experimental validation, developing computer code for natural convection cooling of P ARR-l and it experimental validation, improving modeling procedures and validating methodology ant computer codes by experimental measurements. Standard computer codes WIMS-D/ 4 and CITATION were employed to calculate con excess reactivity, reactivity loads due to temperatures, xenon and samarium, neutron fluxes power distribution and power peaking factors, reactivity feedback coefficients, control roc worth and shutdown margin, reactivity worth of fuel element and reflector. etc. The analytical predictions were validated by experimental measurements and. the agreement is found to b generally good. The steady state thermal hydraulic analysis of P ARR-I and P ARR- 2 was carried to compute coolant velocity, pressure drop, saturation temperature, temperature distribution in the core heat fluxes at Onset of Nucleate Boiling (ONB), Onset of Flow Instability (OFI) and Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB). Computer code DP and PARET {{were used for the}} analysis of forced convection cooling of PARR - 1 core whereas a computer code FREECOM was developed for the analysis of natural convection cooling. Thermal hydraulic analysis 0 PARR- 2 was carried out using standard correlations. The calculated core parameters, for the natural convection cooling, were validated by making experimental measurements on but the reactors and comparing analytical predictions with available experimental data for simile reactors. Good agreement was observed between theoretical and experimental values. Computer code PARET was employed to investigate the transient response PARR-l core t several accident situations like uncontrolled withdrawal of control rods. flooding of bear tube, movement of core against thermal column and removal of an inpile experiment. The. reactivity limits imposed by <b>clad</b> <b>melting</b> temperature were also determined. In all of these transients, time histories of reactor power, energy release, peak fuel, clad and coolant temperatures were calculated. On the other hand, mathematical models were developed for the accident analysis of P ARR- 2. The theoretical predictions for P ARR- 2 were validated b) conducting reactivity insertion experiments. Reactivities of different magnitudes and durations were inserted into the core and transients were allowed to be terminated by intrinsic reactor behaviour without an external control or operators intervention. An external agreement was observed between analytical and experimental values. The radiological consequence analysis of P ARR-I was also performed. Fission produce inventory of some important radioisotopes was calculated using standard computer code KORIGEN. The environmental impacts in case of design basis loss of coolant accident (LOCA) resulting in core melt down and release of fission product from reactor core to the containment building and eventually to atmosphere, after passing through various retention barriers, were analyzed. The atmospheric dispersion was modeled using a conservative, approach outlined in USNRC Regulatory Guide. The consequences were estimated in term of internal and external radiation doses to the workers and surrounding population. These dose estimates were then compared with the recommended dose limits given in 1 OCFRI 00 to determine the boundaries of exclusion and low population zones. The isotopic composition and decay characteristics of an irradiated fuel element of PARR-were studied. Computer code KORIGEN was used to calculate the concentrations of uranium and plutonium isotopes, radioactivity, decay heat and spontaneous fission neutron source as function of operating cycle, fuel burnup and cooling time. The amount of fissile plutonium produced during irradiation and its contribution to total fissions occurring in the system was assessed. The contribution of gamma and alpha+beta to the total decay heat as a function (cooling time was calculated. Similarly, the contribution of light elements, actinides an fission products to total activity and decay heat as a function of cooling time was also studied. The fission product decay heat was calculated by KORIGEN and compared with the obtained from ANS 5. 1 standard curves and other widely used semi-empirical correlations order to see how their predictions vary from each. other. The correlations used include Bors Wheeler formula or Way-Wigner type function, Casta-nedelik formula, SOTRAN code formula, Petterson-Schlitz Formula and EI-Wakilâ€™s Formula. Based on the preceding analyses, following conclusion are drawn: The PARR-I can safely be upgraded to IO MW without compromising the safety of the reactor; The P ARR- 2 is an inherently safe reactor and can be licensed to operate without an operator on the console desk. It is therefore considered suitable for commissioning in densely populated areas; The model developed for the steady state thermal hydraulic and accident analysis of P ARR- 2 are quit adequate; The theoretical predictions of FREECON are in good agreement with experimental measurements.

40|$|A simple {{conduction}} {{model with}} phase {{change has been}} developed for the transient analysis of a fuel pin based on average properties and lumped-parameter techniques. The transient behavior of fuel and cladding can be accurately described by simple analytical expressions that agree with conventional numerical approaches for under-cooling transient analysis. If it be assumed that the heat-transfer resistance between the fuel and cladding remains the same for both steady-state and transient periods, the phase-change problem for fuel and <b>cladding</b> <b>melting</b> can be significantly simplified. BY using the predetermined average overall heat-transfer coefficient across a fuel pin in the steady-state period, the average transient fuel and cladding temperatures can be formulated analytically.

40|$|A {{limited number}} of {{transient}} scenarios were calculated using a computer code suite and input modeling provided by the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) for the CANDU 3 design. Emphasis was placed on a large-break loss-of-coolant accident with delays in actuation of the two independent shutdown systems (shutdown rods and liquid poison injection). Although an extremely unlikely scenario, it was studied {{because of the potential}} consequences that would result from a positive void coefficient of reactivity.

Only small changes in the timing and consequences of the scenario result when several parameters, of potential importance to the progression of the accident, are varied.

Fuel and fuel-boundary conditions in an LMFBR subassembly following sodium voiding and dryout under loss-of-flow conditions are simulated in each F-series test. Simulation is achieved {{with a single}} fuel element surrounded by an annular nuclear-heated wall in a dry (no sodium) test capsule. The area inside the heated wall was selected to represent the area inside the perimeter of an LMFBR coolant channel. Test F 1 was conducted with an irradiated fuel element to investigate the effect of fission gas on fuel motion at design power levels following <b>cladding</b> <b>melting</b> and drainage. The principal conclusion from Test F 1 is that fission products retarded, but did not prevent, eventual fuel collapse.

40|$|Test L 5 {{simulated}} {{a hypothetical}} loss-of-flow accident in an LMFBR using three (plutonium, uranium) dioxide fuel {{elements of the}} FTR type. The test elements were irradiated before TREAT Test L 5 in the General Electric Test Reactor to 8 at. % burnup at about 40 kW/m. The pre-irradiation in GETR caused a fuel-restructuring range characteristic of moderate-power structure relative to the FTR. The test transient was devised so that a power burst would be initiated at incipient <b>cladding</b> <b>melting</b> after the loss of flow. The test simulation corresponds to a scenario for FTR in which fuel in high-power-structure subassemblies slump, resulting in a power excursion. The remaining subassemblies are subjected to this power burst. Test L 5 addressed the fuel-motion behavior of the subassemblies in this latter category. Data from test-vehicle sensors, hodoscope, and post-mortem examinations were used to construct {{the sequence of events}} within the test zone. From these observations, the fuel underwent a predominantly dispersive event just after reaching a peak power six times nominal at, or after, scram. The fuel motion was apparently driven by the release of entrained fission-product gases, since fuel vapor pressure was deliberately kept below significant levels for the transient. The test remains show a wide range of microstructural evolution, depending on the extent of heat deposition along the active fuel column. Extensive fuel swelling was also observed {{as a result of the}} lack of the cladding restraint. The results of the thermal-hydraulic calculations with the SAS 3 A code agreed qualitatively with the postmortem results with respect to the extent of the melting and the dispersal of cladding and fuel. However, the calculated times of certain events did not agree with the observed times...|$|R

40|$|Use of {{appropriate}} modes of heat transfer in finite element modelling simulations of laser cladding and powder deposition {{is important for}} enhancing {{the reliability of the}} predicted results. An important contributory mode is melt pool convection, whose influence on residual stress generated during laser cladding process is the focus of this work. In this paper, an anisotropic enhanced thermal conductivity approach is used to analyse the three-dimensional thermo-structural characteristics of laser cladding and powder deposition of Inconel 718 on EN- 43 A mild steel substrate using finite element techniques. Compared with experimentally measured values, the results of the analysis indicated an over prediction in melt pool profile and size as well as higher peak temperatures from ignoring melt pool convection effect in finite element modelling of the process. With claims relating to the short nature of the duration for the solidification of a deposited <b>clad,</b> ignoring <b>melt</b> pool convection continues to be a common practice in modelling investigations of the laser cladding and powder deposition process.

The beam trip itself is of interest for investigating fuel temperature changes.

25|$|During a meltdown, the {{temperature}} of the fuel rods increases and they can deform, in the case of Zircaloy cladding, above 700–900°C (1,292-1,652 °F). If the reactor pressure is low, the pressure inside the fuel rods ruptures the control rod cladding. High-pressure conditions push the cladding onto the fuel pellets, promoting formation of uranium dioxide–zirconium eutectic with a melting point of 1200–1400°C (2,192-2,552 °F). An exothermic reaction occurs between steam and zirconium, which may produce enough heat to be self-sustaining without the contribution of decay heat from radioactivity. Hydrogen is released in an amount of about 0.5m3 (17.65 cu. ft.) of hydrogen (at normal temperature/pressure) per kilogram of zircaloy oxidized. Hydrogen embrittlement may also occur in the reactor materials and volatile fission products can be released from damaged fuel rods. Between 1300 and 1500°C (2,372-2,732 °F), the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods melts, together with the evaporation of control rod cladding.

Of the four tests, fuel failures were observed in the two tests that experienced the maximum energy depositions of 188 and 212 cal/g, respectively. However, the fuel failures were not observed at {{the place of a}} maximum energy deposition but at the position where the thermocouples were installed; one failed at the position whose local energy deposition was 150 cal/g, and the other one at the place with energy deposition of 170 cal/g. The fuel failures seem to have occurred because excessive pressure, which was caused by the partial melting of the fuel meat, was applied to the cladding with a reduced thickness. However, other parts of the fuel rods including the place of a maximum energy deposition maintained their integrity and a big change in the temperature and pressure in the internal capsule, which would be an indication of the fragmentation and dispersion of the fuel meat into the internal capsule, was not observed. Visual inspection also showed that, except for the thermocouple positions, there was no trace of clad failure such as the formation of brittle cracks in the <b>cladding</b> or <b>melting</b> of the <b>cladding.</b> Therefore, for the Zr based uranium metal fuel rods, it can be concluded that the threshold energy deposition above which fragmentation and dispersion of fuel meat into the primary coolant system is expected to occur could be higher than 212 cal/g. close 0...|$|R
5000|$|The 24-storey Grenfell Tower in Kensington, London was {{destroyed}} by fire in June 2017. The rapid spread of the fire was {{believed to have been}} caused by recent remedial work, which added flammable exterior cladding. The safety instructions advised residents to stay indoors in the event of the fire, which proved fatal as they assumed a fire could not spread via the block's exterior. A local residents organisation, Grenfell Action Group warned that fire safety was inadequate and had expressed concerns about a fatal incident before the fire occurred. The Grenfell Tower fire was one of many similar fires world wide where unsatisfactory cladding was a factor. Cladding can worsen a fire and enable a fire to spread fast if it is not done to satisfactory standards. The cladding can act as a chimney enabling the fire to spread upwards rapidly. Temperatures in a fire can be high enough to cause plastic <b>cladding</b> to <b>melt,</b> then molten plastic drips downwards burning as it falls and spreads the fire rapidly downwards. These fires happen in the cavity so it is frequently impossible to see from the outside or the inside how serious the fire is. Sprinklers and smoke detectors sometimes do not detect the fires. The Lakanal House fire where six people died was exacerbated by fibre composite cladding called trespa which resisted the fire less well than asbestos panels that the trespa replaced. An unnamed surveyor told, The Guardian, “We do a lot of investigations of defective buildings, and we regularly see deficiencies in the workmanship. Gaps are left where there shouldn’t be gaps, or a form of less fire-resistant insulation is used instead of a proper fire break. These things are done to cut costs and save time, but we must get tougher on inspection and ensure the people fitting these facades are properly trained. Otherwise there are thousands more people who could be at risk.” ...|$|R

Observations indicate that for pure Ni-alloy coating the laser parameters selected for good interface fusion {{have no effect on}} the microstructure of the BZ except for its thickness. However, the addition of ceramic particles (TiN, SiC, or ZrO 2) to the Ni alloy varies the compositional or constitutional undercooling of the melt near the solid/liquid interface and consequently leads to the observed changes of microstructure of the BZs. For TiN/Ni-alloy coating the morphology of gamma-Ni solid solution in the BZ changes from dendritic to planar form with increasing scanning speed.

40|$|In laser cladding, a material, {{usually in}} the form of powder, is {{deposited}} on a substrate. Powder particles are intermingled with inert gas and fed by a powder feeder system on the substrate. Laser is employed to melt the additive material and a small layer of surface of the substrate simultaneously. While the powder is being deposited, the laser melts the powder particles and the melted powder particles join the melt pool on the substrate beneath the laser beam. Generating relative motion between the laser focal point and the substrate will result in moving melt pool on the substrate. This will lead to addition of a desired material to the substrate with desired thickness and good bonding as well as minimum dilution. In addition, by producing clads beside and on the top of each other a functional component can be built in a layer by layer fashion. Despite many advantages of laser cladding, it is highly sensitive to internal and external disturbances. This makes a closed-loop control system for laser cladding inevitable. Utilizing a closed-loop control system in laser cladding makes the system insensitive to external and internal disturbances. Having a closed-loop control system for laser cladding would contribute to substantial improvement in clad quality and cost reduction. Feedback sensor is an essential part in a closed-loop control system. Among different parameters that can be used as feedback signals in a closed-loop control of laser <b>cladding,</b> <b>melt</b> pool geometry and in particular clad height is of great importance specifically for the purpose of rapid prototyping. This thesis presents novel algorithms for real-time detection of clad height in laser cladding. This is accomplished by the following: Tackling the issues pertinent to image acquisition in the presence of harsh and intensive light is scrutinized. Important parameters of digital cameras related to selection of proper type of CCD cameras in order to overcome the existent harsh condition are presented. Also, the existent light in laser cladding arisen from different sources is analyzed and based upon that proper bandpass filters and neutral filters are selected. All these lead to capture relatively sharp and clear images of the melt pool. Capturing good quality pictures potentially would provide valuable information about the process. This information could include, but is not limited to, melt pool geometry (i. e., melt pool height, width, melt pool profile, and wet angle), angle of solidification, melt pool temperature, and melt pool temperature distribution. Furthermore, the issues regarding path dependency of the melt pool image are addressed by using a trinocular cameras configuration. By utilizing this, always two cameras monitor {{the front end of the}} melt pool regardless of the direction of the clad. Image analysis of the grabbed images is also discussed. Image thresholding is one of the most formidable tasks in image processing and this difficulty is intensified due to characteristics of the grabbed images of the melt pool (e. g., surrounding hazy area around the melt pool). Applying hard partitioning thresholding method did not lead to detec- tion of the melt pool accurately. As a result, fuzzy thresholding by minimizing of the measure of fuzziness is developed and its performance is investigated. The effect of three important membership functions, triangular, Gaussian, and generalized Bell on the performance of the thresholding method is investigated. Also, Image thresholding by utilizing fuzzy c-means clustering is developed. Applying the developed thresholding methods show promising results. Among the developed thresholding methods, fuzzy thresholding with minimizing the measure of fuzziness with Gaussian membership function is selected for the implementation in the algorithm. Finally, Image feature tracking module is presented. The detected borders of the melt pool images are transformed from image plane to the world plane by using a perspective transformation. Four features of the elliptical features of the projected melt pool borders are selected. These four features along with the angle of tangential path vector with respect to the corresponding right hand side camera's axis are fed into an Elman recurrent neural network. The proposed algorithms and the trained neural network are utilized in the process resulting in acceptable detection of the clad height in deposition of straight clads for a specific direction. It is concluded that the system can detect the clad height with about ± 0. 15 mm maximum error...|$|R
40|$|Two laser surface {{engineering}} techniques, Laser <b>Cladding</b> and Laser <b>Melt</b> Injection (LMI), {{were used to}} prepare three different metal matrix composite layers with a thickness of about 1 mm and approximately 25 - 30 % volume fraction of ceramic particles. SiC/Al- 8 Si, WC/Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and TiB 2 /Ti- 6 Al- 4 V layers were prepared by a Laser Melt Injection process, whereby additional material {{in the form of}} ceramic particles is injected into the molten substrate. As a result, a microstructure characterized by hard ceramic particles distributed in a metal matrix with very strong bonding is formed in the surface layer of the treated metal. A TiB/Ti- 6 Al- 4 V metal matrix composite layer was produced on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrates by conventional laser cladding. A mixture of TiB 2 /Ti powders {{has been used as a}} precursor to obtain two microstructurally distinct layers, namely eutectic and primary TiB particles dispersed in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V matrix. Sliding wear properties of these metal matrix composites layers were studied at boundary lubrication conditions and compared with the wear of the substrate materials. The observed wear mechanisms are summarized and related to detailed microstructural observations. The layers have been found to show excellent interfacial bonding, coupled with dramatically improved tribological properties expressed through a relative wear resistance value ranging from 30 to 1500.

40|$|In high {{pressure}} die casting (HPDC) cooling time greatly affects the total cycle time. As thermal conductivity is the main governing factor, a higher thermal conductive die material allows faster extraction of heat from the casting, thus resulting in shorter cycle time and higher productivity. This thesis presents a novel approach to replace a conventional steel die by a bi-metallic die made of copper alloy in which the cavity surface is coated with a protective layer of tool steel using laser based additive manufacturing technology, Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) for {{high pressure}} die casting application. Results obtained from the finite element heat transfer analysis showed that bi-metallic die offered superior thermal performance compared with monolithic steel die. However, the main challenge lies in the deposition of tool steel on copper alloy due to the very different material properties of these two materials. Over the past decade, researchers have demonstrated interest in tribology and prototyping by the laser aided material deposition process. Laser aided DMD enables formation of a uniform <b>clad</b> by <b>melting</b> the powder onto a substrate material to form desired bimetallic component. Thus, the principal objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the feasibility of deposition of a protective tool steel layer on copper alloy substrate material to form bi-metallic structure using DMD technology for HPDC tooling. Heat transfer analysis, process and material characterization, tooling fabrication and industry evaluation have been investigated in this research to attain the stated aim. The following outcomes have been achieved from this thesis in order to develop an effective bi-metallic tooling for HPDC industries- Reduction of cycle time by employing bi-metallic die compared to that of tool steel for improvements to productivity of existing processes in HPDC; Establishment of feasibility of the application of DMD technique to deposit protective tool steel clad on completely different material i. e. copper alloy substrate; Investigation of microstructural characteristics of the DMD deposited tool steel clad on copper alloy substrate; Evaluation of mechanical properties namely, bond strength and fracture toughness of the bi-metallic structure; Analysis of thermal fatigue behaviour of the bi-metallic structure under conditions analogous to high {{pressure die casting}} environment; and Fabrication and performance evaluation of bi-metallic core pin in a semiindustrial high pressure die casting machine. The outcomes of this research offer innovative technologies based on leading edge research in laser based rapid tooling development for enhancing productivity and reducing lead time in die casting industry. This research has the potential to directly impact multi-million dollar die-casting industry through improved process efficiency, reduced cycle time and lower cost of component processing...|$|R
40|$|The International Standard Problem (ISP) No. 45 {{is part of}} {{the overall}} ISP program of the OECD/NEA and is {{dedicated}} to the behavior of heat-up and delayed reflood of fuel elements in nuclear reactors. ISP- 45 is related to the out-of-pile bundle quench experiment QUENCH- 06, performed at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK), Germany, on December 13, 2000. Special attention was paid to hydrogen production. To assess the ability of severe accident codes to simulate processes during core heat-up and reflood at temperatures above 2000 K, the behavior of the bundle during the whole experiment should be calculated on the basis of experimental initial and boundary conditions, but without knowing further experimental details (blind phase). In the blind phase 21 participants from 15 nations contributed with 8 different code systems (ATHLET-CD, ICARE/CATHARE, IMPACT/SAMPSON, GENFLO, MAAP, MELCOR, SCDAPSIM, SCDAP- 3 D). After the end of the blind phase all measured data were made available and the participants were invited to deliver a second calculation, where this knowledge could be used (open phase). In this report, results of the blind calculations are presented, analyzed, and compared to experimental data. Additionally, post-test calculations using the in-house version SCDAP/RELAP 5 mod 3. 2. irs are used for comparison. During heat-up most results do not deviate significantly from one another, except as a consequence of some obvious user errors, so that a definition of a mainstream is justified. During quenching the lack of adequate hydraulic modeling becomes obvious: some participants could not match the observed cool-down rates, others had to use a very fine mesh to compensate code deficiencies. To overcome this insufficiency some newly developed reflood models were used in MAAP and MELCOR. In QUENCH- 06, the sufficiently thick oxide layers protected the <b>cladding</b> from <b>melting</b> and failure below 2200 K, so that no massive hydrogen release during reflood was found. This behavior could be simulated by most of the codes if no artificial shattering options were used. With respect to hydrogen production the mainstream shows a spreading of +/- 15 % prior to reflood initiation and a range of +/- 40 % after reflood. However, a group of SCDAPSIM users activated an extreme shattering option, which overestimates the produced hydrogen mass by a factor of 5. In the mainstream, most of the codes predict correctly that no bundle damage occurred, whereas others calculate slight material relocations, mainly due to overestimation of the cladding temperatures.

40|$|As part of {{a program}} to develop an {{economical}} fuel cycle for an Organic Moderated Reactor (OMR), experimental fuel elements are being irradiated in the Organic Moderated Reactor Experiment (OMRE). The first two experimental fuel elements {{have been removed from}} the OMRE, examined, and evaluated. These extended-surface, platetype fuel elements had finned aluminum cladding, metallurgically bonded to flat uranium alloy fuel plates. A 0. 0005 in. nickel layer was used to prevent interdiffusion between the aluminum and uranium. The fuel core alloys irradiated were U [...] 5. 5 % Mo and U [...] 3. 5 % Mo [...] 0. 5 % Si. These two experimental elements were removed from the reactor after one of the elements released fission products, and cladding temperatures increased on both fuel elements. The maximum measured cladding temperature was 780 deg F. The maximum fuel burnup was later determined to be 0. 25 at. % U. Hot-cell examination revealed that the coolant inlet ends of the fuel elements had filtered particulate matter out of the coolant, which blocked the ends of the coolant channels. Restriction of the coolant flow through the elements caused partial <b>melting</b> of the <b>cladding</b> in one fuel element and a blister on one of the fuel plates from the other fuel element. Dimensions were taken on three of the fuel plates. Metallographic sections from the blistered fuel plates were examined, and burnup profiles were determined for the three plates measured. The fuel had good dimensional stability, which is significant, since the <b>melted</b> <b>cladding</b> and the core microstructure evidenced temperatures substantially above the maximurn temperatures recorded by thermocouples. Nothing was observed that would indicate the fuel elements would not have functioned properly in the same coolant if the coolant were free of particulate matter of sizes that could be trapped.

40|$|Boron carbide {{is widely}} used as neutron {{absorbing}} control rod material in Western Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) and Russian RBMKs and VVERs and some Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR). During a hypothetical severe accident the B_ 4 C reacts with the surrounding stainless steel <b>cladding</b> forming eutectic <b>melts</b> at temperatures above 1200 C which is far below the melting temperatures of all components. The remaining uncovered absorber material {{as well as the}} B_ 4 C/metal mixtures may be exposed to the steam in the reactor core. The oxidation of boron carbide is highly exothermic and produces various gaseous reaction products like H_ 2, CO, CO_ 2 and CH_ 4 which may affect the fission product chemistry. Extensive test series were performed to study the oxidation behaviour of boron carbide at high temperatures. Four types of B_ 4 C specimens with quite different properties were investigated under various atmospheres in the temperature range between 800 and 1600 C. In contrast to most of the data published so far mainly at lower temperatures which are based on the evaluation of mass changes, gas production data were used to determine the oxidation kinetics of B_ 4 C in steam. The oxidation kinetics of boron carbide are determined by the formation of a liquid boron oxide barrier diffusion layer and its loss due to the reaction with surplus steam to form volatile boric acids and/or direct evaporation at temperatures above 1500 C. The overall reaction kinetics are paralinear. Under the conditions typical for severe accidents (high temperatures and steam flow rates) linear oxidation kinetics establishes soon after initiation of the oxidation.

40|$|Models were {{designed}} to resolve deficiencies in the SCDAP/RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 calculations of the configuration and integrity of hot, partially oxidized cladding. These models are expected to improve the calculations of several important aspects of fuel rod behavior. First, an improved mapping was established from a compilation of PIE results from severe fuel damage tests of the configuration of <b>melted</b> metallic <b>cladding</b> that is retained by an oxide layer. The improved mapping accounts for the relocation of <b>melted</b> <b>cladding</b> in the circumferential direction. Then, rules based on PIE results were established for calculating the effect of cladding that has relocated from above on the oxidation and integrity of the lower intact cladding upon which it solidifies. Next, three different methods were identified for calculating the extent of dissolution of the oxidic part of the cladding due to its contact with the metallic part. The extent of dissolution effects the stress and thus {{the integrity of the}} oxidic part of the cladding. Then, an empirical equation was presented for calculating the stress in the oxidic part of the cladding and evaluating its integrity based on this calculated stress. This empirical equation replaces the current criterion for loss of integrity which is based on temperature and extent of oxidation. Finally, a new rule based on theoretical and experimental results was established for identifying the regions of a fuel rod with oxidation of both the inside and outside surfaces of the cladding. The implementation of these models is expected to eliminate the tendency of the SCDAP/RELAP 5 code to overpredict the extent of oxidation of the upper part of fuel rods and to underpredict the extent of oxidation of the lower part of fuel rods and the part with a high concentration of relocated material.

40|$|Boron carbide (B 4 C) {{is widely}} used as an {{absorber}} material in many commercial reactors, such as boiling water reactors, Russian RBMKs and VVERs, later French pressurised water reactors, and in the European Pressurised Water Reactor. Under hypothetical severe accident conditions, B 4 C reacts with its surrounding stainless steel <b>cladding,</b> producing eutectic <b>melts</b> above 1200 °C; remaining bare B 4 C and B 4 C/metal mixtures are then exposed to steam and oxidize highly exothermically. As well as hydrogen, gases and aerosols containing boron and carbon compounds are produced, which affect the transport and deposition of radiologically important fission products such as iodine and caesium in the circuit, and subsequent behaviour in the containment. The influence of a B 4 C control rod on fuel bundle degradation and fission product release through to the late phase, material transport in the circuit and behaviour in the containment has been studied in the nuclear-heated integral experiment Phebus FPT 3 at Cadarache. Carbonaceous gas production was monitored, and evidence for substantial deposition of B-containing compounds in the circuit was gathered. The electrically-heated QUENCH- 09 test at Karlsruhe used similar bundle geometry and had similar but less severe test conditions, and included a water reflood phase. Extensive separate-effects tests on oxidation of B 4 C and its interaction with surrounding materials have also been performed at IRSN Cadarache (BECARRE/VERDI) and at Karlsruhe (BOX, LAVA, QUENCH-SR). This paper compares the phenomena involving B 4 C observed in these experiments, concentrating on degradation, transport and deposition behaviour. In particular, there is evidence concerning blockage formation in the hot leg of the FPT 3 circuit, which affects the transport of fission products, and this is supported by similar observations in the separate-effect tests. Possible explanations for the phenomena observed are advanced, and suggestions for further work to improve understanding are put forward. JRC. DDG. F. 5 -Safety of present nuclear reactor...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} the development of production methods and tools needed to achieve {{a high degree of}} reliability and integrity of laser cladded components manufactured at high production rate. These targets can be realized by understanding the laser/materials interactions during laser cladding. In order to accomplish these targets the correlations between process conditions, clad geometry, thermal distribution and residual stress were investigated through extensive experimental and numerical researches. Several approaches and steps were taken to identify the optimal process conditions to produce satisfactory clad layers with desired hardness and low residual stresses to avoid defects and cracking. Laser cladding experiments were designed to investigate the relations between processing parameters (laser power, cladding speed and powder feeding rate) and the resulting clad geometry (clad height/width) and dilution. The relations between the processing parameters, the resulting clad geometry and dilution were analysed using response surface methods (RSM), data split and analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods. It is worth mentioning that also with the aid of an optical spectrometer the minimum effective energy can be identified. The capability of monitoring and controlling the laser cladding process with an optical emission spectrometer was investigated. Based on understanding of the interactions between laser beam, powder stream and substrate, a 2 D numerical model of laser cladding was developed to simulate the clad formation and the heat transfer during laser <b>cladding.</b> The geometries, <b>melt</b> depth and depth of the heat affected zone (HAZ) of a single clad track and overlapped clad layer were computed together with their temperature distributions in COMSOL. An analytical solution was developed to calculate the residual stresses using the temperature data simulated from the developed 2 D model. The relations between the cooling rates, thermal gradients, maximum residual stresses and absorbed energy were investigated and the results are discussed.

40|$|Abstract The {{request for}} more {{efficient}} fuel economy to save {{raw materials and}} to reduce air pollution {{becomes more and more}} crucial in the automotive industry. To fulfil this demand by weight reduction, conventional materials such as steel and copper are replaced by light metals. Due to its beneficial material properties e. g. low density, high strength, good formability and high thermal conductivity, aluminium becomes a frequently used candidate. Particularly in the heat-exchanger industry this change has already taken place. Heat-exchangers made of aluminium brazing sheets are used in various applications e. g. climate control, engine and transmission cooling and charge air cooling. Brazing sheets consist of a multilayer alloy system. A typical material combination in this field is an Al-Mn core alloy (AA 3 xxx) clad on one or both sides with an Al-Si alloy (AA 4 xxx). The benefit for this combination is given by the difference in the melting points of the two alloys. During the brazing process (around 590 °C) the core alloy provides structural integrity while the low <b>melting</b> point <b>clad</b> alloy <b>melts</b> and flows to provide upon cooling metallic bonding between the various components of the heat-exchanger. Due to the various conditions that a heat-exchanger is exposed to during its service life such as heating and cooling cycles, salt water environment on the surface and mechanical loading, the corrosion performance is a crucial point since it might cause perforation of the material resulting in a complete failure of the system. In order to understand the corrosion behaviour of the brazing sheets, it is necessary to have a deeper look at the microstructure, which is mainly determined by the composition of the alloying elements and heat treatments. The addition of alloying elements such as copper and iron provides beneficial material properties e. g. strength, good formability and brazeability, but can also change the corrosion mechanism from pitting, which is the preferred attack in pure aluminium, to more aggressive forms of localized attack, like intergranular and exfoliation corrosion. Furthermore thermal treatments such as solution heat treatment, aging, homogenisation or brazing significantly change the microstructure and hence modify the corrosion behaviour. To fulfil the requested corrosion performance, which is usually performed by salt spray testing (SWAAT), it is often necessary to apply a pre-treatment on the heat-exchanger. Besides protecting the aluminium brazing sheet of corrosion attack, the pre-treatment has to contain environmental friendly and low costs components. After accelerated corrosion testing of AA 4045 / 3003 / 4045 brazing sheets by SWAAT and electrochemical techniques, the corrosion propagation was attributed to potential differences within the brazing sheet causing a galvanically driven perforation of the core material by the diffusion zone. Furthermore a correlation between the SWAAT and potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarization measurements is observed, offering a substitution of the SWAAT by these electrochemical techniques and hence reducing the testing time from several weeks (SWAAT) to less that one day. Corrosion prevention is achieved by immersing of the brazing sheets in an aqueous sodium silicate solution. The resulting silica passivation layer consists mainly of a dense SiO 2 network and provides a reduction of around 80 % of the corrosion propagation during SWAAT exposure. It is shown that the barrier properties are dependent on the respective pre-treatments conditions such as bath concentrations, curing times, curing temperatures and dipping times...|$|R
