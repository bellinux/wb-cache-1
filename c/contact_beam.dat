40|$|A microrectenna {{that would}} operate at a {{frequency}} of 2. 5 THz {{has been designed}} and partially fabricated. The circuit {{is intended to be}} a prototype of an extremely compact device {{that could be used to}} convert radio-beamed power to DC to drive microdevices (see Figure 1). The microrectenna (see Figure 2) circuit consists of an antenna, a diode rectifier and a DC output port. The antenna consists of a twin slot array in a conducting ground plane (denoted the antenna ground plane) over an enclosed quarter-wavelength-thick resonant cavity (denoted the reflecting ground plane). The circuit also contains a planar high-frequency low-parasitic Schottky-barrier diode, a low-impedance microstrip transmission line, capacitors, and <b>contact</b> <b>beam</b> leads. The entire 3 -D circuit is fabricated monolithically from a single GaAs wafer. The resonant cavity renders the slot radiation pattern unidirectional with a half-power beam width of about 65. A unique metal mesh on the rear of the wafer forms the backplate for the cavity but allows the GaAs to be wet etched from the rear surface of the twin slot antennas and ground plane. The beam leads protrude past the edge of the chip and are used both to mount the microrectenna and to make the DC electrical connection with external circuitry. The antenna ground plane and the components on top of it are formed on a 2 - m thick GaAs membrane that is grown in the initial wafer MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) process. The side walls of the antenna cavity are not metal coated and, hence, would cause some loss of power; however, the relatively high permittivity (epsilon= 13) of the GaAs keeps the cavity modes well confined, without the usual surface-wave losses associated with thick dielectric substrates. The Schottky-barrier diode has the usual submicron dimensions associated with THz operation and is formed in a mesa process above the antenna ground plane. The diode is connected at the midpoint of a microstrip transmission line, which is formed on 1 - m-thick SiO (permittivity of 5) laid down on top of the GaAs membrane. The twin slots are fed in phase by this structure. To prevent radio-frequency (RF) leakage past the slot antennas, low-loss capacitors are integrated into the microstrip transmission line at the edges of the slots. The DC current- carrying lines extend from the outer edges of the capacitors, widen approaching the edges of the chip, and continue past the edges of the chip to become the beam leads used in tacking down the devices. The structure provides a self-contained RF to DC converter that works in the THz range...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} better and more {{efficient}} computational methods to model the mechanics of contact has increasingly attracted the interest of researchers in this area {{over the last two}} decades. Contact problems [...] wherein two or more bodies meet through an interface [...] are extremely challenging from both mathematical and engineering points of view, because of the complex nonlinearities due to moving contact interfaces. Over the years, a significant effort has been devoted to address the resolution of continuum contact using the finite element method through several techniques including penetration functions, mortar methods, and domain decomposition. Nonetheless, a comparable effort to resolve <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> problems is still lacking in the current literature. 	Motivated by a number of deficiencies encountered in existing models for <b>beam</b> <b>contact,</b> this dissertation concerns the finite element modeling of <b>contact</b> among structural <b>beams</b> of zero thickness undergoing large deformations in space. The resulting methods and algorithms provide an unprecedented range of applicability in simulating not only contact of thin structural beams, but also collisions of cables (e. g., knot tying and surgical thread simulations), and dislocation dynamics, among others. 	The prevailing contact modeling techniques rely on a gap penetration constraint that is enforced by a penalty method to resolve overlapping between two or more <b>contacting</b> <b>beams.</b> Early attempts to resolve this problem, however, have displayed two major drawbacks: not only would the said constraint function be not extendable to planar <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> problems, but also it would break down when dealing with zero thickness structural elements (e. g., thin beams, cables, and ropes). It was also observed that the existing formulations are difficult to implement and, often, computationally inefficient. Moreover, the use of the penalty method, which dominates most of the existing literature available to date, leads to failures in preserving the exact resolution of contact and, sometimes, results in ill conditioned problems. Especially within a large scale system involving multiple contacting bodies, if the penalty approximation is too crude, then the simulations may predict non physical outcomes. 	In this dissertation, a robust approach that is based on a novel contact constraint is proposed. This approach allows a simple and unified treatment of possible <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> scenarios in two and three dimensional problems involving large deformations; and is based on a Lagrange multiplier method to exactly enforce the contact constraint across the interfaces between beam element pairs. Simply based on the calculation of an oriented volume/area, the proposed approach possesses the ability to resolve any contact scenario exactly and efficiently, while being relatively easy to implement and more widely applicable than the few <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> formulations available to date. 	The primary focus of this work is {{the inner workings of the}} novel <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> formulation proposed and, then, the delineation of the details of its numerical implementation in a finite element method setting. Application of the new approach is demonstrated through several benchmark problems, where specific consideration is given to the assessment of its robustness. The verification and assessment studies indicate that the proposed model can successfully resolve <b>beam</b> to <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> with high fidelity for a broad spectrum of scenarios, wherein existing methods usually fail. 	The lessons learned from this study may be applied to resolving line contact in a wide range of areas including structural mechanics, textile mechanics, and dislocation dynamics. They may serve as a useful tool for developing efficient and accurate numerical models to simulate anything from progressive collapse of structures under extreme event scenarios and crushing of foams, to modeling of knots or surgical threads, just to name a few. An incidental aim of this work has been to make the mechanics of <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> a more accessible topic of learning...|$|R

3000|$|It can be {{seen that}} the dynamic {{displacement}} of the beam during vibration always varies in each time step. Thus, the <b>contact</b> surface between <b>beam</b> and subgrade can occurs gap or opposite, which corresponds with two conditions of the contact. The gap appearing between the beam and subgrade is not bonded while in the opposite case the beam is bonded to the elastic foundation. Two-condition <b>contact</b> between the <b>beam</b> and elastic foundation can be expressed as follows: u_i([...] ξ,t) > 0 —unbonded case and u_i([...] ξ,t) < 0 —bonded case, and especially u_i([...] ξ,t) = 0 is lift-off point. It is clear from Eq. (10), the dynamic displacement function u_i([...] ξ,t) is expressed by power-three polynomial in the local coordinate, and thus it is only able to have maximum three lift-off points on the length of the beam element solved from equation u_i([...] ξ,t) = 0.

Detailed nonlinear dynamic behavior of this system is evaluated in our companion paper (Knudsen and Massih 2002 b). Computations show that the work-rate for asymmetric orbits is significantly higher than for symmetric orbits at or near the same frequency. For the vibro-impacting beam, under conditions that exhibit a stable attractor, calculation of work-rate allows us to predict the "lifetime" of the <b>contacting</b> <b>beam</b> due to fretting-wear damage by extending the stable branch and using the local gap between contacting surfaces as a control parameter.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a further step towards the full {{analysis}} of the complex behaviour of <b>contacting</b> <b>beams</b> in the coupled thermo-electro-mechanical field. Now we add to our previous work the coupling with the thermal field. The coupling between electric, mechanical and thermal fields is manifested in: dependence of material parameters on the temperature, frictional heating, heat generation by the electric current flow, dependence of the contact area on the temperature, dependence of thermal and electric fields on the change of the contact area and the contact point position. In the present preliminary analysis we take into account only the last aspect. We also consider the indirect influence of thermal contact on the mechanical field using the thermo-mechanical <b>beam</b> element. The <b>contact</b> constraints are enforced with the penalty method within the finite element technique. It is assumed that the heat flow in the contact area is unlimited {{which leads to the}} equalling of temperatures between two contacting bodies. This constraint is also introduced by the penalty method. The set of governing equations including the coupling is solved by the monolithic scheme. The problem is non-linear, hence the linearized version of equations is derived. The consistent linearization leading to the consistent tangent stiffness matrix and the corresponding residual vector is performed to apply efficiently the Newton-Raphson method and to ensure the quadratic convergence. Some numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency of the suggested approach...|$|R
40|$|Existing <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> {{formulations}} can {{be categorized}} in point contact models that consider a discrete contact force at the closest point of the <b>beams,</b> and line <b>contact</b> models that assume distributed contact forces. In this work, it will be shown that line contact formulations provide accurate and robust mechanical models {{in the range of}} small contact angles, whereas the computational efficiency considerably decreases with increasing contact angles. On the other hand, point contact formulations serve as sufficiently accurate and very efficient models in the regime of large contact angles, while they are not applicable for small contact angles as a consequence of non-unique closest point projections. In order to combine the advantages of these basic formulations, a novel all-angle <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> (ABC) formulation is developed that applies a point contact formulation for large contact angles and a recently developed line contact formulation for small contact angles, the two being smoothly connected by means of a variationally consistent model transition. Based on a stringent analysis, two different transition laws are investigated, optimal algorithmic parameters are suggested and conservation of energy and momentum is shown. All configuration-dependent quantities are consistently linearized, thus allowing for their application within implicit time integration schemes. Furthermore, a step size control of the nonlinear solution scheme that allows for large displacement increments per time step and an efficient two-stage contact search based on dynamically adapted search segments are proposed. A series of numerical test cases is analyzed in order to verify the accuracy and consistency of the proposed contact model transition regarding contact force distributions and conservation properties, but also for quantifying the efficiency gains as compared to standard <b>beam</b> <b>contact</b> formulations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose a finite element {{approach}} which simulates the mechanical behaviour of beam assemblies that are subject to large deformations and that develop contact-friction interactions. We focus on detecting and modeling contact-friction interactions within the assembly of <b>beams.</b> <b>Contact</b> between <b>beams</b> [...] or between parts of the same beam in the case of self-contact, is detected from intermediate geometries defined within proximity zones associating close parts of beam axes. The discretization of contact-friction interactions is performed on these intermediate geometries by means of contact elements, constituted of pairs of material particles which are predicted to enter into contact. A 3 D finite strain beam model is used to represent the behaviour of each beam. This model describes the kinematics of each beam cross-section using nine degrees of freedom, and is therefore able to represent plane deformations of these cross-sections. Algorithms are proposed to solve the global nonlinear problem using an implicit scheme, under quasi-static assumptions. Simulation results of the tightening and releasing of knots made on monofilament and multifilament yarns are shown as an application.

40|$|Publications {{in recent}} years have shown an {{interest}} for the modelling of contact-friction interactions. The study of the mechanical behaviour of fibrous materials such as cables, ropes or woven fabrics, for which interactions between elementary fibres can play an important role, may be a motivation for revisiting the taking into account of <b>contacts</b> between <b>beams.</b> The approach proposed in this paper has been developed {{in the context of the}} modelling of entangled media, in order to solve the mechanical equilibrium of fibre assemblies, using an implicit solution scheme. Fibres are represented by a 3 D beam model describing the kinematics of each cross-section by the means of three kinematical vector fields : the position vector for the center of the cross-section, and two directors for the cross-section, unconstrained regarding both their norms and orientations. This kinematical model, with nine degrees of freedom, allows to account for planar deformation of cross-sections. <b>Contact</b> interactions between <b>beams</b> are considered through discrete contact elements that associate pairs of material particles located on the surface of beams, that are predicted to come into contact. The principle for the construction of these contact elements corresponds to a discretization of the contact problem along intermediate geometries that are assumed to approximate the actual geometry of contact in each region where two parts of beams are close enough to likely come into contact. Proximity zones, associating two parts of beams which are stated to be close enough, are first coarsely determined within the assembly of fibres. The case of self-contact is simply considered by allowing to look for proximity zones within the same beam, provided the two close intervals are seperated by an exclusion distance criterion. For each proximity zone, an intermediate geometry aimed at approximating the contact geometry is defined as the average of the two close parts of <b>beams.</b> <b>Contact</b> elements are then generated at discrete locations on this intermediate geometry, using directions related to this geometry (planes orthogonal to the intermediate geometry) to determine particles candidate to contact.
