25|$|Finland classifies peat as a slowly {{renewing}} biomass fuel. Peat {{producers in}} Finland often claim that peat {{is a special}} form of biofuel because of the relatively fast retake rate of released CO2 if the bog is not forested for the following 100years. Also, agricultural and forestry-drained peat bogs actively release more CO2 annually than is released in peat energy production in Finland. The average regrowth rate of a single peat bog, however, is indeed slow, from 1,000 up to 5,000years. Furthermore, {{it is a common}} practice to forest used peat bogs instead of giving them a chance to renew. This leads to lower levels of <b>CO2</b> <b>storage</b> than the original peat bog.|$|E

50|$|This set of reactions, {{which of}} {{each has its}} own {{equilibrium}} coefficient, determines the form that inorganic carbon takes in the oceans. The coefficients, which have been determined empirically for ocean water, are themselves functions of temperature, pressure, and the presence of other ions (especially borate). In the ocean the equilibria strongly favor bicarbonate. Since this ion is three steps removed from atmospheric CO2, the level of inorganic carbon storage in the ocean does not have a proportion of unity to the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2. The factor for the ocean is about ten: that is, for a 10% increase in atmospheric <b>CO2,</b> oceanic <b>storage</b> (in equilibrium) increases by about 1%, with the exact factor dependent on local conditions.

40|$|Empirical thesis. Bibliography: leaves 52 - 53. Chapter 1. Introduction [...] Chapter 2. Experimental [...] Chapter 3. Results and discussion. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is an {{abundant}} greenhouse gas continually emitted {{into the atmosphere}} from both natural sources and anthropogenic sources including: fossil fuel combustion, fracking techniques, industrial materials production and land deforestation. Consequently, the natural carbon cycle is overridden leading to strong debates regarding global warming and climate change. The reduction of CO₂ to methane (CH₄), {{a process known as}} methanation, {{has been the subject of}} extensive study. However most approaches suffer from limitations including: use of sacrificial and expensive metal-based catalysts, high temperature and pressure requirements leading to incomplete reactions, resulting in CO and unreacted CO₂ products. Alternative approaches currently being suggested involve use of silane-based reducing reagents with Lewis acid type catalysts. Consequently this project focused on screening four silane-based reducing agents against B(C₆F₅) ₃, a B(C₆F₅) ₃/hindered amine tandem catalyst and B(C₆F₅) ₃ + tandem catalyst to determine the efficiencies of CH₄ formation and rates of reactions. Additionally, the continuous in situ regeneration of siloxane byproducts into silane reducing agents was investigated. The conversion of CO₂ to CH₄ holds significant potential for the chemical capture of <b>CO₂</b> and <b>storage</b> of hydrogen in the form of CH₄ which has many applications including: commercial power stations, petrochemical refining and natural gas.

25|$|Biochar (charcoal {{created by}} {{pyrolysis}} of biomass) {{is a potent}} form of longterm (thousands of years) biosequestration of atmosphereic CO2 derived from investigation of the extremely fertile Terra preta soils of the Amazon Basin. Placing biochar in soils also improves water quality, increases soil fertility, raises agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests. As a method of generating bio-energy with carbon storage Rob Flanagan and the EPRIDA biochar company have developed low-tech cooking stoves for developing nations that can burn agricultural wastes such as rice husks and produce 15% by weight of biochar; while BEST Energies in NSW Australia have spent a decade developing an Agrichar technology that can combust 96 tonnes of dry biomass each day, generating 30-40 tonnes of biochar. A parametric study of biosequestration by Malcolm Fowles at the Open University, indicated that to mitigate global warming, policies should encourage displacement of coal with biomass as a power source for baseload electricity generation if the latter’s conversion efficiency rose over 30%, otherwise biosequestering carbon from biomass as a cheaper mitigation option than geosequestration by <b>CO2</b> capture and <b>storage.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Various {{scrubbing}} processes {{have been}} proposed to remove CO2 from the air, or from flue gases. These usually involve using {{a variant of the}} Kraft process. Scrubbing processes may be based on sodium hydroxide. [...] The CO2 is absorbed into solution, transferred to lime via a process called causticization and released in a kiln. With some modifications to the existing processes, mainly an oxygen-fired kiln, the end result is a concentrated stream of <b>CO2</b> ready for <b>storage</b> or use in fuels. An alternative to this thermo-chemical process is an electrical one in which a nominal voltage is applied across the carbonate solution to release the CO2. While simpler, this electrical process consumes more energy as it splits water at the same time. Since it depends on electricity, the electricity needs to be renewable, like PV. Otherwise the CO2 produced during electricity production has to be taken into account. Early incarnations of air capture used electricity as the energy source; hence, were dependent on a carbon-free source. Thermal air capture systems use heat generated on-site, which reduces the inefficiencies associated with off-site electricity production, but of course it still needs a source of (carbon-free) heat. Concentrated solar power is an example of such a source.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Forest harvest {{can have}} {{significant}} impacts on forest ecosystems {{that may influence}} the capacity of soils to sequester carbon (C). The microbial community controls decomposition, which is a critical process in partitioning litter- and root-C between <b>CO₂</b> and <b>storage</b> in semi-permanent soil-C pools. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the effect of clear-cutting and stand age on: 1) temporal dynamics of soil microbial community (SMC) structure and physiological status; and 2) shifts among microbial functional groups in taking up ¹³C-labeled plant materials during decomposition. The experiment was conducted in Douglas-fir ecosystems within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, Washington. We chose stands of three different ages: old-growth where trees are between 300 and 500 years old; an 8 -year old stand; and a 25 -year old stand. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling and ¹³C-PLFA labeling techniques along with the ratio of saturated to monounsaturated PLFAs and the ratios of cyclopropyl PLFAs to their monoenoic precursors as microbial physiological stress markers were utilized. Microbial PLFA profiles showed that SMC structure and physiological status was most affected by season and secondarily by time since clear-cutting. Total microbial biomass and bacterial and fungal biomass were significantly reduced in CC 8 but not in CC 25 sites relative to old-growth sites. Total microbial biomass concentration was lowest and the stress indicators were highest in August, which corresponded to low soil moisture and high temperatures. The relative amount of ¹³C incorporated into PLFAs was also influenced by stand age and ¹³C source (¹³C-labeled litter vs. ¹³C-labeled root material). A significantly greater amount of ¹³C was incorporated in CC 8 samples compared to OG 1 samples in five out of the seven sample dates. Additionally, a significantly greater proportion of ¹³C was incorporated into soil samples containing the ¹³C-labeled litter material relative to samples containing ¹³C-labeled root material in four out of the seven dates. In general, 18 :lω 9 and 18 : 2 ω 6, 9 (common fungal biomarkers) had the greatest amount of ¹³C incorporation throughout the study period in both clear-cut and old-growth sites, indicating the important role of fungi in the decomposition of litter and root material and translocation of C within soil layers...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{increasingly}} being recognized by governments, industry, the scientific community, {{and the public}} as an issue that must be dealt with.

Renewable energy, energy efficiency, cleaner fuels, terrestrial CO₂ sequestration, and geologic <b>CO₂</b> capture and <b>storage</b> (CCS) are the major efforts underway. This thesis examines some major regulatory and political issues that may affect geologic sequestration projects in the future. CCS is a technology system that captures CO₂ from a point source (e. g. power plant or industrial facility), pressurizes it into liquid form, transports it, and finally injects it underground into a porous geology for long-term storage. Technical and economic issues of capture, transportation, and injection of CO₂ have been relatively well studied over the past decade. The impacts of how current environmental regulation and political action to curb climate change will affect CCS have not been thoroughly explored. This thesis investigates the Environmental Protection Agency's Underground Injection Control Program and several types of protected and restricted land use areas to evaluate {{where it would be}} difficult or impossible to site a CCS project. I also explore state-level action on climate change and categorize them based on their attractiveness for CCS projects.
