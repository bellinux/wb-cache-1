5|$|After {{departing from}} the bus, Peter goes off as Spider-Man to an armored truck, which Sandman is robbing. In their struggle, the truck {{goes out of}} control and lands in a {{construction}} site. When Spider-Man tries to web him up, it proves to be ineffective as Sandman <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> through them; the villain then starts to attack Spider-Man with girders. Meanwhile, at the soda shop, Harry tries to impress the jocks, catching Kenny's girlfriend Glory's attention. Kenny plays a prank on Harry, which enrages Glory and she asks Harry to take her home. Back on the construction site, Spider-Man gets out from the pile of girders and gets the head on Sandman. He lures him up to the roof and encasing him in cement from the nearby cement maker.|$|E
5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{concerns}} about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers hide their caches in inappropriate locations, such as electrical boxes, that may encourage risky behaviour, especially amongst children. Hides {{in these areas}} are discouraged, and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every particular cache is hidden, problematic hides <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting {{to search for a}} cache, and report any problems.|$|E

25|$|Safe sex {{commonly}} {{involves the}} use of condoms (also known as male condoms), but female condoms, which give women more control during the safe sex practice, may also be used; both condoms keep semen from coming in contact with the vagina, which can also help prevent unwanted pregnancy. There is, however, little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing STIs, and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy, which {{may be due to the}} female condom not fitting as tightly as the male condom or because it <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> into the vagina and spill semen.|$|E
25|$|A {{microsatellite}} is a {{tract of}} repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from 1–6 or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5–50 times. Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome. They {{have a higher}} mutation rate than other areas of DNA DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> while moving along the template strand and continue at the wrong nucleotide. DNA polymerase slippage {{is more likely to}} occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, slippage in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, slippage changes in repetitive DNA are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations {{in other parts of the}} genome. Most slippage results in a change of just one repeat unit, and slippage rates vary for different allele lengths and repeat unit sizes, and within different species. If there is a large size difference between individual alleles, then there may be increased instability during recombination at meiosis.|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the terms}} {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} condition include herniated disc, prolapsed disc, ruptured disc and slipped disc. Other phenomena that are closely related include disc protrusion, pinched nerves, sciatica, disc disease, disc degeneration, degenerative disc disease, and black disc. The popular term slipped disc is a misnomer, as the intervertebral discs are tightly sandwiched between two vertebrae to which they are attached, and cannot actually [...] "slip", or even get out of place. The disc is actually grown together with the adjacent vertebrae and can be squeezed, stretched and twisted, all in small degrees. It can also be torn, ripped, herniated, and degenerated, but it cannot [...] "slip". Some authors consider that the term [...] "slipped disc" [...] is harmful, as it leads to an incorrect idea of what has occurred and thus of the likely outcome. However, during growth, one vertebral body <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> relative to an adjacent vertebral body, a deformity called spondylolisthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Ruben, {{a learned}} and pious Sephardi Jew living in exile at the [...] "Socola Academy", has {{instructed}} his favorite pupil about [...] "metempsychosis" [...] and apport: [...] "you <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> {{into the lives}} of all the ones who led up to your life [...] into all the future lives caused by your present life"; [...] "you can go any place you want, although you cannot leave it void behind you. [...] there's no such thing as fully vacant space." [...] Simultaneous travel in spacetime, Ruben teaches, may only happen if one changes places with one's ancestors or descendants. Taking the Dionis experience as evidence that Ruben is right, Dan asks to be transported into an ideal universe, and is told by his master that such a place exists [...] "in your immortal soul". If Dan wishes to reach it, he is to read every seventh page of a spell book: each will take him to a new place, in no known order, and no location can be visited twice. After Dan leaves, book in hand, Ruben is revealed to have been possessed by Satan, who takes joy at having ensnared a pious monk: the book is in fact an instrument of perdition.|$|E
2500|$|Dentists {{and dental}} hygienists measure {{periodontal}} disease using a device called a periodontal probe. [...] This thin [...] "measuring stick" [...] is gently placed {{into the space}} between the gums and the teeth, and slipped below the gumline. [...] If the probe <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> more than [...] below the gumline, the patient is said to have a gingival pocket if no migration of the epithelial attachment has occurred or a periodontal pocket if apical migration has occurred. [...] This is somewhat of a misnomer, as any depth is, in essence, a pocket, which in turn is defined by its depth, i.e., a 2-mm pocket or a 6-mm pocket. [...] However, pockets are generally accepted as self-cleansable (at home, by the patient, with a toothbrush) if they are 3mm or less in depth. [...] This is important because if a pocket is deeper than 3mm around the tooth, at-home care will not be sufficient to cleanse the pocket, and professional care should be sought. [...] When the pocket depths reach [...] in depth, the hand instruments and cavitrons used by the dental professionals may not reach deeply enough into the pocket to clean out the microbial plaque that causes gingival inflammation. In such a situation, the bone or the gums around that tooth should be surgically altered or it will always have inflammation which will likely result in more bone loss around that tooth. [...] An additional way to stop the inflammation would be for the patient to receive subgingival antibiotics (such as minocycline) or undergo some form of gingival surgery to access the depths of the pockets and perhaps even change the pocket depths so they become 3mm or less in depth and can once again be properly cleaned by the patient at home with his or her toothbrush.|$|E

2500|$|Striped hyenas were hunted by Ancient Egyptian peasants {{for duty}} and {{amusement}} {{along with other}} animals that were a threat to crops and livestock. Algerian hunters historically considered the killing of striped hyenas as beneath their dignity, due to the animal's reputation for cowardice. A similar attitude was held by British sportsmen in British India. Although striped hyenas are capable of quickly killing a dog with a single bite, they usually feign death when escape from hunting dogs is impossible, and will remain in this state for long periods, even when badly bitten. On some rare occasions, hyenas were ridden down and speared by men on horseback. Although hyenas were generally not fast enough to outrun horses, they had the habit of doubling and turning frequently during chases, thus ensuring long pursuits. Generally though, hyenas were hunted more as pests than sporting quarries; their scavenging damages skulls, skins and other articles from hunter's camps, which made them unpopular among sportsmen. In the Soviet Union, hyena hunting was not specially organised. Most hyenas were caught incidentally in traps meant for other animals. Some hunters in southern Punjab, Kandahar and Quetta, catch striped hyenas to use them in hyena-baiting. The hyenas are pitted against specially trained dogs, and are restrained with ropes in order to pull {{them away from the}} dogs if necessary. In Kandahar, hunters locally called payloch (naked foot) hunt striped hyenas by entering their dens naked with a noose in hand. When the hyena is cornered {{at the end of its}} lair, the hunter murmurs the magic formula [...] "turn into dust, turn into stone," [...] which causes the animal to enter a hypnotic state of total submission, by which point the hunter <b>can</b> <b>slip</b> a noose over its forelegs and, finally, drag it out of the cave. A similar method was once practised by Mesopotamian Arab hunters, who would enter hyena dens and [...] "flatter" [...] the animal, which they believed could understand Arabic. The hunter would murmur [...] "You are very nice and pretty and quite like a lion indeed, you are a lion". The hyena would then allow the hunter to place a noose around its neck and pose no resistance on being dragged out of its lair.|$|E

50|$|A small {{percentage}} <b>slip</b> <b>can</b> {{result in a}} much larger percentage increase in rolling resistance. For example, for pneumatic tires, a 5% <b>slip</b> <b>can</b> translate into a 200% increase in rolling resistance. This is partly because the tractive force applied during this slip is many {{times greater than the}} rolling resistance force and thus much more power per unit velocity is being applied (recall power = force x velocity so that power per unit of velocity is just force). So just a {{small percentage}} increase in circumferential velocity due to <b>slip</b> <b>can</b> translate into a loss of traction power which may even exceed the power loss due to basic (ordinary) rolling resistance. For railroads, this effect may be even more pronounced due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels.|$|R
