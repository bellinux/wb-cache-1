40|$|The low Earth orbit (LEO) {{environment}} is commonly simulated using oxygen plasma ashers {{to determine the}} effects of LEO on spacecraft materials. However, plasma ashers can also contaminate samples during plasma exposure, making them less than ideal for space simulation. This study results from attempts to minimize or eliminate contamination. Optical methods of variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and reflectance spectrophotometry were used to quantify contaminant stoichiometry and deposition rate. Auger electron spectroscopy identified deposited contaminants and their surface coverage. Contamination results from etching of the rubber <b>chamber</b> <b>seals</b> by the plasma. The deposited contaminant was nearly indistinguishable from fully stoichiometric SiO 2. Contaminant deposition rates up to 0. 27 nm/min have been observed, and these layers effectively passivate the surface by depositing an overcoat of SiOx. Placing metal into the path of the plasma before it can reach the <b>chamber</b> <b>seals</b> greatly reduces contamination.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{investigated}} the compressive fracture strength and failure pattern in premolars submitted to endodontic treatment and internal bleaching with 37 % carbamide peroxide for 21 days, with application of different restorative procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six groups were employed (n = 10) : 1) non-bleached teeth and pulp <b>chamber</b> <b>sealed</b> with IRM; 2) bleached teeth and pulp <b>chamber</b> <b>sealed</b> with IRM; 3) bleached teeth and pulp chamber filled with light cured composite resin; 4) bleached teeth, root canals prepared at 10 mm, filling of the root canal and pulp chamber with IRM; 5) bleached teeth, root canals prepared at 10 mm, luting of prefabricated metallic post with zinc phosphate and pulp <b>chamber</b> <b>sealed</b> with composite resin; 6) bleached teeth, root canals prepared at 10 mm, luting of glass fiber post with resin cement and pulp <b>chamber</b> <b>sealed</b> with composite resin. After 24 -hour storage in distilled water, the specimens were submitted to compressive fracture strength testing in a universal testing machine. RESULTS: The following values were found: Group 1 - 56. 23 kgf; Group 2 - 48. 96 kgf; Group 3 - 53. 99 kgf; Group 4 - 45. 72 kgf; Group 5 - 54. 22 kgf; Group 6 - 60. 12 kgf. The analysis of variance did not reveal statistically significant difference between groups (p< 0. 05), suggesting that internal bleaching with 37 % carbamide peroxide did not weaken the dental tissues. The largest number of unfavorable fractures was observed for Groups 2 (50 %), 4 (40 %), and 5 (30 %). Group 6 exhibited the most favorable failure pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that internal bleaching with 37 % carbamide peroxide did not significantly weaken the teeth. Among the bleached teeth, those with temporary IRM restorations or metallic posts demonstrated the most unfavorable fracture pattern, whereas the most favorable fracture pattern occurred in teeth restored with composite resin and glass fiber posts...|$|R

40|$|Disruptions in tokamaks {{seem to be}} unavoidable. Consequences of {{disruptions}} are (i) {{high heat}} loads on plasma-facing components, (ii) large forces on the vacuum vessel, and (iii) the generation of runaway electron beams. In ITER, the thermal energy of the plasma needs to be evenly distributed on the first wall {{in order to prevent}} melting, forces from vertical displacement events have to be minimized, and the generation of runaway electrons suppressed. Massive gas injection using fast valves is a concept for disruption mitigation which is presently being explored in many tokamaks. Fast disruption mitigation valves based on an electromagnetic eddy current drive have been developed in Jülich since the 1990 s and models of various sizes have been built and are in operation in the TEXTOR, MAST, and JET tokamaks. A disruption mitigation valve for ITER is of necessity larger with an estimated injected gas volume of ∼ 20 kPa m 3 [7] for runaway electron suppression and all materials used have to be resistant to much higher levels of neutron and gamma radiation than in existing tokamaks. During the last 5 years, the concept for an ITER prototype disruption mitigation valve has been developed up to the stage that a fully functional valve could be built and tested. Special emphasis was given to the development and functional testing of some critical items: (i) the injection <b>chamber</b> <b>seal,</b> (ii) the piston seal, (iii) the eddy current drive, and (iv) a braking mechanism to avoid too fast closure of the valve, which could damage the injection <b>chamber</b> <b>seal.</b> The concept of the valve will be introduced and detailed solutions and testing results for the critical items presented...|$|E

30|$|A {{completely}} automated {{device for}} readout {{of the dynamic}} and static response of cantilevers in a physiological environment is presented. The device enabled the local injection of sub microliter volumes of sample with excellent repeatability. Reducing the sample volume from previously hundreds of μl [22, 41] to a few μl enables the ability to generate larger volumes of data from the same total sample volume and hence the conservation of precious samples. We investigated {{the effect of the}} <b>chamber</b> <b>seal</b> on the nanomechanical measurement with either a thin membrane or a conventional O-ring. Both sealing methods are valuable for all liquid experiments and create a 4  μl measurement chamber which requires approximately 10  μl of liquid for full exchange. A slow injection speed (2  μl/min) is recommended in static mode measurements to minimise hydrodynamic bending of the sensors. The complete automation of the device including laser focusing allows the greatest resolution possible from experiment to experiment and reduces error due to user interactions. A series of experiments demonstrating the response of the cantilevers to external stimuli (temperature, viscosity, density, flow rate) highlight the sensitivity of the device. The difficulty of deconvoluting unambiguously relevant biological events in measurements using a single nanomechanical sensor is highlighted when one considers any sample introduced to the sensor may have a slight variation in temperature/viscosity/refractive index to the buffer fluid. It also serves to emphasise the importance of the use of in situ reference cantilevers to decouple biologically relevant metrics from environmental effects in real-time as shown when cantilevers are used as specific biosensors.|$|E
