25|$|Some feedback, {{positive}} or negative, is unavoidable and often undesirable—introduced, for example, by parasitic elements, such as inherent capacitance between {{input and output}} of devices such as transistors, and <b>capacitive</b> <b>coupling</b> of external wiring. Excessive frequency-dependent positive feedback can produce parasitic oscillation and turn an amplifier into an oscillator.|$|E
25|$|In general, a {{capacitor}} {{is seen as}} a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an AC resistor. In many cases the capacitor is used as a decoupling capacitor to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground. Other applications use capacitors for <b>capacitive</b> <b>coupling</b> of AC signals; the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC resistance {{is as important as the}} capacitance value.|$|E
25|$|In a triode {{radio-frequency}} (RF) amplifier, if {{both the}} plate (anode) and grid {{are connected to}} resonant circuits tuned to the same frequency, stray <b>capacitive</b> <b>coupling</b> between the grid and the plate will cause the amplifier to go into oscillation if the stage gain {{is much more than}} unity. In early designs, dozens (in some cases over 100) low-gain triode stages had to be connected in cascade to make workable equipment, which drew enormous amounts of power in operation and required a team of maintenance engineers. The strategic value was so high, however, that the British Admiralty felt the high cost was justified.|$|E

30|$|Using our {{experiments}} we {{can conclude}} that {{the improvement of the}} frequency sensitivity is due to <b>capacitive</b> <b>coupled</b> open ended coaxial waveguide resonators. For the high saline regime (water-continuous and salinity > ∼ 3 %), better sensitivity (in amplitude change due to change in salinity) is obtained using the galvanic coupled coaxial waveguide resonator.|$|R
30|$|Our {{numerical}} experiments demonstrate, {{that the}} combination of a galvanic and <b>capacitive</b> <b>coupled</b> open ended coaxial waveguide resonators renders higher sensitivity to determine WLR and liquid thickness.

25|$|To {{improve the}} {{measured}} signal in Auger electron spectroscopy, the gate voltage is scanned in a linear ramp. An RC circuit serves to derive the second derivative, {{which is then}} amplified and digitized. To reduce the noise, multiple passes are summed up. The first derivative is very large due to the residual <b>capacitive</b> <b>coupling</b> between gate and the anode and may degrade {{the performance of the}} circuit. By applying a negative ramp to the screen this can be compensated. It is also possible to add a small sine to the gate. A high Q RLC circuit is tuned to the second harmonic to detect the second derivative.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps can be {{illuminated}} by means {{other than a}} proper electrical connection. These other methods, however, result in very dim or very short-lived illumination, and so are seen mostly in science demonstrations. Static electricity or a Van de Graaff generator will cause a lamp to flash momentarily as it discharges a high voltage capacitance. A Tesla coil will pass high-frequency current through the tube, and since it has a high voltage as well, the gases within the tube will ionize and emit light. <b>Capacitive</b> <b>coupling</b> with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity, depending on {{the intensity of the}} electrostatic field, as shown in the image on the right.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{grounded}} appliances {{have been}} designed with internal isolation {{to a degree that}} allowed the simple disconnection of ground by cheater plugs without apparent problem (a dangerous practice, since the safety of the resulting floating equipment relies on the insulation in its power transformer). Modern appliances however often include power entry modules which are designed with deliberate <b>capacitive</b> <b>coupling</b> between the AC power lines and chassis, to suppress electromagnetic interference. This results in a significant leakage current from the power lines to ground. If the ground is disconnected by a cheater plug or by accident, the resulting leakage current can cause mild shocks, even without any fault in the equipment. Even small leakage currents are a significant concern in medical settings, as the accidental disconnection of ground can introduce these currents into sensitive parts of the human body. As a result, medical power supplies are designed to have low capacitance.|$|E

A simplified diagram of argon excited states when two metastable and two resonance states are replaced with the uniform level.

2500|$|<b>Capacitive</b> <b>coupling</b> {{has only}} been used {{practically}} in a few low power applications, because the very high voltages on the electrodes required to transmit significant power can be hazardous, and can cause unpleasant side effects such as noxious ozone production. In addition, in contrast to magnetic fields, electric fields interact strongly with most materials, including the human body, due to dielectric polarization.

30|$|Experimentally we {{have found}} that using a pair of {{resonators}} as shown in Figure  2 (right), a better sensitivity in amplitude and frequency shift is achieved.
