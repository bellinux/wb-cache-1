5|$|In 1987, Canada {{selected}} the EH101 to replace their Sea Kings in anti-submarine warfare and {{search and rescue}} roles; the EH101's third engine and increased autonomy compared favorably against rivals such as the Sikorsky Seahawk, its range and de-icing capability were also seen as vital for North Atlantic operations. The fledgling EH101, of which up to 50 were on order to replace the Canadian Armed Forces's (CAF) Sea Kings, found itself subject to a wider political battle between the Conservative and Liberal parties, the latter viewing the aircraft as too costly. Critics attacked the EH101 purchase as excessive and unnecessary after the Cold War's end in the early 1990s. Wide-ranging cost estimates were presented by both proponents and opponents of the EH101 procurement, with opponents backing life extensions of Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King and Boeing Vertol CH-113 Labrador helicopter fleets. The EH101 controversy {{was seen as a}} factor in the 1993 Canadian federal election. The order was cancelled by the new Liberal government in 1993 resulting in a $470 million <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E

5000|$|While Levine was in Europe, Mabel Boll [...] "the Queen of Diamonds" [...] {{attempted}} to get Levine to fly her to America in the Columbia, {{which was in}} France following the record flight from New York.

Boll was invited to try an east-west flight from America, and she set out for New York by boat in January 1928.|$|E
50|$|The {{prosecution}} {{alleged that}} on 29 August 1999 a man living in Croydon telephoned Taeger's agency {{asking for the}} services of a prostitute. The defendant went to the address with a prostitute. But the client had changed his mind and claimed that he had not made a telephone call. The defendant insisted that a £50 <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee</b> be paid, and forced his way into the house, producing a knife and demanding payment. The client went upstairs and opened a safe, whereupon the defendant took some £4000 from it and ran from the house. This incident founded the first count of aggravated burglary in the indictment later preferred against the defendant. But his account of the incident was quite different. He said that he had been given the £50 fee without any threat and had taken nothing from the safe. But he said that after this incident he had reported the existence of the safe and its contents to Taeger in the presence of Sullivan.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2008, Fitness First took a club {{member to}} the Australian New South Wales (NSW) Supreme Court to recover a $200 <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee.</b> The court ruled {{in favour of}} Fitness First, {{although}} she {{could not afford to}} pay and was no longer able to use the gym on medical grounds. The patient explained her medical condition before signing up and was instructed to sign the contract. Fitness First sought action to ensure that gym contracts with clients were still legally valid even if the court were to find that the client did not understand what he or she had signed. Fitness First's victory on appeal overturned a prior decision against the company by the NSW Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal, which had found that a contract required a [...] "meeting of the minds, in that they each fully know and understand the terms and conditions of the agreement".

50|$|Edward Atkinson had {{a glorified}} view of steam {{and did not}} {{acknowledge}} the warnings when sales began to slow down in the mid-1920s. Leyland Motors Ltd sold their steam remnants to Atkinson in 1926, followed by Mann in 1929. There {{seems to have been}} various family rivalries at the time and the firm was undoubtedly in difficulties when Edward Atkinson decided to seek help from mine engineers and Pagefield lorry makers, Walker Brothers of Wigan. Under a new arrangement, Walkers manufactured Uniflow engines for Atkinsons, but by this time very few orders were forthcoming. Edward Atkinson had cancer and was unable to pay any dividends on the preference shares and finally abandoned wagon production in 1929 after a grand total of about 545 Atkinsons had been built. The final years were made possible by a <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee</b> from Manchester Co-op Society, which had ordered a hundred wagons. The Frenchwood and Freemason's Row factories closed {{with the end of the}} steamers, though the Kendal Street factory remained for repairing and servicing existing wagons. Edward Atkinson died in 1932 and a year later the firm he co-founded was acquired by London garage owner W. G. Allen, whose father had started Nightingale Garage. Allen was chairman of Atkinson Lorries (1933) Ltd and H. B. Fielding was managing director. Allen had effectively run the firm since 1931, and remained in charge until his death in 1949.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a single-sink {{transportation}} problem {{in which the}} production capacity of the suppliers and the demand of the single customer are stochastic. Shipments are performed by capacitated vehicles, which have to be booked in advance, before {{the realization of the}} production capacity and the demand. Once the production capacity and the demand are revealed, there is an option to cancel some of the booked vehicles against a <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee.</b> If the quantity shipped from the suppliers using the booked vehicles is not enough to satisfy the demand, the residual quantity is purchased from an external company. The problem is to determine the number of vehicles to book in order to minimize the total cost. We formulate a two-stage and a multistage stochastic mixed integer linear programming mod-els to solve this problem and test them on a real case provided by Italcementi, the primary Italian clinker producer and the 5 th largest cement producer in the world. We test the influence of dif-ferent scenario-tree structures on the solutions of the problem, as well as sensitivity of the results with respect to the <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee.</b> Key Words.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of pricing schemes in {{subscription}} services that consist of various combinations of activation, subscription, and cancellation fees. When customers exclusively consider what is directly perceivable, the activation fee starts low and increases as the network grows (penetration strategy), whereas the <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee</b> starts high and decreases as the network grows (skimming strategy). The activation and cancellation fees take various other forms otherwise. The subscription fee remains low at the early stages and increases only when a reasonable number of subscribers is secured. Finally, the authors discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings. This paper investigates {{the use of}} pricing schemes in subscription services that consist of various combinations of activation, subscription, and cancellation fees as applied in certain industries. It is assumed that customer attrition limits the diffusion of the service, but may also generate revenues. The authors demonstrate that, {{depending on the size}} of the service network, and the industry and market characteristics, such as customer activation and maintenance costs and customer sensitivities to different pricing components, the monopolist may find it optimal to choose any of the following pricing schemes: activation, subscription and cancellation fees; subscription and cancellation fees; subscription and activation fees; activation and cancellation fees; and a single activation fee, and a single subscription fee. Using a parametric model, the authors further show that, regardless of the chosen pricing scheme, when customers disregard the effect of the <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee</b> at the subscription and the effect of the activation fee at the termination stage, the activation fee starts low and increases as the network grows (penetration strategy), whereas the <b>cancellation</b> <b>fee</b> starts high and decreases as the network grows (skimming strategy). The activation and cancellation fees can take various other forms when customers consider their full effects. The subscription fee remains very low at the early stages and starts increasing only when a reasonable number of subscribers is secured.
