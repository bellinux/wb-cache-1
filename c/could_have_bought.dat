In 2007, Rodríguez walked in only 1.8 percent of his plate appearances, the lowest {{percentage}} in the major leagues. On October 9, the Tigers announced that they were picking up the fifth-year, 13-million-dollar option on Rodríguez's contract, keeping him on the Tigers team through at least the 2008 season.

25|$|Another {{criticism}} is the claimed possibility of non-existent emission reductions being recorded under the Kyoto Protocol {{due to the}} surplus of allowances that some countries possess. For example, Russia had a surplus of allowances due to its economic collapse {{following the end of}} the Soviet Union. Other countries <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> these allowances from Russia, but this would not have reduced emissions. Rather, it would have been simply be a redistribution of emissions allowances. In practice, Kyoto Parties have as yet chosen not to buy these surplus allowances.|$|E
25|$|Under the Northern Rhodesian settlement, {{the company}} dropped its claim for {{reimbursement}} of a £l.6 million administrative deficit: in return the British Government {{agreed to give}} the BSAC half the net revenue from certain rents and land sales and recognised (or appeared to recognise) the company {{as the owner of}} Northern Rhodesia's mineral rights in perpetuity. The British Government <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> out these rights by paying BSAC £l.6 million to meet its reimbursement claim, but declined to make the money available. This agreement was criticised then and later time by both African and European inhabitants of the territory. The elected unofficial members of the Legislative Council pressed for the royalties issue to be referred to the Privy Council, as the BSAC’s title to unalienated land in Southern Rhodesia had been. Instead, for forty years up to Zambian independence, successive British Governments recognised the BSAC as owner of all underground minerals in Northern Rhodesia, and compelled anyone mining them to pay royalties to the company.|$|E

500|$|As soon as {{the tour}} was {{announced}} {{and in order to}} assure tickets were not over-priced, five cities were used as a [...] "test". The result was promising as a minimum of 7,000 tickets sold per city. Such results could be due to the [...] "huge success" [...] of [...] "Locked out of Heaven" [...] and the Grammy performance. Despite the fact that these two factors could spike sales, in Mars' case [...] "everything was very consistent". Eventually, most of the dates were sold out in North America. This high demand led to an announcement of more dates in several cities despite having chosen 44 dates to begin with, which according to Marx is [...] "ambitious" [...] since tours that go above 24 dates can result in a drop in sales. There were three main factors involved in scheduling dates: research of the market, optimism on what they thought they could sell and how they opened up the arenas. A second date in Chicago, could have been done, however they booked a date in Minneapolis, which culminated in a sold out show. In Los Angeles (L.A.), some shows had coincident dates with the Jay Z and Justin Timberlake concerts. Furthermore, the tickets for Mars' show were only available one week after the Jay Z/Justin Timberlake went on sale. Nevertheless, after the first sold out date in the city, a second date was scheduled and immediately sold out as well. Marx said that more dates could have been sold out in L.A, since they left at least 20,000 people in a [...] "virtual waiting room" [...] who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> tickets. All in all, and according to Marx, the team at WME was pleased with having sold 30,000 tickets, and decided to stop there.|$|E

2500|$|The natural rate of rent {{is related}} to his {{theories}} on usury. At the time, many religious writers still condemned the charging of interest as sinful. Petty also involved himself in the debate on usury and interest rates, regarding the phenomenon {{as a reward for}} forbearance {{on the part of the}} lender. Incorporating his theories of value, he asserted that, with perfect security, the rate of interest should equal the rent for land that the principal <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> – again, a precocious insight into what would later become general equilibrium findings. Where security was more 'casual', the return should be greater – a return for risk. Having established the justification for usury itself, that of forbearance, he then shows his Hobbesian qualities, arguing against any government regulation of the interest rate, pointing to the 'vanity and fruitlessness of making civil positive laws against the laws of nature' ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{delayed by}} 23 minutes {{by a short}} {{thunderstorm}} and bounced by Lindwall and Miller Len Hutton (76) and Cyril Washbrook (30) made their third century stand - exactly 100 - to match the record of Hobbs and Sutcliffe in 1924-25. They looked set to make more, but Washbrook was given out to a ball that Don Tallon scooped off the ground off Lindwall (2/60). Washbrook [...] "stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement". Tallon {{was known for his}} impetuous appealing - [...] "he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision", This caused another umpiring controversy, but Tallon maintained the appeal and Bradman backed him. The Australian reporter Ray Robinson wrote [...] "the hesitant umpire would have been wiser to have asked his square-leg colleague whether it carried to the gloves or was gathered on the half-volley". Washbrook told Hammond that the ball had gone into the ground and the England captain tried to locate a press photograph of the ball touching the ground to show the ABC. Bill Edrich made a solid 46, but wickets fell regularly to Ernie Toshack (4/76). Hammond with his last stroke in Australia hit the ball for a certain four until it was superbly taken by Lindwall, “Every time he missed or edged the ball he was out". England were 255/8 when Godfrey Evans joined Denis Compton, only 228 runs ahead and it was essential that they stayed together. Evans, who usually tried to run cheeky singles off almost every ball, spent a record 95 minutes before making a run. Bradman was ready to accept a second draw to ensure that he won the series, set defensive fields, wasted time and [...] "set his side a frightful example by taking minutes almost, to walk lazily after the ball and field it". Clif Cary thought this was his only mistake of the series, as he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>bought</b> the last two wickets for 40-50 runs with {{a day and a half}} to make the runs on a perfect pitch. Compton made his second century of the match at the other end and they added 85 for the ninth wicket, but Tallon missed a stumping off Evans on 282/8 and Lindwall thought Compton should have been stumped before he reached three figures. His hundred was hit off the last ball before lunch, but Hammond waited until the first ball after lunch before declaring at 340/8. This decision was much discussed and was thought to be unique, but the West Indies captain Jackie Grant had done this against England at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad in 1934-35. It wasted 10 minutes as the teams changed sides.|$|E
