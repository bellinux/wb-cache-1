40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal trade <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> {{decision}} in an extended economic ordering quantity (EOQ) framework that incorporates a default risk component. A principal-agent bilevel programming model with costs minimization objectives {{is set up}} to derive the incentive-compatible <b>credit</b> <b>term.</b> The supplier determines the <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> as the leader in the first level programming, by balancing her/his financing capacity with the retailer's default risk, order behavior and cost shifting. At the second level, the retailer makes decisions on ordering and payment time by reacting on the term offered by the supplier. A first order condition solution procedure is derived for the bilevel programming when <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> is confined within the practically feasible interval. Two key results are obtained - the condition to derive incentive-compatible <b>credit</b> <b>term,</b> and an equation system to derive threshold default risk criterion filtering retailers suitable for credit granting. Numerical experiments show that the capital cost of the supplier {{is the most important}} factor determining the <b>credit</b> <b>term.</b> Default risk acts like a filtering criterion for selecting retailers suitable for credit granting. Empirical evidence supporting our theoretical considerations is obtained by estimating three panel econometric models, using a dataset from China's listed companies.

40|$|We compare Longstaff and Schwartz (1995) (the LS model) and Merton (1974) using Eurodollar data. We {{show that}} both models are {{restrictive}} for money market securities due to modelling arrival time of default as a predictable process, which implies that <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure {{has to start}} from zero. The Merton model, on the other hand, does have some advantages over the LS model. For a currently solvent firm, the Merton model can generate a hump-shaped <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure that converges to a positive constant as time to maturity goes to infinity. In contrast, the LS model generates a hump-shaped credit structure that converges to zero. We estimate and test both models using observed Eurodollar <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structures in 1992. We find that the LS model {{is more difficult to}} estimate due to large number of parameters, complex model structures and intensive calculation requirements. We also find that N-shaped <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structures prevail in the Eurodollar market during 1992. N-shaped credi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We give a {{comprehensive}} review of <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure modeling methodologies. The conventional approach to modeling <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure is summarized and shown to be equivalent to a particular type of the reduced form credit risk model, the fractional recovery of market value approach. We argue that the corporate practice and market observations do not support this approach. The more appropriate assumption is the fractional recovery of par, which explicitly violates the strippable cash flow valuation assumption that is necessary for the conventional <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure definitions to hold. We formulate the survival-based valuation methodology and give alternative specifications for various <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structures that are consistent with market observations, and show how they can be empirically estimated from the observable prices. We rederive the credit triangle relationship by considering the replication of recovery swaps. We complete the exposition by presenting a consistent measure of CDS-Bond basis and demonstrate its relation to a static hedging strategy, which remains valid for non-par bonds and non-flat term structures of interest rates and credit risk. ...|$|R

25|$|Retailers {{must also}} plan for {{customer}} preferred payment modes– e.g., cash, credit, lay-by, Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require {{some type of}} handling and attract costs. If credit is to be offered, then <b>credit</b> <b>terms</b> {{will need to be}} determined. If lay-by is offered, then the retailer will need {{to take into account the}} storage and handling requirements. If cash is the dominant mode of payment, the retailer will need to consider small change requirements, the number of cash floats required, wages costs associated with handling large volumes of cash and the provision of secure storage for change floats. Large retailers, handling significant volumes of cash, may need to hire security service firms to carry the day's takings and deliver supplies of small change. A small, but increasing number of retailers are beginning to accept newer modes of payment including PayPal and Bitcoin. For example, Subway (US) recently announced that it would accept Bitcoin payments.|$|E

Concerns about asset reliability are increasing with the move to fair value accounting in general purpose financial reports. We provide pertinent evidence from credit markets. A key benefit of using credit market data to explore the capital market implications of asset reliability is the theoretical basis of Duffie and Lando (Econometrica 69 (3) : 633 – 664, 2001). They show that asset reliability (measurement) concerns should be concentrated in short-term credit spreads. Thus a focus on <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure can facilitate a cleaner identification {{of the impact of}} asset reliability on security prices. We find that asset reliability issues, attributable to SFAS 157 disclosures of Level 2 and, especially, Level 3 financial assets for a set of US financial institutions over the period of August 2007 to March 2009, are a significant determinant of short-term credit spreads and the shape of the general <b>credit</b> <b>term</b> structure.
