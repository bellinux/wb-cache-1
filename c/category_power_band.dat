50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>band</b> width: Since two-strokes {{are very}} {{dependent}} on wave dynamics, their <b>power</b> <b>bands</b> {{tend to be}} narrow. While struggling to get maximum power, care must always be taken {{to ensure that the}} power profile does not get too sharp and hard to control.|$|R
50|$|A narrow <b>power</b> <b>band</b> {{is often}} {{compensated}} {{for by a}} power-splitting device such as a clutch or torque converter to efficiently achieve {{a wide range of}} speeds. A continuously variable transmission can also avoid the issues of a narrow <b>power</b> <b>band</b> by keeping the engine running at an optimal speed.|$|R
50|$|For example, the 2013 Honda Accord LX {{produces}} 185 bhp at 6,400 rpm and 245 Nm {{of torque}} at 3,900 rpm. This {{results in a}} <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of 2,500 rpm. Relatively speaking, the <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of this engine is essentially 50% of the engine's operating range from idle to maximum power.|$|R

50|$|The {{band has}} been accused of being right-wing/nationalist, which the band itself denies, even though Gunther Theys also plays in the Oi! band Lion's Pride, which has often played {{together}} with various White <b>Power</b> <b>bands.</b> The split-DVD with Dutch White <b>Power</b> <b>band</b> Brigade M was indexed by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons in July 2009.|$|R

5000|$|The Zodiac Master {{goes after}} the Earth Signs, which include Dog, Ram, Ox and Dragon. The Shadow Dragon (Ling) attacks the Dog temple and manages {{to get the}} Dog <b>Power</b> <b>Band</b> and the Zodiac Master gets the Ram <b>Power</b> <b>Band.</b> They both go after the Ox as their next target, thus Ang must stop them, but the {{question}} is can the Zodiac Master really control all that power he is using? ...|$|R
5000|$|After writing [...] "I wanna chat" [...] as a soundtrack for Secret Story, Matt {{launched}} girl <b>power</b> <b>band</b> Hot.Chick.|$|R
50|$|Yin-Wi is {{captured}} by Ang and Ling's combined Dragon Fire power. As such, she forfeits her dark <b>power</b> <b>band.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Beautiful Sin is a European <b>power</b> metal <b>band.</b> They {{are heavily}} {{influenced}} by the popular <b>power</b> metal <b>band</b> Helloween.|$|R
50|$|The <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of an {{internal}} combustion engine or electric motor is the range of operating speeds under which the engine or motor is able to operate most efficiently. While engines and motors have a large range of operating speeds, the <b>power</b> <b>band</b> is usually a much smaller range of engine speed, only half or less of the total engine speed range (electric motors are an exception—see the section on electric motors below).|$|R
50|$|Turbochargers and superchargers {{are both}} {{engine-driven}} air compressors (exhaust-driven or mechanically driven, respectively) and provide {{varying levels of}} boost according to engine rpm, load etc. Quite often there is a <b>power</b> <b>band</b> within a given range of available boost pressure {{and it is an}} aid to performance driving to be aware of when that <b>power</b> <b>band</b> is being approached, in the same way a driver wants to be aware of engine rpm.|$|R
5000|$|Rajesh Anandan, SVP of Strategic Partnerships and UNICEF Ventures, {{stated that}} UNICEF Kid Power and its Kid <b>Power</b> <b>Band</b> product is {{essentially}} a digital extension of UNICEF’s Trick-or-Treat program, which had been started in 1950. Rajesh stated the following: “The Kid <b>Power</b> <b>Band</b> is more relevant in kids’ lives today. UNICEF is really focused on connecting kids to impact in a frictionless way. Both programs were created to harness (kids’) intrinsic desire to do good.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Specifically, <b>power</b> <b>band</b> is {{the range}} of [...] RPM around peak power output. The <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of an {{internal}} combustion gasoline automobile engine typically starts at midrange engine speeds (around 4,000 RPM) where maximum torque is produced, and ends close to the redline after reaching maximum power between 5,000 and 6,500 RPM. Diesel engines in cars and small trucks may develop maximum torque below 2,000 RPM with the power peak below 5,000 RPM.|$|R
50|$|The Sitar <b>Power</b> <b>band</b> is {{a direct}} out growth of Ashwin's early {{encounters}} with jazz musicians from the California Bay Area.|$|R
5000|$|The 1986 Honda 1.5 litre V6 [...] "RA168E" [...] engine {{installed}} in the 1988 McLaren MP4/4 Formula 1 racing car generated 750 bhp at 12,000 rpm and 664 Nm of torque at around 9,800 rpm. As a result, this engine had a <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of 2,200 rpm. The RA168E's minimum operating speed was 6,000 rpm. Relatively speaking, the <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of this engine was essentially 36% of the engine's operating range from idle to maximum power.|$|R
5000|$|The wider <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of the 250 SL {{resulted}} in noticeably improved performance, as the 230 SL engines rarely {{produced more than}} [...] in practice.|$|R
30|$|If power {{increases}} upon {{an energy}} harvest, all energy {{available at the}} beginning of the former constant <b>power</b> <b>band</b> has been consumed by this energy harvest.|$|R
50|$|A {{mechanical}} transmission with {{a selection of}} different gear ratios is designed to make satisfactory power available over {{the full range of}} vehicle speeds. The goal of the selection of gear ratios is to keep the engine operating in its <b>power</b> <b>band.</b> The narrower the band, the more gears are needed, closer together in ratio. By careful gear selection, an engine can be operated in its <b>power</b> <b>band,</b> throughout all vehicle speeds. Such use prevents the engine from labouring at low speeds, or exceeding recommended operating speeds.|$|R

5000|$|In 2009 Owen played guitar for {{the white}} <b>power</b> <b>band</b> Attack on their album Fade Away, though {{at the time he}} was unaware of their racist beliefs.|$|R
5000|$|... "Blood of My Enemies" [...] {{was covered}} by Italian <b>power</b> metal <b>band</b> <b>Power</b> Symphony, on their EP Futurepast.|$|R
50|$|Lovato {{was born}} in Blue Island, Illinois. He started his music career at age 13, playing drums for white <b>power</b> <b>band</b> Confederate Storm, for which he later apologized.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their own recordings, the duo served as Cat <b>Power's</b> <b>band</b> on her breakthrough album Moon Pix, as well as Will Oldham's band on the Western Music EP.|$|R
50|$|Wings of Forever is {{the debut}} {{album of the}} UK-based <b>power</b> metal <b>band</b> <b>Power</b> Quest, {{released}} in 7 May 2002.|$|R

50|$|UNICEF Kid Power has {{a number}} of {{partnerships}} and collaborations. On May 22, 2016, UNICEF Kid Power teamed up with Star Wars to create an exclusive Star Wars style Kid <b>Power</b> <b>Band.</b>|$|R
50|$|Close-ratio {{transmissions}} benefit {{passenger vehicles}} as well. The 2000 Honda S2000 produced 240 bhp at 8,300 rpm and 207 Nm of torque at 7,500 rpm, giving the S2000 a <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of 800 rpm, essentially 8% of the engine's operating speed range. Given the narrow <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of this engine, a close-ratio gearbox would be essential for maximum performance. The S2000's 6-speed transmission {{consisted of a}} 3.13:1 1st gear and 0.97:1 5th gear, resulting in the 1st gear ratio being 3.23 {{times that of the}} 5th gear ratio, vs 3.76 for the BMW 323i close-ratio transmission.|$|R
