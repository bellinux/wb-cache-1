40|$|Most {{conventional}} epidemic models assume contact-based contagion process. We {{depart from}} this assumption and study epidemic spreading process in networks caused by agents acting as <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> These agents traverse from origins to destinations following specific paths {{in a network}} and in the process, infecting the sites they travel across. We focus our work on the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model and use continuous-time Markov chain analysis to model the impact of such agent mobility induced contagion mechanics by {{taking into account the}} state transitions of each node individually, as oppose to most conventional epidemic approaches which usually consider the mean aggregated behavior of all nodes. Our approach makes one mean field approximation to reduce complexity from exponential to polynomial. We study both network-wide properties such as epidemic threshold as well as individual node vulnerability under such agent assisted infection spreading process. Furthermore, we provide a first order approximation on the agents’ vulnerability since infection is bi-directional. We compare our analysis of spreading process induced by agent mobility against contact-based epidemic model via a case study on London Underground network, the second busiest metro system in Europe, with real dataset recording commuters’ activities in the system. We highlight the key differences in the spreading patterns between the contact-based vs. agent assisted spreading models. Specifically, we show that our model predicts greater spreading radius than conventional contact-based model due to agents’ movements. Another interesting finding is that, in contrast to contact-based model where nodes located more centrally in a network are proportionally more prone to infection, our model shows no such strict correlation as in our model, nodes may not be highly susceptible even located {{at the heart of the}} network and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter infections pose an {{important}} {{public health problem}} for the Netherlands. Approximately 100, 000 cases of gastroenteritis occur annually as well as 60 cases of Guillain-Barr 5 syndrome and several thousands of cases of reactive arthritis. The associated costs are expected to exceed 100 million euro per year. Animals, including farm animals, wild animals and pets, {{are the most important}} reservoirs of Campylobacter. Food products and the environment including the residential environment undergo continuous contamination from these reservoirs. The relative importance of different reservoirs and exposure pathways in the epidemiology of human campylobacteriosis is unknown. Many studies have indicated chicken meat to be {{an important}} <b>carrier</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> while other risk factors are the consumption of pork and beef or raw milk, direct contact with animals, foreign travel and contaminated surface water. Drinking water is not an important source of infection in the Netherlands. Improved hygienic measures have led to a reduced prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks. However, in 2000, 35 % of all flocks were still contaminated and a sizeable decrease is not expected in the short term. Additional measures at later stages in the food chain are necessary, including canalisation of contaminated flocks (logistic slaughtering), decontamination of poultry meat and consumer education. There is little information on the quality of imported poultry products. Effective prevention of campylobacteriosis in humans will require more knowledge than currently available and research needs are identified. The complex epidemiology of campylobacteriosis and the limited available knowledge make reliable predictions of the expected results of interventions difficult and call for prudence when defining policy objectives. Effective intervention will require a carefully balanced set of measures. A risk assessment model of the contamination chains is recommended to structurally integrate the available knowledge, so that the effects of interventions and the accompanying uncertainty can be quantified. Integration of these models with economic models and policy analyses will provide an optimal basis for risk management decisions...|$|E

40|$|The Hawaiian {{honeycreeper}} (Drepanididae) {{faces the}} threat of extinction; this {{is believed to be}} due primarily to predation from alien animals, endemic avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) and climate change. A deterministic SI modelling approach is developed, incorporating these three factors and a metapopulation approach in conjunction with a quasi-equilibrium assumption to simplify the vector populations. This enables the qualitative study of the behaviour of the system. Numerical results suggest that although (partial) resistance to avian malaria may be advantageous for individual birds, allowing them to survive infection, this allows them to become <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and hence greatly increases the spread of this disease. Predation obviously reduces the life-expectancy of honeycreepers, but in turn this reduces the spread <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> from resistant carriers; therefore the population-level impact of predation is reduced. Various control strategies proposed in the literature are also considered and it is shown that predation control could either help or hinter, depending upon resistance of the honeycreeper species. Captive propagation or habitat restoration may be the best feasible solution to the loss of both heterogeneity within the population and the loss of the species as a whole...|$|R
40|$|When an {{infection}} spreads {{among members of}} a community, an individual's probability of becoming infected depends on both his susceptibility to the infection and exposure to the disease through contact with others. While one often has knowledge regarding an individual's susceptibility, in many cases, whether or not an individual's contacts are contagious and spreading the infection is unknown or latent. We propose a new generative model in which we model the neighbors' spreader states and the individuals' exposure states as latent variables. Combined with an individual's characteristics, we estimate the risk <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> {{as a function of}} both exposure and susceptibility. We propose a variational inference algorithm to learn the model parameters. Through a series of experiments on simulated data, we measure the ability of the proposed model to identify latent spreaders, estimate exposure as a function of one's spreading neighbors, and predict the risk <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Our work can be helpful in both identifying potential asymptomatic <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections,</b> and in identifying characteristics that are associated with an increased likelihood of being an undiagnosed source of contagion. by Maggie Makar.

40|$|There are no {{effective}} approaches to treatment {{and prevention of}} many infectious diseases representing a significant danger to humans. So far, mass vaccine immunization {{is among the most}} efficient and widely used approaches to prevent outbreaks of viral and bacterial infections. Mass immunization helps to reduce the number <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections,</b> thus significantly decreasing probability <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> dissemination. Recent promising developments include genetically engineered vaccines based on adenoviral vectors, many of which are already at various stages of clinical trials. Genetic immunization with recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines allows delivery of the genes encoding only required antigens to human cells, thus allowing avoidance of conventional vaccines, e. g., live pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and providing versatile technologies for vaccine development. These advances significantly reduce the time needed for vaccine production and, respectively, the development and creation of new vaccines, thus being an important factor in decreasing risk of epidemics and pandemics. Advantages of adenoviral vectors include high ability of penetration into human cells, a potential for induction of both humoral and cellular immune response, rather long and active production of antigens following administration of adenoviral vectors into the human, safe usage, ease of obtaining preparative quantities of vaccines. In this review, we provide information about the ongoing worldwide clinical trials of adenoviral vector-based vaccines against various infectious diseases, like as to consider selection parameters of volunteers participating in the testing, vaccination schedule, doses and methods of drug administration, results of completed experiments, and preliminary data on currently ongoing research...|$|R
40|$|Cattle {{infected}} with {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) {{appear to be a}} reservoir for transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) to humans. Although just over 100 people have developed clinical vCJD, millions have probably been exposed to the infectivity by consumption of BSE-infected beef. It is currently not known whether some of these individuals will develop disease themselves or act as asymptomatic <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> infectivity which might infect others in the future. We have studied agent persistence and adaptation after cross-species infection using a model of mice inoculated with hamster scrapie strain 263 K. Although mice inoculated with hamster scrapie do not develop clinical disease after inoculation with 10 million hamster infectious doses, hamster scrapie infectivity persists in brain and spleen for the life span of the mice. In the present study, we were surprised to find a 1 -year period postinfection with hamster scrapie where there was no evidence for replication of infectivity in mouse brain. In contrast, this period of inactive persistence was followed by a period of active replication of infectivity as well as adaptation of new strains of agent capable of causing disease in mice. In most mice, neither the early persistent phase nor the later replicative phase could be detected by immunoblot assay for protease-resistant prion protein (PrP). If similar asymptomatic <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> arise after exposure of humans or animals to BSE, this could markedly increase the danger of additional spread of BSE or vCJD infection by contaminated blood, surgical instruments, or meat.

40|$|Although the {{heterogeneity}} of malaria transmission {{has been known for}} many years, it has only recently become rec-ognized as having importance in the analysis of longitudinal studies [1]. As-sumptions of homogenous transmission (ie, that every participant in a given study is exposed to the same number of infectious bites) can lead to incorrect conclusions (eg, that placental malaria is a risk factor for childhood malaria or that parasitemia is protective against clinical malaria) [2 – 3]. In both these cases, associations have been confused with a causal pathway, and the outcomes have been confounded by the heteroge-neity of risk in malaria transmission. Persons living in an area of higher transmission are more likely to develop malaria again than are persons living outside that locality. In turn, after repeated attacks, these persons will de-velop immunity against clinical disease and become asymptomatic <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Infection itself is not the cause of the observed association, but rather exposure to repeated infections in the area of residence. In this issue of the Journal, 2 original articles have exam-ined the effects of heterogeneity in malaria transmission in great depth, using cohort studies to determine how best to consider variation in risk when analyzing studies. One, an observational cohort [4], and the other, a cohort in a vaccine study [5], use measurements of antibodies as their outcome measures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith declining {{transmission}} of malaria in several {{regions of the}} world and renewed interest in the elimination of malaria, strategies for malaria control using antimalarial drugs are being revisited. Drug-based strategies to reduce {{transmission of}} malaria need to target the asymptomatic <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> Drugs that are effective against gametocytes are few in number, but {{it may be possible to}} reduce gametocyte production by killing the asexual stages, for which more drugs are available. Drugs for use in large-scale programmes must be safe and tolerable. Strategies include improving access to treatment for malaria with an efficacious drug, intermittent-treatment programmes, and mass drug administration, with and without screening for malaria. Recent proposals have targeted high-risk groups for interventions. None of the strategies has been rigorously tested with appropriate control groups for comparison. Because of the lack of field evidence, modelling has been used. Models have shown, first, that for long-lasting effects, drug administration programmes should be linked with vector control, and second, that if elimination is the aim, programmes are likely to be more successful when applied to smaller populations of a few thousand or less. In order to sustain the gains following the scaling up of vector control and use of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), strategies that use antimalarials effectively need to be devised and evidence generated for the most cost-efficient way forward...|$|R

Patients and methods: Serum samples from 1045 individuals from 0 to 90 years of age were collected. The laboratory investigations by ELISA tests for IgG and IgA antibodies to Helicobacter pylori were performed at the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology Medical Faculty in Ljubljana. Patients were divided by decades into age groups, and by sex into male and female groups. Results: The prevalence of seropositivity increases with age; there is no difference between men and women. The mean seropositivity rate is 25. 1 % (95 % CI 23 – 28 %). The peak seropositivity rate is 54 % (95 % CI 40 – 69 %) in the age group 60 to 69 years. There are 9. 4 % positive participants in the age group 0 to 19 and 29. 6 % seropositive participants in the age group between 20 and 49 years. Conclusions: The Helicobacter pylori seropositivity rate has fallen dramatically in the last 15 years. There is still more than one quarter of population younger than 45 years infected, which is very important in deciding about the right therapeutic approach to that particular segment of our population. </p...|$|R

The disease is characterized by epididymitis, subfertility and infertility in rams. B. ovis occasionally results in abortion in ewes, as well. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate kinetic changes in the reproductive organs of rams experimentally infected with B. ovis. Nine rams were experimentally inoculated intrapreputially with 2 mL of a suspension containing 1. 2 × 109 CFU (colony-forming units) /mL of B. ovis (strain ATCC 25840). In addition, 50 μL of a suspension containing 1. 2 × 1010 CFU/mL of the same B. ovis strain was inoculated into each conjunctival sac, resulting in 3. 6 × 109 CFU total per ram. Six of nine infected rams had developed clinical changes in the tail of the epididymis at 30 days post-infection (dpi), but these changes regressed in 50 % of these rams. Ultrasound demonstrated an increase in the area of the tail of the epididymis (P< 0. 001), reduction in the area of the testes (P< 0. 001), and an increased length and width of the seminal vesicles (P< 0. 001) during the course <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> A sperm granuloma was diagnosed on the basis of ultrasonography findings. Microscopically, there was epididymitis, testicular degeneration, and seminal vesiculitis. Inflammatory cells were detected in the semen even before the development of epididymitis.

Domestic livestock act as intermediate hosts which are the main reservoir for the disease in humans. It is therefore very important to estimate the prevalence of hydatid cysts in slaughtered animals since it can be transmitted to humans through dogs, which act as the final host for the disease. From this point of view, the present study was suggested to determine the prevalence of hydatidosis in Sawakny sheep slaughtered in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. During the course of the study 12, 569 Sawakny sheep were inspected for hydatidosis infection. An overall prevalence of 1. 06 % was detected among the examined sheep, with the highest prevalence occurring in winter (1. 38 %) and lowest prevalence in summer (0. 67 %). Sheep aged 6 – 12  months had a higher rate <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> than older animals, and males were the predominant <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> (97. 7 %) compared to females (2. 3 %).

Although {{it is often difficult to}} separate hereditary influences from environmental ones, the high incidence of tuberculosis, leprosy, colds, 1 pneumonia, 2 poliomyelitis and espe-cially of rheumatic fever among persons of certain genetic groups seems to depend upon a combination of inherited susceptibility, environment and ex-posure to common sources or to each other. The following observation of a close succession of attacks of viral pneumonia among females in direct line of descendence seems to portray such an occurrence. The family group consisted of the grandparents, three daughters and their husbands, and four grandchildren as illustrated in the figure.

Treatment of infected rabbits with 2. 5 % oltrazuril (Baycox) at 25 ppm in water for 2 days was highly effective. The oocysts is appeared in the faeces on day 6 after treatment. No mortality was seen in treated rabbits while all the infected untreated rabbits died with {{in a period of}} 7 days. INTRODUCT ION Coccidiosis {{is considered to be a}} major problem in rabbits as mortality rate may go high particularly during and after rainy season (Gill and Ray, 1960). Adults which are usually symptomless <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> coccidial <b>infection</b> serve as potential source <b>of</b> severe <b>infection</b> with clinical signs resulting in to death of younger ones (Bull, 1958, Wang and Tsai, 1991).

40|$|Background In 2004, {{a revised}} action plan was developed, {{supported}} by the World Health Organization, to eliminate malaria from Saudi Arabia by preventing re‑introduction of malaria into regions since declared malaria free, eliminating foci of transmission in the Mecca and Medina areas and a concerted effort of foci surveillance and control, to eliminate malaria from the regions of Jazan and Aseer. This paper provides the context, activities, progress, and possible contributions toward malaria elimination in the Aseer region since 2000, with a more {{detailed analysis of the}} spatial location of locally acquired case incidence since 2012. Methods This is a descriptive study of all available Ministry of Health surveillance data and process reports since 2000, with higher spatial resolution analysis of data between 2012 and 2015. Results In 2000, there were 511 cases of Plasmodium falciparumlocally acquired infection. The following 4 years witnessed a dramatic decline in cases to only 18 locally acquired infections reported in 2005. A resurgence in local infections was reported in 2006 (93) and 2007 (165), thereafter (2008 – 2014) local cases continued to decline to fewer than 40 per year across the region. However, in 2015, a small rise was noted (51). All locally acquired infections were P. falciparum. There has been a constant flow <b>of</b> imported <b>infections</b> into Aseer since 2000, mostly among immigrant labour from Pakistan, India, Sudan, and Yemen. Imported infections have included both Plasmodium vivaxand P. falciparum. The spatial extent of malaria appears to be changing, but there remain two intractable areas Sarat Abeda and Dhran Aljanub, where risks per reporting centre have changed little since 2001, remaining above 0. 5 per 10, 000 population. Only seven villages contributed 55 % of all locally acquired infection since 2012. Discussion Aseer has reached a state of very low incidence <b>of</b> locally acquired <b>infections,</b> despite a constant source <b>of</b> imported <b>infections</b> from outside the country. How many <b>of</b> the local <b>infections</b> are F 2 generations from imported infections or how many are a result of residual active transmission between asymptomatic <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections</b> transmitted by pockets of existing Anopheles arabiensispopulations remains unknown. A more detailed investigation of the spatial and temporal patterns of infected hosts, parasites and vectors would help define whether this region has managed to effectively prevent local transmission of new infections</p...|$|R
40|$|Leptospirosis is {{a global}} {{zoonotic}} disease. The causative agent, pathogenic Leptospira species, survives in the renal tubules of chronically infected hosts, from where leptospires are shed via urine into the environment. <b>Infection</b> <b>of</b> new hosts can present as an array of acute and chronic disease processes reflecting variations in host-pathogen interactions. The present {{study was designed to}} reproduce the <b>carrier</b> phase <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in Rattus norvegicus, thus facilitating shedding of leptospires in urine. Leptospires shed in urine were collected for proteomic analysis because these organisms reflect a naturally virulent form of Leptospira associated with <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> new hosts. Experimentally infected rats remained clinically asymptomatic but shed leptospires in urine for several months at concentrations of up to 107 leptospires/ml of urine. Proteomic analysis of rat urine-isolated leptospires compared to in vitro-cultivated leptospires confirmed differential protein and antigen expression, as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Furthermore, while serum from chronically infected rats reacted with many antigens of in vitro-cultivated Leptospira, few antigens of rat urine-isolated Leptospira were reactive. Results confirm that differential protein expression by Leptospira during chronic infection facilitates its persistence {{in the presence of a}} specific host antibody response...|$|R
40|$|In {{the three}} years between November 1989 and October 1992, an {{outbreak}} of methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) affected 990 patients at a university hospital. The distribution of patients with carriage, colonization or infection was investigated prospectively. Nosocomial acquisition was confirmed in at least 928 patients, 525 of whom were identified from clinical specimens as being infected (n= 418) or colonized (n= 107) by MRSA. An additional 403 patients were identified from screening specimens, of whom 58 subsequently became infected and 18 colonized. Screening of the nose, throat and perineum detected 98 % <b>of</b> all <b>carriers.</b> <b>Of</b> the 580 <b>infections</b> in 476 patients, surgical wound, urinary tract and skin infections accounted for 58 % <b>of</b> the <b>infections.</b> <b>Of</b> the 476 infected patients, death was attributable to MRSA infection in 13 %. Colonization with MRSA was found in 127 patients and 42 % of 165 colonized sites were the skin. Auto-infection from nasal carriage or cross-infection, probably via staff hands, {{seemed to be the}} most common mode of acquisition <b>of</b> MRSA <b>infections...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ovine {{foot rot}} is an <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> {{the feet of}} sheep, mainly caused by Dichelobacter nodosus. In its virulent form, it is highly {{contagious}} and debilitating, causing significant losses {{in the form of}} decline in wool growth and quality and poor fertility. Current methods of treatment are ineffective in complete eradication. Effective antibiotic treatment of foot rot is hence necessary to ensure better outcomes during control phases by reduction in culling count and the possibility <b>of</b> <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> the <b>infection.</b> Using computational approaches, we have identified a set of 297 proteins that are essential to the D. nodosus and nonhomologous with sheep proteins. These proteins may be considered as potential vaccine candidates or drug targets for designing antibiotics against the bacterium. This core set of drug targets have been analyzed for pathway annotation to identify 67 proteins involved in unique bacterial pathways. Choke-point analysis on the drug targets identified 138 choke-point proteins, 29 involved in unique bacterial pathways. Subcellular localization was also predicted for each target to identify the ones that are membrane associated or secreted extracellularly. In addition, a total of 13 targets were identified that are common in at least 10 pathogenic bacterial species...|$|R
40|$|With {{improved}} HCV therapy, challenges regarding HCV diagnosis, such as seronegative window period, {{false positive}} readings, and differentiation between recent, chronic, and resolved <b>infections,</b> are <b>of</b> increasing importance. To address these challenges an innovative device—SMARTube HIV & HCV—was used. Blood samples were tested for anti-HCV antibodies {{before and after}} incubation in the SMARTube, which promotes the in vitro stimulation of in vivo HCV primed lymphocytes, thus enhancing levels of anti-HCV antibodies. Comparing antibody levels, in concordant samples before and after SMARTube, yielded the Stimulation Index (SI). Among 5888 fresh blood samples, from various populations and regions worldwide, 641 were seropositive using plasma, while SMARTube processing (yielding enriched plasma, termed SMARTplasma) enabled diagnosis <b>of</b> 10 additional <b>carriers</b> in high-risk cohorts, that is, earlier detection. Using SMARTplasma eliminated all false positive results, using the current assays. In addition we show that SI calculation may serve as an important tool for differentiating between those who recently seroconverted, <b>carriers</b> <b>of</b> long-term <b>infection,</b> {{and those who have}} cleared the virus. SMARTube and the SI could lead to better, more informative diagnosis <b>of</b> HCV <b>infections</b> and {{play an important role in}} changing the way we treat both the infected individuals and the epidemic as a whole...|$|R
