5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of food waste comes from its <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E
