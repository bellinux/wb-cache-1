In <b>{{constant}}</b> angular <b>velocity</b> (CAV) <b>recording,</b> in which the disk spins at a constant speed no matter where the data is written, the sectors closest to the spindle are packed tighter than the outer sectors and so require a slightly different timing to write the data in the most reliable way.
