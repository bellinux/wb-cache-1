5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use {{for any kind}} of advertising. Reproduction for corporate use was similarly prohibited and such infractions were classified as offenses against public property. The 2003 Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives prohibits the use of state seals or coats of arms in product branding so as not to mislead the public into thinking that a <b>commercial</b> <b>product</b> has been endorsed by a government organization.|$|E

Physicians at Columbia University would help to identify critical issues in the practice of medicine where the system's technology may be able to contribute, and physicians at the University of Maryland would work to identify the best way that a technology like Watson could interact with medical practitioners to provide the maximum assistance.|$|E

5|$|In the US {{the song}} was {{released}} as a radio-only single, and was therefore ineligible to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs. However, it peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay and number nine on the Hot Dance Club Songs charts. Author Fred Bronson noted it likely {{would have been the}} album's eighth top ten hit if a <b>commercial</b> <b>product</b> had been distributed. In Australia, the song received a commercial release, and peaked at number 94 on the ARIA Singles Chart in July 1991. Jackson has performed the song on two of her tours, the Rhythm Nation World Tour and on her State of the World Tour in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. They argue {{that the reason for}} developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a <b>commercial</b> <b>product,</b> nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2008, a new <b>commercial</b> <b>product,</b> EFi-X, was {{released}} {{that claims to}} allow full, simple booting off official Leopard install disks, and a subsequent install, without any patching required, but this is possibly a repackaging of Boot-132 technology in a USB-attached device. Rebel EFI is another <b>commercial</b> <b>product</b> that also seems to use Open Source software.|$|E
