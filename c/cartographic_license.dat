40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} stages of the map design process is that of assigning and positioning representative symbols on a map. This is achieved in most computer cartography systems by user selection of the symbols, followed by the positioning of those symbols on the features nominated. If the symbols interfere with each other at all, the user must intervene. This user intervention is most undesirable because the changes made may have undesirable repercussions {{for the rest of}} the map; thus the process of change can become iterative and therefore time consuming. The objective of the research reported here is to automate this element of the design stage. Where points or lines overlap with each other or with others of the same type, three possible solutions may be recognised: re-symbolisation, re-location, and generalisation. The main area of research to date has been in the development and implementation of algorithms that apply <b>cartographic</b> <b>license</b> (clarification of information by localised small movements of features). The simplest problem occurs when points are not confined by any other map feature. This paper illustrates the progressive complexity of algorithms required as the solution becomes constrained by the increasing proximity of other features and argues the need for a solution that optimally clarifys such local conflicts whilst 'blending' with the map as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated an increasing need for intelligent automated design. The contention of this project is that Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) techniques {{can be used to}} mimic the process of map design in cartography. A suitable environment for such a map system is considered. Attention is focused on methods for identifying and resolving conflicts that occur when spatial data are displayed using cartographic techniques. The research attempts to find a suitable mechanism for describing and identifying spatial conflicts and serves to focus attention on exactly what makes good map design. It appears that human judgement of design requires the understanding of the map as a whole and is based on geographical knowledge and an understanding of spatial processes. This is in addition to the knowledge of design and perception of maps. An appropriate method of description enables evaluation and assessment of the graphic. The potential spatial conflicts that can occur in a map, along with possible solutions for resolving those conflicts, are identified. Automated techniques were devised for identifying features in proximity and resolving those clusters by application of <b>cartographic</b> <b>license</b> (localized feature displacement). Following from this the knowledge governing the use of all generalization techniques is identified and explicitly itemized. A suitable taxonomy of rules is investigated and the knowledge implemented in a rule based system called CLARITY. The rules base contains over one hundred rules. The results and evaluation of the implementation, together with suggested further work conclude this project...|$|E
