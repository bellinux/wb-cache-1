Bomar and Wakefield enrolled at the school in the same class.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by former Denver Broncos head <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> Reeves, who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took {{the unusual step of}} lobbying for the job. After being rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma held a {{significant}} advantage in contests between the schools with the series record at 65–5–2. Iowa State had not won in Norman since 1990 and had dropped nine straight games to the Sooners. The Cyclones' head <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> McCarney was 0–5 against Oklahoma while Bob Stoops was 3–0 against Iowa State and 22–3 against {{teams from the}} North Division of the Big12.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium. Since {{there was not enough}} room to expand old Dudley Field at its site near Kirkland Hall, the Vanderbilt administrators {{purchased}} land adjacent to the present 25th Avenue South for the new facility. The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E
5|$|Handley {{served as}} coach for two mediocre seasons (1991–92), {{in which the}} Giants went from Super Bowl champions to a 6–10 record. He was fired {{following}} the 1992 season and replaced by former Denver Broncos <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> Reeves. In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor played out {{the last years of}} their career with steadily declining production. In 1993, however, the Giants experienced a resurgent season with Reeves at the helm, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers as members of a winning team.|$|E

5|$|The {{outlook for}} the {{upcoming}} 1915 Vanderbilt football season was not promising. The Commodores were coming off a losing record of 2–8, the first under head <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> McGugin, and the second in the school's 25 years of playing football. Additionally, only 10 experienced players {{from the previous year}} were returning to the team. Despite the one-platoon system with players featuring on offense, defense, and special teams used in 1915, this meant inexperienced freshmen would be a key to the team's success.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, various {{companies}} were established to research subjects and provide practice tests to teams. Two {{of the major}} ones were Acalon Cards and Exams and DemiDec, formed by former <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> Spetner and former Decathlete Daniel Berdichevsky, respectively. The two offer exams and study guides that can augment or replace USAD's official materials. USAD explicitly discouraged teams from ordering materials from third-party companies in the late 1998, though it later removed their discouragement from the curriculum page. USAD republished their discouragement {{just a few weeks}} after removing it, but did not publish such a warning in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Toledo {{finished}} their 1989 {{season with a}} record of six wins and five losses (6–5, 6–2 in MAC play) and tied for second place in the final conference standings. Although the Rockets finished the season with a winning record, on November 22, 1989, head <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> Simrell was fired by Toledo athletic director Al Bohl. By mid-December, the finalists were narrowed to Pete Cordelli (then the quarterback coach at Notre Dame) and Nick Saban (then the secondary coach for the Houston Oilers). On December 22, 1989, Bohl announced the Saban had been hired to replace Simrell as head coach at Toledo. The position was Saban's first as a head coach.|$|E

5|$|In Game 6, the Flyers lead 3–0 {{four minutes}} into the second period. Maxime Talbot fought Daniel Carcillo after the Flyers tallied their third goal and the Penguins, re-energized by Talbot's display, scored three goals in what {{remained}} of the second period to tie the game 3–3. Sergei Gonchar scored his first goal of the series, his first in 23playoff games dating back to game two of the Penguins' first-round series against Ottawa in 2008, to break the tie at 2:19 of the third period. Crosby added an empty-net goal and the Penguins eliminated the Flyers and advance to the Eastern Conference Semifinals.

5|$|When the Anteaters {{defeated}} the Washington Huskies men's basketball team on November 14, 2013, N'Diaye recorded a season-high 18 points. He also added 8 rebounds and 9 blocks. The game was also his first {{experience in the}} 2K Sports Classic. His blocked shots total broke the school's single-game record under the category. He recorded his first career double-double with Irvine on December 28, 2013 against Arizona State, with 12 points, 4 blocks, and a career-high 12 rebounds. In January, in a game at rival Long Beach State, <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> Monson told reporters that he believed his team was still afraid to attack the paint even when N'Diaye {{was sitting on the}} bench. In early February, N'Diaye broke the school's single-game block record {{for the second time in}} the season, totaling with 11 blocked shots and 10 rebounds against Long Beach State. N'Diaye also broke the conference's all-time record. It was his first career game in which he recorded a double-double without scoring over ten points.|$|E
5|$|Pittsburgh {{finished}} their homestand with a 6–1–1record, moving into fourth {{place in the}} Eastern Conference. The {{final game of the}} homestand was the most watched game of the season on FSN Pittsburgh, the Penguins regional television network.

The team collected over $100,000 for the families of three Pittsburgh Police officers who were killed days before the game. The Penguins {{finished their}} regular season on April 12 with a win over the Montreal Canadiens. Through his first 25games as Penguins' <b>coach,</b> <b>Dan</b> Blysma's 18–3–4 record amounted to 40points—the second-most of any coach in NHL history through their first 25games.

5|$|Tolliver was {{slated to}} compete with Tommy Maddox for the backup quarterback spot at Atlanta as {{training}} camp rolled around. Halfway through August, Maddox was released, and Tolliver was made the primary backup behind Chris Chandler. Tolliver played his first NFL game since 1994 on September 7, 1997 against the Carolina Panthers. He completed 7 of 17 passes for 79 yards. After relieving Chandler again the following week, Tolliver was slated to start the next game against the 49ers, in what became his only starting appearance of the season. He was slated to start again against the Denver Broncos, but instead came in late in the game. He was almost able to lead the Falcons to a comeback victory over the Broncos, completing six of nine passes for 85 yards and a touchdown, but he instead lost to the then-undefeated Broncos as the team remained winless. When Chandler went down with an injury in late October, <b>coach</b> <b>Dan</b> Reeves chose to start Tony Graziani. Shortly afterwards, Tolliver was released by the Falcons. In early November, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac was lost for the season due to a broken collarbone. As a result, the Chiefs signed Tolliver to a two-year contract as the third-string quarterback to replace him. Tolliver finished the season having completed 64 passes in 116 attempts for 677 yards, five touchdowns, and one interception. Only one of the 116 attempts came as a Kansas City quarterback. The 1998 preseason began with Tolliver competing with Pat Barnes for the third-string quarterback job, but this ended when Tolliver was released by the Chiefs in August.|$|E
