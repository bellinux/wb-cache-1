5|$|Geometric motifs are <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Price Building's stone cladding, {{especially}} {{over the}} first few levels. The building is topped by a more classical, specifically Châteauesque, steepled copper roof, the final composition showing Beaux-Arts influences. The main exterior decorative themes are pilasters topped with palm motifs, pinnacles and a large vaulted arch with extrados over the main entrance.|$|E

5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians {{fell back}} to the barracks and the chapel. Holes had been <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E
5|$|Highway 35, {{like many}} {{highways}} that begin at Lake Ontario and eventually cross into the Canadian Shield, began as several trails connecting settlements. Most {{of the southern}} portion of the highway follows various sidelines and concessions. Between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls, Highway 35 follows the former Fenelon Road, while north of there it follows The Cameron Road, a trail <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1850s between Fenelon and Minden. North of Minden, the highway generally follows The Bobcaygeon Road, a colonization road built {{as far north as}} Dwight in the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Jahangir's Quadrangle {{occupies}} the northeastern {{corner of the}} fort. Though named for Jahangir, construction on the site began in 1617 or 1618 {{during the reign of}} Akbar, but was completed in 1620 under Jahangir. Akbar's syncretic style is noted in the quadrangle, as it employs column brackets <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of animals. The quadrangle's layout differs from other Mughal quadrangles which are based upon the layout of a Persian paradise garden, and instead is formed by concentric rectangles with a fountain in its centre.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} cannon {{inscribed with}} a {{date of manufacture}} is a bronze cannon. It is dated to 1298 according to an inscription in the 'Phags-pa script. Outside of archaeological finds, appearances of the cannon in Chinese art may suggest that the cannon was invented {{as early as the}} 12th century. The oldest artistic representation of a cannon is a stone relief sculpture dated to 1128. The sculpture was discovered in 1985 <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls of Cave 149 of the Dazu Rock Carvings in Dazu, Chongqing.|$|E
5|$|The straight, {{symmetrical}} stone columns {{found in}} the Polonnaruwa Vatadage are quite similar to those seen in buildings of the Anuradhapura period. The foot of each column is <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of a lotus flower. Archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana has suggested that these stone columns had supported a wooden roof. This is widely accepted, and nails and roof tiles found in excavations seem to support this. However, another {{theory is that the}} Vatadage did not have a roof, and the stone columns were used to hang lamps, curtains or Buddhist symbols.|$|E
5|$|In 1606 Adam Mort {{bought the}} manor house and land in Astley. He was {{a wealthy man}} who built the first Astley Chapel as a chapel of ease for the parish church in Leigh. The chapel was consecrated in 1631, the year that he died. He built a grammar school that stood for over 200years until 1833, when it was {{demolished}} and rebuilt. Adam Mort's grandson, also Adam, rebuilt Damhouse in 1650 and his initials are <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plaque over the front door. The stone and timber structure was named from the stream which was dammed to supply water to a waterwheel powering a corn mill near the house. It is possible the hall was once surrounded by a moat.|$|E

5|$|Royal {{artisans}} {{were sometimes}} responsible for sculpting stelae; {{in some cases}} these sculptors were actually the sons of kings. In other cases {{it is likely that}} captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat. This appears to have been the case in Piedras Negras where Stela12 depicting war captives submitting to the victorious king is <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Pomoná, the defeated city. Archaeologists believe that this may also have been the case with Quiriguá after its surprise defeat of its overlord Copán.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{fortress}} of Deva was constructed from local sandstone, which was quarried {{across the river}} {{to the south of}} the fortress. Traces of the quarry are visible in Handbridge. In the 2nd century, a shrine to the Roman goddess Minerva was <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarry for protection, perhaps by the quarry workers. Despite heavy weathering, the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The chancel, {{which has}} a ceiling {{decorated}} by C. E. Kempe, has three windows {{in the style of}} the late 12th century, and a priest's door built into the south side circa 1250. A south porch was built in 1621 at the behest of Dr Robert Burton, whose arms are <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gable above the date. A candelabrum given by Ann Kendall in 1705 hangs in the chancel. The chancel ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars on a blue background in 1914. Two years later, an altar was erected at the east end of the north aisle, and an aumbry placed in the north wall of the chancel. The royal arms of William IV are displayed in the tower.|$|E

5|$|Altar 12 is <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early Maya {{style and}} archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be}} an especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were <b>carved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E
