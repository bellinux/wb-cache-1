He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised {{the game as}} one of the best examples of the niche shooting gallery genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be an excellent example of what the Virtual Console is for: providing gamers chances to experience quality games that were overlooked in their time. He highlighted the release as providing a <b>cheap</b> <b>option</b> to play a game which has become an expensive collector's item.|$|E

5000|$|Suranga (also Surangam or thurangam) (English: Tunnel well) is a {{traditional}} water management system used to provide a reliable supply of water for human settlements and irrigation in Kasargod district of Kerala and Dakshin Kannada district of Karnataka, India. [...] A suranga is basically a horizontal tunnel dug in the slope of a laterite hill for about 30 m to 40 m, which uses gravitational force for extraction of the underground water and collect into a storage tank. As both the areas are covered by uneven and steep laterite hill which makes boring of traditional bore well hard and expensive, surangas are considered as a relatively <b>cheap</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E

40|$|Nitric acid {{production}} {{is identified as}} a main source of nitrous oxide. Options for emission reduction however are not available. TNO and Hydro Agri studied the technological and economic feasibility of catalytic decomposition of nitrous oxide in nitric acid tail-gases. Although in literature promising candidate catalysts are described for nitrous oxide decomposition, inhibition of these catalysts by NO and H 2 O {{is a serious problem}} that still has to be overcome. But, if a catalyst becomes available, catalytic decomposition of nitrous oxide in nitric acid tail-gases will be a relative <b>cheap</b> <b>option</b> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the financial}} and economic {{costs and benefits of}} the large scale National Ecological Network (NEN) nature conservation project in the Netherlands, taking into account transaction costs and land market impacts of different institutional arrangements. The net financial costs associated with achieving the current plan are equivalent with an annual amount 876 per hectare. Of the costs, transaction costs amount about 16 % or (sic) 140 per hectare. The substantive land purchases involved in the plan will lead to land price increase of 20 %. Nature management by agriculture {{turns out to be a}} relatively <b>cheap</b> <b>option...</b>|$|E
50|$|Automotive Insurance Consumers and Other Examples:The US {{states of}} New Jersey and Pennsylvania {{inadvertently}} ran a real-life experiment providing evidence of status quo {{bias in the}} early 1990s. As part of tort law reform programs, citizens were offered two options for their automotive insurance: an expensive option giving them full right to sue and a less expensive option with restricted rights to sue. In New Jersey the <b>cheaper</b> <b>option</b> was the default and most citizens selected it. Only a minority chose the <b>cheaper</b> <b>option</b> in Pennsylvania, where the more expensive option was the default. Similar effects have been shown for contributions to retirement plans, choice of internet privacy policies and the decision to become an organ donor.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Costs== Stabilization ponds {{are widely}} {{regarded}} as the most cost-effective wastewater treatment technology for the removal of pathogenic micro-organisms. A World Bank study carried out in Sana’a, Yemen, in 1983 makes a detailed economic comparison of waste stabilization ponds, aerated lagoons, oxidation ditches and trickling filters. According to this study, stabilization pond technology is a <b>cheaper</b> <b>option</b> up to a land cost of US$ 7.8 per square meter. Above this cost, oxidation ditches become the <b>cheapest</b> <b>option.</b> However, often the main constraint against selecting this technology is not land cost but land availability. If land is available, stabilization ponds have the advantage of very low operating costs since they use no energy compared to other wastewater treatment technologies.|$|R

40|$|Knee {{cartilage}} or osteochondral lesions {{are common}} and challenging injuries. To date, most symptomatic lesions warrant surgical treatment. We present two cases {{of patients with}} knee osteochondral defects treated with a one-step surgical procedure consisting of an autologous-based matrix composed of healthy hyaline cartilage chips, mixed plasma poor-rich in platelets clot, and plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF). Both patients returned to playing soccer at the preinjury activity level and demonstrated excellent defect filling in both magnetic resonance imaging and second-look arthroscopy (in one of them). The use of a clot of autologous plasma poor in platelets with healthy hyaline cartilage chips and intra-articular injection of plasma rich in platelets is an effective, easy, and <b>cheap</b> <b>option</b> to treat knee cartilage injuries in young and athletic patients...|$|E
40|$|Pectinase is {{a generic}} term that used from {{derivation}} of the pectin. Pectin {{is a complex}} class of carbohydrates polymer which composed of members galacturonic acid that linked through the a- 1 - 4 glycosidic linkage and it is widely found in the primary cell walls or at the middle lamella of higher plants. Furthermore, Among different biofactories of pectinases, the filamentous fungi provide a potentially high yielding and relatively <b>cheap</b> <b>option</b> and the genus of Aspergillus has been used with a success as a production host. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research is to develop industrial production media and a cultivation strategy for the production and secretion of pectinases in a semi-industrial scale by A. niger.

40|$|Physiochemical {{properties}} of wastewater effluent from the plants of a brewery in Lagos, Nigeria were analyzed. The adsorption capacity of Granular activated carbon from animal horns {{when compared with}} the available commercial Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC) has been presented. Kinetics of adsorption was also investigated. The adsorption isotherms could be well defined with Freundlich model instead of Langmuir model for both GAC studied. The experimental data, when applied to the first and second-order kinetic models, followed the first-order with r² = 0. 931 for GAC from animal horns while commercial GAC followed the second-order with r² = 0. 936. The results illustrated how animal horns, a solid waste disposal menace from the abattoir at the Oshodi market in Lagos metropolis, was used as an effective biosorbent for the removal of Zn 2 + ions; offering a <b>cheap</b> <b>option</b> for primary treatment of the wastewater effluent...|$|E
