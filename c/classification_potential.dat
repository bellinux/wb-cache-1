40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of new image {{classification}} models have been developed to diversify the number of options available to prospective machine learning classifiers, such as Deep Learning. This is particularly important in the field of medical image classification as a misdiagnosis could have a severe impact on the patient. However, an assessment on the level to which a deep learning based Convolutional Neural Network can outperform a Support Vector Machine has not been discussed. In this project, the use of CNN and SVM classifiers is used on a dataset of approx. 55, 000 images. This dataset was used to assess the <b>classification</b> <b>potential</b> of each methodology, in terms of training, implementation, and the ability to engineer parameters and features for successful classifications on a very large dataset. The use of CNN approaches is further broken down into the use of different frameworks, in this case Theano and Torch implementations. These are then compared to an SVM classifier by confusion matrix, training time and ease of use to assess which has the higher <b>classification</b> <b>potential.</b> Here it is seen that the Theano model outperforms the Torch model slightly for this task, by roughly 3 % in the accuracy of the confusion matrix. The SVM meanwhile is shown to be very limited in its ability to classify such a large dataset. Furthermore, the SVM is shown to be limited in its ability to recognise the classes corresponding to the different levels of disease severity, achieving a classification accuracy of only 75 % for the whole sample. These results suggest that the application of Deep Learning techniques currently have a very large advantage over SVM approaches in both accuracy and data handling, that to not natively avail of the computational power of Deep Learning...|$|E

We quantify the complexity of a biomed-ical dataset using five complexity measures: correlation-based feature selection subset merit, noise, imbalance ratio, missing values and information gain. The effect of these complexity measures on classification accuracy is evaluated us-ing five diverse machine learning algorithms: J 48 (decision tree), SMO (support vector machines), Naive Bayes (probabilistic), IBk (instance based learner) and JRIP (rule-based induction).

40|$|Abstract. Information Retrieval (IR) {{research}} has recently started addressing the information need of exploratory search. where the searcher may be {{unfamiliar with the}} domain or not have decided what {{is the goal of}} his query. A popular tool to support exploratory search is the use of faceted search. The implementation of faceted search requires that documents be annotated by metadata {{in the form of a}}ttributes and hierarchical categories. In many applications, the metadata is maintained manually, in the form of a search ontology. Recent work has also investigated methods to automatically acquire such metadata from sample documents [1, 2]. In this work, we propose a new method to automatically evaluate the quality of such a search ontology. Our method relies on mapping ontology instances to textual documents. On the basis of this mapping, we evaluate the adequacy of ontology relations by measuring their <b>classification</b> <b>potential</b> over the textual documents.

The aims {{of this study were}} to verify the <b>classification</b> <b>potential</b> of Capsicum accessions regarding/ the species based on morphological descriptors and artificial neural networks, and to establish the most important descriptors and the best network architecture for this purpose. Five hundred and sixty-four plants from 47 Brazilian Capsicum accessions were evaluated. Neural networks of multilayer perceptron type were used in order to automate the species identification through 17 morphological descriptors. Six network architectures were evaluated, and the number of neurons in the hidden layer ranged from 1 to 6. The relative importance of morphological descriptors in the classification process was established by Garson's method. Corolla color, corolla spot color, calyx annular constriction, fruit shape at pedicel attachment, and fruit color at mature stage were the most important descriptors. The network architecture with 6 neurons in the hidden layer is the most appropriate in this study.

In this paper, we investigate {{the role of}} a biomedical dataset on the classification accuracy of an algorithm. To this end, we quantify the com-plexity of a biomedical dataset in terms of its missing values, imbalance ratio, noise and information gain. We have performed our experiments using six well-known evolutionary rule learning algorithms – XCS, UCS, GAssist, cAnt-Miner, SLAVE and Ishibuchi – on 31 publicly available biomedical datasets. The results of our experiments and statistical analysis show that GAssist gives better classi-fication results on majority of biomedical datasets among the compared schemes but cannot be categorized as the best classifier. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the nature of a biomedical dataset – not the selection of evolutionary algo-rithm – {{plays a major role in}} determining the classification accuracy of a dataset. We further show that noise is a dominating factor in determining the complex-ity of a dataset and it is inversely proportional to the classification accuracy of all evaluated algorithms. Towards the end, we provide researchers with a meta-classification model that can be used to determine the <b>classification</b> <b>potential</b> of a dataset on the basis of its complexity measures...|$|E

We believe that now is {{the right time to}} devise non-signature based zero-day (previously unknown) malware detection strategies before Linux intruders take us by surprise. There-fore, in this paper, we first do a forensic analysis of Linux executable and linkable format (ELF) files.

Our forensic analysis provides insight into different features that have the potential to discriminate malware executables from benign ones.

Here we assess {{the use of a}} global expression profiling technique that identifies chromosome regions corresponding to differential gene expression, termed comparative expressed sequence hybridization (CESH). CESH analysis was performed on a total of 104 tumors with a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, prostate cancer, and favorable-histology Wilms tumors. Through the use of the chromosome regions identified as variables, support vector machine analysis was applied to assess <b>classification</b> <b>potential,</b> and feature selection (recursive feature elimination) was used to identify the best discriminatory regions. We demonstrate that the CESH profiles have characteristic patterns in tumor groups and were also able to distinguish subgroups of rhabdomyosarcoma. The overall CESH profiles in favorable-histology Wilms tumors were found to correlate with subsequent clinical behavior. Classification by use of CESH profiles was shown to be similar in performance to previous microarray expression studies and highlighted regions for further investigation. We conclude that analysis of chromosomal expression profiles can group, subgroup, and even predict clinical behavior of tumors to a level of performance similar to that of microarray analysis. CESH is independent of selecting sequences for interrogation and is a simple, rapid, and widely accessible approach to identify clinically useful differential expression. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

Nevertheless, {{there remains a}} requirement for less elaborate methods for snow characterization, as numerical snow models such as SNOWPACK are presently based on two-dimensional (2 -D) grain analysis. We present a detailed assessment of various methods and shape descriptors used for snow characterization from digitized images. Dendricity, {{the ratio of the}} square of grain perimeter to its area, allows distinction between new and old snow while sphericity distinguishes between faceted and rounded grains. The concept of sphericity is based on curvature, yet another powerful shape descriptor. However, curvatures obtained from images of disaggregated snow grains depend on both resolution and methods chosen. We compared the standard parabola method with a cubic smoothing spline approach for curvature measurement. Applying both methods to parametrically generated shapes, descriptor values were compared with their analytical counterparts. The spline method was found to be able to measure a wider range of curvatures accurately, but both methods suffered from a filtering effect.

We demonstrated that by analyzing the signal attenuation in this manner we were able to differentiate two media sub-layers with different orientations of the smooth muscle cells. The other classification method used in our study was fractal analysis. Fractal analysis was implemented in a box-counting (fractal dimension) image-processing code and was used as a tool to differentiate and quantify variations in tissue texture at various locations in the OCT images.

However, the directions in which it takes thinking about the future of armed forces differ widely. Among the six “military futures” identified, those linked to the function of disaster relief are most frequently found. However, the expansion of traditional military roles is also promoted.
