40|$|This article {{reports on}} heat {{transfer}} measurements {{made on a}} rotating test rig representing the internal disc-cone cavity of a gas turbine high-pressure (H. P.) compressor stack. Tests were carried out {{for a range of}} flow rates and rotational speeds at engine representative nondimensional conditions. The rig also had a central drive shaft, which could rotate {{in the same direction as}} the discs, <b>contrarotate</b> relative to the discs, or remain static. Measurements of heat transfer were obtained from a conduction solution method using measured surface temperatures as boundary conditions. Results from the outer surface of the cone are in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions for the heat transfer from a free cone in turbulent flow. The heat transfer measurements from the inner surface of the cone reveal two regimes of heat transfer: one governed by rotation, the other by action of the throughflow. In the rotationally dominated regime, the heat transfer from the inner surface of the cone is higher for a co-rotating shaft than for either a static or contra-rotating shaft. In the throughflow-dominated regime the heat transfer shows little consistent dependence on the direction of shaft rotation. Tests carried out at different values of surface-to-fluid temperature difference add support to the hypothesis that in the rotationally dominated regime the heat transfer occurs through a process of free convection, where the buoyancy force is induced by rotation. The heat transfer from the disc is significantly lower than that from the inner surface of the cone and more or less insensitive to the sense of shaft rotation. The disc average Nusselt numbers show similar behavior to those from the inner surface of the cone and suggest that the disc heat transfer too is governed either by rotationally induced buoyancy or by the axial throughflow...|$|R

The distortion screen (placed upstream of the first rotor) covers 1 / 3 of the span of the blade near the hub and the casing for hub-strong and tip-strong inflow distortions, respectively. The performance of the <b>contrarotating</b> fan was investigated under both the radially distorted inflows and compared with the clean inflow conditions under different speed combinations of rotor- 1 and rotor- 2. The hub-strong radial distortion reduces the overall performance (pressure rise and efficiency) as well as the operating range by about 2 to 4 % under the different speed combinations. On the other hand, it is interesting to observe that the tip covered radial distortion not only improves the pressure rise, but also increases the overall operating range by about 6 to 8 %. There was, however, a 6 to 8 % decrease in efficiency in this case as compared to 12 to 15 % for hub-strong radial inflow distortion.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{theoretical model}} based on first principles {{has been developed}} to predict the characteristics of mass, momentum, energy, and electrostatic potential transport in high-pressure mercury arcs confined in a quartz arctube. The model is utilized to systematically investigate the impact of convection on the transport process by including and excluding the gravity effect. Strong three-dimensional convection flows with multiple <b>contrarotating</b> vortices have been identified. These vortices substantially change the energy balance within the arc, causing highly nonuniform gas temperature distribution and lowering the maximum gas temperature. Geometrical modifications of the arctube such as wall contour curvature and electrode offsets do not change the strength of convection but can produce better overall temperature uniformity within the arctube by accommodating the upward-moving tendency of temperature contours caused by convection. In agreement with the experimental measurement, the model predicts that the arctube curvature can cause large differences of wall temperature profiles, including shape, level, and locations of peak values...|$|E

In the present work, the flutter characteristics of a <b>contrarotating</b> fan blisk for a high bypass ratio engine have been computationally investigated. Unsteady time domain simulations have been performed for each blisk separately for two different operating speeds to get the flutter predictions.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model describing {{the behavior of}} a turbulent fuel jet injected normally into a cross flow is developed. The model places particular emphasis on the <b>contrarotating</b> vortex pair associated with the jet, and predicts the flame length and shape based on entrainment of the oxidizer by the fuel jet. Effects of buoyancy and density variations in the flame are neglected in order to isolate the effects of large-scale mixing. The results are compared with a simulation of the transverse reacting jet in a liquid (acid-base) system. For a wide range of ratios of the cross flow to jet velocity, the model predicts flame length quite well. In particular, the observed transitional behavior in the flame length between cross-flow velocity to jet velocity of orifice ratios of 0. 0 to 0. 1, yielding an approximate minimum at the ratio 0. 05, is reproduced very clearly by the present model. The transformation in flow structure that accounts for this minimum arises from the differing components of vorticity dominant in the near-field and far-field regions of the jet...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{quantify}} {{the benefits of a}} shrouded coaxial rotor configuration through experimental comparisons with free (not shrouded) rotors in hover. The experiment shows that both the figure of merit of <b>contrarotating</b> rotors and the system power loading are improved by the shroud inclusion. Improvements are induced by a suction effect at the inlet, which can be optimized by a regulation effect of the mass flow. Compared to free rotors, the strong suction peak formed on the shroud leading edge by a 65 % increase in mass flow, allowing the shroud to contribute up to 56 % of the total thrust. More uniform pressure distribution in the downstream rotor and less contraction of the slipstream decrease losses and increase the rotor efficiency. The shrouded system efficiency is further improved if the upstream rotor rotates slower than the rear one, for a given total shaft power, because a stronger pressure depression occurs upstream of the rotors to generate more mass flow. On the other hand, the system behavior is insensitive to the interrotor distance...|$|E

The jet was located at 65 % wing chord on an NACA 0021 airfoil fitted with a 30 % chord NACA 4415 flap. The flowfield associated with the jet was surveyed extensively with directional pressure probes to determine local velocity vectors and pressures for three different values of lift coefficient at jet effective velocity ratios (square root of the ratio of the jet dynamic pressure to the freestream dynamic pressure) of 4, 6, and 8. Data describing the jet centerline and the path of the <b>contrarotating</b> vortices accompanying the deflected jet are presented and compared with similar data for a round jet issuing from a large flat plate. The spacing and strength of the vortices are calculated using a simple vortex model previously proposed for the flat plate case.

40|$|The {{development}} of the turbulent symmetric and asymmetric vortex flow about the lee side of a 5 deg semiangle conical forebody at high relative incidence was investigated. The cone was immersed in a Mach 0. 6 airstream at a Reynolds number of 13. 5 x 10 to the 6 th power based on the 1. 4 m axial length of the cone. Small amounts of air injected normally or tangentially to the cone surface, but {{on one side of}} the leeward meridian and beneath the vortex farthest from the wall, were effective in biasing the asymmetry. With this reorientation of the forebody vortices, the amplitude of the side force could be reduced to the point where its direction was reversed. This phenomenon was obtained either by changing the blowing rate at constant incidence or by changing incidence at constant blowing rate. Normal injection appeared more effective than tangential injection. The <b>contrarotating</b> vortices in the penetrating jet flow were of opposite hand to the rotational directions of the forebody vortices. A distinctively organized and stable flow structure emerged with the jet vortices positioned above the forebody vortices...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} in the <b>contrarotating</b> (CR) fan configuration in aviation and other applications where size and weight are important design factors. Contrarotation recovers swirl energy compared with the single-rotor design, but this advantage is not fully harnessed due to, perhaps, the issue of noise. This study explores passive noise reduction for a small, axial-flow, CR fan with perforated trailing-edge for the upstream rotor and perforated leading-edge for the downstream rotor. The fan is designed with simple velocity triangle analyses, which are checked by 3 D flow computations. The aerodynamic consequence and the acoustic benefit of such perforated blading are investigated experimentally. The results {{show that there is}} a reduction of total pressure compared with the baseline CR fan at the same rotating speeds, but this is easily compensated for by slightly raising the rotating speeds. A reduction of 6 - 7 dB in overall noise is achieved for the same aerodynamic output, although there is a moderate noise increase in the high frequency range of 12. 5 - 15. 0 kHz due to blade perforations. The effect of inter-rotor separation distance is also investigated for the baseline design.

The test case {{was chosen to}} match available experimental data where the jet Mach number was 0. 78, and the freestream Mach number was 0. 13. Time-averaged solutions were obtained using the thin-layer Navier-Stokes equations and two overlapping grids. The solutions were sensitive to the radial grid clustering {{near the edge of}} the jet and to the far-field boundary conditions. Experimental data comparisons were required to determine the most appropriate jet grid and satisfactory boundary conditions. Globally, the solutions converged in about 6000 iterations. The computational results accurately showed the deflected jet and associated <b>contrarotating</b> vortices. The fine clustered grid in the region upstream of the jet exit allowed the horseshoe vortex in the boundary layer near the jet exit to be captured. Most importantly for aircraft applications, the computed plate pressure distributions compared favorably with the experimental data over most of the surface. However, in the wake region immediately downstream of the jet exit, where there is extensive flow separation, some discrepancies with experimental data were observed.
