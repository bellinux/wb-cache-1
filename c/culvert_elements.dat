40|$|Cracks of precast {{box culvert}} have arises due to {{improper}} quality of materials, incorrect specifications, faulty design, and mistakes in construction process or extreme environmental conditions. At the same time, external {{factors such as}} soil-water pressure, and soil movement, {{can contribute to the}} damage of these structures. The defects developed in any one particular component in a box culvert can extend and make weaken the box culvert to resist the loads. This study presents an investigation into the crack problems of 11 units precast box <b>culvert</b> <b>elements.</b> The investigation consists of tests which have been conducted to determine the causes of cracks and failure due to construction or design on the East Coast Highway Project Phase II – Bukit Besi to Bukit Payung. The methodology of this study have been carried out through a study of project documents, a site visit, and an analysis of the results of testing conducted upon the material used in the project. In this studies the nondestructive and destructive test were carried out to find the root causes of the problem in the culvert structures. As the results of investigation shows that the cracks of precast box culvert is due to constructions deficiencies such as overloading of backfilling, workmanship during manufacturing and not enough reinforcement as a design...|$|E
40|$|Soil-steel {{structures}} are flexible conduits made of corrugated metal sheets and {{buried in a}} well compacted granular media. Classical methods of design for conventional sized flexible buried conduits are simple and not suitable for long span structures, especially under relatively shallow cover. Herein, the live load effect cannot be considered secondary {{as in the case}} of conduits under deep cover. Also, field experience has shown that failure of the structure could be initiated by soil failure. The present codes avoid the problems associated with shallow cover by requiring a minimum depth of cover. This requirement is empirical and does not differentiate between the different shapes of conduits. A plane strain finite element analysis is developed and used to study long span soil-steel structures of different shapes under any depth of cover and loading condition with due consideration given to the soil state of stress. The structure wall is replaced by conventional beam elements. Soil is simulated by a combination of constant strain and linear strain compatible elements. Storage and time requirements for the numerical solution are kept to the lowest level without sacrificing the desired accuracy. Two-noded spring type interface elements are introduced between soil and <b>culvert</b> <b>elements.</b> Nonlinear stress-dependent hyperbolic relationships are used to model the soil and shear behaviour of interface elements. Construction procedure is simulated by automatically generating the finite element mesh layer by layer and by including the effect of compaction in the incremental analyses. Live load is applied concentrically or eccentrically, in increments. Initiation and propagation of soil failure are detected based on a curved Mohr envelope, and applying a stress transfer technique. A finite element program is developed on the basis of the foregoing analytical procedure to predict the state of stresses in the system due to dead and live loads, as well as the live load causing soil failure. The analytical results are compared with experimental results for live load tests conducted on existing long span soil-steel structures under shallow cover. The results of laboratory tests carried out until failure of soil are also compared with the analytically predicted values. Reasonable agreement is found in both cases. An analytical study establishes the parameters governing soil failure above the conduit. These parameters include the depth of cover, magnitude and position of loading, and the size and geometric shape of the conduit. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

40|$|Crossing <b>culverts</b> are {{essential}} <b>element</b> of rural roads. The paper aims to investigate failures of recently constructed wadi-crossing pipe culverts in Sennar state and provide necessary remedial measures. The investigation is conducted {{to provide an}} extensive diagnosis study {{in order to find}} out the main structural and hydrological weaknesses of the culverts. Literature of steel pipe culverts related to construction practices and common types of culvert failures and their appropriate mitigation measures were reviewed. A detailed field survey was conducted to detect failures and defects appeared on the existing culverts. The results revealed that seepage of water through the embankment and foundation of the culverts leads to excessive erosion and scouring causing sever failures and damages. The design mistakes and poor construction were detected as the main causes of culverts failures. For sustainability of the culverts, various remedial measures are recommended to be considered in urgent rehabilitation of the existing crossings...|$|R

Several researchers have performed experimental and numerical studies about the behavior of these structures under dead loads and crossing live loads. In this study, to investigate the variations of soil properties on the stability of a culvert, we tried to simulate a soil–steel culvert in the PLAXIS program, which is a 2 D finite element code for soil and rock analyses. The Mohr–Coulomb constitutive model was used in this simulation, and as the crossing traffic load, the stage construction method was established. Parametric analyses showed that as cohesion (c), Young’s modulus (E), and the internal friction angle (ϕ) increase, the stability of the soil–steel culvert increases. Furthermore, analyses showed that an increase in other properties, such as Poisson’s ratio (υ) and the dilation angle (ψ), has a negligible effect on the stability of the soil–steel culvert.

40|$|The {{main runway}} for this general {{aviation}} airport requires routing Sand Creek through a 600 -foot long culvert under the runway. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources {{required that the}} channel within the <b>culvert</b> must contain <b>elements</b> which allow fish passage or more specifically places for fish to rest. This requirement eliminated the typical design of a flat-bottom, lined culvert, such as a typical box culvert. In {{order to meet the}} goals of the design, a process-based geomorphic assessment of the creek was conducted, including a longitudinal profile. Using Natural Channel Design, a meandering, two-stage channel within a 24 -foot-wide arch culvert was designed. HEC-RAS was used to properly size the culvert to pass the 100 -year recurrence flood as well as model the channel shears for choosing and sizing bank and channel treatments. In addition, FishXing software was used to verify fish could travel upstream in the pool/riffle structure planned. The resulting design was a rock-lined two-stage channel with a pool/riffle structure within the culvert. In the design, the new channel was reconnected to the existing channel, as a two-stage channel with pre-vegetated coir log and rock bank treatments and Newbury rock weir grade controls in a sand-bottom channel. The culvert and channel inside, and the realigned channel with pre-vegetated coir logs were completed in late 2009. Live staking and bare-root planting in the reconstructed floodplain was completed during the spring 2010. The design team presented this design to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, including a comprehensive understanding of the geomorphic setting as well as the science and engineering rationale behind the design. Had the team not proposed this design, the project would have been placed on indefinite hold and likely be in litigation. Placing multiple meanders within a culvert is arguably {{the first of its kind}} in the US...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a study to {{evaluate}} {{the behavior of a}} flexible culvert with the inclusion of a goefabric above the culvert are presented. In the soil-fabric-culvert system the geofabric becomes an interactive stress-carrying component of the system. Insight into the phenomenon of the stress-attenuation due to the inclusion of a semimechanical reinforcement, like geofabric, is also obtained from this research. The numerical technique of the finite element method is used for the analysis of the soil-fabric-culvert system. In the finite element model, two-dimensional triangular and quadrilateral elements having nonlinear, stress-dependent material properties are used for representing the soil. Beam elements are used to model the <b>culvert,</b> no-compression bar <b>elements</b> are used for the fabric, and two-dimensional interface elements for the contact surfaces between the soil and fabric. Incremental construction sequence and approximate nonlinear geometry are adapted in the analysis. Because of the relatively recent usage of fabrics for engineering purposes, no information regarding their employment as an inclusion in a soil-culvert system is available in the open literature. However, {{a review of the literature}} is conducted to bring out the current state of understanding of the behavior of soil-culvert systems without the presence of a fabric. The classical design concepts which reflect the development of the design methodology for flexible culverts are reviewed. The phenomenological concepts of soil-culvert interaction, particularly those of arching in the soil above the culvert and buckling of the soil-surrounded culvert wall are discussed. The burial depths of D/ 2 and D are considered for the horizontal configuration of the fabric when D = diameter of culvert. A burial depth of 2 D is considered for the inclined configuration of the fabric. The following surface concentrated loading conditions are considered for the horizontal configuration of the fabric. Loads of 10 kip are placed symmetrically at S/D = 1 / 4, 1 / 2, 1, or 2 and 20 kip load at S/D = 0 (S = distance from vertical centerline of culvert). For the inclined configuration of the fabric above culvert, 50 kip surface concentrated loads are placed at S/D = 0, 1 / 4, and 1 / 2 simultaneously. This study shows that the fabric alters the stresses in the soil-fabric-culvert system by two mechanisms: the fabric can carry part of the load in tension and/or it can distribute the load more uniformly over a wider area. Under most practical conditions, the inclusion of fabric causes a significant reduction in the magnitudes of the following culvert design parameters: maximum axial force, maximum moment, vertical crown deflection, and horizontal springline deflection. The presence of fabric is more effective in attenuating the culvert design parameters for the location of surface loads within the horizontal projection of the culvert and for shallow depths of soil cover...|$|R
40|$|Physical models {{transfer}} part of {{the natural}} world into controlled laboratory conditions without the oversimplifying assumptions required by numerical models. However large scale hydraulic facilities are associated with large expenditure, require a high level of preparation, {{while at the same time}} access, to them is restricted for the majority of researchers and engineers. This thesis explores the potential of small scale physical models of waves (termed wave micro-models) as a modelling tool for coastal engineers and scientists. Length scales smaller than 1 : 50 are applied in micro-models and as such the requirements in facility size, technical and experimental personnel and experimental time (t = q 1 length scale for a Froude scaled model) are significantly reduced. However, the problem of scale effects must be assessed. Accordingly the first steps of the large experimental effort presented here, were focused on establishing the validity range of wave micro-models for both breaking and non-breaking waves. Using that as a starting base several micro-models were then designed and developed in order to 1. assess the effectiveness of <b>culverts</b> as flushing <b>elements</b> in marinas, 2. develop a new composite seawall for overtopping based wave energy conversion and 3. test geometry variations in an existed yacht harbour. The obtained experimental findings demonstrated that the micro-modelling of non-breaking waves is possible for water depths larger than 0. 03 m and wave periods longer than 0. 35 sec. On the contrary small scale breaking waves are strongly influenced by surface tension but when the freshwater was replaced by an isopropyl-alcohol and distilled water solution with reduced surface tension, very en- couraging results were achieved. Undistorted plunging breakers were created, air entrainment was observed to increase significantly and the energy dissipation values exceeded even those reported in the literature for large scale experiments. It is believed that such a fluid could potentialy be used in other areas of hydraulic research, e. g hydraulic jumps, dam break events, etc. Useful insights regarding the operation of culverts were also acquired and it was shown that efficient flushing is almost potentially impossible with symetric culverts. In conjunction with this, the mea- surements of the hydraulic power potential of the composite seawall were very promising and when a modelling fluid with reduced surface tension was used run-up and overtopping at small scale were significantly improved. Finally, geometry effects on wave fields were observed with a novel, purposely developed, mapping method. The velocities of floating particles were used to extract wave heights and although inaccuracies were observed, partly because linear theory was employed, the 3 D evolution of a wave field was mapped for the first time. Wave mapping in combination with wave micro-models appears attractive since the comparatively small areas allow for the measurement of the whole wave field rather than using single point measurements as it is usually applied in physical model test...|$|R
