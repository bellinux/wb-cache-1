40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} of fiscal and monetary policies during a currency crisis in an economy with government nominal liabilities. We show that the stock and maturity of these liabilities are key determinants of the magnitude, timing and predictability of a devaluation. Among notable features of our model, monetary authorities defend the <b>currency</b> <b>parity</b> conditional {{on the level of}} the interest rate, rather than on the stock of international reserves; budget deficits need not be high before a currency crisis; post- devaluation inflation may exhibit little persistence, and money demand need not fall after the crisis. ...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, since 1992, the Lebanese economy was {{characterized}} by {{a high level of}} dollarization as a consequence of hyperinflation. To control the inflation rate, the Lebanese monetary authorities have adopted the fixed exchange rate regime in 1997 administrating the Lebanese currency price. Thus, to maintain the Lebanese <b>currency</b> <b>parity</b> against the dollar within a very narrow limit, the Central Bank offered high interest rates on Lebanese treasury bills. The cost of fixing the Lebanese currency added to the cost of reconstruction after the civil war, and the Israeli continual attacks to south Lebanon have produced a permanent budget deficit and contributed to increase the public debts to alarming level. The public debts GDP ratio is equivalent to 185 % in 2015.|$|E
40|$|Last {{decades have}} been the most {{turbulent}} in international monetary history in terms of the number, extent and severity of the economic and financial crises. There were more speculative bubbles in the period 1980 - 2000 than in any previous period, and Japan and Latin American countries experienced the worse of them in the late 1980 s. Sometimes crises were triggered by the concerns regarding borrowers’ excessive indebtedness and sometimes they occurred sequentially {{in a very short time}} period. Some of the crises involved the bankruptcy of several banks; others were related to the lack of confidence in a country’s ability to maintain its <b>currency</b> <b>parity,</b> and others were the result of the burst of a speculative bubble, such as real estate or financial bubbles. Therefore, in the present global economic context the analysis of theories on economic and financial crises is justified by the attempt to deepen the understanding of the triggering causes and evolution of the crises in a capitalist economic system. ...|$|E

50|$|The dollar was {{introduced}} on 17 February 1970, {{less than a}} month before the declaration of a republic on 2 March 1970. It replaced the pound at a rate of 2 dollars to 1 pound. The dollar proved to be a strong <b>currency,</b> at <b>parity</b> with the pound sterling right up to the very end of Rhodesia in 1980, when it was replaced by the Zimbabwean dollar at par. However, the Rhodesian dollar was never a fully convertible currency and its exchange rate was therefore not an indication of the underlying economics.|$|R
40|$|It is now {{recognized}} that a viable {{international monetary system}} must rest {{on a combination of}} only two of the following three principles: (1) respect of the national economic policies, (2) free convertibility of <b>currencies,</b> (3) fixed <b>parities</b> with gold and the dollar. The author emphasizes some arguments against flexible exchange rates. He concludes that the present international monetary system has resolved the fundamental ambiguity of the Bretton Woods system by permitting flexibility of exchange rates. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a country}} sets a peg of its {{currency}} the monetary policy credibility {{it expects to}} gain implies that the anti-inflationary performance has to be as similar {{as possible to the}} anchor country one. Failing to meet this requirement can lead to speculative attacks against the <b>currency</b> <b>parity.</b> This is an insight drawn from monetary policy credibility models dealing with fixed exchange rates regimes. In addition, multiple equilibria embedded in these models may cause speculative attacks that make the efficiency of exchange rate regimes questionable. Contrary to this theoretical insight, the Franc zone continues to work despite the disinflation process in the European Union which is likely to increase the level of constraint related the use of the euro as an anchor. This paper shows how the existence of particular arrangements in the Franc zone allows for getting a framework without multiple equilibria and insures the stability of the system. Moreover, two kinds of structural asymmetries relative to African economies are introduced to show that, without the "operations account" mechanism, the EMU advent and the unfavorable economic and political environment which prevails in Africa are likely to have increased the constraint of pegging to the euro...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{notation}} {{degradation of}} the sovereign debt of the Euro area countries was at the origin of some confusing rumours {{on the effects of}} the loss of “Triple-A rating” for these countries {{as well as for the}} Franc Zone African Countries (PAZF). The need to protect the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) together with the lack ofeconomic competitiveness of the PAZF caused by the structural overvaluation of the CFAFranc and the no optimality of the Franc Zone are some of the destabilizing factors of the CFAlikely to induce queries about the zone including that which concerns the revision of the <b>currency</b> <b>parity.</b> The financial forfeiture of the Euro countries in general, and in France in particular, provides the opportunity to reconsider the current monetary anchoring by envisaging several happier perspectives for the PAZF, beginning with the keeping of the status quo o the building of the competitiveness of the African economies with the creation of a “CEMAC Franc” or a “WAEMU Franc” within the framework of a system of fixed exchange rates with margins of fluctuations. Irrespective of the policy adopted, the ultimate objective shall be to gradually move towards the “post- CFA” era which shall be followed by the creation of a unique African currency before 2020. This discussion goes well beyond the traditional analyses on the need to revise the 1972 and 1973 agreements between France and PAZF as it incorporates elements of the 2011 financial crisis in the debate. </p...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for setting the <b>currencies</b> at <b>parity</b> with the pre-war price was the {{prevailing}} opinion at that time that deflation was not a danger, while inflation, particularly the inflation in the Weimar Republic, was an unbearable danger. Another reason was that those who had loaned in nominal amounts hoped to recover the same value in gold that they had lent. Because of the reparations that Germany had to pay France, Germany began a credit-fueled period of growth in order to export and sell enough goods abroad to gain gold to pay the reparations. The U.S., as the world's gold sink, loaned money to Germany to industrialize, which was then the basis for Germany paying back France, and France paying back loans to the U.K. and the U.S. This arrangement was codified in the Dawes Plan.|$|R
2500|$|Tynwald {{passed the}} Currency Act 1992 {{as part of}} {{preparations}} for {{the event that the}} UK decided to adopt the euro. In such a scenario, the Isle of Man wished to retain the right to issue its own currency, believing it to be an important public statement of independence. Retaining the island's own coinage also enables the Isle of Man Treasury to continue to benefit from the accrual of interest on the issued money (seigniorage). The Currency Act allows for the issue of a Manx euro <b>currency</b> at <b>parity</b> with the euro, referred to as a [...] "substitute euro", which has an Isle of Man inscription on the obverse side of the coins. This proposal would essentially have replaced the [...] "substitute sterling" [...] with a [...] "substitute euro", as they would have functioned in the same way. Manx versions of the euro coins and euro banknotes were designed.|$|R

An eight nation study shows a currency's {{deviation from the}} rate predicted by PPP over a four year period can predict the direction of its movement in the subsequent one to four years. We show short term exchange rate movements of freely floating currencies are large in comparison with changes in economic fundamentals and these movements accumulate to create pressure which results in a predictable pattern of reversal. The results are robust across currencies and relatively insensitive to the time parameters used in the estimation. Purchasing power <b>parity</b> <b>Currency</b> Exchange rate Foreign exchange...|$|R
25|$|A rand {{was worth}} US$1.40 {{from the time}} of its {{inception}} in 1961 until late in 1971. Its value thereafter fluctuated as various exchange rate dispensations were implemented by the South African authorities. By the early 1980s high inflation and mounting political pressure combined with sanctions placed against the country due to apartheid started to erode its value. The <b>currency</b> broke above <b>parity</b> with the dollar {{for the first time in}} March 1982, and continued to trade between R1 and R1.30 to the dollar until June 1984, when depreciation of the currency gained momentum. By February 1985, it was trading over R2 per dollar, and in July that year, all foreign exchange trading was suspended for three days to try to stop the depreciation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for calculating bilateral equilibrium exchange rates for {{a panel of}} currencies {{in a way that}} guarantees global consistency. The methodology has three parts: a theoretical model that encompasses the balance of payments and the Balassa-Samuelson approaches to real exchange rate determination; an unobserved components decomposition in a cointegration framework that identifies a time-varying equilibrium real exchange rate; and an algebraic transformation that extracts bilateral equilibrium nominal rates. The results uncover that, by the start of Stage III of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the euro was significantly undervalued against the dollar and the pound, but overvalued against the yen. The paper also shows that the four major EMU <b>currencies</b> locked their <b>parities</b> with the euro at a rate close to equilibrium. ...|$|R

Standard as well as nonlinear unit root tests are employed on the time series dimension. Unit root tests reject PPP and the highest half-lives are observed after the introduction of the single currency. Panel unit root (Pesaran, 2007) and stationarity tests (Hadri and Kurozumi, 2008) that take into account cross-sectional dependence are also estimated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for {{the calculation of}} bilateral equilibrium exchange rates for a panel of currencies {{in a way that}} guarantees consistency at the global level. A theoretical model, which encompasses the balance of payments and the Balassa-Samuelson approaches to real exchange rate determination, shows that the stock of net foreign assets and the evolution of sectoral prices are the fundamentals underlying the behavior of the real exchange rate. An unobserved components methodology in a cointegration framework allows us to identify a time-varying equilibrium real exchange rate, and deviations from this equilibrium provide an estimate of the degree of multilateral misalignment. Finally, an algebraic transformation converts these multilateral equilibrium real rates into bilateral equilibrium nominal rates. The results uncover, inter alia, that by the start of Stage III of EMU the euro was significantly undervalued against the dollar and even more against the pound, but overvalued relative to the yen. Regarding EMU currencies, it is shown that the four major EMU <b>currencies</b> locked their <b>parities</b> with the euro at a rate close to equilibrium. ...|$|R
30|$|Our {{interest}} for the current problematic of investors based in a small country leads us to push the inquiry one step further and make a comparison between hedged and unhedged returns, taking the cost of hedging into account. Our goal is to address what we perceive as the currently dominant practice of Swiss-based investors which is to form highly internationalized portfolios, if only for lack of opportunities given the limited size of the Swiss capital markets, but systematically hedge the corresponding currency risks. We observe {{that the question of}} whether it pays to hedge or not {{is directly related to the}} existence of significant and long-lasting deviations from UIP. In other words, in a world of long-lasting deviations from interest <b>parity,</b> <b>currency</b> hedging is not the free lunch; it is sometimes made to be and often hoped for at the current juncture. But the crisis behavior of the safe haven currency may render unhedged international investment portfolios (or a permanent carry trade position for that matter) excessively risky. We suggest that a selective hedging strategy based on the strength of the franc has good chances of being successful and provide an example of a simple-minded strategy that would have dominated a systematic hedge over the past 36 years.|$|R
40|$|This Selected Issues paper assesses whether Latvia’s {{strategy}} to enter ERM 2 and adopt the euro is appropriate. The paper examines {{the possibility of}} an exchange rate misalignment from various perspectives. It considers different notions of the real effective exchange rate and competitiveness; deviations of the exchange rate from statistically defined equilibrium concepts; and the possibility that central bank foreign exchange interventions have maintained the exchange rate artificially away from equilibrium. The paper finds little evidence of a major misalignment. The paper also analyzes modeling inflation in Latvia.

5000|$|Like {{most modern}} Japanese institutions, the Bank of Japan was founded after the Meiji Restoration. Prior to the Restoration, Japan's feudal fiefs all issued their own money, hansatsu, in {{an array of}} {{incompatible}} denominations, but the New Currency Act of Meiji 4 (1871) did away with these and established the yen as the new decimal <b>currency,</b> which had <b>parity</b> with the Mexican silver dollar. The former han (fiefs) became prefectures and their mints became private chartered banks which, however, initially retained the right to print money. For a time both the central government and these so-called [...] "national" [...] banks issued money. A period of unanticipated consequences was ended when the Bank of Japan was founded in Meiji 15 (October 10, 1882), under the Bank of Japan Act 1882 (June 27, 1882), after a Belgian model. It has since been partly privately owned (its stock is traded over the counter, hence the stock number). [...] A number of modifications based on other national banks were encompassed within the regulations under which the bank was founded. [...] The institution was given a monopoly on controlling the money supply in 1884, but it would be another 20 years before the previously issued notes were retired.|$|R
