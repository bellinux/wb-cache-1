50|$|Crystal malts, or caramel malts are {{prepared}} separately from pale malts. They are high-nitrogen malts that are wetted and roasted in a rotating drum before kilning. They produce strongly sweet toffee-like flavors and are sufficiently converted {{that they can}} be steeped without mashing to extract their flavor. Crystal malts are available in a range of colors, with darker-colored crystal malts kilned at higher temperatures producing stronger, more caramel-like overtones. Some of the sugars in crystal malts caramelize during kilning and become unfermentable. Hence, adding <b>crystal</b> <b>malt</b> increases the final sweetness of a beer. They contain no enzymes. ASBC 50-165/EBC 90-320; the typical British <b>crystal</b> <b>malt</b> used in pale ale and bitter is around ASBC 70-80.|$|E

50|$|Conversion is {{the extent}} to which {{starches}} in the grain have been enzymatically broken down into sugars. A caramel or <b>crystal</b> <b>malt</b> is fully converted before it goes into the mash; most malted grains have little conversion; unmalted grains, meanwhile, have little or no conversion. Unconverted starch becomes sugar during the last steps of mashing, through the action of alpha and beta amylases.|$|E

2500|$|Malt {{is often}} {{divided into two}} {{categories}} by brewers: base malts and specialty malts; base malts have enough diastatic power to convert their own starch and usually that of some amount of starch from unmalted grain, called adjuncts, while specialty malts have little diastatic power, but provide flavor, color, or [...] "body" [...] (viscosity) to the finished beer. Specialty caramel or <b>crystal</b> <b>malts</b> {{have been subjected to}} heat treatment to convert their starches to sugars nonenzymatically. Within these categories is a variety of types distinguished largely by the kilning temperature (see mash ingredients).|$|R
50|$|American Pale Ales are {{generally}} around 5% abv with significant quantities of American hops, typically Cascade. Although American brewed beers {{tend to use}} a cleaner yeast, and American two row malt, it is particularly the American hops that distinguish an APA from British or European pale ales.

The style is also close to Amber Ale, though Amber Ales are darker and maltier due to use of <b>crystal</b> <b>malts.</b>|$|R
