40|$|In {{the present}} chapter, we {{consider}} the effects of <b>complex</b> <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> used in practice in most sample surveys on {{the analysis of the}} survey data. The cases in which the design may or may not influence analysis are specified and the basic concepts involved are defined. Once a model for analysis has been set up, {{we consider the}} possible relationships between the model and the sample design. When the design may {{have an effect on the}} analysis and additional explanatory variable related to the design cannot be added to the analytical model, two basic methodologies may be used: classical analysis, which could be modified to take the design into account; or a new analytical tool, which could be developed for each design.

40|$|Most of {{the data}} sets {{available}} through the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) are based on <b>complex</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>designs</b> involving multi-stage <b>sampling,</b> stratification, and clustering. These complex designs require appropriate statistical techniques to calculate the variance. Stata employs specialized methods that appropriately adjust for the complex designs, while SPSS does not. Researchers using SPSS must obtain the design effects through NCES and adjust the standard errors generated by SPSS with these values. This presentation addresses {{the pros and cons}} of recommending Stata or SPSS to novice researchers. The first presenter teaches research methods to doctoral students and uses Stata to conduct research with NCES data. She uses SPSS to teach her research methods course, due to its user-friendly interface. The second presenter is a doctoral student conducting dissertation research with NCES data. In his professional life as an institutional researcher, he uses SPSS.

40|$|Permutation {{tests are}} a {{distribution}} free way of performing hypothesis tests. These tests {{rely on the}} condition that the observed data are exchangeable among the groups being tested under the null hypothesis. This assumption is easily satisfied for data obtained from a simple random sample or a controlled study after simple adjustments to the data, but there is no general method for adjusting survey data collected using a <b>complex</b> <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> to allow for permutation tests. In this article, we propose a general method for performing a pseudo- permutation test that accounts for the <b>complex</b> <b>sample</b> <b>design.</b> The proposed method is not a true permutation test in that the new values do not come from the set of observed values in general, but of an expanded set of values satisfying a random-effects model on the clustered residuals.

40|$|Multiple {{imputation}} (MI) is {{a well-established}} method to handle item-nonresponse in sample surveys. Survey {{data obtained from}} <b>complex</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>designs</b> often involve features that include unequal probability of selection, clustering and stratification. Because <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> features are frequently related to survey outcomes of interest, the theory of MI requires including them in the imputation model to reduce the risks of model misspecification and hence to avoid biased inference. However, in practice multiply-imputed datasets from <b>complex</b> <b>sample</b> <b>designs</b> are typically imputed under simple random sampling assumptions and then analyzed using methods that account for the design features. Less commonly-used alternatives such as including case weights and/or dummy variables for strata and clusters as predictors typically require interaction terms for more complex estimators such as regression coefficients, and can be vulnerable to model misspecification and difficult to implement. We develop a simple two-step MI framework that accounts for <b>complex</b> <b>sample</b> <b>designs</b> using a weighted finite population Bayesian bootstrap (FPBB) method to generate draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the population. Imputations may then be performed assuming IID data. We propose different variations of the weighted FPBB for different <b>sampling</b> <b>designs,</b> and evaluate these methods using three studies. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed methods have good frequentist properties and are robust to model misspecification compared to alternative approaches.

40|$|Key words: {{standard}} error, indices, analytical approach, replication methods Different {{types of}} indices {{are the most}} common output of the business short-term surveys. If these surveys are carried out {{on the basis of a}} random sample, all the estimates, calculated out of the sample data, contain sampling error. To have complete information on the quality and reliability of the published results it is necessary to estimate these sampling errors. There are two aspects of the indices as a statistical estimator that makes this task quite demanding: Index is a non-linear estimator and in the combination with the <b>complex</b> <b>sample</b> <b>design</b> we have by definition difficult situation for the variance estimation. Index is a ratio of two quantities estimated in two different time points, generally on the basis of two different samples. This fact is especially problematic when we want to use the standardised software for variance estimation since these applications are focused on the estimates based on a single sample. A lot of different approaches and various methods for the variance estimation have been developed especially for the case of non-linear estimation and <b>complex</b> <b>sample</b> <b>design.</b> In the paper we present the results of the comparison study of two approaches for the estimation of standard error of indices. The first method uses analytical approach where the taylor-linearization formulas for the estimation of the ratio are adopted for the specific of the estimation of indices.
