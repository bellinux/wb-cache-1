DNase expression is modulated in such diseases as acute myocardial infarction, transient myocardial ischemia, oral cancer, stomach cancer, and malignant lymphoma, and DNase I is used in <b>cystic</b> <b>fibroma</b> therapy. RNase is used to treat mesothelial cancer because of its antiproliferative, cytotoxic, and antineoplastic activities. Angiogenin, an angiogenic factor, {{is a member of the}} RNase A family. Angiogenin inhibitors are being developed as anticancer drugs. In this review, we describe fluorometric and electrochemical techniques for detecting DNase and RNase in disease. Oligonucleotides having fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) -causing chromophores are non-fluorescent by themselves, yet become fluorescent upon cleavage by DNase or RNase. These oligonucleotides serve as a powerful tool to detect activities of these enzymes and provide a basis for drug discovery. In electrochemical techniques, ferrocenyl oligonucleotides with or without a ribonucleoside unit are used for the detection of RNase or DNase. This technique has been used to monitor blood or serum samples in several diseases associated with DNase and RNase and is unaffected by interferents in these sample types...|$|E
40|$|Neoplasms in {{the goat}} are {{considered}} to be rare, as compared to other domesticated animals. Among caprine neoplasms, connective tissue tumours are more uncommon than those of epithelial origin [4]. The following is the first report of cystic osteofibromyxoma in an aged female goat. A single case of cystic osteofibromyxoma in a female goat was found after examination of about 30000 goats slaughtered during a period of 3 years at a local abattoir. There was a large pendulous lumpy mass about 10 inches in diameter just anterior to the udder. After removal of the skin, a tumourous mass was found adjacent to, but distinctly separated from the udder. The tumour was made of rounded sacs or cavity-like structures with a central fibrous band in the hollow space separating two tiers of cystic spaces. The lower cysts were filled with necrotic debris and fluid and the upper ones were made of various sizes of cysts containing clear fluid. The wall of the cavity consisted mainly of fibrous tissues admixed with rib-like osseous tissues. The specimen was fixed in 10 % formalin and processed by conventional techniques. Sections were cut at 5 - 6 pm in thickness and stained with haema-toxylin and eosin and Massonâ€™s trichrome. The wall of the sac showed neoplastic proliferation of fibrous tissue in fibroma accompanied by osseous plates in several places. Myxomatous trans-formations were also seen. The upper cysts showed a typical picture of <b>cystic</b> <b>fibroma</b> characterised by the haphazard arrangement of fibrous tissues with empty spaces in between. The lower cysts contained necrotic masses in the spaces. The prevalence of caprine neoplasm has not yet been determined. In India, tumours in the goats are reported to be 0. 8 - 0. 9 % out of total neo-plasms encountered in the species [4]. In the United States the number of goats with neoplasms out of the total goats slaughtered was 3 / 86 000 (0. 003 %) in 1958 [l] and 16 / 0. 51 million (0. 003 %) in 1967 [3]...|$|E
