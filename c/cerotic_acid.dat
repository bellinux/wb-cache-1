50|$|An {{approximate}} {{chemical formula}} for beeswax is C15H31COOC30H61. Its main components are palmitate, palmitoleate, and oleate esters of long-chain (30-32 carbons) aliphatic alcohols, with {{the ratio of}} triacontanyl palmitate CH3(CH2)29O-CO-(CH2)14CH3 to <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> CH3(CH2)24COOH, the two principal components, being 6:1.

50|$|Any {{of these}} {{aliphatic}} fatty acid chains may be glycerated {{and the resultant}} fats may have tails of different lengths from very short triformin to very long, e.g., <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid,</b> or hexacosanoic acid, a 26-carbon long-chain saturated fatty acid. Long chain fats are exemplified by tallow (lard) whose chains are 17 carbons long. Most fats found in food, whether vegetable or animal, {{are made up of}} medium to long-chain fatty acids, usually of equal or nearly equal length. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. Despite long-standing assertions to the contrary, fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells.|$|E

The powder is concentrated in a mortar, to be mixed with water and melted to produce liquid wax. After drying it is concentrated into chunks and sold.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) and <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 26 : 0) activating activities in rat-liver microsomes and peroxisomes. The activation of the two fatty acids showed similar dependencies on ATP and coenzyme A, reflected in about equal apparent Km values both in microsomes and peroxisomes. In microsomes and peroxisomes similar apparent Km values for palmitic acid were found (15 microM and 22. 8 microM, respectively), whereas apparent Km values for <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> were 8. 4 microM and 1. 0 microM in microsomes and peroxisomes, respectively. The activation of <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> {{was found to be}} inhibited to a progressively greater extent by increasing concentrations of 1 -pyrenedecanoic acid (P 10) as compared to the activation of palmitic acid, both in microsomes and peroxisomes. The inhibition by P 10 of palmitic acid activation and <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> activation was non-competitive in both organelles. From the observation that P 10 activation is not affected by palmitic acid and <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid,</b> we conclude that P 10 is activated by a distinct enzyme. Furthermore, our results are in accordance with earlier suggestions that activation of <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> is brought about by an enzyme distinct from the palmitoyl-CoA synthetas...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of sodium 2 -[5 -(4 -chlorophenyl) pentyl]oxirane- 2 -carboxylate (POCA), a potent {{inhibitor}} of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, on fatty acid oxidation by rat brain cells. In cultured glial cells {{as well as in}} dissociated brain cells from adult rats palmitic acid (16 : 0) oxidation was inhibited by about 85 % of control values when 25 microM POCA was added to the medium, whereas no inhibition of <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> (26 : 0) oxidation was observed. Furthermore, omission of carnitine from the culture medium resulted in a 57. 7 % decrease in palmitic acid oxidation in cultured glial cells, whereas <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation was not influenced. These results indicate that rat brain peroxisomes contribute only little (about 15 %) to palmitic acid oxidation and provide conclusive evidence that <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> is oxidized exclusively in rat brain peroxisome...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{fenoprofen}} on the activation of palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), lignoceric acid (C 24 : 0) and <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 26 : 0) in microsomal and peroxisomal fractions from rat liver. Fenoprofen was found to inhibit the formation of palmitoyl-CoA in both microsomal and peroxisomal fractions whereas the formation of lignoceroyl-CoA and cerotoyl-CoA was not inhibited at all. In freshly isolated rat hepatocytes palmitic acid beta-oxidation was progressively inhibited at increasing concentrations of fenoprofen, most probably due to its inhibitory effect on palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activity. On the other hand, fenoprofen was also found to inhibit the beta-oxidation of lignoceric acid and <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> in rat hepatocytes. It is shown that the acyl-CoA oxidase activity with lignoceroyl-CoA as substrate was inhibited by fenoprofen whereas the palmitoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase activities were not inhibited by fenoprofen.

40|$|Backgrounds/Aims: Colorectal cancer (CRC) cells {{show some}} {{alterations}} of lipid metabolism. Elongation of fatty acids (FA) {{has not been}} studied in CRC tissues thus far. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify if CRC specimens and normal colon mucosa differ in terms of their levels of very long-chain FAs, a product of FA elongation. Moreover, the expression of elongase genes has been studied in normal tissue and CRC. Finally, we searched for some specific products of FA elongation in serum of CRC patients. Methods: The specimens of normal colon mucosa and CRC were obtained from nineteen CRC patients differ in terms of FA elongation. We also searched for some specific products of FA elongation in serum of CRC patients and from healthy volunteers. Tissue and serum FA profiles were determined by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and the tissue expression of elongases (ELOVLs) was analyzed with real-time PCR. Results: Compared to normal colon tissue, CRC specimens showed significantly higher levels of 22 -, 24 - and 26 -carbon FAs, stronger expressions of ELOVL 1 and ELOVL 6 (4 - and 9 -fold elevated respectively), and higher values of 18 : 0 / 16 : 0 elongation index. We also demonstrated presence of <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> (26 : 0) in serum of all CRC patients but in none of the healthy controls. Conclusions: CRC tissue seems to be characterized by enhanced FA elongation (hyper-elongation). Presence of <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> in CRC patients sera and absence of this FA in healthy subjects points to this compound as a strong candidate for specific metabolic marker of colorectal malignancies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} cultured {{chorionic}} villous fibroblasts efficiently catalyse the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of hexacosanoic acid (<b>cerotic</b> <b>acid),</b> a saturated very long chain fatty acid containing 26 carbon atoms. Hexacosanoic beta-oxidation {{was found to be}} strongly impaired in cultured chorionic villous fibroblasts from a Zellweger foetus. This finding indicates that measurement of peroxisomal beta-oxidation can be used (in addition to measurement of acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase, de novo plasmalogen biosynthesis, the amount of particle-bound catalase and phytanic acid oxidase) for prenatal diagnosis in the first trimester of Zellweger syndrome, infantile Refsum disease and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy. The method should be equally applicable to the early prenatal diagnosis of disorders {{in which there is a}} deficiency of a single peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzyme. Such diseases include X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (peroxisomal very long chain fatty acyl CoA ligase deficiency), 'pseudo-Zellweger syndrome' (peroxisomal 3 -oxoacyl-CoA thiolase deficiency) and 'pseudo-neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy' (acyl-CoA oxidase deficiency...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the chain length of the free fatty acid FFA in a stratum corneum SC lipid model membrane composed of N amp; 945; hydroxyoctadecanoyl phytosphingosine CER [AP], cholesterol Ch, FFA and cholesterol sulphate ChS was investigated by neutron diffraction. The internal nanostructure of the SC lipid membrane {{in addition to the}} water distribution function was determined via calculation of the neutron scattering length density profile Fourier profile. The Fourier profiles of the studied SC model membranes revealed that such membranes have a repeat distance approximately equal to the membrane thickness. Increasing the chain length of the FFA in the CER[AP] based model membrane did not cause an alteration of the internal nanostructure but led to a decrease in the membrane repeat distance from 45. 6 amp;nbsp; palmitic acid, C 16 0 to 43. 7 amp;nbsp; <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid,</b> C 26 0 due to a partial interdigitation of the FFA chains. Ceramide [AP] forces the long chain fatty acids to incorporate into the unchanged spacing of the bilayer, thereby obligating the FFA protrude partly through opposing leaflet.

Therefore, the elongation of the chain length of the FFA decreases the solubility of the FFA in the SC model membrane based on CER[AP...|$|E
40|$|Background: Knowledge {{regarding}} the plasma fatty acid (FA) pattern {{in patients with}} liver cirrhosis is fragmentary. Objective: We evaluated plasma FA lipidome and its association with the prognosis of cirrhosis and severity of liver graft damage after transplantation. Design: In this observational study, plasma FA lipidome was investigated in 51 cirrhotic patients before liver transplantation and in 90 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. In addition, we studied ischemia-reperfusion damage in the liver of 38 patients for whom a graft biopsy was available at transplantation. With the use of logistic regression, we modeled the presence of cirrhosis, the dichotomized model for end-stage liver disease score below and above the median, {{and the presence of}} severe liver graft ischemia-reperfusion damage. Results: The FA pattern was markedly altered in cirrhotic patients, who showed, compared with healthy controls, higher monounsatu-rated FAs, lower n 26 and n 23 polyunsaturated FAs, and undetectable <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid.</b> Plasma di-homo-γ-linolenic acid was independently associated with the presence of cirrhosis (OR: 0. 026; 95 % CI: 0. 004, 0. 196; P< 0. 0001), severity of its prognosis (OR: 0. 041; 95 % CI: 0. 005, 0. 376; P = 0. 006), postreperfusion graft hepatocellular necrosis (OR: 0. 921; 95 % CI: 0. 851, 0. 997; P = 0. 043), and sinusoidal congestion (OR: 0. 954; 95 % CI: 0. 912, 0. 998; P = 0. 039). Associations of di-homo-γ-linolenic acid with the presence of cirrhosis and severity of its prognosis were confirmed also after false discovery rate correction. Conclusions: Cerotic and di-homo-γ-linolenic acids may serve as markers of disease and prognosis in liver cirrhosis. Dietary supplementation with di-homo-γ-linolenic acid could be a reasonable in-terventional strategy to delay disease progression in liver cirrhosis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1952 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the nature of the chemical constituents of incense cedar bark with the hope that such an endeavor would spur future research, development and use of a now neglected natural raw material. The bark from nine trees, which were separated into three age groups, was sampled from the bottom, middle and top sections. The age groups were 146 - 195 years, 261 - 285 years and 326 - 351 years. The nine samples were successively extracted with hexane, benzene, ethyl ether, hot water and 95 per cent ethanol to show the distribution and amounts of the extractives. The total extractive content varied between 13. 70 per cent for the bottom sample of the oldest age group and 30. 39 per cent for the top sample of the youngest age group. Similarly, the total extractive content of Port Orford cedar bark was found to range from 15. 49 per cent to 25. 69 per cent with the distribution corresponding closely to that of incense cedar. In both species, the greatest amount of extraneous material was removed with hot water and the variations between the total extractive content of the bottom and top samples were due primarily to the deviations in the amounts of this extract. The hexane extract was found to comprise 3. 53 per cent of the ovendry unextracted bark. The components of the hexane extract and the yields based on the oven-dry weight of the hexane solubles were: volatile oil, 0. 95 per cent; crystalline fatty ester, 5. 83 per cent; free acids, 46. 21 per cent; neutrals, 46. 67 per cent; and undetermined, 0. 34 per cent. Saponification of the crystalline fatty ester gave <b>cerotic</b> <b>acid</b> and an alcohol fraction equivalent to a mixture of behenyl and lignoceryl alcohols. The free acids were shown to contain 1. 93 per cent resin acids, 1. 11 per cent of a crystalline acid fraction equivalent to a mixture of behenic and lignoceric acids, and a fatty acid fraction, having a neutral equivalent of 435. 8 and a Hanus iodine number of 41. 2, which comprised 44. 28 per cent of the hexane solubles. The neutral fraction contained 25. 08 per cent combined acids, which had a neutral equivalent of 446. 6 and a Hanus iodine number of 80. 1, and 21. 59 per cent unsaponifiables from which a crystalline phytosterol was isolated in a yield of 1. 07 per cent of the hexane solubles. The yield of benzene soluble material was 2. 46 per cent of the ovendry unextracted bark. The major components of this extract were resin acids, present in both the free and combined forms. The yield of free resin acids was 64. 4 per cent of the benzene extract; the fraction melted at 181 - 182 ° C., had a neutral equivalent of 347. 7 and was optically active. The combined resin acids comprised 7. 8 per cent of the benzene solubles. They melted at 151 - 152 ° C., had a neutral equivalent of 358. 0 and were optically active. The remainder of the benzene extract was found to contain 8. 2 per cent free fatty acids, 10. 8 per cent combined fatty acids and 8. 2 per cent unsaponifiables. The tannin content of incense cedar bark ranged from 3. 5 to 7. 8 per cent, whereas that of Port Orford cedar varied between 4. 2 and 7. 0 per cent. These tannin yields are insufficient for economical commercial extraction. A crude carbohydrate material was obtained with hot water in a yield of approximately nine per cent of the oven-dry weight of unextracted bark. It contained 65. 9 per cent reducing sugars, 24. 0 per cent tannin and 10. 2 per cent insolubles. The composition of the reducing sugars based on the crude carbohydrate material was: pentosans, 13. 46 per cent; mannans, 3. 09 per cent; galactans, 21. 50 per cent; uronic anhydride, 1. 87 per cent; and glucosans, 25. 98 per cent. A composite sample of unextracted bark contained 14. 93 per cent alcohol-benzene solubles; 3. 04 per cent alcohol solubles, 7. 47 per cent hot-water solubles, 37. 06 per cent lignin, 36. 40 per cent holocellulose, 8. 51 per cent pentosans, 2. 69 per cent methoxyl, 0. 59 per cent acetyl, and 0. 97 per cent ash...|$|E
