40|$|The present {{invention}} discloses a Micro-Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS) device {{suitable for}} use in a range of applications from DC, such as switching electrical signal lines, to RF applications such as tunable capacitors and switches. In an embodiment of the invention, the device comprises a bottom substrate and a top substrate separated at a fixed distance from each other. Disposed between the substrates is a flexible S-shaped membrane having an electrode or an electrically conducting electrode layer with one end attached to the top substrate and the other end in contact with the bottom substrate. An electrically conducting <b>contact</b> <b>block</b> is attached to the underside of the membrane actuator for short circuiting a signal line when the switch is in the closed position. When a voltage is applied between the membrane and an electrode layer on the bottom substrate, the membrane is induced by electrostatic force to deflect in a rolling wave-like motion such that the <b>contact</b> <b>block</b> is displaced into contact with the signal line. The device can be actively opened when a voltage is applied between the membrane actuator and a electrode layer on the top substrate causing the <b>contact</b> <b>block</b> to displace upward breaking contact with the signal line.

The charge self-consistency of the coupled CBR-Poisson equations is achieved by using the predictor-corrector iteration scheme with the optional Anderson acceleration. In addition, we introduce a new way to convert an equilibrium electrostatic barrier potential calculated from an external simulator to an effective doping profile, which is then used by the CBR-Poisson code for transport simulation of the barrier under non-zero biases. The code has been applied to simulate the quantum transport in a double barrier structure and across a tunnel barrier in a silicon double quantum dot.

40|$|Numerical {{utilities}} of the <b>Contact</b> <b>Block</b> Reduction (CBR) {{method in}} evaluating the retarded Green's function, are discussed for 3 -D multi-band open systems that are represented by the atomic tight-binding (TB) and continuum k (KP) band model. It is shown that the methodology to approximate solutions of open systems which has been already reported for the single-band effective mass model, cannot be directly used for atomic TB systems, since {{the use of a}} set of zincblende crystal grids makes the inter-coupling matrix be non-invertible. We derive and test an alternative with which the CBR method can be still practical in solving TB systems. This multi-band CBR method is validated by a proof of principles on small systems, and also shown to work excellent with the KP approach. Further detailed analysis on the accuracy, speed, and scalability on high performance computing clusters, is performed with respect to the reference results obtained by the state-of- the-art Recursive Green's Function and Wavefunction algorithm. This work shows that the CBR method could be particularly useful in calculating resonant tunneling features, but show a limited practicality in simulating field effect transistors (FETs) when the system is described with the atomic TB model. Coupled to the KP model, however, the utility of the CBR method can be extended to simulations of nanowire FETs. Comment: 10 Pages, 9 Figure...|$|E
40|$|Due to a {{continuous}} device downscaling, a precise control of dopant placements {{has become a}} critical factor to determine device performances. Recent progresses in the Scanning Tunneling Microscope lithography control dopant positions within a few atomic layers and have led experimentalists to propose various prototypes of planar patterned densely phosphorous δ-doping silicon (Si:P) devices. Theoretical understanding of electronic properties in such systems based on a realistic modeling approach is critical for potential device designs. Si:P devices are studied with the atomistic tight-binding (TB) approach coupled to charge-potential self-consistent simulations. The dispersion of a 1 / 4 mono-layer (ML) doped Si:P doping plane is simulated and compared to the previous literatures to validate our methodology. Upon the methodological validation, dispersions of 1 / 4 ML doped ultra-narrow nanowires (NWs) are studied to explain experimentally observed metallic properties. Predicted channel conductances agree well with measured values. Then, a single donor quantum dot device with Si:P NW leads, is modeled to confirm the experimentally realized device is indeed a single atom transistor. Predicted charging energy and gate-control over the channel ground state establish strong connections to the experimental results. Finally, the numerical practicality of the <b>Contact</b> <b>Block</b> Reduction (CBR) method in simulating electron resonance tunneling features, is examined using Si:P NWs as examples. Based on a proof of principles on small TB systems, we show the CBR method can be practical on supercomputing clusters, due a better scalability than the one observed from the Recursive Greens Function and Wavefunction algorithm. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{interactions}} occurring between {{biological systems}} and the surface of biomaterials has been an area of strong research focus {{for a number of}} decades. There has been a realisation of the importance of macromolecular interactions and a consequent need to understand biointerfacial events at the nanometer length-scale. A set of tools for working at the nanometer scale are critical for the study, design and evaluation of new biomaterials for application to improve medical devices and therapies {{and there has been a}} significant research drive to develop engineering approaches able to perform in the nanometer regime. One such engineering approach to nanopattern model biomaterial interfaces over large areas is colloidal lithography. In this thesis work colloidal lithography is extended from metals and ceramics for use with organic materials including bulk homopolymers, thin films of both homopolymers and block copolymers and monolayers of proteins. Large area arrays of topographic nanostructures with a range of aspect ratios and shapes are demonstrated by systematic control of processing parameters. Templating of block copolymers via topographic or chemical nanopatterns was shown and a templated PLL-g-PEG layer was subsequently used to create large area nanopatterns of the protein Laminin. A novel approach to quantifying protein binding from AFM height histograms was developed and utilised to characterise the functional properties of the surface bound Laminin. Artificial nanostructured biointerfaces produced by these approaches giving nanoscale topographic or chemical cues were used to study the influence of nanoscale surface structures on the behaviour of adherent cells in culture. Significant changes in cellular morphology and cytoskeletal arrangement were observed which correlated to reduced focal adhesion formation. Cells adherent to nanopatterns of protein adhesive domains and high aspect ratio (< 1) cylindrical nanostructures showed similar behaviour suggesting that effects of nanoscale topography in biointerfaces research may relate to their presentation of non-specifically bound protein adsorbing from the extra cellular matrix in a particular 3 D architecture with resultant influences on availability of those proteins to interact with cells.

30|$|We {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} obtaining large photoresponse in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM)type single nanowire device where one <b>contact</b> can be <b>blocking</b> type. We showed that suitable modification of the <b>blocking</b> <b>contact</b> by deposition of a capping metal using focused electron beam (FEB) can lead to considerable enhancement of the photoresponse. The work was done in a single Cu:TCNQ nanowire device fabricated by direct growth of nanowires (NW) from pre-patterned Cu electrode which makes the contact ohmic with the other contact made from Au. Analysis of the data shows that the large photoresponse of the devices arises predominantly due to reduction of the barriers at the Au/NW <b>blocking</b> <b>contact</b> on illumination. This {{is caused by the}} diffusion of the photo generated carriers from the nanowires to the contact region. When the barrier height is further reduced by treating the contact with FEB deposited Pt, this results in a large enhancement in the device photoresponse.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{wavelength}} tunability {{has long}} been the holy grail of photodetector technology. Because of its atomic thickness and unique properties, graphene opens up new paradigms to realize this concept, but so far this has been elusive experimentally. Here we employ detailed quantum transport modeling of photocurrent in graphene field-effect transistors (including realistic electromagnetic fields) to show that wavelength tunability is possible by dynamically changing the gate voltage. We reveal the phenomena that govern the behavior of this type of device and show significant departure from the simple expectations based on vertical transitions. We find strong focusing of the electromagnetic fields at the contact edges over the same length scale as the band-bending. Both of these spatially-varying potentials lead to an enhancement of non-vertical optical transitions, which dominate even the absence of phonon or impurity scattering. We also show that the vanishing density of states near the Dirac point leads to <b>contact</b> <b>blocking</b> and a gate-dependent modulation of the photocurrent.

40|$|Adjusting {{the work}} {{function}} of the two electrodes to the energy levels of the intrinsic active materials of an organic solar cell is crucial for a good device performance. Often, injection barriers (in combination with selective <b>contacts</b> <b>blocking</b> one charge carrier species) caused by a misaligned metal work function or extraction barriers resulting from insulating intentional or unintentional interlayers between metal and active layers, result in a decrease in fill factor seen in the extreme case in S-shaped current–voltage (J–V) characteristics. To avoid this S-kink, {{it is essential to}} identify its origin, desirably applying a simple experimental method. We propose an approach based on analyses of current–voltage data as a function of illumination intensity. A normalization of the J–V curves at the saturated photocurrent reveals distinctive features for each type of barrier. We apply the method to planar heterojunction small-molecule and bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells with oxidized metal electrode or plasma-treated active layer and explain the theory with a drift-diffusion model.
