40|$|Abstract This project {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of raw materials properties and heat-treatment temperature on the reactivity of carbon anodes. The properties of the raw materials such as structure, porosity, and chemical purity have strong effects on the final properties of the carbon anode composites. These properties {{interact with each other}} during the heat-treatment processes of the anode fabrication process, and may further interact during the reaction of carbon anodes under different gaseous atmospheres. Understanding the effects of these factors on reactivity is important in order to develop high oxidation resistance carbon anodes. There are great potential economic benefits from using high oxidation resistance carbon anodes in the aluminium smelting process, as well as reducing green house gas emission. A high-sulfur petroleum coke (~ 3. 2 wt % S) and a low-sulfur petroleum coke (~ 1. 7 wt % S) with various metal microconstituents in different quantities are used to study the effect of chemical purity. These <b>cokes</b> were <b>calcined</b> at multiple heat-treatment temperatures. A suite of 24 simulated carbon anodes was produced from these <b>calcined</b> petroleum <b>cokes</b> at multiple baking heat-treatment temperatures. The effect of heat-treatment temperature {{on the development of the}} structure and porosity of these samples were studied using various techniques including gas adsorption, XRD, SEM, and TEM. The TGA method was used to measure the reactivity of the coke and simulated carbon anode samples. Sulfur was found to act as both a catalyst and an inhibitor to the gasification reactions. In air gasification, cokes and simulated anodes with high-sulfur content are four times more reactive than cokes and simulated anodes with low-sulfur content. On the basis of chemical structure analysis, the excess sulfur lowers the activation energy of the carbon-oxygen reaction by destabilizing the bonds of the adjacent carbons in the aromatic ring structure, allowing more active sites to form. In CO 2 gasification, cokes and anodes with high-sulfur content are less reactive than cokes and anodes with low-sulfur content. Sulfur is believed to inhibit the catalytic activity of metals such as sodium by forming non-mobile stable metal sulphide complexes. In addition, it was found that excess heat treatment enhanced the catalytic activity of low sulfur based carbons. Some metal complexes such as nickel nitrides destabilized during high temperature heat treatment and become active toward the carbon-CO 2 reaction. The calcination level of petroleum cokes was found to have strong influence on the structural development of simulated carbon anodes. Simulated anode composites made from lower temperature <b>calcined</b> <b>cokes</b> contained a better developed structure than simulated anode composites made from higher temperature <b>calcined</b> <b>cokes.</b> This was mainly due to the underdeveloped structure of lower temperature <b>calcined</b> <b>cokes.</b> On the basis that the under-calcined cokes have similar chemical structure to the binder pitch, the cokes formed stronger bonds with the binder pitch matrix as the composite structure developed during the heat treatment baking process. These under-calcined coke-based simulated anode composites were found to have better oxidation resistance than the simulated anode composites made from higher temperature <b>calcined</b> <b>cokes.</b> The evolution of pore structure and crystalline structure during gasification is investigated. The results showed that gasification in air produced slightly different structural development than gasification in CO 2. Because oxygen is more reactive than CO 2, it prefers to attack the most reactive parts of the carbon structure such as disorganized carbon and smaller crystallites while CO 2 attacks the carbon structure more uniformly. As a result, oxygen creates more porosity during gasification than CO 2. This observation was demonstrated with the simulated anode composites made from high temperature <b>calcined</b> <b>cokes.</b> Due to the mismatch properties between different components in these simulated anode composites, more porosity development occurred in air gasification than in CO 2 gasification. Another important finding is that the pitch component is completely removed from the anode structure by about 50 % solid conversion in both gasification processes. The findings in this project suggested that new processing conditions may be applied to produce anodes with high oxidation resistance. Unlike the current practice of optimizing the properties of one key component in the anode composites, it is better to minimize the differences in properties between different components in the anode composites. This includes the use of low temperature <b>calcined</b> <b>cokes</b> and a careful consideration of the chemical impurity of the raw materials...|$|R

De-ashing of the feedstock would be necessary to produce anode grade fillers for the aluminium industry.

The heavy petroleum residues (also known as heavy fuel oil) are currently used as bunker fuel in the shipping industry and are responsible for substantial air pollution.

40|$|Carbon {{required}} for the reduction of alumina by electrolysis in the Hall-Héroult process is supplied by the anode. Anodes are produced from a mixture of petroleum coke with coal tar pitch as the binder. The minimum theoretical carbon consumption is 0. 334 kg C/kg Al. But due to current efficiency and oxidation losses the consumption is typically 400 kg C/kg Al. Petroleum coke is a by-product from crude oil refineries, but as its value represents only about 2 per cent of the overall production it has a limited interest to the producers. Mechanical and physical properties of coke {{are influenced by the}} crude oil, processes within the refineries and calcining of the coke. Continuous high demand for <b>calcined</b> <b>coke</b> by aluminium smelters has created a difficult situation with respect to quality and availability, leading to the use of lower quality coke in aluminium smelters and potential disturbances in the production. Understanding the consequences of varying <b>calcined</b> <b>coke</b> qualities is crucial for to possibly compensate and adjust process parameters in the subsequent use of the coke, in order to obtain economical production of aluminium. In the present work, the subject of study was four different petroleum coke types, where three were derived from a single source (SSA, SSB and SSC) and one was from a blend of different cokes. All of the cokes had different chemical and physical properties. Single source cokes have homogenous chemical and physical composition in the whole size range while the blended coke had heterogeneous composition due to the mixture of different coke types used. The blended coke consisted of several different coke types (25) {{in order to meet the}} required specification. This work also describes new characterisation/measurement methods which can contribute to a better understanding of variations in material properties due to physical and mechanical changes in the <b>calcined</b> <b>coke</b> feed materials. Each step in the production of pilot scale anodes is described. A new method was developed for the characterisation of the mechanical strength of <b>calcined</b> <b>coke.</b> This method, the drop test, originates from the study of materials for road construction for the determination of the grain stability of rock materials. The method determines the coke grain strength in the entire size distribution. On the other hand, established measuring methods for <b>calcined</b> <b>coke,</b> HGI (ASTM D 5003 - 95) and grain stability (ISO 10142), determine only the mechanical strength in a specific size range, + 0. 6 - 1. 18 mm and + 4 - 8 mm, respectively. In other words, both methods give limited information about coke mechanical strength distribution throughout the whole size range, which is especially important when blended cokes are used. Additionally, the results from the drop test are expressed in volume reduction, size reduction, impact force and amount of fines below 148 μm generated during the test. A good correlation between ISO 10142 and the drop test was found. The results show good correlation between the size and volume reduction and the specific grinding energy. The method can also determine the grain strength of a specific size fraction which might be critical to further processing during anode production. Totally, about 8 tons of four <b>calcined</b> <b>coke</b> types were processed during this work. The majority of this material was ground in the air swept ball mill, for production of the finest fraction, dust. The pilot scale air swept ball mill circuit is identical to the equipment used in industry today. This investigation showed the importance of process optimisation for the stable production of dust with the required specification (particle size and Blaine). Each coke exhibited different behaviour in the grinding circuit, due to different mechanical strengths, which is reported as a specific grinding energy. The mechanically weakest coke produced dust with the lowest specific grinding energy. The particle size variation in the coke used in the mill produced a significant disturbance in the product quality. It was found that the sweeping speed through the mill influences the particle size distribution in terms of the proportion of the finest particles. It also affected the particle roundness of the produced dust, which can influence the flowability of the coke when mixed with pitch. The ratio of ball sizes and the rotational speed of the mill influenced the particle size distribution, Blaine and specific grinding energy. On-line particle size control was utilised during the dust production. This system allowed continuous control of the product size by regulation of the air classifier rotor speed. Three different dust sizes were produced in the air swept ball mill, which were all below about 200 μm but contained different proportions of material below 63 μm. Sieved coke fractions together with dust were weighed according to a specified recipe and blended in a sigma blade mixer together with coal tar pitch. A vibration compactor was used for the production of green anodes under optimal conditions. The anodes were produced with three different pitch contents (15, 18 and 20 wt%) and three different dust sizes (45, 63 and 94 %, - 63 μm). Core samples of green anodes were investigated in an improved dilatometer for the determination of thermal expansion and shrinkage during baking. Improvements made to the dilatometer during this work contributed to better reproducibility, increased precision and a healthier working environment. An increase in the heating rate influenced the initial expansion, shrinkage and baking loss of the anode. The heterogeneous pitch distribution throughout the anode due to the forming force, friction between coke particles and between the paste and mould showed the importance of selecting a consistent sampling position. The results showed that the bottom samples have greater expansion due to a thicker pitch bridge layer while the top samples have reduced expansion. The sample packing material contributed to a higher initial expansion due to the reduced free surface area for binder volatiles release, and the shrinkage was reduced because of the radial thrusts from the packing material. Thermal dilation results showed differences between samples with varying pitch, dust size and coke type, which can be used to indicate the final properties of baked anodes. A good correlation was found between the thermal dilation after the pitch expansion and the dust content. Green anodes were baked under controlled conditions and then characterised. The baked apparent density showed a good correlation with the pitch content and dust size. The results showed that 18 % pitch content and 63 % - 63 μm produced the highest baked densities. The variation in coke type exhibited differences in baked density, specific electrical resistance, air permeability, CO 2 and air reactivity and modulus of elasticity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

This study focuses on investigating potential energy savings by replacing inner one third of existing bricks with higher thermal capacity (Cp) and/or higher thermal conductivity (k) bricks. This investigation is motivated by postulating that the bricks with higher thermal capacity can store more thermal energy {{during the period of}} contacting with the hot gas and release more heat to the cock bed when the bricks rotate to below and in contact with the coke bed. A rotational, transient marching conduction numerical simulation is conducted using the commercial software FLUENT. The impact of brick heat capacity and thermal conductivity on transporting thermal energy to the coke bed is analyzed. The results show: (a) Increasing the heat capacity of brick layer reduces brick temperature which helps increase the heat transfer between the hot gas and brick, in other words it does help brick store more heat from the hot gas, but, heat transfer between brick and coke is reduced, which is opposite to the original postulation. (b) Higher brick thermal conductivity decreases brick temperature thus increases heat transfer between hot gas and the brick layer. The heat transfer from brick to coke bed is also increased, but not significantly. (c) Usually a brick with a higher Cp value also has a higher k-value.

Direct heating geometries include the Shell in-situ conversion process (ICP) using down hole electric heaters in vertical holes and the ExxonMobil Electrofrac (EF) approach using longitudinal vertical fractures created from horizontal wells and propped with electrically conductive material such as <b>calcined</b> <b>coke.</b> Indirect heating approaches propose injection and circulation of steam or a non-condensable gas like CO_(2). These include the Chevron CRUSH concept of creating horizontal fractures from vertical wells or the Texas A&M University (TAMU) concept using multiple vertical transverse fractures penetrated by horizontal wells (MTFH). The objective of this study is to compare energy efficiency of various in-situ retorting technologies for different heating schemes and well configurations using the commercial adaptive-implicit thermal simulator, STARS of Computer Modelling Group Ltd. (CMG). STARS is a three phase multi-component thermal simulator and is based on vapor-liquid distribution ratio of a component, K values to perform phase equilibrium calculation instead of using the Equation of state (EOS). Shell has applied CMG ?STARS to model its in-situ upgrading project, but is yet to publish details on the input parameters used for modeling. As such, the various thermo-physical parameters like thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, porosity, permeability needed for the numerical simulation are obtained by extensive literature survey of various oil shale deposits in Green river formation of USA. Using CMG ?STARS, we have built and validated simulation model to replicate Shell?s in-situ Conversion Process (ICP) in the Mahogany Demonstration Project South (MDPS). A sensitivity analysis of direct heating pattern and spacing reproduces previous work. Then the validated model is used to evaluate the size and fracture spacing sufficient to heat the oil shale in other direct and indirect heating approaches and to compare pressurized hot fluid circulation to heating elements on terms of hydrocarbon production and energy efficiency while keeping all the model inputs similar for each method. This research also enables oil shale well design recommendations for direct and indirect heating methodologies considering the depth of the reservoir and, for indirect heating, the pressure and temperature for the circulation fluid...|$|E
40|$|In the Hall-Héroult {{process for}} primary {{production}} of aluminium, {{a considerable amount}} of anode carbon is lost through unwanted gasification in air and CO 2. The carbon gasification reactions are catalyzed by a number of inorganic impurities normally present in the anodes. Some of these impurities follow the anode raw materials while others are introduced during the anode manufacturing process. The aim of this work is to obtain a fundamental knowledge of how the bath compounds: AlF 3, Al 2 O 3, NaF, Na 3 AlF 6 and CaF 2, which may be introduced in various amounts to prebaked anodes through the addition of recycled anode butts, influence the air and CO 2 reactivity of anode carbon. In order to avoid the disturbing and possibly masking effect of other impurities normally present in industrial anode materials, this work uses cokes made by carbonization of high purity carbon precursors (tar oil/petroleum pitch) in a laboratory scale coke reactor. Known amounts of fluoride salts or the corresponding metal acetylacetonates are added to the liquid precursor prior to carbonization. “High”-sulfur cokes are prepared by also adding 4. 5 weight percent dibenzothiophene to the precursor (corresponds to an addition of 1 wt% elemental sulfur). The <b>calcined</b> <b>coke</b> samples are characterized in terms of reactivity towards air and CO 2 gasification, size and shape of optical texture units and degree of turbostratic order. Scanning electron microscopy and surface area measurements are used to study the surface textural changes resulting from the catalyzed gasification. The extent of gasification inside industrial prebaked and Søderberg anodes is investigated by characterizing anode core samples in terms of air permeabilities, contamination profiles and reactivities towards air and CO 2 gasification. The characteristics are related to findings from electron microscopy examinations. COKES DOPED WITH SODIUM ACETYLACETONATE, SODIUM FLUORIDE AND CRYOLITE Sodium acetylacetonate decomposes completely to sodium carbonate during carbonization and calcination of the coke samples. At the initial stages of gasification, the sodium carbonate particles decompose to a sodium oxide phase, which catalyzes the air and CO 2 gasification reactions strongly. Sodium fluoride and cryolite also act as strong gasification catalysts. Due to formation of higher amounts of inhibiting fluorine gases (COF 2, AlOF 2), the cryolite doped cokes are less reactive than the corresponding sodium fluoride cokes. The difference between the two coke series is especially pronounced during air gasification. The air reactivity of the sodium-doped cokes is markedly reduced when 4. 5 weight percent dibenzothiophene is added to the coke precursors prior to carbonization. During carbonization, the sulfur is stabilized in large aromatic molecules and it is only liberated when the carbon matrix is gasified. The free sulfur adsorbs on the active sites of the sodium particles and lowers their catalytic activity. The Na-S adsorption complexes are thermally unstable at the CO 2 gasification temperature (960 °C) and the CO 2 gasification rates are therefore not affected by the dibenzothiophene additions.

There are no cocatalytic effects between calcium and sodium i. e. the catalytic activity of calcium is not affected by the concurrent presence of sodium and vice versa. GAS REACTIVITY OF INDUSTRIAL ANODES The carbon dioxide produced at the anode working surface, percolates through the open porosity of the anodes and reacts with accessible carbon in the lower parts. Airburn is mainly of concern at the exposed parts of prebaked anodes (anode tops and the sides near the tapping positions) and under the gas skirts of the Søderberg anodes. From air permeability measurements and electron microscopy examinations, internal CO 2 gasification is found to occur in the lower 3 – 5 cm of prebaked anodes. Depending on the anode top surface temperature, air gasification may occur as deep as 4 cm below the anode top surface. In Søderberg anodes the extent of internal CO 2 gasification strongly depends on the gas permeability of the anode. In high-permeability Søderberg anodes, CO 2 gasification may occur as far as 60 cm above the working surface. Higher up, the temperature is normally too low for gasification. In some particular low-permeability Søderberg anodes (permeability resembling “bad” prebaked anodes), internal CO 2 gasification is limited to the lower 15 – 20 cm of the anodes. In both prebaked and Søderberg anodes, the more reactive binder coke is selectively gasified. Since much of the binder phase in the lower parts of the high-permeability Søderberg anodes is consumed, substantial dusting is expected from the working surface of these anodes. In the prebaked anodes, the binder phase is mostly structurally intact. Catalytically active sodium and calcium impurities are mainly introduced to prebaked anodes via the addition of butts. Pot-room dust is an important contamination source in Søderberg anodes. Additionally, the lower parts of especially the high-permeability Søderberg anodes are contaminated by gaseous sodium and aluminium bath species that penetrates into the anode open porosity and condense within the anodes. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
5000|$|ExxonMobil Electrofrac uses {{a series}} of {{fractures}} created in the oil shale formation. Preferably these fractures should be longitudinal vertical fractures created from horizontal wells and conducting electricity from the heel to the toe of each heating well. For conductivity, an electrically-conductive material such as <b>calcined</b> petroleum <b>coke</b> is injected into the wells in fractures, forming a heating element. [...] Heating wells are placed in a parallel row with a second horizontal well intersecting them at their toe. This allows opposing electrical charges to be applied at either end. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that electrical continuity is unaffected by kerogen conversion and that hydrocarbons are expelled from heated oil shale even under in situ stress. [...] Planar heaters should be used because they require fewer wells than wellbore heaters and offer a reduced surface footprint. The shale oil is extracted by separate dedicated production wells.|$|R
50|$|Prebaked anodes {{are divided}} into {{graphitized}} and coke types. For manufacturing of the graphitized anodes, anthracite and petroleum <b>coke</b> are <b>calcined</b> and classified. They are then mixed with coal-tar pitch and pressed. The pressed green anode is then baked at 1200 °C and graphitized. Coke anodes are made of <b>calcined</b> petroleum <b>coke,</b> recycled anode butts, and coal-tar pitch (binder). The anodes are manufactured by mixing aggregates with coal tar pitch to form a paste with a doughy consistency. This material is most often vibro-compacted but in some plants pressed. The green anode is then sintered at 1100-1200 °C for 300-400 hours, without graphitization, to increase its strength through decomposition and carbonization of the binder. Higher baking temperatures increase the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, and decrease the air and CO2 reactivity. The specific electrical resistance of the coke-type anodes is {{higher than that of}} the graphitized ones, but they have higher compressive strength and lower porosity.|$|R
40|$|Wood {{charcoal}} is {{an attractive}} alternative to petroleum coke in production of carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting process. <b>Calcined</b> petroleum <b>coke</b> is the major component in the anode recipe and its consumption results in a direct greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint for the industry. Charcoal, on the other hand, is considered as a green and abundant source of sulfur-free carbon. However, its amorphous carbon structure and high contents of alkali and alkaline earth metals (e. g., Na and Ca) make charcoal highly reactive to air and CO 2. Acid washing and heat treatment were employed {{in order to reduce}} the reactivity of charcoal. The pre-treated charcoal was used to substitute up to 10 % of coke in the anode recipe in an attempt to investigate the effect of this substitution on final anode properties. The results showed deterioration in the anode properties by increasing the charcoal content. However, by adjusting the anode recipe, this negative effect can be considerably mitigated. Increasing the pitch content was found to be helpful to improve the physical properties of the anodes containing charcoal...|$|R

During non-isothermal oxidation test up to 1400 °C in air atmosphere, oxidation {{behavior of the}} C/B 4 C/SiC composite was clarified by means of calculation of kinetic parameters using experimental data of mass change, gas formation of CO 2, and oxygen gas consumption. Amount of the matrix carbon oxidized above 800 °C in the composite with SiC particle of 0. 4 µm and 0. 9 µm in size was less than that in the composite with SiC particle of 50 nm and 1. 8 µm in size. The oxidation of the matrix carbon was shown to depend upon the formation of B 2 O 3 glass below 800 °C oxidation, and that of SiO 2 glass above 800 °C.
