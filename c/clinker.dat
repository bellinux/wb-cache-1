5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with <b>clinker</b> (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the <b>clinker</b> planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true <b>clinker</b> technique.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron hosts {{numerous}} sailing regattas featuring <b>clinker</b> built boats {{unique to}} the area; there is a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone. Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy, fishing for pollock, coley and mackerel; wrasse, bass, mullet and gurnard are also possible. Bass and coley can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago; and wrasse, pollock and mackerel are plentiful. Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd, but pollock, mackerel, wrasse and conger are caught; huss are plentiful; and ling are found occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Cementco {{continued}} to transport coral until the mid-1980s, when QCL {{was acquired by}} the firm Holderbank and another ship was purchased to transport <b>clinker</b> to the company's new factory at Gladstone. She was subsequently laid up at Mary Street Wharf while {{attempts were made to}} sell her; during this period she was renamed Crusader II to avoid confusion with a new ship named Cementco. A buyer was not found, and in 1986 Cementco was sunk at Flinders Reef off Cape Moreton where she later became a popular dive wreck.|$|E

[...] This hopper is always filled with water to quench the ash and <b>clinkers</b> falling down from the furnace. Some arrangement is included to crush the <b>clinkers</b> and for conveying the crushed <b>clinkers</b> and bottom ash to a storage site.

40|$|Abstract The {{trace element}} content of <b>clinkers</b> (and {{possibly}} of cements) {{can be used}} to identify the manufacturing factory. The Mg, Sr, Ba, Mn, Ti, Zr, Zn and V content of <b>clinkers</b> give detailed information for the determination of the origin of <b>clinkers</b> produced in different factories. However, for the analysis of such complex data {{there is a need for}} algorithmic tools for the visualization and clustering of the samples. This paper proposes a new approach for this purpose. The analytical data are transformed into a twodimensional latent space by factor analysis (probabilistic principal component analysis) and dendograms are constructed for cluster formation. The classification of South African <b>clinkers</b> is used as an illustrative example for the approach...|$|R
40|$|Yeelimite-containing cements are {{attracting}} {{attention for}} their tailored properties. Calcium sulfoaluminate, CSA, cements have high contents of Yeelimite {{and they are}} used for special applications. Belite calcium sulfoaluminate, BCSA or sulfobelite, cements have high contents of belite and intermediate contents of Yeelimite, and they may become an alternative to OPC. Here, we report Rietveld quantitative phase analyses for three commercially available CSA <b>clinkers,</b> one CSA cement, and two laboratory-prepared iron-rich BCSA <b>clinkers.</b> The crystalline phases are reported and quantified. Selective dissolutions are employed for BCSA <b>clinkers</b> to firmly establish their phases. Finally, the overall unaccounted contents (amorphous plus crystalline not quantified) have been determined by two approaches: i) external standard procedure (G-method) with reflection data; ii) internal standard procedure (spiking method with ZnO) with transmission data. The overall unaccounted contents for CSA <b>clinkers</b> were ~ 10 wt. %. Conversely, the unaccounted contents for BCSA <b>clinkers</b> were higher, ~ 25 wt. %. Universidad de Málaga.

5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of <b>clinker</b> had built up inside the flues.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved {{at the time and}} subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but {{there was no evidence that}} Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a bilge pump and the lower part of the main mast, both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows suggests that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader Margaret Rule. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was <b>clinker</b> built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the rough handling by Deane the Mary Rose escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, Canadian {{volcanologist}} William Henry Mathews (1919–2003) identified Mount Price as <b>Clinker</b> Mountain {{in articles}} and journals. The name Mount Price was adopted on September 2, 1930 after {{a committee of}} the Garibaldi Park Board {{was set up to}} deal with nomenclature. It was requested that the Geographic Board of Canada to adopt Mount Price for this mountain after Thomas E. Price, a former mountaineer and engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway. <b>Clinker</b> Peak and <b>Clinker</b> Ridge were both officially named on September 12, 1972 to retain Price's earlier name <b>Clinker</b> Mountain.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{technological}} value is discussed. On that basis, {{a method of}} assessing the technological value of coal is recommended. The technological value of the basic <b>clinkering</b> coal in coking batch (Zh, GZh coal) is assessed. Similar estimates are presented for poorly coking GZhO and Zh coal, with somewhat inferior <b>clinkering</b> properties. Three levels of technological value are identified for <b>clinkering</b> coal: the first level includes Zh and GZh coal from enterprises in the Kuznets and Pechorsk basins; the second includes GZhO coal from the Raspadskaya and Vorgashorskaya mines; and the third includes G coal from the Kirov mine.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the laboratory scale {{study on the}} preparation of ecocement <b>clinkers,</b> whose main mineral is alinite, from {{municipal solid waste incineration}} fly ash. X-ray diffraction technique was used to monitor the phase formation during the burning of raw mixes. Effects of compositions, firing time and firing temperature on the properties of <b>clinkers</b> have been investigated. The hydration behaviour of the ecocement obtained from the optimized <b>clinkers</b> was also studied. From the results it is observed that the characteristics of the <b>clinkers</b> are strongly dependent on the raw mix compositions and firing temperature but not so much on firing time. The desirable <b>clinkers</b> can be obtained by firing the raw mix at 1, 200 A degrees C for 1 h and controlling the compositional parameters KH (lime saturation moduli) around 1. 02, a (silica-alumina ratio) around 4. 50, Cl (Chlorides content) around 7. 6 % and m (MgO content) around 1. 40 %.

25|$|A further {{development}} {{was the use}} of timber frames, to which the planks could be lashed, stitched or nailed. With the use of frames, it is possible to develop carvel-style and clinker-style planking (in the USA the term lapstrake is used instead of <b>clinker).</b> Scandinavians were using <b>clinker</b> construction by at least 350 BC.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clinkers</b> {{consist of}} bits and ends, field-late and white-burning or red-burning clays. Through {{different}} mixtures {{of the raw}} ingredients, many varied colour nuances can be achieved. For the production of masonry units the source materials—clay and water—are mixed and formed industrially in a string extrusion process. For special purposes, for example the restoration of listed buildings, hand-formed <b>clinkers</b> are used. During the drying process, the water concentration decreases to approximately 3%. Then <b>clinkers</b> are fired at temperatures between 1100 °C and 1300 °C in a tunnel kiln (earlier in ring kilns), {{in contrast to the}} 800 °C to 1200 °C temperature range seen with normal bricks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The new mullite-SiC bricks were {{prepared}} by mullite homogenized grogs to substituted the bauxite <b>clinkers</b> (Al 2 O 3 content is 85 % or 88 %) as raw materials. In this paper, the physico-chemical properties and wear {{resistance of the}} new mullite-SiC bricks were studied by comparing with the ordinary mullite-SiC bricks produced by using bauxite <b>clinkers</b> as raw materials. The result shows that the new mullite-SiC bricks have low apparent porosity and bulk density, high compressive strength and refractoriness under load, excellent wear resistance.

25|$|To fully {{recreate}} the Rainhill Trials, 20 return runs along {{a section of}} the Llangollen Railway were required (between Carrog and Glyndyfrdwy stations). Novelty was only able to complete 10 runs before the fire became completely filled with <b>clinker.</b> The inability to clear <b>clinker</b> from the fire in this type of boiler was a major problem, the only way being to drop the fire completely and start again.|$|E
25|$|The {{behaviour}} of the coal's ash residue at {{high temperature}} {{is a critical}} factor in selecting coals for steam power generation. Most furnaces are designed to remove ash as a powdery residue. Coal which has ash that fuses into a hard glassy slag known as <b>clinker</b> is usually unsatisfactory in furnaces as it requires cleaning. However, furnaces can be designed to handle the <b>clinker,</b> generally by removing it as a molten liquid.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of large}} {{quantities}} of bauxite residue (BR) to produce two types of low-carbon cement (ferrobelitic and aluminoferrite) was studied in this project. These types of cement are of great interest for the industry because of the lower energy demand and CO 2 footprint {{as well as the}} higher possible incorporation of by-products, compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). To produce the <b>clinkers,</b> BR was combined with limestone, clays and reagent chemicals in order to achieve a suitable raw meal chemistry. The goal was to keep BR addition constant at 50 wt% in all mixtures. The mineralogical phase formation at different burning temperatures was estimatedby means of thermodynamic calculations. <b>Clinkers</b> were produced at different temperatures, 1200, 1250 and 1300 °C, followed by rapid cooling by air. The obtained <b>clinkers</b> were mineralogically quantified by the Rietveld method using X-Ray diffraction analysis. Additionally, microstructural characterisation was performed using SEM-EDS. Hydration kinetics were also studied by isothermal calorimetry. The results show that BR quantities as high as 50 wt% can be used to produce reactive, and environmental friendly cement <b>clinkers.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{trace element}} content of <b>clinkers</b> (and {{possibly}} of cements) {{can be used}} for the qualitative identification (i. e. manufacturing factory). This paper proposes a fuzzy classifier for the discrimination of <b>clinkers</b> produced in different factories based on their Mg, Sr, Ba, Mn, Ti, Zr, Zn and V content. The fuzzy classifier is identified by unsupervised fuzzy clustering. The most relevant trace elements were selected based on the obtained clusters by the modified version of Fisher interclass separability method. The classification of Portuguese and South African <b>clinkers</b> is used as an illustrative example. The results show that the proposed method is useful to identify compact classifiers that are able to determine the origin of the clinker; and the obtained classifier is easy to use and interpret for engineers and researchers, even when they are not familiar with the concept of fuzzy logic...|$|R
25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the <b>clinker</b> {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal <b>clinker.</b> As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the <b>clinker</b> (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the <b>clinker</b> and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{valorisation}} {{of electric}} arc furnace steel slag (EAFS) {{in the production of}} low energy belite cements is studied. Three types of <b>clinkers</b> were prepared with 0 wt. % (BC), 5 wt. % (BC 5) and 10 wt. % (BC 10) EAFS, respectively. The design of the raw mixes was based on the compositional indices lime saturation factor (LSF), alumina ratio (AR) and silica ratio (SR). The <b>clinkering</b> temperature was studied for the range 1280 - 1400 °C; firing was performed at 1380 °C based on the results regarding free lime and the evolution of microstructure.
