40|$|This article {{examines}} how <b>compensation</b> <b>type</b> and failure type explain the recovery effect of compensation, using a meta-analysis (Study 1) and an experiment (Study 2). Drawing on resource exchange theory, we propose new classifications for both compensation and failure type and find three major results. First, {{consistent with our}} matching hypothesis, the strongest recovery effect is generally observed when compensation represents a resource similar to the failure {{it is supposed to}} offset, that is, immediate monetary compensation for a monetary failure, exchange for a flawed product, reperformance for a failed service, and psychological compensation for lack of attention. Surprisingly, lack of attention may also be rectified by the other compensation types. Second, consistent with our intertemporal choice hypothesis, immediate monetary compensation is generally more effective than delayed monetary compensation. Yet, this effect also varies with failure type. Third, resource-based classifications explain the recovery effect of compensation better than current classifications of compensation and failure type. As a theoretical contribution, the resource-based classifications help to explain the fluctuating effect sizes of compensation reported in prior research. From a managerial point of view, practitioners can choose the appropriate <b>compensation</b> <b>type</b> for a failure, one that repays in kind what customers have lost.

40|$|Organizations {{commonly}} provide relative performance information (RPI) as part {{of their}} management control systems to motivate employees. Despite the benefits of RPI that have been well-documented in the literature, RPI can lead to unhealthy competition where employees sabotage their co-workers’ performance so as to outperform, and thus be ranked higher than their co-workers. Organizations could strengthen group identity, an informal management control, to reduce sabotage. However, there is limited previous evidence that strengthening group identity actually reduces sabotage. This study aims to fill that gap. Additionally, this study investigates whether the effect of strengthening group identity depends on the type of compensation contract assigned. I used an experiment in a laboratory setting because it is difficult to observe incidences of employee sabotage behavior in real organizations since sabotage is often conducted covertly and concealed carefully. I manipulate <b>compensation</b> <b>type</b> at two levels (piece rate versus flat wage), and group identity at two levels (strong versus moderate).

However, my results do not support the arguments that the effect of strengthening group identity on sabotage depends on <b>compensation</b> <b>type.</b> In addition, although I find that suspicion of having been sabotaged by others increases the frequency at which employees sabotage others, I find mixed evidence on whether the suspicion of having been sabotaged affects employees’ effort...|$|E

Three paradigms {{to study this}} problem are proposed. They are distinguished by the set of variables used for control design.

The asymptotic convergence of the tracing error to zero requires the use of a generalized coordinate with the contact constraints taken into account.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to gain some insight into the {{effectiveness}} of different types of tangible compensation strategies for two different types of services: utilitarian and hedonic. Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are investigated using a 2 x 2 between-subject experimental design and two factors: service type (utilitarian vs hedonic) and <b>compensation</b> <b>type</b> (utilitarian a price reduction vs hedonic a free gift). Findings - The results show that customers prefer to receive a form of compensation that matches the type of service involved. For example, customers who receive a utilitarian compensation (e. g. a price reduction) after experiencing a failure in utilitarian service (e. g. at a bank) report higher levels of satisfaction and repurchase intention than they would after experiencing a failure in hedonic services (e. g. at a restaurant), but that the reverse is true for a hedonic-type compensation (e. g. a free gift). Practical implications - The offering of either a price reduction or a free gift cuts into company profits. Organizations should, therefore, tailor their service recovery efforts, focusing on those resources in the bundle that will have the greatest positive impact and create the most favorable customer response. Originality/value - The primary contribution of this paper to the service marketing literature is that it provides empirical results, which shed light on the interplay between the type of compensation and the type of service on the customer's post-recovery judgment of that service...|$|E

IFMs are extensively managed, sown species- and flower-rich vegetation strips which provide both habitats {{for a wide range}} of species and valuable structures for the ecological network. However, the success of ecological compensation measures depends strongly on their acceptance by farmers and the general public. In summer 2004, we investigated in a case study the attitudes of 108 Swiss people to IFMs directly in the field. Study participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of IFMs of different species richness and composition that were presented to them, to explain their rating and to estimate the number of species present. In addition, they were asked to imagine a field margin of their particular liking, to describe it, and to state their opinion on several aspects of IFMs. Study participants responded very positively to species-rich vegetation. The more species-rich an IFM was perceived to be, the more it appealed to them. Species richness and general diversity were named as the main reasons for a positive rating.

40|$|Abstract—An {{integrated}} direct/indirect adaptive robust controller (DIARC) {{is proposed}} to further improve the achievable posture trajectory tracking control {{performance of a}} parallel manipulator driven by pneumatic muscles. Due to the model errors of the static forces and friction forces of pneumatic muscles, the simplified average flow rate characteristics of valves, and the unknown disturbances of entire system, there exist large extent of parametric uncertainties and rather severe uncertain nonlinearities in the modeling of the parallel manipulator. To address these problems, in this paper, an indirect type parameter estimation is used to obtain reliable estimates of effective model parameters for reducing the parametric uncertainties while an integrated direct/indirect ARC with dynamic <b>compensation</b> <b>type</b> fast adaptation is utilized to further attenuate the influences of uncertain nonlinearities for better tracking performance. Considering that the conventional parameter estimation algorithm based on single error minimizing criterion normally fails to provide reliable parameter estimation for the parallel manipulator with symmetric structure due to the difficulty in satisfying the persistent exciting conditions all the time—the theoretical requirement for the convergence of online parameter estimation, additional practical constraints are imposed to further condition the parameter estimation process and a new parameter estimation algorithm based on composite error minimizing criterion in task-space is developed. Experimental results demonstrate that the parallel manipulator {{under the control of}} the proposed integrated DIARC has strong self-adaptability and robustness with the steady-state posture tracking error being less than 0. 01, average tracking error less than 0. 1, and maximum tracking error less than 0. 3, which are significantly better than those of the direct ARC.
