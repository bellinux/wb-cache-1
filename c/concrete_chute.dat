50|$|After {{the dome}} on each tank was finished, miners would descend {{into the central}} shaft and begin {{removing}} the remaining rock {{between them and the}} dome. As the rock was mined, it would fall down the shaft and into a hopper which permitted passage of rock sizes suitable to be carried by the conveyor belts below. Then, a jaw crusher would reduce the rock down to 10-inch diameter pieces for disposal. After enough space was cleared, workers constructed a six-foot catwalk around the circumference and suspended from cables anchored in the dome. These walks carried not only miners, but air lines, water lines, hand tools, and other items.Â  Miners would lower themselves by rope, insert dynamite into the rock wall, raise the catwalk, and then detonate the explosives.Â  As the excavation went deeper, picks, shovels, and crowbars were used to scale down the loose rock and bring the wall to a sufficient depth behind the excavation line.Â  This permitted effective application of approximately six inches of gunite (a mixture of cement, sand, and water) to line the basalt rock.Â  They then coated the gunite with a layer of natural red dirt to prevent bonding with concrete and allow future injection of pressurized grout.Â  This continued {{all the way down to}} the base.Upon completion of the excavation, workers erected a steel tower in the center to the full height of 250 feet.Â  The tower served to support <b>concrete</b> <b>chutes,</b> pipes, booms, and other equipment necessary to install the piping, concrete, and steel linings.Â  Workers then began to erect the steel liner and rebar incrementally so that they could pour concrete in stages. Concrete was poured continually and workers had to remove wooden shoring as concrete filled. They injected pressurized grout to pre-stress the concrete by filling void space between the concrete and the gunite. When finished, the tanks were tested by slowly filling them with water while laborers in boats physically checked the entire surface area of the steel liner.|$|R

40|$|Concrete washout is a one of {{contributor}} to pollute the urban or rural drainage.

40|$|On a {{spillway}} chute, a stepped design {{increases the}} rate of energy dissipation on the chute itself and reduces {{the size of a}} downstream energy dissipator. Up to date, the effects of step roughness on the flow properties remain unknown despite the practical relevance to damaged <b>concrete</b> steps, rock <b>chutes</b> and gabions weirs. New measurements were conducted in a large-size laboratory facility with two step conditions (smooth and rough) and three types of step roughness. Detailed air-water flow properties were measured systematically for several flow rates. The results showed faster flow motion on rough step chutes. Although the finding is counter-intuitive, it is linked with the location of the inception point of free-surface aeration being located further downstream than for a smooth stepped chute for an identical flow rate. In the aerated flow region, the velocities on rough-step chutes were larger than those of smooth chute flows for a given flow rate and dimensionless location from the inception point of free-surface aeration both at step edges and between step edges. The results suggest that design guidelines for smooth (concrete) stepped spillway may not be suitable to rough stepped chutes including gabion stepped weirs, and older stepped chutes with damaged steps...|$|R
40|$|Spillways {{for large}} {{embankment}} dams typically feature an ogee structure and {{a section of}} <b>concrete</b> lined <b>chute,</b> but at some location discharge onto an unlined section. Erosion of this unlined section can require costly remediation and can potentially threaten {{the integrity of the}} dam. The unlined section of spillway is typically sited in fractured-rock. The erosion of this highly heterogeneous substance does not conform to existing erosion assessment methods for sediment transport or rip-rap. Rather, the designer simply makes a judgement, based on comparison to erosion at other dam sites. While this has been successful in many cases, there have been cases where significant erosion has occurred. In addition, flood estimates in Australia have been revised, and it is unknown how vulnerable existing spillways will be to erosion from larger forecasted floods. This dissertation was undertaken in response to this problem, and sets out to provide improved methods for assessment of erosion of unlined spillways in rock. The thesis is structured into three parts. Firstly, at the time of writing, industry relied largely on design techniques that were based on benchmarking a site in question against observed erosion at other dam sites. In Part 1 the historical development of these âcomparative design techniquesâ is traced and is critically reviewed against the original geotechnical and hydraulic data, and against detailed geotechnical and hydraulic data from 29 dams in Australia, South African and the USA, which were collected as part of the dissertation. This data was used to develop rock-mass indices that specifically represent erodibility, and an improved comparative design method. In Part 2, a laboratory test program examining forces arising from water flowing over joint-bound blocks is presented. The nature of fluctuating hydraulic pressures are examined in detail, and equations allowing estimation of pressures and forces on individual rock units at the prototype scale are given. In Part 3, the findings of the laboratory studies are applied to develop analytical representation of erosion. Improved analytical representations of erosion of rockfill (rip-rap) are developed. However, it was found that a generalised analytical representation of fractured rock is not appropriate, due to the unique geology at every spillway site. A methodology for site-specific kinematic assessments is presented using the findings from the laboratory testing...|$|R

40|$|The Guri Hydroelectric Project of the Corporation Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) {{is located}} on the Caroni River in northeastern Venezuela. The project {{includes}} a water impoundment created by a concrete gravity type dam. The dam contains a three-chute <b>concrete</b> spillway, each <b>chute</b> consisting of an overflow gated crest, a steep chute, and a terminal flip bucket. The spillway flow is projected from the bucket in a high arching jet which plunges into the tailwater pool for final dissipation of its energy. Spillway flows were first released from the new structure early in 1969. Inspection of the spillway late in 1969 disclosed significant scouring or erosion of portions of the lips of the buckets and the ends of the side training walls. The Harza Engineering Company, which designed the structure and provided engineering assistance during the construction and initial operations, recommended to CVG that the damaged areas be restored with epoxy concrete and epoxy protective coatings. These repairs were made early in 1970 before the new seasonal water release. Subsequent inspections late in 1970 established that scouring had been renewed and even greater damage had been sustained than in the previous year. Field inspection suggested that the damage was due to the action of cavitation and that the damage might not be self-arresting and was thus potentially hazardous. Early in 1971 staff members of the Harza Engineering Company reviewed the available evidence with staff members of the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Minnesota. As a consequence of these discussions the Laboratory was authorized in February 1971 to proceed with an experimental study.
