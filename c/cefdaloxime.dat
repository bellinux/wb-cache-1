40|$|<b>Cefdaloxime</b> (formerly RU 29246; Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc., Somerville, N. J.) a new active {{component}} of the HR- 916 ester, was tested by dilution and two disk (10 - and 30 -micrograms) diffusion susceptibility tests against 391 clinical isolates. Interpretive criteria were proposed for three potential MIC breakpoints of {{less than or equal}} to 1, {{less than or equal to}} 2, and less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. Analyses by regression line and error rate bounding methods minimized false-susceptible (very major) errors and produced a greater than or equal to 90 % absolute interpretive agreement between susceptibility test methods. The less than or equal to 2 -micrograms/ml breakpoint seemed optimal when 10 -micrograms disks and the available human pharmacokinetics were used. The following inhibition zone diameter criteria were proposed: susceptible, greater than or equal to 19 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 15 mm. These recommendations for clinical trials should remain tentative until additional information about <b>cefdaloxime</b> formulations, pharmacokinetics, and patient outcomes can be correlated with in vitro susceptibility test results...|$|E
40|$|This {{comparative}} study determined {{the effect of}} blood on the antienterococcal activities of the newer cephalosporins. Standardized disk diffusion susceptibility tests were performed with 57 strains of enterococci (30 Enterococcus faecalis strains) on Mueller-Hinton agar with and without 5 % sheep blood supplementation. Twelve cephalosporins representing five different structural groups (based on the 7 -alpha position substitution) were tested. The greatest frequency of activity enhancement by blood was observed with <b>cefdaloxime</b> and cefdinir (7 -alpha hydroxyimino group) against E. faecalis. Cephalosporins with a 7 -alpha methoxyimino group (cefpodoxime, cefepime, and cefpirome) had marked increases in zone diameters (3 to > 9 mm) when tested with the blood supplement. Cephems with 7 -alpha amino or carboxy substitutions did not demonstrate any enhanced activity. Awareness of this phenomenon is important for the interpretation and accuracy of cephalosporin susceptibility testing...|$|E
