5|$|Australia scored slowly, as Yardley {{employed}} leg {{theory to}} slow the scoring. Brown <b>came</b> <b>in</b> at No. 5, but he had played {{most of his career}} as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24. Hassett <b>came</b> <b>in</b> and Australia reached stumps at 293/4, a lead of 128. Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes, with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs.|$|E
5|$|Barnes thus {{played in}} four of the five Tests, missing the fourth Test through injury. He scored 329runs, {{averaging}} 82.25.

Barnes made 176 in 255 minutes against Surrey early in the tour, but, apart from his Test hundred, his only other century <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the final tour match, when the final 50 runs of his 151 against the H.

5|$|By lap 20, Sebastian Vettel {{was closing}} the gap to the two Red Bulls ahead of him, coming within three second of Verstappen.

On lap 28, Ricciardo was again the first of the front runners to pit, taking on the soft compound. Vettel <b>came</b> <b>in</b> two laps later, making the same choice in tyres. This left Verstappen to lead Kimi Räikkönen, as it emerged that both would run on a different strategy, pitting only twice in contrast to the three stopping Vettel and Ricciardo.
