She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice {{in the days before the}} official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a column}} {{assessing}} <b>Caroline</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> candidacy for the US Senate seat being vacated by Hillary Clinton in early 2009, Maureen Dowd likened the Kennedy family role in US politics, from grandfather Joe Kennedy to father John Kennedy and uncles Robert Kennedy and Ted Kennedy, to the House of Atreus, and Caroline {{and her brother}} John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s place in it as [...] "heartbreaking." [...] The columnist had eight years earlier traced the Kennedy/Atreus parallels in more detail, in a piece comparing the then-ascendant [...] "Bush dynasty" [...] with the Kennedy one.|$|R

500|$|In December 2008, Lowey {{would have}} another {{chance at the}} Senate seat, when Clinton was {{nominated}} for U.S. Secretary of State by President-elect Obama and Lowey was considered a front-runner to be named as her appointed replacement. [...] But Lowey withdrew from consideration, as {{in the intervening years}} she had gained enough seniority {{to become one of the}} powerful [...] "cardinals" [...] on the House Appropriations Committee and did not want to relinquish that position. [...] When <b>Caroline</b> <b>Kennedy</b> announced her interest in the vacancy, comparisons were drawn to Clinton in 2000, with both being famous people seeking to hold elective office for the first time. [...] Others pointed out that Clinton had won election to the office while Kennedy would first be appointed. [...] In any case, Kennedy's effort soon faltered, in part due to not having the same desire or willingness to work for the seat as Clinton had had, and she soon withdrew as abruptly as she had entered.|$|E
500|$|In October 1968, Aristotle Onassis married Jacqueline Kennedy, {{the widow}} of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States. Onassis and his sister Christina were greatly upset by the union. They had hoped that he might remarry their mother, which had seemed {{possible}} {{towards the end of}} their father's relationship with the Greek opera singer Maria Callas. Onassis said: [...] "My father loved names and Jackie loved money." [...] Despite never liking their stepmother, Onassis and his sister were friendly with her children, <b>Caroline</b> <b>Kennedy</b> and John, and Onassis would occasionally let his stepbrother ride at the controls of his plane. Aristotle Onassis's friend, John W. Meyer, credited Alexander with persuading his father to stop publicly accusing his business rival and former brother-in-law, Stavros Niarchos, of involvement in the death of Niarchos's former wife, Alexander's aunt Eugenia Livano-Niarchos s. Niarchos later married Onassis's mother, the sister of his former wife.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{made his}} first post-illness public {{appearance}} on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. Though additionally ill from an attack of kidney stones and {{against the advice of}} some associates, Kennedy insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece, <b>Caroline</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> the senator said, [...] "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing– nothing– is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on." [...] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2008, Maloney hired a public-relations firm to help bolster {{her efforts}} to be named by Governor David Paterson as Hillary Clinton's {{successor}} as a New York Senator. Maloney toured parts of the state, but was overshadowed by <b>Caroline</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> promotional tour for the same seat. Maloney interviewed with the governor for 55 minutes. Public opinion polls placed Maloney's support for the Senate seat in the single digits, trailing the front-runner, then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, although her bid was endorsed by the National Organization for Women Political Action Committee, the Feminist Majority Political Action Committee, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, and other columnists [...] and editorial boards.|$|R

500|$|As Hillary Clinton {{resigned}} her United States Senate seat on January 21, 2009 {{to assume}} {{a position in the}} United States Cabinet under United States President Barack Obama, New York Governor David Paterson was required to appoint a temporary replacement until a special election in 2010 for the balance of her term. Some thought that the New York State Governor would appoint a minority senator such as Brown, Gregory W. Meeks, H. Carl McCall, William C. Thompson, Jr., José E. Serrano or Nydia M. Velázquez. However, Andrew Cuomo was the front-runner for the seat and the next most likely candidates were Velázquez, Steve Israel, Nita Lowey and Meeks. Prominent women who were mentioned include Carolyn B. Maloney and <b>Caroline</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> The New York Timess Danny Hakim noted that Cuomo, Paterson and Brown were the three names most often mentioned prior to Paterson's ascension to the governor's office. [...] Although these three were the favorites, Brown was considered an unknown outside of Western New York. [...] Nonetheless, Brown's name was mentioned before Kennedy's and Cuomo's in a New York Times article paragraph about Paterson's final nomination decision thoughts. [...] In fact, in at least one article in The New York Times on the subject, Brown was mentioned and Cuomo wasn't. [...] When Paterson announced he had selected Blue Dog Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand, Brown {{was one of the few}} contenders to attend the event.|$|E
