A segment west from Van Etten Junction was included in the Conrail take over. Additionally, a segment from Geneva to Victor, New York, later cut back to Shortsville, New York to Victor, remained with the Lehigh Valley Estate under subsidized Conrail operation. The Shortsville to Victor segment became the Ontario Central Railroad in 1979 (the Ontario Central became part of the Finger Lakes Railway in October 2007). Other remaining track left over from the LV was sold to shortline or regional railroads other than Ontario Central Railroad such as the Finger Lakes Railway, the Depew, Lancaster and Western Railroad which is owned by the Genesee Valley Transportation Company, the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad, the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway, and finally the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad.|$|R

The meeting was led by Yehoshua Sherpstein and Yair Aharony.|$|R
40|$|In {{defining}} a virtual team-working solution {{as with any}} new organisational form, success relies not merely on the introduction and adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), but also on critically analysing the underlying social and organisational aspects. The paper investigates the effectiveness of virtual teams, and any other suitable form of virtual collaboration, in the Construction sector and explores {{the factors that influence}} their successful adoption. The positivist strand adopted in the research emphasises a particular approach that promotes software application hosting through a dedicated application service provider, as opposed to the traditional software-licensing model. The research identifies important socio-organisational challenges inherent to the project-based nature of <b>Construction,</b> <b>including</b> issues <b>related</b> to technology adoption, team identification, trust, and motivation.

As a pre-apprenticeship program, BTPAP does not attempt to replicate the specialized training {{that is part of}} an apprenticeship program. Rather, BTPAP uses a “holistic approach” to basic skills development, <b>including</b> <b>construction</b> <b>related</b> mathematics, job search training, and exposure to various fields of skilled labor and their professional cultures. These fields include cement masons, roofers, plumbers, steamfitters, iron workers, electricians, plasterers and carpenters. Beyond skills enhancement, this program also seeks to instill the basic awareness that construction and skilled trades are viable employment option for minorities, women, and people living in poverty. BTPAP helps build confidence in each program graduate – allowing them to reach new opportunities in the skilled labor market...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{quantum physics}} solves ground {{states for a}} given Hamiltonian, while quantum {{information}} science asks for the existence and construction of certain Hamiltonians for given ground states. In practical situations, one would be mainly interested in local Hamiltonians with certain interaction patterns, such as nearest neighbour interactions on some type of lattices. A necessary condition for a space $V$ to be the ground-state space of some local Hamiltonian with a given interaction pattern, is that the maximally mixed state supported on $V$ is uniquely determined by its reduced density matrices associated with the given pattern, {{based on the principle}} of maximum entropy. However, it is unclear whether this condition is in general also sufficient. We examine the situations for the existence of such a local Hamiltonian to have $V$ satisfying the necessary condition mentioned above as its ground-state space, by linking to faces of the convex body of the local reduced states. We further discuss some methods for constructing the corresponding local Hamiltonians with given interaction patterns, mainly from physical points of view, <b>including</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>related</b> to perturbation methods, local frustration-free Hamiltonians, as well as thermodynamical ensembles.

500|$|A {{motorway}} connecting Zagreb and Split {{was designed}} in the early 1970s, and a public loan was started in order to collect sufficient funds for its construction. However, due to political upheavals in Croatia and Yugoslavia, construction of the motorway was labeled a [...] "nationalist project" [...] and cancelled in 1971. After Croatian independence and conclusion of the Croatian War of Independence, efforts to build the motorway were renewed and construction started in 2000. The Zagreb–Split section of the route was completed by 2005, while the first sections between Split and Dubrovnik opened in 2007 and 2008. Construction costs incurred so far amount to 3 billion euro.
