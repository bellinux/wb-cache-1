In this paper, we apply the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to determine the risk premium implicit in the discount rates for a range of Australian fisheries, and compare this with the set of management instruments in place. We test the assumption that rights based management instruments lower perceptions of risk in fisheries. We find little evidence to support this assumption, although the analysis was based on only limited data. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|During an effort-regulated {{period from}} 1996 to 2002, {{unregistered}} annual increases of 0. 3 % of hooks fished per day were demonstrated for the Faroe Islands longline fishery. However, annual increases were higher (1. 5 %) during a preceding {{total allowable catch}} regulated period, thereby invalidating an expectation of the 1996 shift in regulations (output to input control) to have induced increases {{in the number of}} hooks set per day. Underlying this result is a substantial increase in total yearly effort (fishing days) and a shift in targeting behaviour from secondary to primary (high value) target species in response to the transition from output to input control. Interview data on technology were combined with logbook data and analysed with generalized linear modelling to demonstrate haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) catch-per-unit-effort increases of 51 % and 26 %, respectively, following the introduction of skewed hooks and swivel line. The technological introductions were not correlated to regulation shifts. So, rather than the management system in force, an ongoing technological development seems to be the principal driver of fishing power trends.

As most coastal zones, Venice Lagoon {{is subject to the}} deposit of sedimentological materials, in form of inorganic and organic detritus, nutrients and heavy metals, and there is also a very strong anthropic pressure; therefore, analysis and monitoring of production sites have a great importance in fisheries management and control. Aim of the present study is to identify and validate biochemical, physiological and molecular markers that could be utilized for assessing the state of health of productive sites, as well as to identify new ones. A multidisciplinary approach has been developed to define and characterize both the populations of bivalve mollusc growing up in some aquaculture lagoon sites and the best sites as well. Model organisms for the research are Tapes philippinarum and Tapes decussatus, two species of bivalve mollusc of the Veneridae family, which happens to have a great socio-economical importance: as a consequence, fishing and production sites have to be carefully controlled. The main focus of this study centers on inorganic pollution, specifically heavy metals bioaccumulation and storing in different tissues; the evaluation of metallothioneins induction has proved very helpful in determining the quality of old and new aquaculture sites; in addition, molecular markers have been used to look for a mollusc bivalve sub-population identification...|$|E

In 1998, the total fish catch landed was 217, 100 metric tons of which Lake Victoria contributed 48. 6 %. The development of government centred management systems has led to increasing alienation of resource users and to wilful disregard of specific regulations. The realisation of the problems faced by the current management systems has led to the recognition that user groups need to be actively involved in fisheries management if the systems are to be consistent with sustainable fisheries and be legitimate. Community participation in fisheries management (Comanagement) is being tried in Lake Victoria, through co-management, which is the sharing of responsibility between the government, researchers and the resource users. A study on co-management was carried in the fisher communities on Lake Victoria, Uganda in July 1999 and between October – November 2000, to assess the potential for implementing a community-based co-management approach on the fishery. Results of this study show that there is a general agreement between the staff and fisher-folk on the need to share management responsibilities.

40|$|In {{many cases}} marine organisms and {{especially}} their diverse developmental stages {{are difficult to}} identify by morphological characters. DNA-based identification methods offer an analytically powerful addition or even an alternative. In this study, a DNA microarray has been developed {{to be able to}} investigate its potential as a tool for the identification of fish species from European seas based on mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences. Eleven commercially important fish species were selected for a first prototype. Oligonucleotide probes were designed based on the 16 S rDNA sequences obtained from 230 individuals of 27 fish species. In addition, more than 1200 sequences of 380 species served as sequence background against which the specificity of the probes was tested in silico. Single target hybridisations with Cy 5 -labelled, PCR-amplified 16 S rDNA fragments from each of the 11 species on microarrays containing the complete set of probes confirmed their suitability. True-positive, fluorescence signals obtained were at least one order of magnitude stronger than false-positive cross-hybridisations. Single nontarget hybridisations resulted in cross-hybridisation signals at approximately 27 % of the cases tested, but all of them were at least one order of magnitude lower than true-positive signals. This study demonstrates that the 16 S rDNA gene is suitable for designing oligonucleotide probes, which can be used to differentiate 11 fish species. These data are a solid basis for the second step to create a “Fish Chip” for approximately 50 fish species relevant in marine environmental and fisheries research, as well as <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> products...|$|E
40|$|Lake Tana’s 15 large Barbus species {{form the}} only known intact endemic cyprinid species flock left in the world. The barbs {{contribute}} around {{one third of the}} total annual catch of the motorised commercial gillnet fishery which was introduced in 1986. A dramatic reduction of the adult Barbus stocks and the even lower proportion of recruits {{at the end of the}} 1990 s, show the necessity for the development, implementation and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> legislation in Lake Tana. The reproductive biology of the Barbus species, essential for fishery management, is poorly known. This paper presents results on size at maturity, size at harvest and gillnet selectivity curves, which can be used to provide a scientific base for management proposals. Size at maturity varied widely among the Barbus species, ranging from 18. 8 cm in Barbus brevicephalus to 44. 3 cm in Barbus crassibarbis. Males matured at smaller size and reached smaller maximum length than females. Estimated selectivity curves fitted closely or were slightly larger than the observed length-frequency distribution of the commercial catch. The vast majority (85 %) of barbs landed by the commercial gillnet fishery were mature. Fishing pressure on juvenile, immature fish is unlikely to be the cause of the observed decrease in Barbus stocks. Size control regulations like mesh sizerestrictions, intended to protect the immature part of fish populations are expected to have little positive effects on the Barbus stocks and are therefore not recommended. The drastic reduction in barbs during the 1990 s is most like due to recruitment overfishing, that is, poorly regulated high fishing effort by the commercial gillnet fishery on the spawning aggregations of adult barbs during their annual breeding migration in river mouths and surrounding floodplains. Only effort control regulations limiting the gillnet fishery in the spawning season and/or areas will prevent a total collapse of the Barbus stocks as has happened to other cyprinids in African lakes. Such measures have to be implemented urgently to guarantee the conservation of Lake Tana’s unique biodiversity as a sustainable source of cheap protein and as a natural laboratory to study the evolutionary processes underlying speciation in freshwater fish...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{propagation}} of salmonid fish under the ocean ecosystem {{is essential for}} salmon industry. Salmonid fish including chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) and masu salmon (O. masou) are important species for hatchery reared and released fish in Japan. Diseases, especially viral and bacterial diseases are serious problems {{and one of the}} limitations of successful propagation and/or aquaculture of salmonid fish. Methods currently used to control the diseases in hatcheries are 1) hygiene and facility sanitation, 2) disinfection of water supply and waste water, 3) health monitoring of matured fish and hatched fry. Under these circumstances, hatched fish are healthy and specific pathogen free, but there is still a possibility of infection with some pathogens in environmental waters after they are moved to river or pond. For prospective study, development of effective vaccines and immunological tools for judgment of vaccination effect is necessary. To create safe and worry free salmon products, we have established a system using a risk analysis based on hazard analysis (HA) and set up the critical control point (CCP) from fishing through processing to distribution. Model program for improvement the quality <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> products from fishing to market was created using chum salmon as a model fish species in 1999 with Hokkaido government, Japan. One town, located in east part of Hokkaido, was selected to become the model district in addition to its position as leading producer of chum salmon. This town received high marks for its efforts to promote the advanced measures to preserve freshness, as well as its approach to enhance the quality control of the marine products, such as the positive sanitation and hygiene measures adopted by local processors. This town implemented a local HACCP manual. Through this HACCP effort, the industry in the town district was integrated. Today, Japanese government considers that a safe and worry-free food product of the highest quality, by practicing the HACCP program and Good Practice program is necessary for fisheries industry and consumer. This Local Town District HACCP System has been accepted in many fishermen's cooperatives, and created this HACCP system in many towns and areas in Hokkaido and Tohoku. This risk analysis using HA and set up the CCP are combined with traceability system and accepted among consumers in Japan. 水産増養殖の最終目標は食料資源の生産供給であり，安全で安心して食べることのできる魚介類の提供が求められている。サケ資源を食料源として持続的に有効活用するためには，健康種苗を育成・放流し，資源管理のもと，成長した個体を捕獲して安心して食べられるよう，漁獲から加工，流通・消費者に至る過程を管理する必要がある。魚を家畜同様，ヒトが管理すると病気の発生は避けられず，適切な防疫対策の実施が必須である。サケ・マス類の病原体は，成熟時に卵巣腔液や精漿に出現し，卵子や精子が汚染される。古くはこの汚染発眼卵が病原体伝播に大きくかかわり，孵化稚魚の発病による産業被害を引き起こした。現在は採卵親魚の健康調査を実施し，病原体の疫学調査に資すると共に，受精直後および発眼期に卵表面の消毒を行い，病原体フリーの用水で孵化・飼育を行って健康種苗を確保して放流している。漁獲後は，食品としての安全性を確保すると共に消費者に安心を提供することが重要である。安全性は科学的に確認でき，客観的に評価できるが，安心は安全性と異なり心的な問題である。食品として信頼して食べるためには，健康障害を起こす可能性のある要因を科学的に整理し，その成果を安全性確保に生かす必要がある。現在はリスク分析手法を用いて，生産現場から食卓までの危害分析（HA）を行い，重要な管理点（CCP）を設定して，リスクを制御する方法が広く採用されている。加工場のHA-CCPのみならず，リスク管理を導入したフードチェーン・アプローチによって安全性が確保され，トレーサビリティーの導入により消費者に生産者の顔が見えるようになり，食品産業に従事する人々も責任を自覚するようになってきた。水産食品には，刺身や寿司に代表されるように，加工工程で熱を加えないものも多く，これらの安全性を確保するには，加工場での衛生管理はもちろん，原料段階での衛生管理・品質管理が重要である。加工原料としての漁獲物を衛生細菌による汚染から守ることは，より安全な食品を消費者へ提供するために必要な処置と考える。漁獲から消費者までの水産物の流れは，漁場→漁港→産地卸売市場→加工場→消費地卸売市場→小売店→消費者となっている。加工場から消費者への行程は衛生管理が普及しているが，漁獲から加工場に至るまでの漁港を含めた食品衛生に関する配慮がいま求められている。衛生管理型漁港の整備，漁港の衛生レベルの設定，水産物の衛生品質管理に優れた産地市場を認定し，認定市場を参考に産地市場の衛生品質管理の向上を目指す取り組み，さらに養殖魚のJASの導入が進んでいる。資源管理に関してもMSC（Marine Stewardship Council）に対抗し日本版マリンエコラベル（MEL-Japan）が設立されている。今回，北海道の代表的な水産物であるサケを例に，漁獲から加工・流通・消費に至る各過程での衛生管理，特に，今まで見過ごされてきた漁獲から加工場に入るまでの衛生管理の必要性とトレーサビリティーについて考え，地域ぐるみの衛生管理を紹介したい。Lecture...|$|E

Due to the relevance of its catches in the Italian fishery, it is currently sampled {{within the framework of the}} EC Data Collection programme, covering the central and southern Tyrrhenian Sea and the Strait of Sicily (Southern Mediterranean Sea). This paper reports about the complete set of data from these two GSAs up to 2007. The length-weight relationships are also provided for each data set, including the size at age for some selected years. The high socio-economical importance of this species in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, requires a strict and continuous <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery</b> and landings all over the area, able to provide reliable data for a future update of the stock assessment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the experience of}} a group of eight Pacific Island coastal States in exercising their sovereign rights for the EEZ to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the tuna <b>fishery</b> and reduce dominance of the distant water fishing fleets. The group is established under the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management <b>of</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Common Interest, with the membership including the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Known widely as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, the group has adopted a cooperative framework and work together to establish a number of instruments to facilitate the co-ordination and harmonisation the management of the common fish stocks within their EEZs. In doing this, the Parties to the Nauru Agreement were asserting and protecting their sovereign rights, creating economic opportunities for their people, and conserving and managing the tuna fish stock. The thesis argues that the Parties to the Nauru Agreement has taken <b>control</b> <b>of</b> their tuna <b>fishery</b> through the introduction of the instruments such as the minimum terms and conditions for access under the First, Second and Third Implement Arrangements of the Nauru Agreement, the Palau Arrangement for the Management of the Western Pacific Purse Seine Fishery to limit fishing effort and the establishment of the Federated States of Micronesia Arrangement for Regional Access which provide preferential treatment for the domestic and/or locally-based vessels. The thesis concludes that in order to maintain and/or strengthen the control the Parties to the Nauru Agreement have attained, the group needs to redefine its cooperative framework to cater for the different interests they have acquired...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperMarket {{failure in}} open access {{fisheries}} usually results in economic losses, {{because the most}} efficient means of harvesting fish resources are not used, and because fish resources are not allocated to the use with the highest social marginal value. In efficient, competitive markets, pricing mechanisms would ensure the optimal allocation of fish resources among alternative uses and between alternative users. However, because property rights over fish are poorly defined in open access fisheries, the market allocation and distribution of fish resources are not optimal. For this reason, governments have often directly managed fisheries on society's behalf. However, the involvement <b>of</b> government in <b>fisheries</b> management can lead to further misallocation of resources (O'Boyle 1993). This may arise where increased operational and adjustment costs, management costs and/or non-productive rent seeking behaviour by fishers and fishery managers exceeds the benefits from management. Moving fisheries management functions from under direct government control to control by a statutory body partly avoids this situation. However, devolving fisheries management does not guarantee that the interests of both society and the fishery managers will be achieved. For example, statutory fishery management agencies are often monopoly suppliers (Carter, Klein and Day 1990). Furthermore, because fishery management services are not supplied in the open market, management performance cannot be assessed by the willingness to pay of those receiving the service. Nor {{is it possible to}} use the competitive survival of specific services and organizations to indicate satisfactory fishery management outcomes. In addition to pursuing resource use efficiency, fishery managers are required to meet distributional and equity goals of governments regarding the resource access of various user groups. As a result, fishery managers often have to meet multiple performance objectives. The difficulties <b>of</b> achieving satisfactory <b>fishery</b> management performance, creates a need to monitor and <b>control</b> the performance <b>of</b> <b>fishery</b> management agencies to ensure that they pursue socially desired outcomes. Eichner and Brecher (1979) noted that program control is generally seen as being achieved through input regulation, or structural reform, including 'community' (client) control. They proposed that output monitoring should also be used. The <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Commonwealth <b>fisheries</b> management can be seen to be following a similar path of development. In response to these issues, the Commonwealth Government (1989) has initiated institutional changes to the management <b>of</b> Commonwealth <b>fisheries.</b> These include splitting <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the day-to-day operation <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> management off to a statutory body (the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA), requiring commercial fishers to pay those fishery management costs attributable to commercial fisheries, and developing and applying performance indicators to monitor fisheries management...|$|R
