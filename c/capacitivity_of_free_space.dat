40|$|For most marine benthic {{communities}} unoccupied primary substrata, or <b>free</b> <b>space,</b> {{is considered}} the principle limiting resource. Substratum temperatures, desiccation rates and hydrodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space,</b> however, may vary depending on patch size and isolation and therefore potentially influence biotic processes. This paper investigates the relationship between small-scale changes in the availability and configuration <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space,</b> heat stress and abundance of the small rocky intertidal gastropod Patelloida latistrigata within southeastern Australia. Using infrared thermography I show that heat stress of rocky intertidal communities increased linearly with increasing amounts <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space</b> on three neighbouring shores during four separate sampling intervals from October 2009 to January 2010. Abundances of P. latistrigata generally declined with increasing availability <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space</b> and the associated increases in heat stress. An experimental manipulation that altered the configuration but not the availability <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space</b> demonstrated that both heat stress and P. latistrigata abundance are not affected by small-scale changes in the configuration <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> The small-scale distribution of P. latistrigata, however, was significantly influenced by differences in the configuration <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space</b> with limpets displaying bimodal distributions within areas characterised by unevenly distributed <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> Since the distribution of Patelloida varies depending on the configuration <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space</b> but thermal properties at the scale of individual limpets do not then we might expect Patelloida to be responding to changes in other abiotic factors, such as hydrodynamic forces and desiccation rates, which may change with the configuration <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space.</b> This study highlights the dynamic and usually unexamined relationship between abiotic stress and the availability and acquisition of resources by marine benthic invertebrates...|$|R

Shorter regions <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>space</b> also mean that the file system is {{no longer able to}} allocate new files contiguously, and has to break them into fragments.
