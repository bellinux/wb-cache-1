5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama trailed the LSU Tigers 17–14 with only 1:34 {{remaining}} in the game. The Crimson Tide then went on a five-play, 72-yard drive, <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> a 28-yard AJ McCarron touchdown pass to T. J. Yeldon with only 0:51 left, and defeated LSU 21–17 at Baton Rouge.|$|E
5|$|All erosion types took {{advantage}} of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, {{and the presence of}} cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed sedimentary rock that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> basalt which are separated by adjacent drainages.|$|E

5|$|Burrow Mump, {{an ancient}} {{earthwork}} {{owned by the}} National Trust, is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> Keuper marl, standing at a strategic point where the River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. It probably served as a natural outwork to the defended royal island of Athelney {{at the end of}} the 9th century.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930 s, {{reform was}} {{gradually}} legislated by the British; Congress won {{victories in the}} resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|In Michigan's October 10 {{game against}} Iowa, Robinson {{replaced}} Forcier {{in the fourth}} quarter with the team trailing 30–21. He led the team on a 59-yard scoring drive <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> his own 3-yard touchdown run with 3:16 left to cut the lead to 30–28. However, on the following drive, Robinson's threw an interception at Michigan's 31-yard line with 44 seconds remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|In the game, coach Mack Brown and his Texas Longhorns beat USC by {{the score}} of 41–38 and ended USC's 34game win streak. The game's outcome {{was still in}} doubt late in the fourth quarter, when the Trojans tried to convert a fourth down play that would win the game for them. After they were stopped Young led the Longhorns on a {{touchdown}} drive that was <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> his fourth down rush for the twelveyard touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Mills was <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> England {{at schools}} level before making his under-18 debut in a 1–0 {{victory over the}} Soviet Union on 10 October 1978. He won his second and last cap in a 4–0 victory over Belgium on 17 January 1979. Mills' debut for the under-21 team came in a 3–0 victory over Romania in a 1982 UEFA European Under-21 Championship {{qualifier}} on 28 April 1981. He was capped again in a 0–0 with draw Norway in a friendly on 8 September 1981.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's Pillar (also {{known as}} the Nelson Pillar or simply the Pillar) was a large granite column <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> a statue of Horatio Nelson, built in the centre of what was then Sackville Street (later renamed O'Connell Street) in Dublin, Ireland. Completed in 1809 when Ireland {{was part of the}} United Kingdom, it survived until March 1966, when it was {{severely}} damaged by explosives planted by Irish republicans. Its remnants were later destroyed by the Irish Army.|$|E

5|$|Some protein {{complexes}} {{contain a}} large central cavity that is {{isolated from the}} remainder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the proteasome. Here, a set of subunits form a hollow barrel containing proteases that degrade cytosolic proteins. Since these would be damaging if they mixed freely with {{the remainder of the}} cytosol, the barrel is <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> a set of regulatory proteins that recognize proteins with a signal directing them for degradation (a ubiquitin tag) and feed them into the proteolytic cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{eruption}} {{occurred in the}} late Miocene, about 7million years ago. The resulting stratum, the Rattlesnake Formation, lies {{on top of the}} Mascall and is <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> an ignimbrite. The Rattlesnake stratum has fossils of mastodons, camels, rhinoceroses, the ancestors of dogs, lions, bears, and horses, and others that grazed on the grasslands of the time.|$|E
5|$|The present château {{with its}} five conical towers and watchtower <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> slate roofs {{began to be}} built in the 15th century, and was altered and {{extended}} several times since then. A park was built in the 19th century through which a wide driveway brought visitors to the main building. This is based on a central square tower with a pyramidal roof.|$|E

5|$|The present château, {{designed}} on {{a triangular}} plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung in the master bedroom, were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The {{top of the}} {{peninsula}} is fairly flat, reaches an elevation of , and is <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> much younger sandstone and conglomerate deposits from the Pleistocene era, 1 million years or less in age. These flat-lying beds lie directly {{on top of the}} gently dipping Point Loma and Cabrillo formations. The gap in the sedimentary record, called an Angular unconformity, represents about 70 million years of non-deposition and/or erosion.|$|E
5|$|The various {{formations}} of Siletzia {{are characterized}} as marine tholeiitic pillow basalts and volcanic breccia, often interbedded with sedimentary layers of continental origin, lying on oceanic crust. These are usually <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> {{a layer of}} alkalic volcanics deposited subaerially. All this suggests these formations were initially deposited in an oceanic environment, possibly as seamounts or an island arc.|$|E

5|$|The western wing is {{dominated}} by a square tower of stone-dressed brick which rises two storeys above the roof and is <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> an ogee spirelet surrounded by four corner chimneys. Designed by Barry in the High Victorian style, it was added after the fire. A slender bell tower also rises from the west wing. At the rear is a loggia with a vaulted ceiling supported by Tuscan columns. The western end of this wing is a single-storey extension by Thomas Bower dating from 1896.|$|E
5|$|This {{island is}} {{unlikely}} to disappear entirely in the near future. The eroded area consisted mostly of loose tephra, easily washed away. Most of the remaining area is <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> hard lava flows, which are much more resistant to erosion. In addition, complex chemical reactions within the loose tephra within the island have gradually formed highly erosion resistant tuff material, in {{a process known as}} palagonitization. On Surtsey this process has happened quite rapidly, due to high temperatures not far below the surface.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are <b>capped</b> <b>by</b> a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the ascus.|$|E
