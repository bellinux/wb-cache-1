40|$|Hydrolysis of GTP {{is known}} to {{accompany}} microtubule assembly. Here we show that hydrolysis of GTP is also associated {{with the formation of}} linear oligomers of tubulin, which are precursors (prenuclei) in microtubule assembly. The hydrolysis of GTP on these linear oligomers inhibits the lateral association of GTP-tubulin that leads to the formation of a bidimensional lattice. Therefore GTP hydrolysis interferes with the nucleation of microtubules. Linear oligomers are also formed in mixtures of GTP-tubulin and GDP-tubulin. The hydrolysis of GTP associated with heterologous interactions between GTP-tubulin and GDP-tubulin in the <b>cooligomer</b> takes place at a threefold faster rate than upon homologous interactions between GTP-tubulins. The implication of these results in a model of vectorial GTP hydrolysis in microtubule assembly is discussed...|$|E

The RNA {{segments of the}} labeled fragments were isolated by degrading the DNA portion with the 3 ′→ 5 ′ exonuclease intrinsic to bacteriophage T 4 DNA polymerase and fractionated according to net charge by a DEAE-Sephadex A- 25 column chromatography {{in the presence of}} 7 M urea. Tri-, tetra- and pentanucleotides were obtained which have ATP residues at their 5 ′ ends. Most of the pentanucleotides had a single deoxynucleotide at the 3 ′ end but a minor portion was totally an oligoribonucleotide. In the light of prior results, the former is a <b>cooligomer</b> of an intact tetraribonucleotide primer and a monodeoxynucleotide and the latter is an intact pentaribonucleotide primer. Tri- and tetraribonucleotides with ATP at the 5 ′ ends had no deoxynucleotide at the 3 ′ ends, therefore it is not clear if intact triribonucleotide primers are present.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of organic semiconductors has been exten-sively developed {{in recent years}} due to the opportunity to fabricate low-cost and/or large-area electronic components. 1 Among them, ladder π-conjugated oligomers are regarded as promising materials due to their rigid coplanar structures and enhanced π-conjugation, which lead {{to a set of}} desirable properties, such as intense luminescence, high carrier mobility and environmental stability. 2 - 5 We have recently developed new approaches to prepare the fully ladder-type conjugated oligomers utilizing the BBr 3 -promoted intramolecular cycli-zation. 6 This method features with its fast and quantitative reaction to produce both electron-rich and electron-deficient conjugated systems with rigid planar structure. Another important development in the {{synthesis of}} π-conjugated oligomers has been the utilization of donor-acceptor (D-A) type architectures within the backbone. The donor-acceptor systems cause partial intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) that enables manipulation of the electronic structure, leading to low band gap semiconductors with relatively high charge carrier mobilities. 7, 8 In a fusion of these two concepts, we present herein the synthesis of D-A alternating <b>cooligomer</b> 1 where the acceptor is based on the ladder-type planar molecule prepared by the BBr 3 -promoted lactonization and the alkylated thiophene is used as a donor (Figure 1).

Poly(VDF-co-BDFE) copolymers of various aspects (from white powders to yellow viscous liquids) were produced {{depending on the}} copolymer compositions. The microstructures of the obtained copolymers were characterized by 19 F and 1 H NMR spectroscopy and by elementary analysis and these techniques enabled one to assess the contents of both comonomers in the produced copolymers. VDF was shown to be more incorporated in the copolymer than BDFE. From the extended Kelen and Tudos method, the kinetics of the radical copolymerization led to {{the determination of the}} reactivity ratios, ri, of both comonomers (rVDF ¼ 1. 20 6 0. 50 and rBDFE ¼ 0. 40 6 0. 15 at 75 °C) showing that VDF is more reactive than BDFE. Alfrey-Price's Q and e values of BDFE monomer were calculated to be 0. 009 (from QVDF = 0. 008) or 0. 019 (from QVDF = 0. 015) and þ 1. 22 (vs. eVDF = 0. 40) or þ 1. 37 (vs. eVDF = 0. 50), respectively, indicating that BDFE is an electron-accepting monomer.

40|$|International audienceThe {{synthesis}} of functionalized fluorocooligomers based on chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) and {{allyl glycidyl ether}} (AGE) under radical copolymerization is presented. The compositions of comonomers in the cooligomers were determined by three different analyses viz: from 1 H and 19 F NMR spectroscopy by using 1, 3 -bis(trifluoromethyl) benzene as the external standard, epoxy equivalent weight value, and elemental analyses. The compositions determined by three methods were matching reasonably well and showed that the esulting poly(CTFE-co- AGE) cooligomers exhibit a tendency for alternation. The distribution of the monomers in the cooligomers was proposed based on {{the assessment of the}} reactivity ratios, ri, of both comonomers. These values were determined from the kinetics of radical copolymerization of CTFE with AGE from Fineman- Ross, Kelen-Tudos, and extended Kelen-Tudos methods which led to the assessment of the average reactivity ratios as: rCTFE ¼ 0. 20 6 0. 03 and rAGE ¼ 0. 15 6 0. 08 at 74 C. The lower Mn values substantiated the formation of cooligomers rather than copolymers. The formation of cooligomers was attributed to the chain transfer to AGE (by hydrogen abstraction from AGE) from the allylic transfer. The poly(CTFE-co-AGE) cooligomers were soluble in most of the common organic polar solvents. An optimization of <b>cooligomer</b> yields was investigated by using ethyl vinyl ether as a third comonomer and from different initiators.

Chapter 5 reviews recent developments in modelling charge pair generation, focussing on electronic structure calculations of interfacial states, electrostatic models, excited state dynamics, and remaining challenges in achieving a predictive approach. In Chapter 6, we study the influence of chemical structure and mutual position of oligomer:fullerene pairs on interfacial state properties using time-dependent density functional theory, reproducing energy trends measured by electroluminescence in corresponding polymer:fullerene systems.

Interestingly, both these pentafluorosulfanyl monomers exhibit different behaviors in that radical terpolymerization in the presence of C 6 F 13 I as a degenerative chain transfer agent. Thus, CF 2 CFSF 5 can be terpolymerized with VDF and HFP with a good control of molecular weight leading fluoropolymers bearing SF 5 groups with low polydispersity index (PDI). Unexpectedly, only two iodide functionalities of the terpolymers namely two end groups (-CH 2 CF 2 I and -CF 2 CH 2 I) were observed and their proportions were influenced by the number of VDF units.

On the other hand, for the complexes bearing 2 -naphthyl-substituted ligands a single species was observed in solution. The cationic derivatives were tested as precatalysts both in CO/styrene and ethylene/MA copolymerizations under mild conditions, highlighting that: i. in CO/styrene copolymerization BIAN ligands generate more productive and more stable catalysts than DAB derivatives (2. 73 kg CP/g Pd vs 0. 79 kg CP/g Pd); ii. in ethylene/MA copolymerization opposite trend is found: DAB-containing catalysts are better performing than BIAN-analogues (201. 3 g P/g Pd vs 27. 0 g P/g Pd); iii. for both reactions, regardless to the ligand skeleton, catalysts with 2 -naphthyl-substituted ligands show a catalytic behaviour analogous to that of catalysts with meta-substituted aryl-BIANs, while catalysts with 1 -naphthyl-substituted ligands show a catalytic behaviour analogous to that of catalysts with ortho-substituted aryl-BIANs.

40|$|One of {{the major}} unsolved {{problems}} in polymer chemistry {{is represented by the}} synthesis of functionalized polyolefines, that are currently produced through radical processes, a technology that suffers from high energy consumption, low cost efficiency and poor control over the macromolecule structure. 1 The direct, controlled, homogeneously catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with polar vinyl monomers represents a sustainable technology to overcome these limits. The main catalytic systems reported in the literature are based on Pd(II) compounds with either -diimines or phosphino-sulfonate ligands. 2 Their productivity is thus far low from the values required for an industrial application, and better performing catalysts are strongly needed. With this aim we are studying Pd(II) complexes with new nonsymmetric -diimines (Ar,Ar'-BIAN) featured by an acenaphthene skeleton and one aryl ring substituted in meta positions with electron-withdrawing groups, while the other ring bears electron-releasing substituents on the ortho positions (Figure up).

The catalysts with the nonsymmetric Ar,Ar'-BIAN showed a productivity twice as high as that of the catalysts with the corresponding symmetric ligands together with a higher incorporation of the polar monomer into the catalytic product.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Conducting {{polymers}} have attracted great attention {{for the last}} two decades because of their potential applications in many fields. One of the major goals for the scientists who are studying in this field is to synthesize conducting polymers with extremely low band gap. Such polymers would be intrinsically conducting, and thus eliminating the need for doping. Several powerful approaches are proposed to synthesize low band gap polymers. One of them is the donor/acceptor concept, which was proposed by Havinga and his co-workers. In their model, they attached regularly alternating electron withdrawing and electron donating groups to the carbon backbone. By connecting these groups, they aimed to decrease the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, and to increase the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the polymer respectively. By this way they claimed that one could obtain very low band gap conducting polymers by introducing the alternating donor/acceptor groups, where the electronegativity difference between these groups is highest. Huang and Pickup synthesized donor/acceptor copolymers of 3, 4 - ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) which is considered as electron donating group and 4 -dicyanomethylene- 4 H-cyclopenta[2, 1 -b: 3, 4 -b’]dithiophene (CDM) as electron withdrawing group. By changing the monomer ratio in the copolymers, they decreased the band gap to less than 0. 16 eV, however, the intrinsic conductivity was about 10 - 3 S/cm. Although a very low band gap was achieved, the conductivities of copolymers were still low. To understand this behaviour and also to check the validity of donor/acceptor concept, we performed theoretical studies for these systems. Monomer through hexamer of EDOT, oligomers for 1 : 1 copolymer of EDOT and CDM were optimized using density functional theory. Ionization potentials, electron affinities, energy gaps, and band widths of the polymers were obtained by extrapolation. The lowest band gaps are calculated for copolymer poly-CDM-EDOT and poly-CDM. Band gaps of the polymers are found to agree well with the experimental values. When we combine two monomers (EDOT: electron-rich, CDM: electrondeficient) in one to one ratio and in different ratios in order to form co-oligomers, the highest occupied molecular orbitals of co-oligomers are averaged between the HOMO levels of parent homo-oligomers. Lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of <b>cooligomers</b> are also averaged between the LUMO levels of parent homo-oligomers; however, averaged LUMO levels of co-oligomers are more close in energy to the LUMO level of CDM oligomer. We also found that poly-CDM and poly-CDMEDOT have very flat conduction bands. These narrow bands are attributed to the localized states, which decrease the mobility of n-type carriers in these bands consistent with the experimental findings. Overall, we concluded that donor/acceptor concept can be used to decrease the band gap while sacrificing the dispersion of valence and conduction bands. However, band broadening does not occur in alternating donor/acceptor polymers as donor/acceptor approach suggested. Köse, Muhammet ErkanM. S...|$|R
