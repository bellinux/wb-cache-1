When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E
25|$|Aurelian {{strengthened}} {{the position of}} the Sun god Sol Invictus as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon. His intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god they <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> in without betraying their own gods. The center of the cult was a new temple, built in 274 and dedicated on December 25 of that year in the Campus Agrippae in Rome, with great decorations financed by the spoils of the Palmyrene Empire.|$|E
25|$|The Rams {{jumped out}} to a 17–0 lead on the Colts in the RCA Dome {{in front of a}} Monday Night Football audience, and few <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> it. The 5–0 Colts were down 17 points {{at the end of the}} first quarter, and the 2–5 Rams had all the {{confidence}} in the world. That drastically changed in the second half, however. After two interceptions by MLB Cato June that set up two touchdowns, an interception and a fumble recovery by CB Nick Harper that also set up two touchdown scores, the Colts scored all 45 of their points in three quarters, and held the Rams to just 11 points in those quarters.|$|E

25|$|To {{begin with}} {{cognitive}} responses in infidelity, individuals {{whom have been}} cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. They may feel that their partner has lost interest in them and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with (Johnson, 2017). Therefore, they anticipate {{the loss of their}} partner's emotional interest in them and become jealous for more clear reasons. They <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> that they are losing someone who they care deeply about, or they may feel as if their partner is mad at them and doing it out of spite, etc. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individual’s significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.|$|E
25|$|Beach {{appeared}} on {{maps of the}} time, notably that of Abraham Ortelius of 1570 and that of Jan Huygen van Linschoten of 1596, as the northernmost part of the southern continent, the Terra Australis, along with Locach. According to Marco Polo, Locach was a kingdom where gold was “so plentiful that no one who did not see it <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> it”. Beach {{was in fact a}} mistranscription of Locach. Locach was Marco Polo’s name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lavo, or Lop Buri, the “city of Lavo”, (ลพบุรี, after Lavo, the son of Rama in Hindu mythology). In Chinese (Cantonese), Lavo was pronounced “Lo-huk” (羅斛), from which Marco Polo took his rendition of the name. In the German cursive script, “Locach” and “Boeach” look similar, and in the 1532 edition of Marco Polo’s Travels his Locach was changed to Boëach, later shortened to Beach.|$|E
25|$|Nearly half {{a century}} after Elagabalus, Aurelian came to power. He was a reformer, {{strengthening}} {{the position of the}} sun-god as the main divinity of the Roman pantheon; he even built a brand new temple, in Rome, dedicated to the deity. It's also thought likely that he may have been responsible for establishing the festival of the day of the birth of the unconquered sun (Dies Natalis Solis Invicti), which was celebrated on December 25, the day when the sun appears to start rising again - four days after having previously reached its lowest point, though the earliest surviving reference to the festival is in the Chronography of 354. He followed the principle of one god, one empire; his intention was to give to all the peoples of the Empire, civilian or soldiers, easterners or westerners, a single god they <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> in without betraying their own gods. Lactantius argued that Aurelian would have outlawed all the other gods if he had had enough time, but Aurelian only managed {{to hold on to the}} position of Emperor for five years.|$|E

Anderson told producers of his intention to leave one year prior to his departure. They wanted Oliver to leave the show {{on a positive note}} and began planning his final storyline. Anderson filmed his final scenes in March 2013. Producers kept his departure a secret until transmission to surprise viewers. Anderson told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that Oliver survived the bereavement over the deaths of his sister and wife. Oliver was given redemption in his final scenes so that his fans <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> that he has a future. Oliver resigns and in his final scene tells Elliot that he will return to the hospital. Anderson was pleased that his character has the option of returning in the future.|$|E
500|$|The gaps, {{the longest}} of which {{measures}} about [...] long, {{appear to have}} followed {{the line of the}} hull plates. This suggests that the iron rivets along the plate seams snapped off or popped open to create narrow gaps through which water flooded. An engineer from Titanics builders, Harland and Wolff, suggested this scenario at the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry following the disaster but his view was discounted. Titanics discoverer Robert Ballard has commented that the assumption that the ship had suffered a major breach was [...] "a by-product of the mystique of the Titanic. No one <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> that the great ship was sunk by a little sliver." [...] Faults in the ship's hull may have been a contributing factor. Recovered pieces of Titanics hull plates appear to have shattered on impact with the iceberg, without bending.|$|E

However, Green received criticism for changing the lyric [...] "and no religion too" [...] to [...] "and all religions true", resulting in an immediate backlash from fans who believed that he had disrespected Lennon's legacy by changing the lyrics of his most iconic song. Green defended the change by saying it meant to represent [...] "a world [...] <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> what [...] wanted". The event got media attention outside of the US, with Britain's The Guardian stating [...] "Lennon's original lyrics don't praise pluralism or interchangeable religious truths – they damn them".|$|E
500|$|I cannot {{withhold}} my compliments {{from the}} government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march ....

The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation I can put upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though it is, is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent .... It {{remains to be seen whether}} the Government will tolerate as they have tolerated the march, the actual breach of the salt laws by countless people from tomorrow.|$|E

She originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos, but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that [...] "You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent." [...] It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone. Whitney described {{the application of the}} wig, saying [...] "they nailed it to my head every morning." [...] It was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it. In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly. The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.|$|E

[...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.'

500|$|While Nelson was {{apparently}} convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine, most biographers, researchers, and other observers {{have concluded that}} his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic. He told Dobson that [...] "true crime" [...] detective magazines had [...] "corrupted" [...] him and [...] "fueled [...] fantasies ... {{to the point of}} becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, [...] "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [...] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up." [...] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer. [...] "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. [...] "The problem was Bundy." [...] "I wish I <b>could</b> <b>believe</b> that his motives were altruistic," [...] wrote Rule. [...] "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds.
