50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game you are provided with an interface allowing you to <b>choose</b> <b>your</b> lord's <b>name,</b> and to select the prefecture where you will reside. Once that is done you are automatically given a single city and provided with clearings to construct buildings. Cities and military revolve around the consumption of resources; food, lumber, stone, and iron. To produce resources you must construct resource fields in the rural area of your city. Without resources buildings can't be constructed, and the city will come to a standstill. Another important factor is population, which can be consumed for training soldiers, collecting taxes and working resource fields. Without a peasant population, the previous things can't be done, you can acquire more peasants by building and upgrading cottages.|$|R
