40|$|At {{the annual}} conference of the African National Congress (ANC) in January 1959, a National Anti-Pass Planning Council was appointed, and the year 1959 {{declared}} "Anti-Pass Year". From the inception of the ANC, to its banning in 1960, passes for Africans is a continuous theme of ANC protest activity. Albert Luthuli writes of {{the early years of the}} ANC: things were beginning to move. In the Free State in 1913 there were widespread anti-pass demonstrations and numerous arrests. In 1919 Congress organised an anti-pass campaign - in Johannesburg alone there were 700 arrests. But in 1959 passes have become the major focus of ANC opposition to Apartheid. It was this decision; to <b>centre</b> protest <b>against</b> <b>Apartheid</b> specifically around the issue of passes, which finally culminated in the shootings at Sharpeville in March 1960 and launched the crises of the early 1960 's for the South African State. This paper seeks to explain why the ANC adopted the Natives Abolition of Pases Act of 1952 as its major thrust of protest activity in 1959. It examines the Anti-Pass Campaign led by the Federation of South African Women (F. S. A. W.) prior to the adoption by the ANC of an anti-pass campaign. Most previous efforts to explain the events leading up to the Sharpeville crisis have not looked at the campaign of the F. S. A. W., nor the general resistance to passes by African women, which began in 1955. The F. S. A. W. 's campaign is generally ignored as a factor influencing the ANC decision, and yet it is probably more significant than any other...|$|R

5000|$|No {{one knows}} more about Gandhi’s impact in South Africa than a man named E. S. Reddy. A student radical in India in the 1940s, Reddy was the moving spirit behind the United Nations’ <b>Centre</b> <b>Against</b> <b>Apartheid</b> from the 1960s to the 1980s. Writing in 1996, Reddy noted that Gandhi’s example and methods {{animated}} both the Indian passive resistance of 1946 and the broader Defiance Campaign of 1952. Then he continued: ‘Even when the ANC decided on armed struggle, there was great emphasis on avoiding loss of life. Non-violent resistance continued in new forms throughout the struggle. The influence of Gandhi may also be discerned {{in the spirit of}} reconciliation which followed the establishment of a democratic government in 1994. I believe that the thor liberation.’ ...|$|E
40|$|The notorious {{governmental}} {{policy of}} Apartheid affects {{the people of}} that country psycho-logically, as well as politically, socially, economically and medically. It does so {{in a variety of}} ways, including: the humiliating effects on blacks and arrogance inducing effects on whites; the disruption of family-life by the enforced migrant labor system; the stunted brain-development and behavioral effects that result from the inexcusably widespread childhood malnutrition in that wealthy country, (the world’s 6 th-largest food-exporter); the distortions and alienations in personality development, on racial lines; the mental breakdowns and suicides that result from the physical and mental torture that uncharged security-police detainees are subjected to while under interrogation. In addition, when mental health services are required they are grossly inferior for blacks, especially in the rural areas and particularly in out-patient care. The white-doctor: black-patient relationship, perforce the rule, is distinctly problematic in this socio-political climate. The World Medical Association and the World Psychiatric Association have been supportive to the South African government and silent, respectively, {{in the face of all}} the documented information on this hazardous public health situation. The United Naitons and its agencies, the World Health Organization and the <b>Centre</b> <b>Against</b> <b>Apartheid,</b> should be commended for their work and unequivocal stands on this issue and should be heeded in their calls for a principled response by more of the world’s psychiatric, psychological and medical communities.
