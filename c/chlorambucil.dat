25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, <b>chlorambucil,</b> and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), <b>chlorambucil,</b> and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone CHOP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone , vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy is the {{mainstay}} of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated {{with a combination of}} prednisolone and high dose pulse <b>chlorambucil</b> with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.|$|E
25|$|The subtypes of alkylating {{agents are}} the {{nitrogen}} mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, <b>chlorambucil,</b> ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with CLL, it is incurable by present {{treatment}}s, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than totally and permanently eliminating it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with <b>chlorambucil</b> or cyclophosphamide, plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone. The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier patients may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation {{in the hope of}} a permanent cure.|$|E
2500|$|Some cancer {{treatments}} like bexarotene, busulfan, <b>chlorambucil,</b> estramustine, etoposide, flutamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, ixabepilone, letrozole, lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, procarbazine, tamoxifen, topotecan ...|$|E
2500|$|Complete cure is rare with {{lymphoma}} {{and treatment}} {{tends to be}} palliative, but long remission times are possible with chemotherapy. [...] With effective protocols, average first remission times are 6 to 8 months. [...] Second remissions are shorter and harder to accomplish. [...] Average survival is 9 to 12 months. [...] The most common treatment {{is a combination of}} cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin. [...] Other chemotherapy drugs such as <b>chlorambucil,</b> lomustine (CCNU), cytosine arabinoside, and mitoxantrone are sometimes used in the treatment of lymphoma by themselves or in substitution for other drugs. [...] In most cases, appropriate treatment protocols cause few side effects, but white blood cell counts must be monitored.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people have}} a history of {{exposure}} to chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents such as melphalan, cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and <b>chlorambucil)</b> or radiation (therapeutic or accidental), or both (e.g., at the time of stem cell transplantation for another disease). Workers in some industries with heavy exposure to hydrocarbons such as the petroleum industry have a slightly higher risk of contracting the disease than the general population. Xylene and benzene exposure has been associated with myelodysplasia. Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange are at risk of developing MDS. A link may exist between the development of MDS [...] "in atomic-bomb survivors 40 to 60 years after radiation exposure" [...] (in this case, referring to people who were in close proximity to the dropping of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II).|$|E
50|$|This is {{important}} since <b>chlorambucil,</b> as an electrophile, is made less reactive by conjugation with glutathione, thereby making the drug less toxic to the cell. Shown above, <b>chlorambucil</b> reacts with glutathione as catalyzed by hGSTA 1-1 {{leading to the}} formation of the monoglutathionyl derivative of <b>chlorambucil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bone marrow {{suppression}} (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) is {{the most}} commonly occurring side effect of <b>chlorambucil.</b> Withdrawn from the drug, this side effect is typically reversible. Like many alkylating agents, <b>chlorambucil</b> {{has been associated with}} the development of other forms of cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorambucil</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Everett et al.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which <b>Chlorambucil</b> acts to kill tumor cells are not yet completely understood.|$|E
50|$|Prednimustine {{is a drug}} used in chemotherapy. It is the ester {{formed from}} two other drugs, {{prednisolone}} and <b>chlorambucil.</b> It {{can be associated with}} myoclonus.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent study}} has shown <b>Chlorambucil</b> to be {{detoxified}} by human glutathione transferase Pi (GST P1-1), an enzyme {{that is often}} found over-expressed in cancer tissues.|$|E

5000|$|MALT {{lymphoma}} is exquisitely immunotherapy sensitive. Chemotherapy {{is reserved}} for those uncommon patients with disseminated disease at presentation or lack of response to local treatment. Rituximab, the anti-CD20 chimeric antibody, is {{a key component of}} therapy. Responses vary from 55% to 77% with monotherapy and 100% in combination with chemotherapy. Oral alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or <b>chlorambucil</b> have been administered for a median duration of 12 months with high rates of disease control (CR up to 75%) but appear not to be active in t(11;18) disease. [...] The purine nucleoside analogs fludarabine and cladribine also demonstrate activity, [...] the latter conferring a CR rate of 84% (100% in those with gastric primaries) in a small study. [...] A pivotal study of rituximab plus <b>chlorambucil</b> compared with <b>chlorambucil</b> alone (IELSG-19 study, n = 227) demonstrated a significantly higher CR rate (78% vs. 65%; p = 0.017) and 5-year EFS (68% vs. 50%; p = 0.024) over <b>chlorambucil</b> alone. However, 5-year OS was not improved (88% in both arms). First-line treatment of choice is generally rituximab in combination with single alkylating agents or fludarabine, or a combination of all three drugs. The final results of this study, including the later addition of a rituximab-alone arm, are pending.|$|E
50|$|SPAs {{have not}} been shown to {{directly}} modify DNA or have activity other than direct blocking of other factors or processes. However, modifying agents can be bound to the tail ends of the hairpin structure. The specific binding of the SPA to DNA allows for site-specific targeting of the conjugated modifying agent. SPAs have been paired with the DNA-alkylating moieties cyclopropylpyrroloindole and <b>chlorambucil</b> that were able to damage and crosslink SV40 DNA. This effect inhibited cell cycling and growth. <b>Chlorambucil,</b> a chemotherapeutic agent, was more effective when conjugated to an SPA than without.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorambucil</b> is a {{white to}} pale beige {{crystalline}} or granular powder with a slight odor. When heated to decomposition it emits very toxic fumes of hydrogen chloride and nitrogen oxides.|$|E
50|$|On November 13, 2013 the US FDA {{approved}} obinutuzumab {{in combination}} with <b>chlorambucil</b> as a first-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, {{and was the first}} drug with breakthrough therapy designation to gain approval.|$|E
5000|$|... 2013 - Gazyva (obinutuzumab): For use in {{combination}} with <b>chlorambucil</b> to treat patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Gazyva is the first drug with breakthrough therapy designation to receive FDA approval.|$|E
5000|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) is seen in people with cancer, especially leukaemia, who receive chemotherapy with a cytotoxic drug. These include: Bleomycin, <b>chlorambucil,</b> cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, lomustine, mitoxantrone, topotecan, and vincristine.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the agents}} are known as [...] "Classical alkylating agents". These include true alkyl groups, and have been known for a longer time {{than some of the}} other alkylating agents. Examples include {{melphalan}} and <b>chlorambucil.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although the purine {{analogue}} fludarabine {{was shown}} to give superior response rates to <b>chlorambucil</b> as primary therapy, no evidence shows early use of fludarabine improves overall survival, and some clinicians prefer to reserve fludarabine for relapsed disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorambucil,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Leukeran among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For CLL it is a preferred treatment. It is given by mouth.|$|E
5000|$|It first {{received}} FDA approval on April 17, 2014, for use {{in combination}} with <b>chlorambucil,</b> {{for the treatment of}} previously untreated patients with CLL for whom fludarabine-based therapy is considered inappropriate MHRA approval on the 19th of April 2010, ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorambucil</b> {{produces}} its anti-cancer effects by {{interfering with}} DNA replication and damaging the DNA in a cell. The DNA damage induces cell cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis via {{the accumulation of}} cytosolic p53 and subsequent activation of Bax, an apoptosis promoter.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, {{aromatic}} mustards like <b>chlorambucil</b> {{were introduced}} as less toxic alkylating agents than the aliphatic nitrogen mustards, {{proving to be}} less electrophilic and react with DNA more slowly. Additionally, these agent can be administered orally, a significant advantage.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{nitrogen mustard}} drug, mustine (HN2), {{is no longer}} commonly in use because of excessive toxicity. Other nitrogen mustards developed as treatments include cyclophosphamide, <b>chlorambucil,</b> uramustine, ifosfamide, melphalan, and bendamustine. Bendamustine has recently re-emerged as a viable chemotherapeutic treatment.|$|E
50|$|As the granulomas {{are caused}} by {{collections}} of immune system cells, particularly T cells, {{there has been some}} success using immunosuppressants (like cyclophosphamide, cladribine, <b>chlorambucil,</b> and cyclosporine), immunomodulatory (pentoxifylline and thalidomide), and anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment (such as infliximab, etanercept, golimumab, and adalimumab).|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include bone marrow suppression. Other {{serious side effects}} include an {{increased}} long term risk of further cancer, infertility, and allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy often results in harm to the baby. <b>Chlorambucil</b> is in the alkylating agent family of medications. It works by blocking the formation of DNA and RNA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chlorambucil</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 111.87 USD per month. In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS about 145.84 pounds per months. It was originally made from nitrogen mustard.|$|E
50|$|In {{the pivotal}} {{clinical}} trial of obinutuzumab {{in combination with}} <b>chlorambucil,</b> clinical trial subjects experienced infusion reactions (69%; 21% grade 3/4), neutropenia (40%; 34% grade 3/4), thrombocytopenia (15%; 11% grade 3/4), anemia (12%), and pyrexia and cough (10% each). More than 20% of subjects had abnormal lab tests including low calcium and sodium, high potassium, increases in serum creatinine and liver function tests, and low albumin levels.|$|E
5000|$|Avoiding sun {{exposure}} {{and the use}} of sunscreens (not containing zinc oxide, which is toxic to dogs) is important. Topical therapy includes corticosteroid use. Oral vitamin E or omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are also used. More refractory cases may require the use of oral niacinamide and tetracycline, corticosteroids, azathioprine, or <b>chlorambucil.</b> [...] Treatment is often lifelong, but there is a good prognosis for long-term remission.|$|E
50|$|Chlorambucil's current use {{is mainly}} in chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia, {{as it is}} well tolerated by most patients, though <b>chlorambucil</b> has been largely replaced by fludarabine as first-line treatment in younger patients. It {{can be used for}} treating some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, polycythemia vera, trophoblastic neoplasms, and ovarian carcinoma. Moreover, it also has been used as an immunosuppressive drug for various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, such as nephrotic syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Lenalidomide is {{undergoing}} clinical trial {{as a treatment}} for Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and solid tumor cancers, such as carcinoma of the pancreas. One Phase 3 clinical trial being conducted by Celgene in elderly patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia was halted in July 2013 when a disproportionate number of cancer deaths were observed during treatment with lenalidomide versus patients treated with <b>chlorambucil.</b>|$|E
