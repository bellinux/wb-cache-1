5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did not start serious work until October. Kerry was <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> his ability to perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat is {{the prime}} example of the {{classical}} style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> the use of sandstone (rather than brick or laterite) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite {{was used for the}} outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|For the 1947–48 season, defenceman Doug Harvey {{joined the}} team. Within {{a couple years}} Harvey would become the best offensive-oriented defenceman in the NHL and he and Bouchard would form a long-time and very {{effective}} defensive pairing.

5|$|Fuller, however, was <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> {{his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be {{strongly}} anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E

Originally called Half-Life 2: Aftermath, the game was later renamed to Episode One after Valve became <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> using an episodic structure for the game. Similar to Half-Life 2, Episode One also uses the Source game engine. The game debuted new lighting and animation technologies, as well as AI sidekick enhancements.|$|E

David's Napoleon is flamboyant, <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> his leadership of the French army, and in his ability to cross the Alps and defeat the Austrians in Italy. Delaroche's Napoleon is instead downcast, gaunt and embittered by the harsh cold. His eyes and expressionless face evidence his weariness, his tiredness a result of the long and unstable trek.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{remained}} <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> his team's {{ability to}} repeat as AL champions in 1928 season. Huggins supplemented his team by acquiring Bill Dickey from the minor leagues. He acquired Stan Coveleski, who {{was attempting to}} return to his peak years, but released him in August when the former star continued to struggle. The Yankees reached the 1928 World Series, winning their sixth pennant in eight years, and defeated the Cardinals 4 games to 0. This was the first time a team swept their opponents in consecutive World Series'.|$|E

I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> your body and show it off.

5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. <b>Confident</b> <b>in</b> strong sales, {{the company had}} told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E
5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E

5|$|After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel {{released}} his debut album All I Want Is You in November 2010. It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said that the experience of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E
5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were highly prized. For those who were not <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, and that a 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E

Noting that she had recently become secretary of her parent-teacher association, she said that she was beginning to feel more <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> herself.

A sequel, Pilotwings 64, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 as a launch title for its respective system. A second sequel for the Nintendo 64, which showed off the console's capabilities, was cancelled. In 2003, {{it was announced}} that Factor 5 was working on a GameCube incarnation of the Pilotwings series. Development was moved to Nintendo's Wii console shortly thereafter. However, an anonymous blogger claimed in late 2009 that Factor 5 had indeed finished working on it, but that Nintendo was not <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> publishing it. Nintendo finally announced a new title in the series, the Nintendo 3DS title Pilotwings Resort, at E3 2010.

5|$|Development of {{the game}} officially began in January 2013. Ubisoft Montreal, the {{developer}} of Patriots, handled the game's development, with Ubisoft's offices in Barcelona, Toronto, Kiev, Shanghai and Chengdu providing assistance. The game was originally called Rainbow Six Unbreakable, a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic but also the mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell. According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team was <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> their new vision for the game but very nervous when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.|$|E

Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the Kuma battalion reported that they were in place on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi was still <b>confident</b> <b>in</b> his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses.
