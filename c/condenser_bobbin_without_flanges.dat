50|$|It is the {{practice}} in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or <b>without</b> <b>flange</b> stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections <b>without</b> <b>flange</b> stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.|$|R

50|$|Diagram 2 {{shows the}} {{wheelset}} displaced to the left, due to {{curvature of the}} track or a geometrical irregularity. The left wheel (shown here) is now running on a slightly larger diameter; the right wheel opposite has moved to the left as well, towards {{the centre of the}} track, and is running on a slightly smaller diameter. As the two wheels rotate at the same rate, the forward speed of the left wheel is a little faster than the forward speed of the right wheel. This causes the wheelset to curve to the right, correcting the displacement. This takes place <b>without</b> <b>flange</b> contact; the wheelsets steer themselves on moderate curves <b>without</b> any <b>flange</b> contact.|$|R
40|$|In most {{available}} studies, unreinforced masonry (URM) {{walls are}} idealized as rectangular sections, while in reality walls have effective sectional shapes such as C, I, T, and L. In this article, {{the results of}} experimental and analytical assessment of flange effects {{on the behavior of}} I- and C-shaped URM walls are reported. Four clay brick walls at half scale were tested. Two specimens were designed with I-and C-shaped sections, and for comparison, two additional specimens were designed <b>without</b> <b>flanges.</b> The tests showed that under constant axial load the strength of the I-shaped wall increases, but that of the C-shaped wall decreases, because of out-of-plane distortion effects. Despite the loss of strength, both flanged walls indicated almost similar initial stiffness, deformation capacity, and mode of failure in comparison with walls <b>without</b> <b>flanges.</b> A mixed-mode analytical model is proposed to predict the lateral force displacement curve of flanged URM (FURM) walls. The proposed analytical model is based on section analysis of the walls and shows good agreement with previous experimental results...|$|R

50|$|Generally {{the aim is}} for {{trains to}} run <b>without</b> <b>flange</b> contact, which also depends on the tyre profile of the wheels. Allowance {{has to be made}} for the {{different}} speeds of trains. Slower trains will tend to make flange contact with the inner rail on curves, while faster trains will tend to ride outwards and make contact with the outer rail. Either contact causes wear and tear and may lead to derailment. Many high-speed lines do not permit slower freight trains, particularly with heavier axle loads. In some cases, the impact is reduced by the use of flange lubrication.|$|R

Its form was a close relative of a plateway, where longitudinal L-shaped metal plates were used to support and guide the wheels of wagons. In the Haytor case, the [...] "plates" [...] were cut from granite blocks; the upstand guided {{the wheels of the}} wagons.

50|$|The Class 470 {{locomotive}} was one {{of twelve}} standard designs developed by the FS right after their institution, and was intended for heavy mountain work. The two extreme axles were given a lateral play of 40 mm and the central wheels were <b>without</b> <b>flanges,</b> to allow the locomotive to deal even with sharp curves. The boiler was common {{with that of the}} FS Class 680, as was the four-cylinder compound Plancher engine, in which the two high pressure (HP) and the two low pressure (LP) cylinders were respectively grouped together, with each pair being served by a single piston valve via a crossed port arrangement.|$|R

50|$|E.550 {{had five}} axles {{connected}} to the two electric motors through an articulated coupling rod. The three center axles were rigidly mounted to the frame and the center axle's wheels were <b>without</b> <b>flanges.</b> The outer axles were mounted {{in a manner that}} allowed them to turn into curves. The wheels were small, and thus adapted to heavy freight or slow passenger services at low speed. The locomotive had two cabs, one {{at each end of the}} central compartment. The motors were asynchronous three-phase, which could be connected in series at low speed and in parallel at higher speeds. The connections were enabled through a tambour connector using a liquid-cooled rheostat. Feeding was provided by paired trolley poles at each end, each pair carrying two bow collectors for the two wires of the three phase system.|$|R
40|$|Design codes {{prescribe}} equations for {{the ultimate}} state design of RC walls with flange walls as boundary ele-ments. These codes consider part {{of the length of}} the flange wall as a width that will effectively resist lateral loads. However, wall damage and the accuracy of the effective width used in the calculations have not been sufficiently discussed. Therefore, a loading test is car-ried out at Yokohama National University on two 1 / 3 scale specimens in order to evaluate the strength, dam-age, energy dissipation, and behavior of RC structural walls in flexure.

5000|$|The coupled {{driving wheels}} on steam {{locomotives}} (often simply called [...] "drivers") {{were held in}} a straight line by the locomotive's frame. The flanges of the drivers were spaced a bit closer than the rail gauge, and they could still fit between the rails when tracking through a mild curve. At some degree of curvature, though, the flanges on the center driver would begin to bind in the curve. The farther apart were the front and rear drivers, the less track curvature the locomotive could negotiate. One solution was to make the center driver(s) [...] "blind," [...] i.e. <b>without</b> <b>flanges</b> on the tires. The other solution was to allow {{at least one of the}} axles (often the front driver) to move lateral to the frame, and such designs incorporated various devices to permit this motion.|$|R

Transient motion of pigs through gas pipelines has been simulated numerically {{in order to}} help engineers predict the variables related to pig motion such as estimating its speed, required driving pressure, and the amount of fluid bypass through the pig. In this paper, the continuity and linear momentum equations for compressible gas flows were discretized by finite difference method based on moving and staggered grids. These equations were solved together with dynamic equation for pig movement and the equation for modelling bypass flow. Besides, gas was considered both ideal and real. Test cases representing typical pigging operations in pipelines with or <b>without</b> <b>flanges</b> and branches were studied using the numerical model developed.

50|$|The {{thinnest}} part thickness {{determines the}} maximum stress {{that can be}} transferred to the deformation zone. Due to material volume constancy, the flange thickens and results in blank holder contact at the outer boundary rather than on the entire surface. The maximum stress that can be safely transferred from the punch to the blank sets a limit on the maximum blank size (initial blank diameter in the case of rotationally symmetrical blanks). An indicator of material formability is the limiting drawing ratio (LDR), defined as the ratio of the maximum blank diameter that can be safely drawn into a cup <b>without</b> <b>flange</b> to the punch diameter. Determination of the LDR for complex components is difficult and hence the part is inspected for critical areas for which an approximation is possible. During severe deep drawing the material work hardens and {{it may be necessary to}} anneal the parts in controlled atmosphere ovens to restore the original elasticity of the material.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{a study of}} the {{cylindrical}} vessels in horizontal position and subject to internal pressure is carried out, where lids are one of the main components of this equipment. The Autodesk Inventor pro. 2016 is used to make the geometrical characterization of these elements: parametric solid modeler, assembles and surfaces for the mechanical design of complex parts. The different geometric forms of the lids and bottoms analyzed in this work are: flat-circular with or <b>without</b> <b>flange,</b> elliptical with different values of the K factor, torispherical with different values of the M factor and the hemispherical bottoms. Using the Finate Element Method (FEM), a comparative study is made about the behavior of the stress and strain in the different geometrical forms mentioned before, being demonstrated that although the best resistance and rigidity values are presented by the hemispherical bottoms and the best options of production by the flat-circulars, they are not the bottoms used the most in this vessels, being the elliptic bottoms those of more use.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Adequate depth of cement {{penetration}} and cement mantle thickness {{is important for}} the durability of cemented cups. A flanged cup, as opposed to unflanged, has been suggested to give a more uniform cement mantle and superior cement pressurization, thus improving the depth of cement penetration. This hypothesis was tested experimentally. Materials and methods The same cup design with and <b>without</b> <b>flange</b> (both <b>without</b> cement spacers) was investigated regarding intraacetabular pressure, cement mantle thickness, and depth of cement penetration. With machine control, the cups were inserted into open-pore ceramic acetabular models (10 flanged, 10 unflanged) and into paired cadaver acetabuli (10 flanged, 10 unflanged) with prior pressurization of the cement. Results No differences in intraacetabular pressures during cup insertion were found, but unflanged cups tended to migrate more towards the acetabular pole. Flanged cups resulted in thicker cement mantles because of less bottoming out, whereas no differences in cement penetration into the bone were observed. Interpretation Flanged cups do not generate higher cementation pressure or better cement penetration than unflanged cups. A possible advantage of the flange, however, may be to protect the cup from bottoming out, and there is possibly better closure of the periphery around the cup, sealing off the cement-bone interface...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAutomobiles are {{required}} weight reduction and improvement of collision safety. Additionally, rigidity of vehicle bodies is important performance that affects driving stability. Collision safety and rigidity of vehicles are strongly affected by strength and rigidity {{of the structural}} components. Accordingly, they are made of high strength steel / ultra-high strength steel and have closed cross section shapes (closed-profiles). Conventional closed-profile components are currently assembled by spot welding of two press-formed parts. Flanges of press-formed parts {{are required}} for spot welding and inhibit weight reduction. In the present situation, a new forming method was developed for closed-profile parts <b>without</b> <b>flanges.</b> The developed method was constituted three forming processes by using conventional mechanical press machines. In the 1 st process, a steel sheet was partially stretched for adjustment of the cross section length and formed folds at ridgeline positions of the final shape. In the 2 nd process, the formed sheet in 1 st process was bent by press forming. In the 3 rd process, the formed sheet in 2 nd process was closed to hexagonal cross section shape by side tools which were driven transversely by cams. And finally it was added compression in plain by the punch. Trial product by the developed forming method satisfied the target performances (bending and torsion rigidity and collision strength).

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members are}} {{increasingly}} used as primary structural {{elements in the}} building industries around the world due to the availability of thin and high strength steels and advanced cold-forming technologies. Cold-formed lipped channel beams (LCB) are commonly used as flexural members such as floor joists and bearers. However, their shear capacities are determined based on conservative design rules. For the shear design of LCB web panels, their elastic shear buckling strength must be determined accurately including the potential post-buckling strength. Currently the elastic shear buckling coefficients of LCB web panels are determined by assuming conservatively that the web panels are simply supported at the junction between their flange and web elements. Hence finite element {{analyses were conducted to}} investigate the elastic shear buckling behavior of LCBs. An improved equation for the higher elastic shear buckling coefficient of LCBs was proposed based on finite element analysis results and included in the ultimate shear capacity equations of the North American cold-formed steel codes. Finite element analyses show that relatively short span LCBs <b>without</b> <b>flange</b> restraints are subjected to a new combined shear and flange distortion action due to the unbalanced shear flow. They also show that significant post-buckling strength is available for LCBs subjected to shear. New equations were also proposed in which post-buckling strength of LCBs was included...|$|R
