40|$|Rainfall {{passing over}} a given {{area is a}} highly dynamic process; it changes {{constantly}} in form and intensity. It varies constantly on short spatial and temporal scales that makes real time measurements {{of the amount of}} rainfall challenging. Measuring and sensing rain is important to be able to understand and control our urban environment. Traditionally, rainfall analysis for hydrologic modelling use spatial measurements collected at various sparsely spread observation points using rain gauges working on various principles such as weighing type, tipping bucket, capacitive type etc. An accurate representation of spatial model of rainfall is essential for hydrological operational purposes such as forecasting of river flow, flood irrigation planning and modelling of catchment areas. Measurement of drop size distribution are also exploited to investigate microphysics of precipitation and to improve rainfall remote sensing estimation techniques. However, the high initial costs of <b>convectional</b> <b>rain</b> gauges prevent collection of data with high spatial resolution. The research looks at investigating the sensor stack {{to be a part of}} an integrated sensor approach to develop a device architecture for the development of low cost integrated rain sensing and measuring the rain. The device architecture consists of three main stacks – energy generation layer, sensing layer, processing layer. The raindrop on impact causes vibration on the device surface. This force exerted by the raindrop causes a deflection and is measured indirectly by the use of a thin film piezo sensor. As part of the work, we find there is a good correlation between the vibrations caused and the size or volume of the raindrop by indirectly measuring the impact force of the raindrop. The working range of the device is between 100...|$|E
40|$|A {{hydrological}} {{study was}} undertaken to investigate precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff in the Browney basin, north-east England. The areal and seasonal distribution of precipitation {{during the period}} 1968 - 1972 were analysed and frequency analysis were carried out {{on the amount of}} rainfall and the number of raindays per month during the period 1939 - 1973 at Durham Observatory. There was a high correlation between yearly precipitation and altitude. October and September were the driest months of the year while February was the wettest month. The relatively high intensity rainfall in the late summer months gave evidence for the occurrence of <b>convectional</b> <b>rain</b> during this time of the year. A wide range in the amount of rainfall and in the number of rain-days for any given month at Durham Observatory was observed. To measure evapotranspiration two sets of evapotranspirometers were installed at two locations just outside the extreme eastern and western margins of the catchment. Other methods for measurement for estimation of evapotranspiration in the catchment were also used. These were the Penman and Thornthwaite formulae, the catchment water balance method and simple hydraulic lysimeters. The results of measured evapotranspiration at the two locations indicated greater evapotranspiration at the higher elevation. The use of simple hydraulic lysimeters for the measurement of actual evapotranspiration was discarded because of significant differences in the results of the replicates. A comparison of the catchment water balance evapotranspiration with the results from the other methods revealed that there was some moisture deficit in the catchment especially during the late summer months. Studies of runoff data from the catchment showed significant variations in the yearly, seasonal and short term patterns. These differences were explained by the differences in the amount and distribution of precipitation, evapotranspiration and antecedent soil moisture conditions. The overall hydrology of the catchment was studied by the simulation of the flow records during the period 1969 - 1973, using the Stanford Watershed Model IV. The results obtained revealed high correlations between the monthly recorded and simulated flows. The mean monthly recorded flow during the five year period exceeded the simulated flow by 2 percent. The actual evapotranspiration and groundwater components of the hydrologic cycle where also studies using the results of the simulation method...|$|E
50|$|Tukuyu, {{known as}} Neu Langenburg during the German colonial rule, {{is a small}} {{hillside}} town that lies about 36 mi {{south of the city}} of Mbeya, at an elevation of around 5000 ft in the highland Rungwe District of southern Tanzania, East Africa. Tukuyu town has a moderate to cool temperature ranging from 10° C in May/June to mid 20°C in around November.The town and surrounding areas are ever green all year round due the almost year round <b>convectional</b> <b>rains</b> resulting from Lake Nyasa(Lake Malawi).|$|R
