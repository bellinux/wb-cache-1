People {{of a number of}} different nationalities have settled on Sherkin, including artists, writers, craft workers, musicians, photographers, beekeepers, pilots, cattle <b>farmers,</b> mussel and <b>oyster</b> <b>farmers,</b> biologists, botanists and oceanologists, fishermen and sailors, teachers and doctors, horselovers and strawberry growers.|$|R
50|$|Since 1977, several boat {{builders}} in Brittany {{have built}} specialized amphibious vehicles {{for use in}} the area's mussel and oyster farming industries. The boats are made of aluminium, are relatively flat-bottomed, and have three, four, or six wheels, {{depending on the size of}} the boat. When the tide is out the boats can run on the tidal flats using their wheels. When the tide is in, they use a propeller to move themselves through the water. <b>Oyster</b> <b>farmers</b> in Jersey make use of similar boats. Currently, Constructions Maritimes du Vivier Amphibie has a range of models.|$|R
5000|$|Patrick {{was born}} to an <b>oyster</b> <b>farmer</b> and took up boxing in 1940 to earn money. He first fought under the name Alf Edwards, so that his mother would not know he was boxing.

He defended it two months later, again against Morgan, and in 1942 captured the Australian welterweight title. He kept the lightweight title until retirement in 1948, but relinquished the welterweight title in 1946.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} baseline {{information on}} the involvement of women in small-scale coastal aquaculture such as the farming of slipper oyster, Crassostrea iredalei (Faustino 1933), and green mussel, Perna viridis (Linnaeus 1758). Data were gathered during a socio-economic survey of oyster and mussel farming in Western Visayas, Philippines conducted from July to December 1991. There were 175 respondents interviewed; 18. 5 % and 2. 4 % of <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers</b> were females. Fishing and related activities were {{the major source of}} livelihood for the majority of <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers.</b> In 1990, 79. 4 % and 69. 8 % of <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers</b> earned an annual income of less than P 30 000 (1 USS P 23). Based on the 1988 (latest data available) poverty threshold of P 2654 (monthly) for Western Visayas, 80. 4 % and 71. 7 % of <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers</b> lived below poverty level in 1990. of 175 respondents. 79. 3 % and 48. 2 % of <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers</b> indicated that their household members participated in farming activities. More female household members were involved in oyster farming compared with mussel farming. Harvesting in mussel farming and both harvesting and marketing in oyster farming generated the widest participation among female household members...|$|R
40|$|Disappointing {{growth of}} cultured mussels and oysters in {{previous}} years resulted in a reduced yield for mussel and <b>oyster</b> <b>farmers.</b> This is accounted to the increasing amount of wild Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and the reduction of primary production of phytoplankton. The {{aim of this study}} was measuring growth of sub littoral C. gigas and M. edulis in the four compartments of Oosterschelde estuary, in relation to local food availability. In the North compartment of the Oosterschelde estuary local circumstances limited growth in relation to food availability. High mortality and limited growth in relation to food availability are attributed to a combination of reduced salinity, low currents velocity and the possibility of unfavourable alga...|$|R
50|$|While {{the oyster}} {{industry}} created wealth, it also suffered many setbacks and upheavals, {{as well as}} creating social inequalities. In 1885, some <b>oyster</b> <b>farmers</b> sought greater opportunities by immigrating to West Sayville, New York on Long Island, where wild oysters were once abundant. During the 20th century, further setbacks {{in the form of}} harsh winters, especially in 1963, and the threatened closing of the Eastern Scheldt by a dam almost led to the collapse of the oyster industry. After moderate recovery, the bacterium Bonamia ostreae infected the prevalent flat oysters, again decimating the industry in 1980. This led to the introduction of the Pacific Oyster, now the most cultivated oyster species, which some consider an invasive species.|$|R
40|$|Among the {{economically}} important bivalves, the slipper oyster (Crassostrea iredalei) and green mussel (Perna viridis) are predominantly being farmed in the Philippines. Oyster and mussel {{farms in the}} Western Visayas region have increased {{because of the need}} for supplementary sources of income brought about by the dwindling catch of small-scale fishermen. Socio-demographic and costs and returns data were gathered from 175 <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers</b> using a combination of rapid rural appraisal techniques and a pre-tested questionnaire. Oyster and mussel farms, less than 1000 m 2, were located among fish capture devices in rivers and bays. The <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers</b> belong to the marginalized sector of society with about 30 % of total household income derived from oyster and mussel farming. Problems encountered by <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers</b> included poaching, mortality due to siltation or sedimentation and pond effluents, no spat, lack of financing, and lack of buyers. This study recommends that <b>oyster</b> and mussel <b>farmers</b> form cooperatives to effectively market their produce and avail of financing, and research on the non-occurrence of spat...|$|R
50|$|As a {{prominent}} member of Brooklyn {{society and the}} judiciary, and as a Democratic party member, Martin was acquainted with notable contemporaries of his such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Brooklyn banker Herbert Losee, and the Long Island <b>oyster</b> <b>farmer</b> and entrepreneur Royal Toner. Martin {{was a member of}} the Episcopalian church, and was related to the Methodist Episcopal minister Reverend Dr. William Wallace Martin of Nashville, Tennessee. Although he belonged to the Episcopalian church, Martin's second wife was a Roman Catholic. He had his youngest son Walter Martin baptized as an Episcopalian, but arranged for his school education in a Catholic school and then at the evangelical The Stony Brook School. He maintained friendly relationships with many Catholics, and in 1922 was a guest speaker at the Brooklyn chapter of the Knights of Columbus.|$|R
