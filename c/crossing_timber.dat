50|$|A new {{alignment}} {{from the}} state line to Elk City {{was built in the}} late 1920s. It only coincided with the earlier route through Texola and through Sayre; the rest was entirely separate. Except in Sayre, where the city had paved the road with Portland cement (PC) in 1926, the state began paving the road in 1928 and 1929 with asphalt over a concrete base from Elk City to several miles east of Hext. It switched to PC in 1929, paving the remainder from east of Hext to the state line from 1929 to 1931. This alignment followed E1240 Road {{from the state}} line to Texola, and then the present main road through Erick and Hext to south of Sayre. The old cement lies {{in the center of the}} four-lane road through Texola, and then mainly follows the westbound lanes to Erick, through which it again lies in the center. A short abandoned piece of PC, including ruins from a former bridge over a creek, is located to the south of the road, between N1700 and N1710 Roads. Beyond Erick, the PC was again built in the present location of the westbound lanes, but has since been paved over until the I-40 interchange (exit 11). Just past exit 11, the road becomes two lanes, and the original road — mostly built as PC, but later resurfaced in asphalt, and once the westbound lanes of a divided highway - is now abandoned to the north of the open roadway; a 1928 concrete federal aid primary marker lies 0.8 mi west of Hext. Beyond Hext, where I-40 comes in from the south, the two-lane road crosses to the original roadway; the later eastbound lanes are now the westbound lanes of I-40. The 1929 alignment curved to the north into N1870 Road west of exit 20, following Main Street and Fourth Street as the original route did. However, it continued beyond Benton Boulevard to Sayre Avenue, turning off onto the present four-lane I-40 Bus. towards I-40 exit 25. Just prior to the exit, Route 66 curved northeast along the northside frontage road. It crossed to the south side after exit 26, <b>crossing</b> <b>Timber</b> Creek on a 1928 through truss bridge, and crossed again just east of the N1910 Road overpass. This part of the north frontage road, from east of N1910 Road to exit 32, retains the original 1928-1929 paving, as well as a 1926 box drain. Between exit 32 and Elk City, the original road (resurfaced) is now the westbound lanes of I-40 Bus., where another 1926 box drain still stands.|$|E

30|$|Oak-dominated {{forests in}} the Okmulgee area {{are part of a}} broad forest-prairie {{transition}} zone locally referred to as the <b>Cross</b> <b>Timbers</b> (Hoagland et al. 1999). Geochronological studies suggest that the <b>Cross</b> <b>Timbers</b> ecotone formed between the margins of the North American Great Plains prairie and eastern deciduous forest ecosystems more than 8000 years ago (Albert 1981, Bryant and Holloway 1985, Delcourt 2002). Soil type and a longitudinal moisture gradient strongly influenced woody and herbaceous vegetation, but fire helped shape this ecotone by altering vegetation composition and structure for the past 5000 years (Albert 1981, Hoagland et al. 1999, Anderson 2006). Lightning-initiated fires probably influenced the forest-prairie transition zone on a broader scale while anthropogenic ignitions may have maintained a patchwork of oak-dominated forests on a smaller scale (Pyne 1982, Frost 1998, Petersen and Drewa 2006). Therefore, the fire history of the <b>Cross</b> <b>Timbers</b> may be linked to the regional human history.|$|R
