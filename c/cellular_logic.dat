Similar to systems found in nature, these circuits use repressor protein concentrations as logic signals; a gate&# 8217;s input repressors interact with the cell&# 8217;s DNA to influence {{the production of the}} gate&# 8217;s output repressors. A limitation in building these circuits is the number of unique repressor proteins available to use as logic signals, and previous designs have consisted of only a few gates. In this paper, we propose a scalable <b>cellular</b> <b>logic</b> technology with zinc-finger proteins acting as the unique repressor logic signals. A zinc-finger protein binds to DNA at a specific target site determined by the nucleotide sequence, and zinc-finger proteins can readily be engineered to target almost any sequence. Our proposed technology uses engineered zinc-finger proteins and target DNA sequences as a scalable solution to implementing independent logic gates. The technology additionally attaches dimerization domains to the zinc-finger proteins to enable cooperativity and provide logic gates with nonlinear gain.

Because of this tremendous increase of digital images, there is an urgent need of image content description to facilitate automatic retrieval.

In CBIR, an image is described by several low level image features, such as color, texture, shape or the combination of these features.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} {{the design of}} two vectors {{testable}} sequential circuits based on conservative logic gates. The proposed sequential circuits based on conservative logic gates outperform the sequential circuits implemented in classical gates in terms of testability. Any sequential circuit based on conservative logic gates can be tested for classical unidirectional stuck-at faults using only two test vectors. The two test vectors are all 1 s, and all 0 s. The designs of two vectors testable latches, master-slave flip-flops and double edge triggered (DET) flip-flops are presented. The importance of the proposed work {{lies in the fact}} that it provides the design of reversible sequential circuits completely testable for any stuck-at fault by only two test vectors, thereby eliminating the need for any type of scan-path access to internal memory cells. The reversible design of the DET flip-flop is proposed for the first time in the literature. We also showed the application of the proposed approach toward 100 % fault coverage for single missing/additional cell defect in the quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) layout of the Fredkin gate.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Magnetism and {{magnetic}} material research on mesoscopic length scale, {{especially on the}} size-dependent scaling laws have drawn much attention. From a scientific point of view, magnetic phenomena would vary dramatically {{as a function of}} length, corresponding to the multi-single magnetic domain transition. From an industrial point of view, the application of magnetic interaction within the single domain limit has been proposed and studied in the context of magnetic recording and information processing. In this thesis, we discuss the characteristic lengths in a magnetic system resulting from the competition between different energy terms. Further, we studied the two basic interactions within the single domain limit: dipole interaction and exchange interaction using two examples with practical applications: magnetic quantum-dot <b>cellular</b> automata (MQCA) <b>logic</b> and bit patterned media (BPM) magnetic recording. Dipole interactions within the single domain limit for shape-tuned nanomagnet array was studied in this thesis. We proposed a 45 ° clocking mechanism which would intrinsically eliminate clocking misalignments. This clocking field was demonstrated in both nanomagnet arrays for signal propagation and majority gates for logic operation. Correct output and robust performance were detected for both configurations. Further, more complicated design, two digital binary full adder, was carried out. This novel design provides high stability for logic operation of MQCA and potentially paves way for its application. In addition, the magnetization reversal in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) system and its dependence on scaling law were studied. High quality epitaxial L 10 FePdPt and FePt thin films on MgO (001) substrate was fabricated. For FePd binary alloy thin films, we observed that Pt addition and low temperature post annealing would facilitate L 10 chemical ordering. For FePt thin film samples, reversal process {{and magnetic}} behavior were studied for both continuous film and patterned dots array. Further, patterned dots arrays within different length scale were developed to reveal the multi/single domain transition, which is observed to be around 200 nm for our L 10 FePt thin film.
