5|$|A {{practical}} use for Twitter's real-time functionality is {{as an effective}} de facto emergency <b>communication</b> system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance <b>communication,</b> {{but the idea that}} it could be used for emergency <b>communication</b> was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Blissymbols {{were first}} used in Canada in 1971 to provide <b>communication</b> to those {{not able to}} use {{traditional}} orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries. With improved technology, keyboard <b>communication</b> devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper. By {{the end of the}} 1970s, <b>communication</b> devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output. Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe <b>communication</b> impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.|$|E
5|$|<b>Communication</b> {{partners}} {{may also}} require training to notice and consistently interpret the <b>communication</b> signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly {{because there is}} a danger that learned helplessness can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully. Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive <b>communication</b> style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of <b>communication</b> skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent <b>Communication</b> (abbreviated NVC, {{also called}} Compassionate <b>Communication</b> or Collaborative <b>Communication)</b> is a <b>communication</b> process {{developed}} by Marshall Rosenberg {{beginning in the}} 1960s. It focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), empathy (defined as {{an understanding of the}} heart in which we see the beauty in the other person), and honest self-expression (defined as expressing oneself authentically {{in a way that is}} likely to inspire compassion in others).|$|E
5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of <b>Communication</b> in March 1932 to develop special tank <b>communication</b> devices. The plan was to equip each tank with a keyphone, while a platoon commander's tank would be {{equipped}} with a telephone switch for 6 subscribers (four for the tanks in the platoon, one for <b>communication</b> with infantry and one for contacting headquarters). A special terminal block was mounted on the rear of the tank so that <b>communication</b> wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|E
5|$|The Center for Nonviolent <b>Communication</b> (CNVC), {{founded by}} Marshall Rosenberg, has trademarked the terms NVC, Nonviolent <b>Communication</b> and Compassionate <b>Communication,</b> among other terms, {{for clarity and}} {{branding}} purposes.|$|E
5|$|The College of <b>Communication</b> Arts and Sciences was {{established}} in 1955 {{and was the first}} of its kind in the United States. The college's Media and Information Studies doctoral program was ranked No. 2 in 2007 by The Chronicle of Higher Education in the category of mass <b>communication.</b> The <b>communication</b> doctoral program was ranked No. 4 in a separate category of <b>communication</b> in The Chronicle of Higher Educations 2005 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index, published in 2007. The college's faculty and alumni include eight Pulitzer Prize winners and a two-time Emmy Award winning recording mixer.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} AAC {{can be traced}} to the days of {{classical}} Rome and Greece, with the first recorded use of augmentative strategies with the deaf. The use of manual alphabets and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century, as was the gestural system of Hand Talk used by Native Americans to facilitate <b>communication</b> between different linguistic groups. The first known widely available <b>communication</b> aid was a letter and word-based <b>communication</b> board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had cerebral palsy. This <b>communication</b> board was distributed in the 1920s by a men's group in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|There were three, {{relatively}} independent, research {{areas in}} the 1960s and 1970s {{that lead to the}} field of augmentative and alternative <b>communication.</b> First was the work on early electromechanical <b>communication</b> and writing systems. The second was the development of <b>communication</b> and language boards, and lastly there was the research on ordinary (without disability) child language development.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for <b>communication</b> with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border <b>communication</b> between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access <b>Communication</b> System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile <b>Communication</b> (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted <b>communication</b> was necessary.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{effective}} <b>communication</b> among patients and healthcare professionals {{is critical for}} achieving a patient's optimal health outcome. However, according to the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, ineffective <b>communication</b> has the opposite effect as {{it can lead to}} patient harm. <b>Communication</b> with regards to patient safety can be classified into two categories: prevention of adverse events and responding to adverse events. Use {{of effective}} <b>communication</b> can aid in the prevention of adverse events, whereas ineffective <b>communication</b> can contribute to these incidences. If ineffective <b>communication</b> contributes to an adverse event, then better and more effective <b>communication</b> skills must be applied in response to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient's safety. There are different modes in which healthcare professionals can work to optimize the safety of patients which include both verbal and nonverbal <b>communication,</b> as well as the effective use of appropriate <b>communication</b> technologies.|$|E
