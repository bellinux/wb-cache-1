The method used today by the national administrations for developing the <b>coordination</b> <b>contour</b> around these stations is vague and leads to unnecessarily large coordination areas. A new method of calculating the <b>coordination</b> <b>contour</b> is proposed for this type of stations. Its application to realistic scenarios leads to interesting results. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E

The method used today by the national administrations for calculating the <b>coordination</b> <b>contour</b> around these stations is vague and leads to unnecessarily large coordination areas. A new method of developing the <b>coordination</b> <b>contour</b> is proposed for this type of stations. It is shown that the adoption of the method by the national administrations contributes considerably to the development and wide use of mobile earth stations and eases the harmonic coexistence of this service with the terrestrial services. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the construction of}} the <b>coordination</b> <b>contour</b> around the stations of the conventional Fixed Service operating in the same frequency bands with the mobile Earth Stations located on board Vessels (ESVs). A new method for the realistic calculation of the coordination area is presented. This method takes into account the mobility parameters of the interfering stations such as their velocity and their frequency of passage from specific locations around the FS station and the specific interference conditions. Simulations in real interference environments prove its validity. Useful results for the coordination procedure between the two services are extracted and thoroughly discussed. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
50|$|The {{three most}} common means of joining clauses are sentence-sequence (juxtaposed clauses that have {{separate}} intonation <b>contours),</b> <b>coordination</b> (juxtaposed clauses with one intonation contour and sharing of conjugational {{categories such as}} tense) and subordination. The {{most common type of}} subordination is the purposive.|$|R
50|$|Tea is {{cultivated}} in Sri Lanka using the ‘contour planting’ method, where tea bushes are planted in lines in <b>coordination</b> with the <b>contours</b> of the land, usually on slopes. For commercial manufacture the ‘flush’ or leaf growth {{on the side}} branches and stems of the bush are used. Generally two leaves and a bud, which have the flavour and aroma, are skilfully plucked, usually by women. Sri Lanka {{is one of the}} few countries where each tea leaf is picked by hand rather than by mechanization; if machinery were used, often a considerable number of coarse leaves and twigs could be mixed in, adding bulk but not flavor to the tea. With experience the women acquire the ability to pluck rapidly and set a daily target of around 15 to 20 kg of tea leaves to be weighed and then transported to the nearby tea factory. Tea plants in Sri Lanka require constant nurturing and attention. An important part of the process is taking care of the soils with the regular application of fertilizer. Younger plants are regularly cut back 10 - 15 cm from the ground to encourage lateral growth and are pruned very frequently with a special knife.|$|R
