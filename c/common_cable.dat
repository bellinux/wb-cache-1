25|$|Unshielded {{twisted pair}} (UTP) cables {{are the primary}} cable type for {{telephone}} usage. In the late 20th century, UTPs emerged as the most <b>common</b> <b>cable</b> in computer networking cables, especially as patch cables or temporary network connections. They are increasingly used in video applications, primarily in security cameras.|$|E
25|$|UTP {{cable is}} also the most <b>common</b> <b>cable</b> used in {{computer}} networking. Modern Ethernet, the most common data networking standard, can use UTP cables. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to optical fiber and coaxial cable.|$|E
500|$|There is a {{limit to}} the {{applicability}} of this lumped element model. [...] The model works well if the components are small enough that the time taken for a wave to cross them is insignificant, or equivalently, if there is no significant phase difference in the wave either side of the component. [...] What amounts to significant depends on how accurate the model is required to be, but a common rule of thumb is to require components to be smaller than one sixteenth of a wavelength. [...] Since wavelength decreases with frequency, this puts an upper limit on the frequency that can be covered in this kind of design. [...] This limit is much lower in the mechanical domain than the equivalent limit in the electrical domain. [...] This is because the much higher propagation speeds in the electrical domain lead to longer wavelengths (mechanical vibrations in steel propagate at about 6,000m/s, electromagnetic waves in <b>common</b> <b>cable</b> types propagate at about [...] ). [...] For instance, traditional mechanical filters are only made up to around 600kHz (although MEMS devices can operate at much higher frequencies due to their very small size). [...] In the electrical domain, on the other hand, the transition from the lumped element model to the distributed element model occurs in the hundreds of megahertz region.|$|E

40|$|Convergence of {{information}} industries {{has led to}} the emergence of services that cross industry boundaries. Changes in these industries have caused the organization of regulatory institutions to become inadequate. An exploratory analysis of orders issued by bureaus of the US Federal Communications Commission shows overlap in the issues on which each provides rulings. Rather than organizing into traditional industries such as <b>common</b> carrier, <b>cable,</b> and mass media, bureaus could be re-organized into functions such as oversight of rates, spectrum allocation, and universal service provision. Using theories of bureaucracy and organization, this paper proposes an explanation for the difficulties that the FCC has had in adapting to converging information industries.

50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>cable</b> tie, {{normally}} made of nylon, has {{a flexible}} tape section with teeth that engage with a pawl {{in the head}} to form a ratchet so that as the free end of the tape section is pulled the cable tie tightens and does not come undone. Some ties include a tab that can be depressed to release the ratchet so that the tie can be loosened or removed, and possibly reused.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>cable</b> trays {{are made}} of {{galvanized}} steel, stainless steel, aluminum, or glass-fiber reinforced plastic.

Galvanized tray may be made of pre-galvanized steel sheet fabricated into tray, or may be hot-dip galvanized after fabrication. When galvanized tray is cut to length in the field, usually the cut surface will be painted with a zinc-rich compound to protect the metal from corrosion.|$|E
50|$|Many cable {{providers}} offer few or {{no details}} about unencrypted QAM channels.

QAM channels may move without notification and some channels may have strange numbering schemes.|$|R

50|$|The most <b>common</b> <b>cable</b> tie {{consists}} of a flexible nylon tape with an integrated gear rack, and on one end a ratchet within a small open case.

This allows several cables to be bound together into a cable bundle and/or to form a cable tree.|$|E

40|$|It {{is still}} a {{practical}} problem how to effectively install FBG sensors on bridge cabes. In this paper, a simple and effective solution is introduced to develop smart bridge cables using FRP-OFBG bars developed in HIT (Harbin Institute of Technology).

The installation techniques and the sensing properties of FBGs in three kinds of <b>cables,</b> FRP <b>cables,</b> <b>common</b> steel-wire <b>cable</b> and extruded-anchor cable, are introduced and tested under dead load. Moreover, the preliminary introduction of a practical field application based on this solution has been also given.
