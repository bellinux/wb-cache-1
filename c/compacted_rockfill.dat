40|$|Lechago dam (Teruel, Spain) is a 40 m high zoned {{earth and}} {{rockfill}} dam founded on soft continental deltaic deposits. A relatively narrow central clay core is stabilized by wide rockfill shoulders. The dam {{was completed in}} January 2009 and impounding will probably {{start at the beginning}} of 2011. The dam was well instrumented and continuous records of stress development, pore water pressures and horizontal and vertical displacements are available for the construction period. The clay core material was investigated by means of tests performed on compacted specimens of Tertiary clays. Rockfill samples were excavated in outcrops of highly fractured Cambrian quartzitic shale. In the years to follow the dam design, an extensive testing program on <b>compacted</b> <b>rockfill</b> gravels was conducted under Relative Humidity control in large diameter oedometer and triaxial cells. The results of this research have been reported in a number of papers. A coupled FE model has been developed to analyze the dam behaviour during construction. Model predictions, essentially based on laboratory tests, are compared with measurements during construction. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Based on fractal theory, {{used the}} index of {{rockfill}} compaction characteristics(granularity fractal dimension) which conforms to Talbot curve distribution, combined with blasting schemes and rolling test data of several domestic rockfill dams, the relationship is established between <b>compacted</b> <b>rockfillâ€™s</b> dry density and rock blasting parameters by rockfill granularity fractal dimension and its average diameter, and that {{provided the basis for}} rockfill particle grading optimization method. The method is applied by rockfill of JIANGPINGHE dam under construction, and the results show that this method can well reflect the intrinsic relation between rock blasting and rockfill compaction, which can be applied to particle grading design of rockfill dam. 1...|$|R
