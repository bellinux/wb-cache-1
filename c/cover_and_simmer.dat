50|$|Fårikål - mutton stew: the {{national}} dish of Norway. Very simple preparation: cabbage and mutton is layered {{in a big}} potalong with black peppercorns, salt (and, in some recipes, wheat flour to thicken the sauce), <b>covered</b> with water <b>and</b> <b>simmered</b> until the meat is very tender. Potatoes on the side.|$|R
50|$|Lamb meat is {{cut into}} chunks and placed into a stew pot over heat. Chicken {{may be used as}} an {{alternative}} to lamb. Tomatoes, along with cinnamon, bay leaves, ginger, garlic, red chili powder, cumin seeds, fried onions, black cardamom, garam masala and cooking oil are added and stirred. Potatoes and salt are mixed in. Water is added, in a proportion that is enough to <b>cover</b> the meat, <b>and</b> brought to the boil. The aloo gosht is <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> left to <b>simmer</b> until the meat becomes tender. Once ready, it may be garnished with chopped coriander and served hot.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed on top of the grill, <b>covered,</b> <b>and</b> allowed to <b>simmer</b> for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|R

50|$|Matta rice is {{traditionally}} double cooked. The rice is washed {{in a large}} pan and left to soak from 1 hour to overnight. The rice is drained <b>and</b> <b>simmered</b> with 4 to 8 parts water for 30 minutes. It is then <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> left for 15-20 minutes. The rice is then salted and boiled for another 15-20 minutes or until cooked. It is finally drained <b>and</b> left <b>covered</b> for a further 10-15 minutes before serving.|$|R
50|$|The second style, more {{characteristic}} of southwestern and south-central Louisiana, is Cajun jambalaya, which contains no tomatoes (the idea being the {{farther away from}} New Orleans one gets, the less common tomatoes are in dishes). The meat is browned in a cast-iron pot. The bits of meat that stick {{to the bottom of}} the pot (sucs) are what give a Cajun jambalaya its brown color. A little vegetable oil is added if there is not enough fat in the pot. The trinity (of 50% onions, 25% celery, and 25% green or red bell pepper, although proportions can be altered to suit one's taste) is added and sautéed until soft. Stock and seasonings are added in the next step, and then the meats are returned to the pot. This mixture is then simmered, covered, for at least one hour. Lastly, the mixture is brought to a boil and rice is added to the pot. It is then <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> left to <b>simmer</b> over very low heat for at least 1/2 hour without stirring. The dish is finished when the rice has cooked.|$|R
