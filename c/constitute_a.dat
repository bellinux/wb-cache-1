5|$|Another {{important}} form {{of protective}} mimicry is Müllerian mimicry, discovered by and {{named after the}} naturalist Fritz Müller. In Müllerian mimicry both model and mimic are aposematic, so mimicry may be mutual, does not necessarily <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> bluff or deception, and as in the wasps and bees may involve many species in a mimicry ring.|$|E

50|$|While most jurisdictions could {{probably}} agree about what <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> murder, what <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> homicide {{may be more}} problematic, while a crime against the person could vary widely. Legislation differences often means the ingredients of offences vary between jurisdictions.|$|R
5|$|In September 2007, it was {{reported}} that the U.S. Justice Department has launched a formal investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Hsu and his associates. One focal point for the investigation concerns whether any of the donations by the Paws were reimbursed by Hsu, which would <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> felony. Through his attorney, Hsu has denied any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of {{the plan}} criticize this tax rebate due to its costs. Economists at the Beacon Hill Institute {{estimated}} the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation). In addition, economist Bruce Bartlett {{has argued that the}} rebate would create a large opportunity for fraud, treats children disparately, and would <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> welfare payment regardless of need.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands within {{tropical}} cyclones are curved in orientation. Tropical cyclone rainbands contain {{showers and}} thunderstorms that, {{together with the}} eyewall and the eye, <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> hurricane or tropical storm. The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.|$|E

5|$|While {{some critics}} have feared the {{revision}} of the Champagne region is about expanding production irrespective of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson {{has pointed out that}} the proposed additions <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> consolidation rather than expansion.

5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E

5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area {{in front of their}} own goal. Though {{there are a variety of}} positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Nepalis, {{who settled}} in the region during British rule, {{comprise}} the majority of Gangtok's residents. Lepchas, native to the land, and Bhutias also <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> sizeable portion of the populace. Additionally, {{a large number of}} Tibetans have immigrated to the town. Immigrant resident communities not native to the region include the Marwaris, who own most of the shops; the Biharis, who are employed in mostly blue collar jobs and the Bengalis.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Talbot (sometimes Geoffrey II Talbot, died around 1140) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Norman nobleman {{during the civil}} war of King Stephen of England's reign. His landholdings around Swanscombe are {{considered}} to possibly <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> feudal barony. Although he was at Stephen's court in early 1136, by 1138 Talbot was supporting Stephen's rival, Matilda. After escaping capture twice, Talbot was captured by partisan's of Stephen but was released. In 1139 and 1140, Talbot was engaged in military operations around Hereford, which included fortifying Hereford Cathedral in an attempt to take Hereford Castle.|$|E

One hundred miles would <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> day's work, and crews would not receive allowances for time spent on delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.|$|E
5|$|Live {{performances}} {{before an}} audience <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes {{a wide range of}} forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented masques that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.|$|E

5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
