Circuit Card Assembly includes manufacturing, test, quality, finance and other groups, functioning as its own business within Raytheon IDS. Circuit Card Assembly competes with external vendors for contracts from Raytheon businesses outside of IDS, thus the pursuit of competitive advantage in the form of technology, quality and throughput is a continuous activity. Circuit Card Assembly spends upwards of a million dollars each year on troubleshooting <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> <b>assemblies</b> that fail first pass testing, in labor alone, with additional costs associated with reprocessing and material replacement. This thesis describes the creation of a design tool that improves electrical design for test, reducing wasteful troubleshooting on hundreds of products each year, saving {{tens of thousands of dollars}} on high cost programs, with incremental yearly savings totaling in the hundreds of thousands, and a net present value of over 2. 5 million in labor savings. The tool provides designers with real time feedback regarding the impact their design decisions have on expected troubleshooting activity, and provides guidance to improve troubleshoot ability. The tool reduces spending on non-value added activity buy an average of 50 %, while at the same time helping fulfill Circuit Card Assembly's mission to engage design teams at the earliest stages of product development, before potentially costly decisions are finalized and beyond Circuit Card Assembly's ability to influence. The subject of interaction between groups in different functional silos, between independent Raytheon businesses and with seemingly disparate incentives is investigated as it pertains to the development of the design for test tool. The method of action of the design tool at a personal or organizational level is to raise awareness of total product cost and allow disparate teams to communicate in the same language with a more complete understanding of how to achieve corporate level goals. Communicating effectively across business and functional barriers is the greatest achievement of the new tool, but also the greatest roll out and developmental challenge.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to help {{electronics}} designers make more cost-effective design decisions, a software tool was developed which predicts the costs of manufacturing <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> <b>assemblies.</b> This tool {{can be used in a}} concurrent engineering environment to provide board density information, scrap and rework cost estimates and a breakdown of setup, labor and material costs for each step of the printed circuit board (PCB) assembly process. What-if analyses can be performed to compare the costs of using different component types, such as through-hole versus surface-mount components, or different manufacturing process alternatives, such as manual assembly versus automatic assembly. Incorporated within the software tool are activity-based models of the 56 processes that constitute the circuit card assembly manufacturing system. In addition to predicting the level of activity at each of the processes, the model also identifies and considers design decisions that lead to an increase in processing costs. Specifically, board density, solder characteristics, production batch sizing and the variety of components used in a design can lead to higher rework rates as well as increased setup and processing for certain operations. Verification was done by comparing predictions made by the model to actual historical cost data for 12 randomly selected boards currently in production.

Runtime: 49 : 54 minutesThe role of polymers in the electronics and medical areas, particularly in miniaturized devices and electronic components, continues to grow rapidly due to increasing demand for more reliable products and advances in other technical fields. As the number of medical devices and electronics are growing to enhance human life, the challenges to make them safe, effective and to find protection solutions for components, which are ever increasing in their complexity and decreasing in their dimension, are also increasing.

Lean is most successful when production {{is characterized by a}} few high-volume products, but may not be the answer as the production mix increases and volume decreases. This thesis focuses on this high-mix, low-volume type of production in addition to two other key production system characteristics: demand variability and degree of customization. A manufacturer's position along these four characteristics is very important to the applicability of Lean theory. The alternative philosophy of Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM) is compared to Lean and shown to offer a better fit in some cases. One such case where Lean does not fit neatly is <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> <b>assembly</b> at Raytheon Systems Limited in Glenrothes, Scotland, where the author conducted his six-month LFM internship.

Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) <b>Circuit</b> <b>Card</b> <b>Assembly</b> (CCA) manufactures highly complex <b>circuit</b> <b>cards</b> at a high mix / low volume scale for various purposes. Due to the high input variability and small production lot sizes of this level of <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> manufacturing, historical trending and defect mitigation is difficult, causing a significant portion of CCA's manufacturing costs to be attributed to troubleshooting defects and rework. To mitigate these costs, yield prediction analysis software is utilized to predict potential manufacturing defect rates and first pass yields of new designs. This thesis describes the creation and testing of a new data analysis model for yield prediction. By gathering and processing data at an individual component level, the model can predict defect rates of designs at an assembly level. Collecting data at the individual component level drives more comprehensive component-based calculations, greatly improving yield prediction accuracy and thereby allowing cost effective <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> designs to be created. The increase in prediction accuracy translates to a potential $ 250, 000 saved annually for Raytheon CCA from early defect identification and removal.

The use of bare die and thin/thick film components reduces both overall mass/weight and <b>circuit</b> <b>card</b> <b>assembly</b> (CCA) size. Imbedded Component / Die Technology improves form factor with increased component-to-substrate ratio allowing for smaller CCAâ€™s or for the addition of redundant systems to increase reliability for high reliability (Hi-Rel) applications. Flexible interconnects from component-to-component or component-to-substrate, coupled with a vibration-dampening encapsulant, allow for reliable use in high mechanical shock and vibration environments. Replacing solder as the mechanical and electrical attachment material, conductive adhesives and wire bonds allow for lower overall processing temperatures. The use of Imbedded Component / Die Technology when assembling CCAâ€™s can dramatically improve reliability and also improve form factor...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of a wide}} dynamic range pulse height analyzer system developed for use on High Energy Cosmic Ray Experiment (HECRE) Balloon Flights. A wide dynamic range of 100, 000 is obtained by extending the range of a basic 1024 channel analyzer {{through the use of}} multiple ranges and range selection. The system described here contains four 100, 000 pulse height analyzers. Each 100, 000 pulse height analyzer consists of a group of cordwood welded modules mounted and interconnected on a printed <b>circuit</b> <b>card.</b> Four of these <b>card</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the required clock drive circuitry (discrete components mounted and interconnected on a separate card) and three input-output connectors are interconnected and mounted on the system board...|$|R
