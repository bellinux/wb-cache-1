40|$|Kidney {{disease is}} {{worldwide}} the 12 th {{leading cause of}} death affecting 8 – 16 % of the entire population. Kidney disease encompasses acute (short-lasting episode) and chronic (developing over years) pathologies both leading to renal failure. Since specific treatments for acute or chronic kidney disease are limited, more than 2 million people a year require dialysis or kidney transplantation. Several recent evidences identified lysosomal proteases <b>cathepsins</b> as key players in kidney pathophysiology. <b>Cathepsins,</b> originally found in the lysosomes, exert important functions also in the cytosol and nucleus of cells {{as well as in the}} extracellular space, thus participating in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Based on their catalytic active site residue, the 15 human <b>cathepsins</b> identified up to now are classified in three different families: serine (<b>cathepsins</b> A and G), aspartate (<b>cathepsins</b> D and E), or cysteine (<b>cathepsins</b> B, C, F, H, K, L, O, S, V, X, and W) proteases. Specifically in the kidney, <b>cathepsins</b> B, D, L and S have been shown to regulate extracellular matrix homeostasis, autophagy, apoptosis, glomerular permeability, endothelial function, and inflammation. Dysregulation of their expression/activity has been associated to the onset and progression of kidney disease. This review summarizes most of the recent findings that highlight the critical role of <b>cathepsins</b> in kidney disease development and progression.

Abnormalities of tubular matrix metalloproteinases {{have been}} shown recently to occur early {{in the course of}} polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The present study was conducted to determine whether lysosomal cysteine proteinases were altered in proximal tubules from 2 -month-old, heterozygous Han:SPRD rats. The activities of <b>cathepsins</b> B (- 45 %), H (- 39 %) and L (- 37 %) were significantly lower in proximal tubules from PKD rats as compared to healthy offspring. Enzyme proteins were also decreased (cath. B, 2. 4 ± 0. 7 -fold; cath. H, 1. 9 ± 0. 6 -fold; N = 4, P < 0. 05), while mRNA levels for <b>cathepsins</b> B, H and L were not different. Tubular cystatin C, a major inhibitor of <b>cathepsins,</b> was normal with regard to protein and mRNA levels in PKD animals. The decrease in <b>cathepsins</b> in PKD was specific for tubules, as enzyme activities in glomeruli and liver tissue were unchanged and limited to the lysosomal compartment, since marker enzymes for cytoplasm, endoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria were all normal.

The presence of <b>cathepsins</b> could be demonstrated in cyst fluid from homozygous PKD rats and urinary excretion of <b>cathepsins</b> was enhanced in heterozygous animals.

25|$|Additionally, {{inflammatory}} responses {{within the}} bone marrow are believed to foster many hematological diseases. The secretion of IL-6 by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and the secretion of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and LFA, is induced {{in the presence of}} TNF-α and the adhesion of MM cells to BMSC. In vitro proliferation of MM cell lines and inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis is promoted by IL-6. Thalidomide and its analogs directly decrease the up-regulation of IL-6 and indirectly through TNF-α, thereby reducing the secretion of adhesion molecules leading to fewer MM cells adhering to BMSC. Osteoclasts become highly active during MM, leading to bone resorption and secretion of various MM survival factors. They decrease the levels of adhesion molecules paramount to osteoclast activation, decrease the formation of the cells that form osteoclasts and downregulate <b>cathepsin</b> K, an important cysteine protease expressed in osteoclasts.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} calpain {{originates}} in 1964, when calcium-dependent proteolytic activities {{caused by a}} “calcium-activated neutral protease” (CANP) were detected in brain, lens of the eye and other tissues. In the late 1960s the enzymes were isolated and characterised independently in both rat brain and skeletal muscle. These activities were caused by an intracellular cysteine protease not associated with the lysosome and having an optimum activity at neutral pH, which clearly distinguished it from the <b>cathepsin</b> family of proteases. The calcium-dependent activity, intracellular localization, along with the limited, specific proteolysis on its substrates, highlighted calpain’s role as a regulatory, rather than a digestive protease. When the sequence of this enzyme became known, it was given the name “calpain”, to recognize it as a hybrid of two well-known proteins at the time, the calcium-regulated signalling protein, calmodulin, and the cysteine protease of papaya, papain. Shortly thereafter, the activity {{was found to be}} attributable to two main isoforms, dubbed μ("mu")-calpain and m-calpain (a.k.a. calpain I and II), that differed primarily in their calcium requirements in vitro. Their names reflect {{the fact that they are}} activated by micro- and nearly millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ within the cell, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Once activated, osteoclasts move {{to areas}} of microfracture {{in the bone}} by chemotaxis. Osteoclasts lie in a small cavity called Howship's lacunae, formed from the {{digestion}} of the underlying bone. The sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast's plasma membrane to the underlying bone. Sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. Attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp in bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin. The osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (H2O + CO2 → HCO3− + H+) through the ruffled border into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix into Ca2+, H3PO4, H2CO3, water and other substances. Dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of osteopetrosis. [...] Hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by proton pumps, specifically a unique vacuolar-ATPase. This enzyme has been targeted {{in the prevention of}} osteoporosis. In addition, several hydrolytic enzymes, such as members of the <b>cathepsin</b> and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the matrix.

Preliminary immunological data from the RV 144 phase III trial indicated that the immune responses were biased towards the Env antigen with a dominant CD 4 + T-cell response. In this study, we examined the susceptibility of HIV- 1 Env-A 244 gp 120 protein, one of the protein boost subunits of the RV 144 Phase III vaccine trial, to proteasomes and <b>cathepsins</b> and identified the generated peptide epitope repertoire by mass spectrometry. The peptide fragments were tested for cytokine production in CD 4 (+) T-cell lines derived from RV 144 volunteers. Env-A 244 was resistant to proteasomes, thus diminishing {{the possibility of the}} generation of class I epitopes by the classical MHC class I pathway. However, Env-A 244 was efficiently cleaved by <b>cathepsins</b> generating peptide arrays identified by mass spectrometry that contained both MHC class I and class II epitopes as reported in the Los Alamos database. Each of the <b>cathepsins</b> generated distinct degradation patterns containing regions of light and dense epitope clusters.

Although these channels do not regulate cellular multiplication or migration, their inhibition by the specific blocker tetrodotoxin impairs both the extracellular gelatinolytic activity (monitored with DQ-gelatin) and cell invasiveness leading to the attenuation of colony growth and cell spreading in three-dimensional Matrigel®-composed matrices. MDA-MB- 231 cells express functional cysteine <b>cathepsins,</b> which we found play a predominant role (∼ 65 %) in cancer invasiveness. Matrigel® invasion is significantly decreased in the presence of specific inhibitors of <b>cathepsins</b> B and S (CA- 074 and Z-FL-COCHO, respectively), and co-application of tetrodotoxin does not further reduce cell invasion. This suggests that <b>cathepsins</b> B and S are involved in invasiveness and that their proteolytic activity partly depends on NaV function.
