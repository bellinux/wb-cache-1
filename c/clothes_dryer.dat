25|$|Dryer lint, which {{collects}} on the {{lint screen}} of a <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer,</b> is highly flammable and therefore presents a fire hazard. However, {{because of this}} flammability, dryer lint may be collected for use as tinder, although burning man-made fibres can produce toxic fumes.|$|E
25|$|In warm climates where air {{conditioning}} is used, any household device that gives off heat {{will result in}} a larger load on the cooling system. Items such as a stove, dish washer, <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer,</b> hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home. Low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the {{air conditioning}} to remove. The air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard air heat exchanger such as geothermal or water.|$|E
25|$|Lint is {{the common}} name for visible accumulations of textile fibers and other {{materials}}, usually found on and around clothing. Certain materials used {{in the manufacture of}} clothing, such as cotton, linen, and wool, contain numerous, very short fibers bundled together. During the course of normal wear, these fibers may either detach or be jostled out of the weave of which they are part. This is the reason that heavily used articles like shirts and towels become thin over time, and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer.</b>|$|E

25|$|Example 3: A {{potential}} use of event-driven SOA {{could be}} a virtual electricity market where home clothes dryers can bid {{on the price of}} the electricity they use in a real-time market pricing system.

25|$|Throughout the house, {{there are}} {{numerous}} love quotes written by Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In {{the dining room and}} kitchen, the furniture are in bright red and yellow colors, and logs stacked against each other fill up a wall. The walkway to the Head of Household room evokes a giant library. The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis. The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks. The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds. Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink bedspreads fill another room. The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace. A red colored room connected directly to the living room by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds. New this season is a Spa room complete with a massage table, two-person sauna and lounge. The spa room would be featured in numerous subsequent seasons.

500|$|Allison, in {{combination}} with an approaching frontal boundary, dropped heavy rainfall across southeastern Pennsylvania, peaking at 10.17inches (258mm) in Chalfont in Bucks County and over 3inches (76mm) in portions of Philadelphia. The rainfall caused rivers to rise, with the Neshaminy Creek in Langhorne peaking at [...] Several other rivers and creeks in southeastern Pennsylvania crested at over 10feet (3m). The rainfall downed numerous weak trees and power lines, leaving 70,000 without power during the storm. The flooding washed out several roads and bridges, including a few SEPTA rail lines. In addition, the rainfall destroyed 241homes and damaged 1,386 others. Flooding at a Dodge dealership totaled 150vehicles. Hundreds of people were forced to be rescued from damaged buildings from flood waters. The flooding dislodged a <b>clothes</b> <b>dryer</b> {{in the basement of}} the [...] "A" [...] building of the Village Green Apartment Complex in Upper Moreland Township, breaking a natural gas line. The gas leak resulted in an explosion and an ensuing fire that killed six people. Firefighters were unable to render assistance as the building was completely surrounded by floodwaters.

40|$|Electric <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> in the US consume about 6 % of {{residential}} electricity consumption. Available electric <b>clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> today are either based on electric resistance (low-cost but energy-inefficient) or vapor compression (energy-efficient but high-cost). Thermoelectric dryers {{have the potential}} to alleviate the disadvantages of both through a low-cost, energy-efficient solution. This paper presents experimental results and steady state simulation of a prototype thermoelectric dryer. A thermoelectric model is coupled with a psychrometric dryer system model to design the experimental prototype. The results from the prototype are used to calibrate the model and identify important parameters that affect performance, such as relative humidity of air leaving the drum. ...|$|R

30|$|Most {{residential}} clothes washers in the US and Asia {{have been}} traditionally top-loading, vertical-axis washers (Pakula and Stamminger 2010).

From these averages, the authors estimated that nearly 1.4 trillion gallons of water and 270 trillion Btu of energy were used by these vertical axis washers annually nationwide. <b>Clothes</b> <b>dryers</b> are also significant energy users.
