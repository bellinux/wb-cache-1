In hemodialysis the US National Kidney Foundation Kt/V target is ≥1.3, so that one <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the delivered dose is at least 1.2.

25|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} to localize individual poems by studying the geography, flora, and fauna to which they refer. This approach usually does not yield firm results. For example, there are no wolves in Iceland, but we <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Icelandic poets {{were familiar with the}} species. Similarly, the apocalyptic descriptions of Völuspá have been taken as evidence that the poet who composed it had seen a volcanic eruption in Iceland - but this is hardly certain.|$|E
25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, {{leaning back in his}} chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing that is going on around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Wolfe is working.|$|E

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
25|$|None of us {{can ever}} forget how in that last Easter Sunday of his life, the Holy Father, marked by suffering, came once more to {{the window of the}} Apostolic Palace and one last time gave his blessing Urbi et Orbi.

25|$|Another {{institutional}} {{factor that}} may have an important effect is proportionality, i.e., how closely the legislature reflects {{the views of the}} populace. Under a pure proportional representation system the composition of the legislature is fully proportional to the votes of the populace and a voter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he will be represented in parliament, even if only from the opposition benches. (However many nations that utilise a form of proportional representation in elections depart from pure proportionality by stipulating that smaller parties are not supported by a certain threshold percentage of votes cast will be excluded from parliament.) By contrast, a voting system based on single seat constituencies (such as the plurality system used in North American, the UK and India) will tend to result in many non-competitive electoral districts, in which the outcome is seen by voters as a foregone conclusion.|$|E

500|$|Smalljon Umber {{meets with}} Ramsay Bolton and Harald Karstark. He {{explains}} to Ramsay that Jon Snow has been letting Wildlings through the Wall and fears {{that they will}} make their way south. When Ramsay asks why the Umbers have not already sworn fealty, Smalljon expresses his dislike for Roose Bolton and declares that was why Ramsay killed him, despite Ramsay's false insistence that Roose was poisoned. Ramsay offers assistance if Smalljon will swear to him as Warden of the North but he refuses, citing Roose's betrayal of his oath to Robb Stark. Instead, Smalljon demonstrates his loyalty by presenting Ramsay with [...] "a gift", two hooded figures who are revealed to be Rickon Stark and Osha. When Ramsay asks him how he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the boy is Rickon Stark, Smalljon presents him with the severed head of Rickon's direwolf Shaggydog.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, in May 1924, {{the club}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour, beginning with an ill-tempered match against Czechoslovakian side Sparta Prague. The match was an intensely physical encounter with Cardiff accusing their opposition of dirty tactics. As the teams left the pitch {{at the end of}} the first-half, a furious Keenor, upset at the nature of some tackles he had received, yelled at the Prague players [...] "If I get anymore kicks on the shin I shall be chopping someone off at the knee". In the second-half, Cardiff players found themselves being physically assaulted by members of the crowd, who aimed kicks and punches at the players, when they approached the sidelines to take throw-ins and corner-kicks, going on to lose the match 3–2. They later played matches against First Vienna in Austria and Borussia Dortmund and Hamburger SV in Germany. The following season, the side reached the final of the 1924–25 FA Cup where they suffered a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United, who claimed their fifth FA Cup win, following a goal from Fred Tunstall. After the Final, Keenor stated: [...] "Just because we lost in our very first Cup Final, I don't think there is any cause to get down in the mouth. I can say here and now that one day soon our followers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Cardiff City will bring that cup to Wales." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{the rest}} of the Red Cross Movement many be multi-national, the Committee {{believes}} that its mono-national nature is an asset because the nationality in question is Swiss. Thanks to permanent Swiss neutrality, conflicting parties <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> no one from [...] "the enemy" [...] will be setting policy in Geneva. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 showed that even Red Cross actors (in this case National Societies) can be so bound by nationalism that they are unable to sustain neutral humanitarianism.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the emperor}} Constantine I {{extended}} [...] official toleration of Christianity within the Roman Empire in 313, {{huge numbers of}} pagans became converts. This period of Christianization probably saw the use of Christian images became very widespread among the faithful, though with great differences from pagan habits. Robin Lane Fox states [...] "By the early fifth century, we know of the ownership of private icons of saints; by c. 480-500, we <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{the inside of a}} saint's shrine would be adorned with images and votive portraits, a practice which had probably begun earlier." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure that the game was balanced, the {{designers}} had to play through maps several times to ensure that they were not unbalanced.

2500|$|In {{the book}} Ehrlich {{presented}} {{a number of}} [...] "scenarios" [...] detailing possible future events, {{some of which have}} been used as examples of errors in the years since. Of these scenarios, Ehrlich has said that although, [...] "we clearly stated that they were not predictions and that 'we <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> none of them will come true as stated,’ (p.72) – their failure to occur is often cited as a failure of prediction. In honesty, the scenarios were way off, especially in their timing (we underestimated the resilience of the world system). But they did deal with future issues that people in 1968 should have been thinking about." [...] Ehrlich further states that he still endorses the main thesis of the book, and that its message is as apt now as it was in 1968.|$|E
2500|$|On the one hand, {{film and}} {{television}} producers seem to find Catholicism irresistible. There {{are a number of}} reasons for this. First, more than any other Christian denomination, the Catholic Church is supremely visual, and therefore attractive to producers and directors concerned with the visual image. Vestments, monstrances, statues, crucifixes – {{to say nothing of the}} symbols of the sacraments – are all things that more [...] "word oriented" [...] Christian denominations have foregone. The Catholic Church, therefore, lends itself perfectly to the visual media of {{film and television}}. You <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> any movie about the Second Coming or Satan or demonic possession or, for that matter, any sort of irruption of the transcendent into everyday life, will choose the Catholic Church as its venue.

2500|$|On 1 September 1939, German forces invaded Poland; Britain and France {{joined the}} war against Germany.

In July, following the Fall of France, when Britain stood almost alone against Germany, Hitler offered peace. Some politicians {{inside and outside the}} government were willing to consider the offer but Churchill would not. Chamberlain died on 9 November the same year.
