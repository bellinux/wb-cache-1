Internazionale Milano S.p.A. was {{described}} {{as one of the}} financial [...] "black-holes" [...] among the Italian clubs, which was heavily dependent on the financial contribution from the owner Massimo Moratti. In June 2006, the shirt sponsor and the minority shareholder of the club, Pirelli, sold 15.26% shares of the club to Moratti family, for €13.5million. The tyre manufacturer retained 4.2%. However, due to several <b>capital</b> <b>increases</b> of Inter, such as a reversed merger with an intermediate holding company, Inter Capital S.r.l. in 2006, which held 89% shares of Inter and €70million capitals at that time, or issues new shares for €70.8million in June 2007, €99.9million in December 2007, €86.6million in 2008, €70million in 2009, €40million in 2010 and 2011, €35million in 2012 or allowing Thoir subscribed €75million new shares of Inter in 2013, Pirelli became the third largest shareholders of just 0.5%, as of 31 December 2015. In the prospectus of Pirelli's second IPO in 2017, the company also revealed that the value of the remaining shares the company owned, was write-off to zero in 2016 financial year. Inter also received direct capital contribution from the shareholders to cover loss which was excluded from issuing shares. (...) ...|$|E

6000|$|Therefore, as <b>capital</b> <b>increases,</b> more labor can be employed. When [...] the Pittsburg rioters, in 1877, {{destroyed}} property, or {{the product}} [...] of past labor, {{they did not}} realize then that that property might, [...] but now could never again, be employed for productive purposes, [...] and thereby support laborers.|$|E
6000|$|As {{regards the}} effects upon the {{material}} {{condition of the}} [...] wages-receiving class, since {{it seems clear that}} <b>capital</b> <b>increases</b> [...] faster than improvements, and probably faster even than [...] population, it follows that in countries where the [...] laboring-classes are evidently growing in intelligence, they gain [...] in wages with the progress of society. Such certainly seems to be [...] the teaching of Mr. Giffen’s late studies (see Book IV, Chap. III, [...] § 5).|$|E
60|$|In {{countries}} which are further advanced in industry and population, and have therefore {{a lower rate}} of profit, than others, there is always, long before the actual minimum is reached, a practical minimum, viz., when profits have fallen so much below what they are elsewhere that, were they to fall lower, all further accumulations would go abroad. As {{long as there are}} old countries where <b>capital</b> <b>increases</b> very rapidly, and new countries where profit is still high, profits in the old countries will not sink to the rate which would put a stop to accumulation: the fall is stopped at the point which sends capital abroad.|$|E

60|$|This {{brings us}} to the last of the counter-forces which check the {{downward}} tendency of profits in a country whose <b>capital</b> <b>increases</b> faster than that of its neighbors, and whose profits are therefore nearer to the minimum. This is, the perpetual overflow of capital into colonies or foreign countries, to seek higher profits than can be obtained at home. I believe this to have been for many years one of the principal causes by which the decline of profits in England has been arrested. It has a twofold operation: In the first place, it does what a fire, or an inundation, or a commercial crisis would have done—it carries off a part of the increase of capital from which the reduction of profits proceeds; secondly, the capital so carried off is not lost, but is chiefly employed either in founding colonies, which become large exporters of cheap agricultural produce, or in extending and perhaps improving the agriculture of older communities.|$|E
60|$|In {{the next}} place, {{even if the}} supply were drawn from the whole instead of {{a small part of}} the surface of the {{exporting}} countries, the quantity of food would still be limited, which could be obtained from them without an increase of the proportional cost. The countries which export food may be divided into two classes: those in which the effective desire of accumulation is strong, and those in which it is weak. In Australia and the United States of America, the effective desire of accumulation is strong; <b>capital</b> <b>increases</b> fast, and the production of food might be very rapidly extended. But in such countries population also increases with extraordinary rapidity. Their agriculture has to provide for their own expanding numbers, as well as for those of the importing countries. They must, therefore, from the nature of the case, be rapidly driven, if not to less fertile, at least what is equivalent, to remoter and less accessible lands, and to modes of cultivation like those of old countries, less productive in proportion to the labor and expense.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{possible}} that a different combination from the above may [...] sometimes occur in the causes which underlie the progress of [...] society: (1.) There may be {{a period in which}} capital is increasing [...] more rapidly than population, and when {{there seems to be an}} era of [...] industrial improvements also. Then both wages and profits will be [...] high, and it will be a period of general satisfaction. (2.) If [...] capital goes on increasing, but improvements are few, wages will [...] rise; but profits must suffer a fall. In this country, where [...] population has not yet increased so as to press seriously against [...] subsistence, and where <b>capital</b> <b>increases</b> with incredible [...] swiftness, these cases are often exemplified. The extraordinary [...] resources of the newer States have permitted an unlimited increase [...] of population, and capital has found no difficulty in finding an [...] investment. But yet those States which have been burdened with the [...] disabilities of the old slave régime are far behind the others. [...] The changes in the rank of the States, in respect of population, [...] at each decade, as seen in Chart No. XVI, are suggestive.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was born}} in Boston, New-England, and owe my first {{instructions}} in literature to the free grammar-schools established there. I have, therefore, already considered those schools in my will. But I am also under obligations {{to the state of}} Massachusetts for having, unasked, appointed me formerly their agent in England, with a handsome salary, which continued some years; and although I accidentally lost in their service, by transmitting Governor Hutchinson's letters, much more than the amount of what they gave me, I do not think that ought in the least to diminish my gratitude. I have considered that among artisans, good apprentices are most likely to make good citizens; and having myself been bred to a manual art, printing, in my native town, and afterward assisted to set up my business in Philadelphia by kind loans of money from two friends there, which was the foundation of my fortune, and of all the utility in life that may be ascribed to me, I wish to be useful, even after my death, if possible, in forming and advancing other young men, that may be serviceable to their country in both these towns. To this end I devote two thousand pounds sterling, which I give, one thousand thereof to the inhabitants of the town of Boston, in Massachusetts, and the other thousand to the inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, in trust, to and for the uses, intents, and purposes herein after mentioned and declared. The said sum of one thousand pounds sterling, if accepted by the inhabitants of the town of Boston, shall be managed {{under the direction of the}} selectmen, united with the ministers of the oldest Episcopalian, Congregational, and Presbyterian churches in that town, who are to let out the same upon interest at five per cent. per annum, to such young married artificers, under the age of twenty-five years, as have served an apprenticeship in the said town, and faithfully fulfilled the duties required in their indentures, so as to obtain a good moral character from at least two respectable citizens, who are willing to become their sureties in a bond, with the applicants, for the repayment of the money so lent, with interest, according to the terms hereinafter prescribed; all which bonds are to be taken for Spanish milled dollars, or the value thereof in current gold coin: and the managers shall keep a bound book or books, wherein shall be entered the names of those who shall apply for and receive the benefit of this institution, and of their sureties, together with the sums lent, the dates, and other necessary and proper records respecting the business and concerns of this institution: and as these loans are intended to assist young married artificers in setting up their business, they are to be proportioned by the discretion of the managers, so as not to exceed sixty pounds sterling to one person, nor to be less than fifteen pounds. And if the number of appliers so entitled should be so large as that the sum will not suffice to afford to each as much as might otherwise not be improper, the proportion to each shall be diminished, so as to afford every one some assistance. These aids may, therefore, be small at first; but as the <b>capital</b> <b>increases</b> by the accumulated interest, they will be more ample. And in order to serve as many as possible in their turn, as well as to make the repayment of the principal borrowed more easy, each borrower shall be obliged to pay, with the yearly interest, one tenth part of the principal; which sums of principal and interest so paid in shall be again let out to fresh borrowers. And as it is presumed that there will always be found in Boston virtuous and benevolent citizens willing to bestow a part of their time in doing good to the rising generation, by superintending and managing this institution gratis, it is hoped that no part of the money will at any time be dead or diverted to other purposes, but be continually augmenting by the interest, in which case there may, in time, be more than the occasion in Boston shall require: and then some may be spared to the neighbouring or other towns in the said state of Massachusetts, which may desire to have it, such towns engaging to pay punctually the interest, and the proportions of the principal annually to the inhabitants of the town of Boston. If this plan is executed, and succeeds, as is projected, without interruption for one hundred years, the sum will then be one hundred and thirty-one thousand pounds, of which I would have the managers of the donation to the town of Boston then lay out, at their discretion, one hundred thousand pounds in public works, which may be judged of most general utility to the inhabitants, such as fortifications, bridges, aqueducts, public buildings, baths, pavements, or whatever may make living in the town more convenient to its people, and render it more agreeable to strangers resorting thither for health or a temporary residence. The remaining thirty-one thousand pounds I would have continued to be let out on interest, in the manner above directed, for another hundred years; as I hope it will have been found that the institution has had a good effect on the conduct of youth, and been of service to many worthy characters and useful citizens. At the end of this second term, if no unfortunate accident has prevented the operation, the sum will be four millions and sixty-one thousand pounds sterling, of which I leave one million and sixty-one thousand pounds to the disposition and management of the inhabitants of the town of Boston, and three millions to the disposition of the government of the state, not presuming to carry my views farther.|$|E
