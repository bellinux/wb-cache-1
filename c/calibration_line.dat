Two different types of soil were analyzed – loam (intermediate plasticity) and sodium bentonite (high plasticity). Two basic methods were used for the evaluation of the liquid limit – Casagrande percussion (cup) method and cone penetrometer method. Two approaches were applied to the evaluation of liquid limit based on cone penetrometer test (30 °/ 80 g cone) – standard method assuming 20 mm penetration at liquid limit and new <b>calibration</b> <b>line</b> for cone penetrometer liquid limit - NCCLL (Mohajerani).
