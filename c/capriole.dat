2500|$|The [...] "school jumps," [...] or [...] "airs {{above the}} ground," [...] are {{a series of}} higher-level {{classical}} dressage movements where the horse leaves the ground. These include the <b>capriole,</b> courbette, the mezair, the croupade, and levade. None are used in modern competitive dressage, but are performed by horses of various riding academies, including the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre in Lisbon, Portugal, and the Cadre Noir in Saumur. [...] Baroque horse breeds such as the Andalusian, Lusitano and Lipizzan are most often trained to perform the [...] "airs" [...] today, in part due to their powerfully conformed hindquarters, which allow them the strength to perform these difficult movements.|$|E

Young men and boys, on the other hand, play, according to recognized law, old, traditionary games, permitting no <b>caprioles</b> of fancy, but with scope enough for the outbreak of savage instincts.

60|$|Satisfied in {{some degree}} by this man's assurances, and compelled--to {{give way to}} {{superior}} force, the Abbot Ambrosius retired from the Church {{at the head of}} the monks, and left the court free for the revellers to work their will. But, wild and wilful as these rioters were, they accompanied the retreat of the religionists with none of those shouts of contempt and derision with which they had at first hailed them. The Abbot's discourse had affected some of them with remorse, others with shame, and all with a transient degree of respect. They remained silent until the last monk had disappeared through the side-door which communicated with their dwelling-place, and even then it cost some exhortations on the part of Howleglas, some <b>caprioles</b> of the hobby-horse, and some wallops of the dragon, to rouse once more the rebuked spirit of revelry.|$|R

Then again, out of the heart of the cloud, Pegasus shot down like a thunderbolt, as if he meant to dash both himself and his rider headlong against a rock. Then he went through about a thousand of the wildest <b>caprioles</b> that had ever been performed either by a bird or a horse.|$|R

60|$|When Dandie Dinmont, after {{executing}} two {{or three}} <b>caprioles,</b> and cutting the Highland fling, by way of ridicule of his wife's anxiety, at last deigned {{to sit down and}} commit his round, black, shaggy bullet of a head to her inspection, Brown thought he had seen the regimental surgeon look grave upon a more trifling case. The gudewife, however, showed some knowledge of chirurgery; she cut away with her scissors the gory locks whose stiffened and coagulated clusters interfered with her operations, and clapped on the wound some lint besmeared with a vulnerary salve, esteemed sovereign by the whole dale (which afforded upon fair nights considerable experience of such cases); she then fixed her plaster with a bandage, and, spite of her patient's resistance, pulled over all a night-cap, to keep everything in its right place. Some contusions on the brow and shoulders she fomented with brandy, which the patient did not permit till the medicine had paid a heavy toll to his mouth. Mrs. Dinmont then simply, but kindly, offered her assistance to Brown.|$|R
6000|$|For {{the fine}} arts, and {{especially}} for the belles-lettres, he entertained a profound contempt. With this he had been inspired by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query [...] "A quoi un poete est il bon?" [...] {{he was in the}} habit of quoting, with a very droll pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus my own inkling for the Muses had excited his entire displeasure. He assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of Horace, that the translation of [...] "Poeta nascitur non fit" [...] was [...] "a nasty poet for nothing fit"--a remark which I took in high dudgeon. His repugnance to [...] "the humanities" [...] had, also, much increased of late, by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural science. Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just at the epoch of this story--for story it is getting to be after all--my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with the <b>caprioles</b> of the hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laughed with his arms and legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood. He thought, with Horsley, that [...] "the people {{have nothing to do with}} the laws but to obey them." ...|$|R
60|$|Some such {{thoughts}} crossed Waverley's mind as he paced his horse {{slowly through the}} rugged and flinty street of Tully-Veolan, interrupted only in his meditations by the occasional <b>caprioles</b> which his charger exhibited at the reiterated assaults of those canine Cossacks, the collies before mentioned. The village was {{more than half a}} mile long, the cottages being irregularly divided from each other by gardens, or yards, as the inhabitants called them, of different sizes, where (for it is Sixty Years Since) the now universal potato was unknown, but which were stored with gigantic plants of kale or colewort, encircled with groves of nettles, and exhibited here and there a huge hemlock, or the national thistle, overshadowing a quarter of the petty inclosure. The broken ground on which the village was built had never been levelled; so that these inclosures presented declivities of every degree, here rising like terraces, there sinking like tan-pits. The dry-stone walls which fenced, or seemed to fence (for they were sorely breached), these hanging gardens of Tully-Veolan were intersected by a narrow lane leading to the common field, where the joint labour of the villagers cultivated alternate ridges and patches of rye, oats, barley, and pease, each of such minute extent that at a little distance the unprofitable variety of the surface resembled a tailor's book of patterns. In a few favoured instances, there appeared behind the cottages a miserable wigwam, compiled of earth, loose stones, and turf, where the wealthy might perhaps shelter a starved cow or sorely galled horse. But almost every hut was fenced in front by a huge black stack of turf {{on one side of the}} door, while on the other the family dunghill ascended in noble emulation.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "high school" [...] or ''''haute ecole'''' school jumps, {{popularly known}} as the [...] "airs above the ground," [...] include the courbette, <b>capriole,</b> levade, and ballotade. Though these {{movements}} are said to come from when the horse was used in war, in their modern form, it is unlikely the airs were used in actual battle, as all but the <b>Capriole</b> expose the horse's sensitive underbelly to the weapons of foot soldiers, and {{it is more likely}} that they were training exercises used off the battlefield.|$|E
50|$|The <b>capriole</b> is a {{movement}} where the horse leaps {{into the air and}} pulls his forelegs in towards his chest at the height of elevation, while kicking out with his hindlegs.|$|E

50|$|The verb to caper {{means to}} leap in a frolicsome way, and {{probably}} derives from <b>capriole,</b> which {{derives from the}} Latin for goat (Capra). The noun caper means a frolicsome leap, a capricious escapade or an illegal or questionable act.|$|E
5000|$|The {{horses were}} trained to perform a number of airs above the ground (or [...] "sauts d'Ã©cole") movements, which could enable their riders to escape if surrounded, or to fight more easily. These {{included}} movements such as levade, <b>capriole,</b> courbette, and ballotade. Movements still seen today in competitive dressage include the piaffe, passage, and half-pass.|$|E
50|$|The double Ã  droite {{begins with}} a pieds joints and petit saut, {{followed}} by two quick steps, a marque pied gauche croisÃ© and marque pied droit croisÃ©, during beat two, a grÃ¨ve droit croisÃ©e and petit saut on beat three and on the last beat pieds joints and a <b>capriole</b> (leap into the air with entrechat).|$|E
50|$|In the <b>capriole</b> (meaning leap of a goat), {{the horse}} jumps from a raised {{position}} of the forehand straight up into the air, kicks out with the hind legs, and lands more or less on all four legs at the same time. It requires an enormously powerful horse to perform correctly, and is considered {{the most difficult of}} all the airs above the ground. It is first introduced with the croupade, in which the horse does not kick out at the height of elevation, but keeps the hind legs tucked tightly under, and remains parallel to the ground. The horse is then taught the ballotade. In this movement, the horse's hind hooves are positioned so one can see its shoes if watching from behind, but the horse is not asked to kick out. When the horse demonstrates proficiency in the ballotade, the <b>capriole</b> is introduced.|$|E

5000|$|In the courbette, {{the horse}} raises its {{forehand}} off the ground, tucks up forelegs evenly, and then jumps forward, never allowing the forelegs to touch down, {{in a series}} of [...] "hops". Extremely strong and talented horses can perform five or more leaps forward before having to touch down with the forelegs, although it is more usual to see a series of three or four leaps. The courbette, like the <b>capriole,</b> is first introduced through the easier croupade.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Airs Above the Ground" [...] follows; all {{horses are}} under saddle, but the riders {{do not have}} stirrups. Movements {{performed}} include the levade, <b>capriole</b> and courbette. The performance finishes with the [...] "School Quadrille", consisting of 8 riders working in formation at the walk, trot, and canter, with flying changes, pirouettes, the half pass and the passage. The ride is performed to classical music. Lasting 20 minutes, the School Quadrille of the Spanish Riding School is the longest and most difficult in the world.|$|E
50|$|Braiding {{the dock}} {{of the tail}} in a French braid with the skirt left loose is {{commonly}} seen in hunter competition and hunt seat equitation. In polo, draft horse showing and on Lipizzan horses that perform the <b>capriole,</b> the entire tail, dock and skirt, is generally braided and the braid is folded or rolled into a knot, with or without added ribbons and other decorative elements. In inclement weather, many other show disciplines will allow competitors {{to put up the}} skirt of the tail into a similar type of stylized knot known as a mud tail.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary riders need {{to learn}} to ride out and correct a simple buck or two, because it is a {{relatively}} common form of disobedience. Further, at times, movement akin to bucking is actually required of a horse: Horses that are jumping over an obstacle actually are using almost the same action as bucking when launching themselves into the air, it is simply carried out with advanced planning over a higher and wider distance. The classical dressage movement known as the <b>Capriole</b> is also very similar to the low buck done by a horse when it kicks out with both hind legs.|$|E

The braid may be secured by wrapping with a lock of hair reserved from the braid, or by taping. Often the dock is shaved.

All carry the traditional white saddle of the school. Then one stallion is then worked [...] "On the Long Rein", in which a fully trained Lipizzan performs all the movements it would be asked to do under saddle. In this section, the horse wears a red snaffle bridle and a red shabrack (saddlecloth) with the golden coat of arms of the Austrian Empire.|$|E
