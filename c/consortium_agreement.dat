2500|$|When the Shah {{returned}} to Iran after the coup, he {{was greeted by}} a cheering crowd. He wrote in his memoirs that while {{he had been a}} king for over a decade, {{for the first time he}} felt that the people had [...] "elected" [...] and [...] "approved" [...] of him, and that he had a [...] "legitimate" [...] popular mandate in order to carry out his reforms (although some in the crowd may have been bribed). The Shah however, never was able to remove the reputation of being a [...] "foreign imposed" [...] ruler among non-royalist Iranians. However the Shah throughout his rule continued to assume that he was supported by virtually everybody in Iran, and sank into deep dejection when in 1978 massive mobs demanded his ouster. The incident left him in awe of American power, while it also gave him a deep hatred of the British. When the Shah attempted during the 1970s to once again control the oil prices (through OPEC), and cancel the same oil <b>consortium</b> <b>agreement</b> that caused the 1953 coup, it resulted in a massive decline in US support for the Shah, and ironically, hastened his downfall.|$|E

30|$|Sponsors and {{principal}} investigators of international collaborations, {{such as the}} Centre for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI) and Grand Challenges in Global Health (GCGH) Initiative, typically hail from affluent countries. These parties usually assume the responsibility for drafting and driving data sharing or <b>consortium</b> <b>agreements.</b> Intellectual Property (IP) regulatory and guidance frameworks typically have a European or North American basis. Moreover, there is often no or poor intellectual property expertise available to consortium partners from developing countries. Accordingly, data sharing or <b>consortium</b> <b>agreements</b> drafted by PIs or sponsors from affluent countries are sometimes perceived by consortium partners in developing countries as being biased in favour {{of the interests of}} their consortium partners from the developed world. PIs from affluent countries should accordingly ensure that their colleagues from the developing world are prospectively involved in the drafting of <b>consortium</b> or data-sharing <b>agreements.</b> Such an approach could see data access and research output issues explicitly and meaningfully governed. Such an agreement should describe the management of intellectual property rights related to the proposed project, including plans for sharing data, information, and materials resulting from the award. The policy must also clearly govern the timing and means of data release, and any constraints on release. ([URL] We recommend that local communities have a say in the management and sharing of data relating to them.|$|R

30|$|Public {{administration}} in the U.S. has three levels: federal, State, and local, either at the county or the city level. Each administration plays a different role in the Triple Helix Model. Virtually all U.S. public R&D funds are controlled by the Federal Government, with a few notable exceptions such as California’s 2006 3 -billion-dollar stem cell initiative (Etzkowitz and Rickne 2014). U.S. Government releases every year the total spending of the different agencies. As a general trend and since 2008, R&D federal funds have mainly declined, however, have become more sophisticated.
