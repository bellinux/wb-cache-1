25|$|Following the {{departure}} of <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy</b> in September 2004, Cowen became Minister for Finance. On 1 December 2004, he announced his first budget, one that {{was viewed as a}} give-away budget in which spending was increased by 9%.|$|E
25|$|He was {{president}} of the Liberal International, the world federation of liberal political parties. Since Autumn 2004, he has been a professor at the Dutch universities of Leiden and Delft.

25|$|One {{legislative}} package {{inherited from the}} Prodi Commission was the Directive on services in the internal market, {{commonly known as the}} 'Bolkestein Directive', which sought to liberalise the EU's services sector which accounts for two-thirds of the EU's economy. Barroso's Market Commissioner, <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy,</b> put forward a text following far reaching amendments proposed by Parliament and protests from trade unions.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to this, some shifts in policy and a cabinet reshuffle {{took place in}} September 2004, including <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy's</b> resignation as Finance minister to join the European Commission.|$|R
50|$|During the 1979 {{leadership}} contest Gallagher supported George Colley. However, Charles Haughey became {{party leader}} and Taoiseach. Because of this Gallagher was demoted {{to the position}} of Minister of State. In October 1982, following the resignations of Martin O'Donoghue and Desmond O'Malley from the Cabinet, after they supported <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy's</b> motion of no confidence, Gallagher returned as Minister for the Gaeltacht. He remained in that post until December when Fianna Fáil went into opposition.|$|R
25|$|A {{large number}} of TDs quickly grew disillusioned with Haughey's {{leadership}} and threw their support behind O'Malley {{in an effort to}} oust the incumbent leader. On 1 October 1982, a challenge to Haughey was initiated by the Kildare TD, <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy.</b> O'Malley was on holiday in Spain at the time but rushed back to put his own name forward as a possible alternative to Haughey. He and his supporters resigned from the Cabinet. Haughey won an open vote by 58 votes to 22, with the result that those TDs who voted against Haughey, including O'Malley, became known as the Gang of 22.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 as Ireland entered {{recession}} McCreevy's stewardship {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} reasons why the global financial crisis is hitting Ireland especially hard, due to his [...] "light touch" [...] regulation of the financial system. Former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald attributed Ireland's dire economic state in 2009, on a series of [...] "calamitous" [...] government policy errors by the then Finance Minister <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy,</b> who between the years of 2000 and 2003, boosted public spending by 48pc while cutting income tax.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} term {{increased}} prosperity and a better standard of living were the main results of the Celtic Tiger economy.

The good economic conditions allowed Minister for Finance, <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy,</b> to deliver several generous budgets. The 1998 and 1999 Finance Acts included special tax incentives targeted at the area covered by the pilot Rural Renewal Scheme for the Upper Shannon Area. This scheme was later subject to criticism by the Heritage Council for being introduced without a ‘Baseline Audit’ to inform the ...|$|E
2500|$|On 12 March 2008, Libertas, a lobby group {{started by}} {{businessman}} Declan Ganley {{launched a campaign}} called Facts, not politics which advocated a No vote in the referendum. A month later, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel appealed to Irish people to vote Yes in the referendum whilst {{on a visit to}} Ireland. The anti-Lisbon Treaty campaign group accused the government and Fine Gael of a U-turn on their previous policy of discouraging foreign leaders from visiting Ireland during the referendum campaign. The European Commissioner for the Internal Market <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy</b> admitted he had not read the Treaty from cover to cover, and said [...] "he would not expect any sane person to do so".|$|E
2500|$|Haughey's {{second term}} was {{dominated}} by even more economic mismanagement, based on Haughey's policy of using government policy and money, {{in an effort to}} induce a sufficiently large share of the electorate to vote him his elusive 'overall majority' in the Dáil. With Haughey and his supporters taking a dangerously populist line in every area of policy, and refusing to address serious shortcomings in the performance of the state, a growing minority in his own party were becoming increasingly concerned. The issue of his leadership cropped up again when in October the backbench TD, <b>Charlie</b> <b>McCreevy,</b> put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Desmond O'Malley disagreed with the timing but supported the hasty motion of no confidence all the same. O'Malley resigned from the Cabinet prior to the vote as he was going to vote against Haughey. A campaign now started that was extremely vicious on the side of Haughey's supporters, with threats made to the careers of those who dissented from the leadership. After a marathon 15-hour party meeting, Haughey, who insisted on a roll-call as opposed to a secret ballot, and won the open ballot by 58 votes to 22. Not long after this, Haughey's government collapsed when the Workers' Party TD's and Tony Gregory withdrew their support for the government over a Fianna Fáil policy document called [...] "The Way Forward," [...] which would lead to massive spending cuts. Fianna Fáil lost the November 1982 election and FitzGerald once again returned as Taoiseach {{at the head of a}} Fine Gael/Labour coalition with a comfortable Dáil majority. Haughey found himself back in opposition.|$|E
