40|$|There is wide {{agreement}} {{that in order}} to manage the increasingly complex and uncertain tasks of business, government and community, organizations can no longer operate in supreme isolation, but must develop a more networked approach. Networks are not ‘business as usual’. Of particular note is what has been referred to as <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks.</b> <b>Collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> now constitute a significant part of our institutional infrastructure. A key driver for the proliferation of these multiorganizational arrangements is their ability to facilitate the learning and knowledge necessary to survive or to respond to increasingly complex social issues In this regard the emphasis is on the importance of learning in networks. Learning applies to networks in two different ways. These refer to the kinds of learning that occur as part of the interactive processes of networks. This paper looks at the importance of these two kinds of learning in <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks.</b> The first kind of learning relates to networks as learning networks or communities of practice. In learning networks people exchange ideas with each other and bring back this new knowledge for use in their own organizations. The second type of learning is referred to as network learning. Network learning refers to how people in <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> learn new ways of communicating and behaving with each other. Network learning has been described as transformational in terms of leading to major systems changes and innovation. In order to be effective, all networks need to be involved as learning networks; however, <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> must also be involved in network learning to be effective. In addition to these two kinds of learning in <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> this paper also focuses on the importance of how we learn about <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks.</b> Maximizing the benefits of working through <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> is dependent on understanding their unique characteristics and how this impacts on their operation. This requires a new look at how we specifically teach about <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> and how this is similar to and/or different from how we currently teach about interorgnizational relations...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> has {{attracted}} considerable attention, especially in two knowledge domains: innovation and operation management. Although <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> have evolved into many forms, their {{central role in}} triggering debates has not gone unnoticed. In this paper, we aim to contribute to these debates through a bibliometric review of a decade of research on <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> (2002 – 2015). By {{using a combination of}} document co-citation and bibliographic coupling analyses, we unveil the origins and evolution of <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> over time by analysing the references from the most important academic contributions. Our goal is threefold: first, to systematise {{the state of the art}} in the Input-Process-Output (IPO) framework; second, to elucidate the antecedents of the research field on <b>collaborative</b> <b>networks</b> (research streams originating from the field, main authors and journals) by organising them in six thematic clusters; and third, to show how the antecedents shaped the IPO framework. While ‘collaborative networks’ used to belong to two distinct domains, the research agendas seem to converge because of the interactions between their most active authors. As such, cross-fertilisation occurs with the International Journal of Production Research, which plays a central role in this proces...|$|R
