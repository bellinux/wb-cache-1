50|$|In several {{clinical}} trials, <b>clocapramine</b> {{has been}} compared to other neuroleptic agents. Against haloperidol, though {{there was no significant difference}} in efficacy at the end of the study, <b>clocapramine</b> tended to be superior in alleviating motor retardation, alogia, and thought disorder, and also produced fewer side effects. Against sulpiride, <b>clocapramine</b> demonstrated more favorable effects in the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms, including motor retardation, delusions, hallucinations, and social isolation, though it produced more side effects. Against timiperone, <b>clocapramine</b> showed lower efficacy against both positive and negative symptoms and produced more side effects such as dyskinesia, insomnia, constipation, and nausea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clocapramine</b> (Clofekton, Padrasen), {{also known}} as 3-chlorocarpipramine, is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic of the imidobenzyl class which was introduced in Japan in 1974 by Yoshitomi {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia. In addition to psychosis, <b>clocapramine</b> has also been used to augment antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety and panic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clocapramine</b> {{has been}} implicated {{in at least one}} fatality, a suicide in which there were two self-inflicted stab wounds and an {{overdose}} of <b>clocapramine</b> as well as three other antipsychotics was taken. The stab wounds could not explain the death, and thus, it was attributed to multiple drug toxicity instead.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clocapramine</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to act as an antagonist of the D2, 5-HT2A, α1-adrenergic, and α2-adrenergic receptors, and does not inhibit the reuptake of either serotonin or norepinephrine. It has also been shown to have affinity for the σ receptors. Clocapramine's affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor is greater than that for the D2 receptor and it has a lower propensity for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms compared to typical antipsychotics, thus underlying its atypical nature.|$|E

Methods: We searched data that had been published in PubMed, the Cochrane Library databases, PsycINFO, CiNii, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society up to August 29, 2014. Randomized controlled trials that compared iminodibenzyl antipsychotics with other antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia were included. Odds ratios and standardized mean differences were evaluated. Results: We included four randomized controlled trials on carpipramine (number of patients [n]= 290), six on <b>clocapramine</b> (n= 1, 048), and five on mosapramine (n= 986) in the meta-analysis. There {{were no significant differences}} in the response rates or in the discontinuation rates either between carpipramine and the other pooled antipsychotics or between <b>clocapramine</b> and the other pooled antipsychotics. On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, mosapramine’s positive subscale scores were superior to those of the other pooled antipsychotics (standard mean of difference =− 0. 22); however, on that same scale, there {{were no significant differences in}} total scores, negative scores, general subscale scores, response rates, or the discontinuation rates between mosapramine and the other pooled antipsychotics. Furthermore, the incidences of extrapyramidal symptoms and of hyperprolactinemia were significantly greater with mosapramine than with the other pooled antipsychotics. Conclusion: The pharmacological profiles of carpipramine and <b>clocapramine,</b> which are classified as SGAs, were similar to those of first-generation antipsychotics because there were no significant differences in efficacy and safety outcomes. However, mosapramine was associated with a greater risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and hyperprolactinemia than the other SGAs were, although it may be beneficial for the improvement of positive symptoms.

This study aimed {{to examine whether}} previous findings could be replicated in a genetically distinct and homogenous group (ie, Japanese patients with schizophrenia) and whether previous findings could be extended to {{a broader range of}} antipsychotics with previously unclear relative efficacy and tolerability. Methods: Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed in which randomized trials comparing any of the following interventions were included: second-generation antipsychotics, haloperidol, or placebo. The primary outcomes for efficacy and acceptability were the response rate and all-cause discontinuation. The secondary outcomes included the improvement of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores, discontinuation because of adverse events, and individual adverse events. Results: Eighteen relevant studies were identified (total n= 3, 446; aripiprazole = 267, blonanserin = 285, clozapine = 47, <b>clocapramine</b> = 295, haloperidol = 857, mosapramine = 493, olanzapine = 179, paliperidone = 136, perospirone = 146, placebo = 138, quetiapine = 212, and risperidone = 338; mean study duration = 8. 33 ± 1. 41 weeks). In primary outcomes, olanzapine and paliperidone showed efficacy than placebo, and olanzapine and paliperidone showed superior acceptability compared with placebo. There were differences in the incidences of individual adverse events (the best antipsychotic: extrapyramidal symptoms = olanzapine, hyperprolactinemia-related symptoms = quetiapine, sedation = paliperidone, and weight change = blonanserin) among antipsychotics. Conclusion: Although the current analysis exclusively included Japanese patients with schizophrenia, no remarkable differences were observed in efficacy and safety compared with previous meta-analyses. Diverse hierarchies in safety outcomes also support the implication that individual risk expectations for adverse events can guide clinical decisions. However, the sample size was relatively limited. Additional efficacy and safety data are required to fully obtain a conclusive understanding. Keywords: antipsychotics, Japanese schizophrenia, network meta-analysis, efficacy, safet...|$|E
