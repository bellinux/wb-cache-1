Titled Amarak Productions, Inc. vs. Morton, Madonna's former {{bodyguard}} and ex-lover Jim Albright brought a defamation case against Morton, based on an incorrect photo <b>caption.</b> The photo had a <b>caption</b> identifying the subject in it as Albright; it was actually one of Madonna's homosexual back-up dancers, Jose Gutierez. Amarak Productions, Inc. had employed Albright as Madonna's bodyguard in 1992, and he became romantically involved with her. While writing Madonna, Morton contacted Albright to gather information on their relationship. On discovering the misleading image, the lawsuit was filed by Albright who objected to the <b>caption.</b>|$|E
5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed <b>caption</b> data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed <b>caption</b> stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the <b>caption</b> style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E

50|$|Rear Window <b>captioning</b> is an {{alternative}} to open <b>captioning,</b> in which text is permanently visible. Open <b>captioning</b> has been little-used due to the fear {{that it was too}} intrusive and noticeable to hearing viewers. However, no studies have been conducted to elicit hearing people's opinions on how they will adapt to reading <b>captions</b> on screen. Rear Window <b>captioning</b> is a form of closed <b>captioning</b> because the viewer must choose to view the <b>captions.</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>captioning</b> during video-based listening activities. Second- and fourth-year learners of Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, and Russian watched three short videos with and without <b>captioning</b> in randomized order. Spanish learners had two additional groups: one watched the videos twice with no <b>captioning,</b> and another watched them twice with <b>captioning.</b> After the second showing of the video, learners took comprehension and vocabulary tests based on the video. Twenty-six learners participated in interviews following the actual experiment. They were asked about their general reactions to the videos (<b>captioned</b> and noncaptioned). Results from t-tests and two-way ANOVAs indicated that <b>captioning</b> was more effective than no <b>captioning.</b> <b>Captioning</b> during the first showing of the videos was more effective for performance on aural vocabulary tests. For Spanish and Russian, <b>captioning</b> first was generally more effective than <b>captioning</b> second; while for Arabic and Chinese, there was a trend toward <b>captioning</b> second being more effective. The interview data revealed that learners used <b>captions</b> to increase their attention, improve processing, reinforce previous knowledge, and analyze language. Learners also reported using <b>captions</b> as a crutch...|$|R

This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the <b>caption</b> Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?").

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was twofold: we {{investigated}} (a) the effect of two types of <b>captioned</b> video (i. e., on-screen text in the same language as the video) on listening comprehension; (b) L 2 learners’ perception of the usefulness of <b>captions</b> while watching L 2 video. The participants, 226 university-level students from a Flemish university, watched three short French clips in one of three conditions: the control group watched the clips without <b>captions</b> (N = 70), the second group had fully <b>captioned</b> clips (N = 81), the third group had keyword <b>captioned</b> clips (N = 75). After each clip, all participants took a listening comprehension test, which consisted of global and detailed questions. To answer the detailed questions, participants had access to an audio passage of the corresponding clip. At the end of the experiment, participants completed a questionnaire and open-ended survey questions about their perception of <b>captions.</b> Our findings revealed that the full <b>captioning</b> group outperformed both the no <b>captioning</b> and the keyword <b>captioning</b> group on the global comprehension questions. However, no difference was found between the keyword <b>captioning</b> and the no <b>captioning</b> group. Results of the detailed comprehension questions (with audio) revealed no differences between the three conditions. A content-analysis approach to the questionnaire indicated that learners’ perceived need for full <b>captions</b> is strong. Participants consider <b>captions</b> useful for speech decoding and meaning-making processes. Surprisingly, keyword <b>captions</b> were considered highly distracting.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{challenges the}} conventions of adding static <b>captions</b> {{to the bottom of}} videos and instead advocates for designing integral <b>captions</b> and integral subtitles that interact with bodies, sound, and other modes around the screen. I use this dissertation to argue that integral <b>captions</b> create a space for embodied rhetorics (the ways that we make meaning through our bodies) and visual access to multimodal communication (how sound, visuals, signs, and other modes interact within the space of the screen). In contrast to conventional <b>captions</b> and subtitles that are placed {{at the bottom of the}} screen and that can be turned on and off, I define integral <b>captions</b> and subtitles as those that are designed to be essential elements of a video in coordination with sound, meaning, and other modes of communication. I address this dissertation directly to scholars, instructors, and practitioners in rhetoric and composition, professional communication, and related disciplines who could integrate <b>captions</b> and subtitles to make meaning more informative, engaging, and visually accessible for students, colleagues, and viewers.
