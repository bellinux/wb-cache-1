25|$|However, {{infrared}} telescopes have an Achilles heelthey {{need to stay}} extremely cold, and {{the longer}} the wavelength of infrared, the colder they need to be. If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind. This can be overcome by careful spacecraft design, in particular by placing the telescope in dewar with an extremely cold substance, such as liquid helium. This has meant most infrared telescopes have a lifespan limited by their coolant, as short as a few months, maybe a few years at most. It has been possible to maintain a temperature low enough through {{the design of the}} spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, such as the extended missions of Spitzer or NEOWISE. Another example is Hubble's NICMOS instrument, which started out using a block of nitrogen ice that depleted after a couple years, but was then converted to a <b>cryocooler</b> that worked continuously. The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sun-shield and radiators with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional <b>cryocooler.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To {{carry out}} {{long-term}} experiments requiring a large bore and a constant high magnetic field, a 100 mm bore water-cooled resistive magnet has been designed, which is com-bined with a <b>cryocooled</b> superconducting outsert as a <b>cryocooled</b> hybrid magnet. The designed double Bitter magnet will produce 10. 1 T under a use of 4. 5 MW power {{for a long}} time operation, and a <b>cryocooled</b> hybrid magnet will be able to keep 18 T in a backup field of 8 T for ten hours economically. Main application of the wide bore <b>cryocooled</b> hybrid magnet is X-ray diffraction measurement under high magnetic fields.

40|$|SummaryMost {{macromolecular}} X-ray {{structures are}} determined from <b>cryocooled</b> crystals, {{but it is}} unclear whether <b>cryocooling</b> distorts functionally relevant flexibility. Here we compare independently acquired pairs of high-resolution data sets of a model Michaelis complex of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), collected by separate groups at both room and cryogenic temperatures. These data sets allow us to isolate the differences between experimental procedures and between temperatures. Our analyses of multiconformer models and time-averaged ensembles suggest that <b>cryocooling</b> suppresses and otherwise modifies side-chain and main-chain conformational heterogeneity, quenching dynamic contact networks. Despite some idiosyncratic differences, most changes from room temperature to cryogenic temperature are conserved and likely reflect temperature-dependent solvent remodeling. Both cryogenic data sets point to additional conformations not evident in the corresponding room temperature data sets, suggesting that <b>cryocooling</b> does not merely trap preexisting conformational heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that crystal <b>cryocooling</b> consistently distorts the energy landscape of DHFR, a paragon for understanding functional protein dynamics...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{increasing}} cost and the dwindling availability of liquid helium, many superconducting systems are cooled using two stage mechanical refrigeration. In general {{two types of}} mechanical cryocoolers are employed which have sufficient cooling power to maintain magnets below their critical temperature. The Gifford-McMahon <b>Cryocooler</b> has been commercially available since the 1960s and has found widespread application. The G-M regenerator cycle in a <b>cryocooler</b> operates using a piston type displacer and heat exchanger. Alternatively, 1999 marked the first commercial application using a pulse tube <b>cryocooler.</b> This design of <b>cryocooler</b> has become increasingly common due to low vibration and long service interval as pulse tube designs utilize an acoustic process in lieu of mechanical displacement. Typical to two stage refrigerators the first stage will offer higher cooling capacity but at higher temperature ~77 K with the second stage being at ~4.2 K and <2.0 Watts cooling power. In use, the first stage is used primarily for ancillary cooling of the cryostat with the second stage used primarily for cooling the magnet.|$|E

40|$|High-pressure <b>cryocooling</b> (HPC) {{has been}} {{developed}} as a technique for reducing the damage that frequently occurs when macromolecular crystals are <b>cryocooled</b> at ambient pressure. Crystals are typically pressurized at around 200 MPa and then cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature under pressure; this process reduces the need for penetrating cryoprotectants, {{as well as the}} damage due to <b>cryocooling,</b> but does not improve the diffraction quality of the as-grown crystals. Here it is reported that HPC using a pressure above 300 MPa can reduce lattice disorder, in the form of high mosaicity and/or nonmerohedral twinning, in crystals of three different proteins, namely human glutaminase C, the GTP pyrophosphokinase YjbM and the uncharacterized protein lpg 1496. Pressure lower than 250 MPa does not induce this transformation, even with a prolonged pressurization time. These results indicate that HPC at elevated pressures can be a useful tool for improving crystal packing and hence the quality of the diffraction data collected from pressurized crystals. clos...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} for {{the first}} time a method for preparing <b>cryocooled</b> xenon-derivatized protein crystals. The method is based upon the hypothesis and subsequent observation that the diffusion of a xenon atom from a tight binding site following depressurization occurs on a timescale of minutes.

In accordance with this observation, a xenon-derivatized myoglobin crystal was <b>cryocooled</b> at ~ 95 K within 20 s of complete depressurization. A crystallographic data set was then collected to 2. 0 Å resolution and isomorphous and anomalous difference Patterson maps revealed the presence of a well ordered xenon site with an occupancy of approximately 0. 5. Phasing statistics for this site were of good quality and demonstrate the practicality of this method.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the study of biological systems and aqueous solutions at low temperatures. The focus of the dissertation is on the continued development of low temperature biological small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), cryoSAXS. CryoSAXS is a new method for biological SAXS that involves <b>cryocooling</b> the sample to 100 K. At 100 K the sample is much more resistant to damage from X-rays, enabling use of volumes hundreds or thousands of times smaller than in conventional room temperature SAXS. This work was divided into three main pieces. First, we designed, microfabricated, and tested new small volume, fixed path length sample holder for use in cryoSAXS. Next, as a first step towards answering the question of how much the radiation tolerance of a sample increases upon <b>cryocooling,</b> we developed methods to quantify radiation damage to SAXS profiles and tested these using standard room temperature SAXS. Finally, we measured the radiation tolerance of <b>cryocooled</b> SAXS samples, and found that the <b>cryocooling</b> decreases the radiation sensitivity by three orders of magnitude. The last chapter of the dissertation describes ongoing work to develop time resolved cryoSAXS, and other outstanding questions in cryoSAXS. In addition to cryoSAXS, in a complementary research project we studied ice formation in aqueous solutions. In particular, we quantified the critical warming rate, the warming rate required to prevent ice formation upon warming a vitrified solution. This has particular relevance to biological cryopreservation, as ice formation can irreparably damage cryopreserved samples. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|R

Microgravity crystals were larger, more homogeneous, and more perfect than earth crystals. Several mg crystals contained primarily a single mosaic domain with havg of 0. 005 deg. The earth crystals varied in quality and all contained multiple domains with havg of 0. 031 deg. <b>Cryocooling</b> caused a 43 -fold increase in h for mg crystals (havg= 0. 217 deg) and an %fold increase for earth crystals (havg= 0. 246 deg).

Therefore, an improved signal-to-noise ratio for each reflection was measured from cryo-cooled single domain crystals relative to cryo-cooled multi-domain crystals.
