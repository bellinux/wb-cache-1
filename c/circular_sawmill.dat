50|$|From Midlothian Junction, the C&P made a {{connection}} with a logging railroad. The Juniata Lumber Company established a <b>circular</b> <b>sawmill</b> in Midlothian, {{at the end of}} a 3-foot gauge line that extended 12 miles into Garrett County along Big Savage Mountain. A Class-B Climax geared engine was used to haul the logs. From the sawmill, the lumber was shipped in boxcars over the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad. Twenty-five thousand board feet per day of railroad ties and dimensioned wood were produced at peak production. The sawmill facility was closed by 1913.|$|E
50|$|The 19th century saw {{a decline}} in traffic at the port, falling off {{completely}} {{at the end of}} the century. The number of herring boats decreased from 12 in 1858 to 8 in 1863. Corn exports fell as railways assumed the burden and grain exporting was moved to more efficient and connected ports. Yet timber and slate importation appears to have continued: in 1887, forty men were employed in this industry; and other shore-side concerns appear buoyant; the sawmill thrived, with 27 employees in 1891, and there was a large steam-mill used to process grain and drive a <b>circular</b> <b>sawmill.</b> Apparently the port's death-knell was the capsizal of the timber ship Joanna in the shallow harbour in 1896, after which it became difficult to secure insurance for freight passing through Alnmouth.|$|E
50|$|European {{settlers}} {{reached this}} area in the early 19th century. At first, trees were cut mostly to clear land for agriculture and provide timber for cabins and barns. Soon, the first commercial water-powered mills cut small amounts of lumber from selected pine, hemlock and large hardwoods. By 1840, portable steam engines made <b>circular</b> <b>sawmills</b> practical, and mills that could process 10,000 board feet (24 mÂ³) of lumber per day were common.|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} sawmills were established, they were usually small water powered {{facilities}} {{located near the}} source of timber, which might be converted to grist mills after farming became established when the forests had been cleared. Later, bigger <b>circular</b> <b>sawmills</b> were developed in the lower reaches of a river, with the logs floated down to them by log drivers. In the broader, slower stretches of a river, the logs might be bound together into timber rafts. In the smaller, wilder stretches of a river, rafts couldn't get through, so masses of individual logs were driven down the river like huge herds of cattle.|$|R

50|$|Rip {{cuts are}} {{commonly}} {{made with a}} table saw, but other types of power saws can also be used, including a radial arm saw, band saw, and hand held <b>circular</b> saw. In <b>sawmills</b> the head saw is the first rip-saw a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be resawn using other saws and then edged in a edger and sometimes cut to length by a crosscut saw. Also, smaller portable sawmills and chainsaw mills use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time {{a piece of wood}} is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.|$|R
