40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} mainstream U. S. journalism consistently serves white racial {{interests and the}} racial status quo, or what I call white incumbency, despite its push for diversity and its stated aims to improve coverage of nonwhite communities. It {{is based on an}} in-depth ethnographic study of two daily newspapers and extensive one-on-one interviews with 61 journalists. I found that although journalists strongly identify with the need for more diverse coverage in newspapers, they emphasize individual and personal stories that avoid recognition of historical racial power imbalances, exhibiting what Ruth Frankenberg calls power-evasive race cognizance. Journalists also demonstrate a number of often contradictory identifications and self-understandings about themselves and their work, such as commitments to diversity and not taking sides, but these conflicts are almost always resolved in favor of white incumbency. Journalistic <b>conventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices,</b> such as the watchdog function and its emphasis on public institutions, routinely produce stories that replay and reinforce racial hegemony by portraying nonwhites as problems or people seeking “special privileges. ” Also, journalistic repertoires about those <b>conventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> avoid interrogations of journalists’ ongoing complicity in the maintenance of white incumbency...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{interested}} in investigating the complex nexus of sites of organizing and absurdity emerging from the persistent undermining and intermingling of common orders, logics <b>and</b> <b>conventions.</b> In its analysis the paper refers to an example from popular culture – the detective series Twin Peaks – which presents a ‘city of absurdity’. The series is discussed utilising Foucault’s (1970) concept of heterotopia which allows us to convey the ‘other side’ of ‘normal’ order and rational reason, immanent in sites of organizing. Fundamentally, the sites in Twin Peaks evoke an understanding of organization as a dynamic assemblage in which heterogeneous orders, <b>conventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> interrelate <b>and</b> collide. Analysed through a ‘heterotopic lens’ the TV series Twin Peaks contributes to the exploration of absurdity {{as a form of}} humour, and more generally to a sensitive and vivid knowing and experiencing of organization, organizational ‘otherness’ and absurdity...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{supposed}} that greater user involvement {{will result in}} more sustainable, more socially inclusive designs and technologies. I take issue with this proposition {{on the grounds that}} it fails to acknowledge the prior structuring of users' expectations or the socio-technical regimes and landscapes in which specific innovations take root. In developing this position I suggest that the re-specification of normal practice is of greater environmental significance than the ecological design of appliances and products with which taken-for-granted needs are met. It is useful to show how users configure and appropriate specific technologies but it is more important to follow the construction and reproduction of middle-range 'services' such as those of comfort, cleanliness and convenience. This begs the question as to how users are configured and technological systems are appropriated at macro and meso as well as micro levels of innovation. In exploring these issues with reference to air-conditioning, showering, and frozen food, I reframe the notion of user involvement such that the relation between technology, <b>convention</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> takes centre stage...|$|R

The academic version of language awareness has relations of power that are implicit in its <b>conventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices.</b> On the other hand, Post-colonial literary practitioners are listed among academic writers whose L 2 is English. By and large, however, these literary practitioners are mainly from ex-colonized countries that have chosen English {{for the production of}} their literary works as well. In so doing, in their L 2, they have academic language awareness that lets them practice writing. Hence, to this scope of writers, this fluctuation is triadic in that for them there is mother tongue interference as a third party. This factor, too, colors creativity and self-identity of these writers. One of these well-known writers is Chinua Achebe, whose works are in English. This article, therefore, for its argument, has had a discursive analysis of Achebe's triadic language awareness.

40|$|Although a {{large body}} of {{literature}} has suggested that doctoral supervisors {{play an important role in}} their students’ attempts at scholarly publishing, few studies have focused specifically on what roles they play. This study sought to address this gap by zooming in on the various roles a group of Chinese doctoral students found their supervisors playing in their scholarly publishing endeavors. Our analysis revealed four important roles played by the supervisors: ‘prey’ searchers, managers, manuscript correctors and masters. The results showed that the supervisors not only facilitated the doctoral students’ publishing output, but also fostered their apprenticeship in scholarly publishing and the academic community. However, the results also unveiled a general unavailability of sorely-needed detailed and specific guidance on students’ early publishing attempts and some supervisors’ limited ability to correct students’ English manuscripts. These findings underscore the important contributions doctoral supervisors can make to their students’ academic socialization. They also suggest a need for external editorial assistance with doctoral students’ English manuscripts and ample opportunities for their scaffolded initiation into the tacit <b>conventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> of scholarly publishing...|$|R
