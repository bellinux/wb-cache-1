Glyn Uzzell commented “Muqbil Zahawi was born in Baghdad, but has studied and lived in the United States for long periods. He has also lived and worked in Africa. Whether <b>consciously</b> acquired <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> assimilated, the influences of these widely differing cultures are reflected in his art.” Indeed, African art dominated his early works and continued throughout his life. The powerful images of the art from the continent were especially powerful to Al-Zahawi, who saw them as direct, unequivocal, and uncompromising.|$|R
50|$|Neuroimaging {{techniques}} {{have been applied}} to the investigation of flashbacks. Using these techniques, researchers attempt to discover the structural and functional differences in the anatomy of the brain in individuals who suffer from flashbacks {{compared to those who}} do not. Neuroimaging involves a cluster of techniques, including computerized tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (including functional), as well as magnetoencephalography. Neuroimaging studies investigating flashbacks are based on current psychological theories that are used as the foundation for the research, and one such theory that is consistently investigated is the difference between explicit and implicit memory. This distinction dictates the manner in which memories are later recalled, namely either <b>consciously</b> (voluntarily) <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> (involuntarily).|$|R
50|$|The {{construct}} of behavioral communication is {{conceived as a}} variable of Individual differences. This means that some people more than others tend to engage in indirect or behavioral communication, whether <b>consciously</b> doing so <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> doing so, {{in spite of the}} plausible alternatives of using verbal communication. An individual's behavioral style greatly effects their verbal and nonverbal communication. It is rare that someone utilizes all one behavioral communication style, all of the time. Being able to identify one's own behavioral style requires a high level of self-awareness.|$|R

We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

5000|$|Instrumental emotion {{responses}} are experienced and expressed {{by a person}} because the person has learned that the response {{has an effect on}} others, [...] "such as getting them to pay attention to us, to go along with something we want them to do for us, to approve of us, or perhaps most often just not to disapprove of us." [...] Instrumental emotion responses can be <b>consciously</b> intended <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> learned (i.e., through operant conditioning). Examples include crocodile tears (instrumental sadness), bullying (instrumental anger), crying wolf (instrumental fear), and feigned embarrassment (instrumental shame). When a client responds in therapy with instrumental emotion responses, it may feel manipulative or superficial to the therapist. Instrumental emotion {{responses are}} explored in therapy in order to increase awareness of their interpersonal function and/or the associated primary and secondary gain.|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point for this research was an interest in how people learn and develop as adults and, more specifically, how people can help each other, either <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> perhaps <b>unconsciously,</b> to develop on both a professional and personal level. Society is structured so that individuals live and work together within a framework of cooperation and the focus here {{is the role of}} this framework in vocational development. Colleagues undoubtedly {{have a role to play}} in the development of others. Some willingly offer advice, assistance or just listen where needed; others may be more reluctant to do so, perhaps afraid of revealing their own vulnerability.

40|$|Monetary rewards {{facilitate}} {{performance on}} behavioral and cognitive tasks, even when these rewards are perceived without conscious awareness. Also, recent {{research suggests that}} consciously (vs. unconsciously) perceived rewards may prompt people to more strongly concentrate on task stimuli and details. Here we propose that the latter is sometimes dysfunctional, in that it prevents improvements in task performance. We used an Attentional Blink paradigm, in which such enhanced concentration on task stimuli is detrimental to performance. Participants were <b>consciously</b> (supraliminally) <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> (subliminally) exposed to a high-value or low-value coin that they could earn by performing well on an Attentional Blink trial. As hypothesized, high-value rewards increased performance when they were presented subliminally, while this performance benefit vanished when high-value rewards were presented consciously. We discuss this finding {{in the context of}} recent research on unconscious goal pursuit...|$|R

[...] In the concluding article, published in October, 1957, Dewar wrote that the failure of the Navy to adequately support the Army at Gallipoli [...] "is {{to be found in the}} system of training officers which <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> suppressed independent thought and suggestions from subordinates." [...] Despite his later close association with Churchill, he criticised the former First Lord's unrealistic expectations and also Lord Fisher's inability to rein him in for want of a naval staff; and Admiral of the Fleet (at the time Commodore) Roger Keyes for actively trying to gain support for forcing the straits again instead of acting as chief of staff and only advising the Naval Commander at the Dardanelles.|$|E

[...] The joint statement signed by both experts after the discussion showed that Kaney had conceded ground on a number of issues, weakening the claim considerably.

500|$|The opera was {{described}} by its creators as a commedia lirica. McDonald commented in 2009 that Falstaff is very different – a stylistic departure – from Verdi's earlier work. In McDonald's view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue, and {{there is only one}} traditional aria. The result is that [...] "such stylistic economy – more sophisticated, more challenging than he had employed before – is the keynote of the work." [...] McDonald argues that <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously,</b> Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century: [...] "the lyricism is abbreviated, glanced at rather than indulged. Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish, replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea". In McDonald's view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action. It has influenced at least one of Verdi's operatic successors: in 1952 Imogen Holst, musical assistant to Benjamin Britten, wrote, after a performance of Falstaff, [...] "I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [...] There are orchestral bits which are just as funny to listen to as the comic instrumental bits in A. Herring!" ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{begins by}} critiquing the long-‐established acronym CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning).

We look also at {{the extent to which they}} believe that their L 2 -‐based activity helps <b>consciously</b> and/ <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> with their language learning, practice, and acquisition. We argue that these data, combined with other recent trends in the field, suggest a need to move from CALL towards a more accurate acronym: mobile assisted language use (MALU). We conclude with a definition of MALU together with a brief discussion of a potential alignment of MALU with the notion of the digital resident and a newly emerging educational theory of connectivism...|$|R
5000|$|Weber {{also noted}} that life chances are to certain extent subjective: one's {{assessment}} of one's life chances will affect one's actions; therefore, if one believes that one is or can become a respected and valued member of society, that outcome and associated positive results {{are more likely to}} become a reality for such a person than they are for one without this conviction. [...] Persons without such a belief, especially those who <b>consciously</b> espouse <b>or</b> have <b>unconsciously</b> internalized a belief to the contrary, are vulnerable to learned helplessness and its long-term effects.|$|R
40|$|Unconsciously {{presented}} {{information can}} influence our behavior in an experimental context. However, whether these {{effects can be}} translated to a daily life context, such as advertising, is strongly debated. What hampers this translation is the widely accepted notion of the short-livedness of unconscious representations. The effect of unconscious information on behavior is assumed to rapidly vanish within a few hundreds of milliseconds. Using highly familiar brand logos (e. g., the logo of McDonald's) as subliminal and supraliminal primes in two priming experiments, we assessed whether these logos were able to elicit behavioral effects after a short (e. g., 350 ms), a medium (e. g., 1000 ms), and a long (e. g., 5000 ms) interval. Our results demonstrate that when real-life information is presented minimally <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> even <b>unconsciously,</b> it can influence our subsequent behavior, even when more than five seconds pass between {{the presentation of the}} minimally conscious or unconscious information and the behavior on which it exerts its influence...|$|R
500|$|The Smiths left Borley on 14 July 1929 and {{the parish}} had some {{difficulty}} {{in finding a}} replacement. The following year the Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster (1878–1945), a first cousin of the Bulls, and his wife Marianne (née Marianne Emily Rebecca Shaw) (1899–1992) moved into the rectory with their adopted daughter Adelaide, on 16 October 1930. Lionel Foyster wrote an account of various strange incidents that occurred between the time the Foysters moved in and October 1935, which was sent to Harry Price. These included bell-ringing, windows shattering, throwing of stones and bottles, wall-writing and the locking of their daughter {{in a room with}} no key. Marianne Foyster reported to her husband a whole range of poltergeist phenomena that included her being thrown from her bed. On one occasion, Adelaide was attacked by [...] "something horrible". Foyster tried twice to conduct an exorcism, but his efforts were fruitless; {{in the middle of the}} first exorcism, he was struck in the shoulder by a fist-size stone. Because of the publicity in the Daily Mirror, these incidents attracted the attention of several psychic researchers, who after investigation were unanimous in suspecting that they were caused, <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously,</b> by Marianne Foyster. She later said that she felt that some of the incidents were caused by her husband in concert with one of the psychic researchers, but other events appeared to her to be genuine paranormal phenomena. She later admitted that she was having a sexual relationship with the lodger, Frank Pearless, and that she used paranormal explanations to cover up her liaisons. The Foysters left Borley in October 1935 as a result of Lionel Foyster's ill health.|$|E

40|$|The term ‘worldview’ {{harbours}} different {{dimensions that}} are not always clearly distinguished. A worldview can {{be considered to be}} a personal matter, but it may also be a more collective phenomenon, as it can manifest itself for example within a certain sphere of life (e. g. politics or economics) as a full-blown ideology or a more implicit ‘embedded worldview’. A second distinction can be made between the dimension of a deep, existential commitment and that of an encompassing mental framework, between spiritual inspiration and a more or less intellectually coherent system. There may be tensions between these various dimensions. Having a worldview as a person may imply being in conflict with other worldviews that are embodied in certain social fields. How can people deal with these conflicts? One can easily be seduced to avoid the conflicts and to shift gears between them. With the credit crisis and economics used as an illustration, this article explores some of the techniques that people – <b>consciously,</b> semi-consciously <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> – may employ to navigate the differences between various social domains and their inherent worldviews. In order to support people to regain some unity, the notion of worldview may still be helpful, but interpreted primarily as ‘deep commitment’...|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} examines {{practical and}} ethical issues {{inherent in the}} application of oral history and memory studies to research about the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe since the collapse of the Soviet bloc. Case studies highlight the importance of ethical good practice, including the reflexive interrogation of the interviewer and researcher, and aspects of gender and national identity. Researchers use oral history to analyze present-day recollections of the Soviet past, thereby extending our understanding beyond archival records, official rhetoric and popular mythology. Oral history explores individual life stories, but this has sometimes resulted in rather incomplete, incoherent, inconsistent or illogical narratives. Oral history, therefore, presents the researcher with a number of methodological and ethical dilemmas, including the interpretation of "silence" in biographical accounts. This collection links the discussion of oral history ethics with that of memory studies. Memories are shaped by factors that may be, simultaneously, both consecutive and disrupted. In written accounts and responses to interview questions, respondents sometimes display nostalgia for the Soviet past, or, conversely, may seek to de-mythologize the realities of Soviet rule. Case studies explore what to do when interview subjects and memoirists <b>consciously,</b> sub-consciously <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> "forget" aspects of their own past, or themselves seek {{to take control of the}} research process...|$|R
40|$|Communication {{depends on}} {{cooperation}} {{in at least}} the following way: In order to be successful, communicative behavior needs to be adjusted to the general world knowledge, abilities, and interests of the hearer, and the hearer's success in figuring out the message and responding to {{it needs to be}} informed by assumptions about the communicator's informative intentions, personal goals, and communicative abilities. In other words, interlocutors cooperate by coordinating their actions in order to fulfill their communicative intentions. This minimal assumption about cooperativeness must {{in one way or another}} be built into the foundations of any plausible inferential model of human communication. However, the communication process is also influenced to a greater or lesser extent, whether intentionally and <b>consciously</b> <b>or</b> unintentionally and <b>unconsciously,</b> by the participants' orientation toward, or preoccupation with, their own concerns, so their behavior may easily fall short of being as cooperative as is required for achieving successful communication. ...|$|R

40|$|This review aims to {{classify}} and clarify, from a neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and psychological perspective, different memory models {{that are currently}} widespread in the literature {{as well as to}} describe their origins.

This article intends to provide a comprehensive and rigorous overview for understanding and ordering the latest scientific advances related to this subject. The main forms of memory presented include sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Information from the world around us is first stored by sensory memory, thus enabling the storage and future use of such information. Short-term memory (or memory) refers to information processed in a short period of time. Long-term memory allows us to store information for long periods of time, including information that can be retrieved <b>consciously</b> (explicit memory) <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously</b> (implicit memory) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of existing studies {{of small business}} failure tend to focus upon either the symptoms arising from problems within the firm or upon the reasons cited for failure. Comparatively little analysis of the root cause has been undertaken. Failure and success are usually defined in rational terms which ignore stakeholder aspirations. Many owner-managers pursue personal objectives which inhibit the probability of success if measured using these rational criteria. The root cause of small business failure is almost invariably a lack of management attention to strategic issues. Notwithstanding the fact that common skills and abilities are required, the management process in small firms is unique and cannot {{be considered to be}} the same as professional management in larger firms practised on a reduced scale.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Afrikaans and Dutch)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006). Nelson Mandela’s autobiography, ‘Long walk to freedom’, can {{be viewed}} as a {{milestone}} in South African history. Although it is not necessarily significant in a literary sense, it played an important role in making many South Africans aware of another side to their country’s history, and introduced them to a man who, besides being the world’s most famous political prisoner and a respected statesman, is also an ordinary human being. The Afrikaans translation of the autobiography, Lang pad na vryheid, formed part of a project to translate the original document into all the languages of South Africa (three other translations have been completed thus far). This project is discussed in relation to the ideological motive for it, and also in relation to the ideological position of Afrikaans in South Africa and the ideology and poetics of the translator. The study is based on a descriptive approach, specifically as manifested in the manipulation theory of André Lefevere. It attempts to place the translation of autobiography as a genre within translation theory, and suggests that the translator of autobiography has little ‘leeway’ with regard to the application of translation strategies, specifically those that change the original narrator’s ‘voice’. The various ways in which the text has been ‘manipulated’ in the production of its translation, both to make it function as a text in the target language and in ways that cannot always be justified on that basis, lead to the conclusion that it is very difficult to translate autobiography without interfering with the very personal telling of a person’s life story by that person, and without modulating the narration in a way that cannot always be reconciled with the autobiographer’s ideology. The modulation of the autobiographer’s voice, whether this takes place <b>consciously,</b> subconsciously <b>or</b> <b>unconsciously,</b> is finally argued to produce a translation that can no longer be viewed as the autobiography of Nelson Mandela in the strict sense...|$|R
