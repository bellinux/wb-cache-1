25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, type-founding {{companies}} often would offer pre-formed illustrations as fonts showing objects and designs {{likely to be}} useful for printing and advertisements, the equivalent of modern <b>clip</b> <b>art</b> and stock photographs. As examples, the American Type Founders specimen of 1897 offered designs including baseball players, animals, Christmas wreaths, designs for cheques, and emblems such as state seals for government printing. The practice has declined as printing custom illustrations and colour printing using processes such as lithography has become cheaper, although illustration typefaces are still sold by some companies. See above for the historical definition of display typeface.|$|E

It included album <b>clip</b> <b>art,</b> sample sound bytes, a biography by Mark Frauenfelder, lyrics, and a cyberculture bibliography by Gareth Branwyn. Frauenfelder {{appeared on a}} segment of MTV News to describe the diskette's features. Plans were considered by EMI/Chrysalis to re-release the album in the following fall with an updated CD-ROM if the album was successful. As CD-ROMs were prohibitively expensive {{at the time of}} production, this was anticipated as a potential benchmark event for the music industry. However, this failed to materialise due to the critical and financial failure of the album.|$|E

2500|$|Art Fern was the [...] "Tea Time Movie" [...] announcer, whose {{theme song}} was [...] "Hooray for Hollywood". Carson once {{admitted}} on camera {{that this was}} his favorite character, based on late-afternoon TV hosts who would deliver commercials throughout the movie. Each sketch usually featured three long commercials interrupted by silent, four-second clips from antique films. When the camera returned from each <b>clip,</b> <b>Art</b> was always caught off-guard and immediately reminded viewers that they were watching a film favorite. The movies always had unlikely casts and even less likely titles: [...] "Slim Pickens, Patti Page, Duke Wayne, and Charlton Heston in another classic Western: 'Kiss My Saddle Horn'!" [...] Carson originally played the fast-talking huckster in his own voice (as Honest Bernie Schlock or Ralph Willie), and finally settled on a nasal, high-pitched, smarmy drone, reminiscent of Jackie Gleason's [...] "Reginald Van Gleason III" [...] character. The character, now permanently known as Art Fern, wore a lavish toupee, loud jackets, and a pencil mustache. Actress Carol Wayne became famous for her 100-plus appearances (1971–1982) as Art's buxom assistant, the Matinée Lady. While Art gave his spiel, she would enter the stage behind him. Art would react to her attractive body by wincing, loudly shouting [...] "Ho— leeeee!" [...] and turning almost everything she said into a sexual double entendre. After Carol Wayne's death in 1985, Carson kept Art Fern off the air {{for most of the}} next year, and finally hired Danuta Wesley and then Teresa Ganzel to play the Matinée Lady. Carson also used these sketches to poke fun at the intricate Los Angeles interstate system, using a pointer and map to give confusing directions to shoppers, often including points where he would unfold the cardboard map to point out, via the appropriate picture, when the shopper would arrive at [...] "the fork in the road". Another freeway routine in the same theme centered on the [...] "Slauson Cutoff", a slang term Carson popularized to describe the truncated Marina Freeway (which ended abrubtly at Slauson Avenue in Culver City). Art Fern would advise drivers to take a series of freeways until they reached the Slauson Cutoff, and would then advise them to [...] "Get out of your car, cut off your slauson, get back in your car," [...] often followed by peals of laughter from the audience, led by McMahon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clip</b> <b>art</b> {{is divided}} into two {{different}} data types represented by many different file formats: bitmap and vector art. <b>Clip</b> <b>art</b> vendors may provide images of just one type or both.

30|$|Depending on {{the text}} size, some common words may show up quite often. So {{concatenation}} of data bytes into bigger units may pay off in achieving better compression. For better performance, the principle of Rice coding is borrowed here. That is, the compression is done not on the data itself, but {{on the number of}} bits in each data unit. The (transformed) data stripped of the top bit (must be 1) is sent as it is. Decompression extracts the recorded number of bits back into each unit. Thus compression is primarily data mapping, with bit conversion playing a lesser role. This (recursive) concatenation scheme is somewhat like dictionary coding, such as LZW, in that it can also be applied to the likes of GIF, pNG and <b>clip</b> <b>arts.</b>|$|R

Introduction The continuous evolution from a source object into a target object is generally known as metamorphosis, or morphing. Metamorphosis can produce compelling transitions between objects, and thus have numerous applications in scientific visualization and in animations in the film and advertising industries. Many morphing algorithms have been proposed. Some are based on two dimensional polylines or piecewise linear curves 7; 11; 14; 26; 27 [...] ...|$|R
50|$|To compete {{largely on}} quantity, some <b>clip</b> <b>art</b> vendors must produce or license {{new and old}} <b>clip</b> <b>art</b> {{collections}} in volume. <b>Clip</b> <b>art</b> marketed {{in this way is}} often less expensive but simpler in structure and detail, as is typified by cartoons, line art, and symbols. <b>Clip</b> <b>art</b> which is sold according to smaller, specialized subject genres tends to be more complex, modern, detailed, and expensive.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{companies}} such as Nova Development and <b>Clip</b> <b>Art</b> Incorporated also pioneered the marketing of large <b>clip</b> <b>art</b> collections in the late 1990s, including Nova's [...] "Art Explosion" [...] series, which sold <b>clip</b> <b>art</b> in increasingly large libraries up to a million images.|$|E

Besides apps and background images, ringtones are the major form of personalization. They are most often {{used to have a}} personal sound for incoming texts and calls. Furthermore, ringtones are used to identify the caller or sender of a message. In parts, this function is utilitarian (e. g., caller identification without looking at the phone) {{but it is also a}} form of self-expression (e. g., favorite tune as standard ringtone). We investigate how audio can be used to convey richer information. In this demo we show how sonifications of SMS can be used to encode informa-tion about the sender’s identity as well as the content and intention of a message based on flexible, user-generated mappings. We present a platform that allows arbitrary mappings to be managed and apps to be connected in order to create a sonification of any message. Using a background app on Android, we show the utility of the approach for mobile devices. Author Keywords Sonification; text messages; rich audible information...|$|R
