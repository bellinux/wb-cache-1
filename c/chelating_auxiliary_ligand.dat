Abstract: This {{thesis is}} focused on phosphino-urea ferrocene ligands that are still rather neglected in the literature. It describes the synthesis of novel polar amides and hydrazides of 1 '-(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene- 1 -carboxylic acid (Hdpf) with or without ethylene linker bearing various urea and guanidine terminal functional groups. Urea and guanidine derivatives with ethylene bridge can be prepared from Hdpf and appropriate amine with amidation agents. Phosphine ureas without the linker are accessible from reactions of primary amide of Hdpf with suitable acylation agents while analogical guanidine is obtained from guanylation of amide-amine generated from Hdpf acylbenzotriazole and ethylenediamine. Reaction of the acylbenzotriazole with free guanidine leads to [1 -(diphenylphosphino) ferrocenecarbonyl]guanidine hydrochloride. These ferrocene ligands were used to prepare four types of palladium(II) complexes, viz. where L denotes the newly synthesized ligands and LNC is 2 - [(dimethylamino) methyl]phenyl-C,N <b>auxiliary</b> <b>chelating</b> <b>ligand.</b> Catalytic efficiency of complexes with ethylene bridge was tested on reactions of aromatic [...] ...|$|R

A series of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> with electron-withdrawing substituents were synthesized to tailor the relative metal binding affinities of the ligands and thus directly influence the stabilities, and consequently the dissociation pathways, of the complexes.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades many {{different}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> systems have been utilized in the copper-catalyzed Ullmann amination reaction. However, there has been little consensus on the relative merits of the varied ligands and the exact role they might play in the catalytic process. Accordingly, in this work some of the most commonly employed <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> have been evaluated for C–N coupling using reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) methodology. The results reveal not only the relative kinetic competencies of the different <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> but also their markedly different influences on catalyst degradation rates. For the model Ullmann reaction between piperidine and iodobenzene using the soluble organic base bis(tetra-n-butylphosphonium) malonate (TBPM) at room temperature, N-methylglycine was shown to give the best performance in terms of high catalytic rate of reaction and comparatively low catalyst deactivation rates. Further experimental and rate data indicate a common catalytic cycle for all <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> studied, although additional off-cycle processes are observed for some of the ligands (notably phenanthroline). The ability of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand,</b> base (malonate dianion), and substrate (amine) to all act competitively as ligands for the copper center is also demonstrated. On the basis of these results an improved protocol for room-temperature copper-catalyzed C–N couplings is presented with 27 different examples reported...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe elucidation of {{flavonoid}} isomers {{is accomplished}} by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) via formation and collisional activated dissociation (CAD) of metal/flavonoid complexes containing an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand.</b> Addition of a metal salt and a suitable neutral <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> to flavonoids in solution results {{in the formation of}} [M(II) (flavonoid-H) ligand]+ complexes by ESI which, upon collisional activated dissociation, often result in more distinctive fragmentation patterns than observed for conventional protonated or deprotonated flavonoids.

40|$|AbstractThe use of pyridyl and {{polyether}} compounds as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> {{to promote}} metal complexation {{of a series}} of pharmaceutical analytes by electrospray ionization (ESI) is explored as an alternative to conventional protonation by ESI. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> vary in the number and nature of binding sites, the orientation of the binding sites with respect to each other, and the conformational flexibility of the ligand during complexation of the metal ion. The ESI of ternary solutions composed of a pharmaceutical substrate, a transition metal ion salt, and an auxiliary complexation agent generate metal complexes of the type [(L–H+) MII(aux) ]+, where L is the pharmaceutical, M is either copper, nickel, or cobalt, and aux is the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand.</b> Overall, the pyridine-type ligands are more useful for the generation of ternary metal complexes than the polyether-type ligands, which preferentially complex sodium ions and, upon collisional activation, undergo fragmentation of the polyether skeleton in addition to the structurally informative dissociation of the analytes. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> that exhibits the best performance is 2, 2 ′-dipyridine; its ternary metal complexes enhance the structural characterization of five of the pharmaceuticals by promoting a greater number of fragments relative to the CAD patterns of the protonated substrates...|$|R

It was found that both the absorption and emission characteristics could be tailored through the systematic variation of the electron affinity of the individual <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand.</b> This was shown to be the case regardless of the functional group at the end of the main ligand. Stokes shift and Raman spectroscopy was employed as a means to gauge the effect of ligand change on the conjugation and vibrational characteristics of the complexes.

The well-defined trends established elucidate the effect which variation of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> has on the electronic characteristics of the ruthenium polypyridyl systems.

DIG₃Tren is a guanidine based, tetradentate, tripodal ligand that binds to metals as an uncharged ligand. DIG₃Tren was modestly purified with a kugelrohr. [CoLOAc][OAc] has an acetate as its <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand,</b> while [CoL][BPh 4] 2 has an empty <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> binding site.

40|$|Reactions of alkyl-substituted {{aromatic}} monocarboxylic acids with first-row {{transition metal}} ions {{in the presence of}} chelating and bridging N, N-donor ligands produce a variety of discrete and polymeric complexes, depending on the position of the substituent on benzoic acid and the ability of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> to act as a chelating or a bridging ligand. The eleven different compounds isolated in the present study fall into two different structural types, viz., discrete mono or/dinuclear complexes ([Cu(L- 1) (2) (AL(1)) (H 2 O) ] (1), [Mn(L- 1) (2) (AL(1)) ](2) (2) and [Zn(L- 1) (2) (AL(1)) ](2) (3)) and polymeric compounds (4 - 11). The polymeric compounds isolated can further be classified into four different structural types, viz., 1 D helical polymers, linear 1 D polymeric chains, railroad-like polymers and 2 D polymeric sheets. The structure modulation {{is a result of the}} combination of the types of substituents on the aryl ring of the benzoic acid and the nature of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> used. For example, when 1, 10 -phenanthroline was used as the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> and the carboxylic acid used was 4 -tert-butylbenzoic acid, discrete complexes were isolated. However, for the same <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand,</b> when 2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoic acid was used, a series of 1 D helical polymers ([M(L- 2) (2) (AL(1)) (H 2 O) ](n); M = Mn (4), Co (5), Cu (6), and Zn (7)) were obtained. This clearly demonstrates the ability of o, o'-disubstituted benzoic acids to form helical polymers, whereas p-substitution on the aryl ring results in discrete complexes. The reactions of metal acetates with benzoic acid in the presence of 4, 4 '-bipyridine were found to be sensitive to the ortho substituents on the acid. When two equivalents of 2, 4, 6 -triisopropylbenzoic acid were used, a linear polymer ([Zn(L- 3) (2) (AL(2)) ](n) (8)) was obtained. The use of either one or two equivalents of 2, 4, 6 -trimethyl benzoic acid invariably leads to the isolation of railroad-like polymers ([M(L- 2) (OAc) (AL(2)) ](n); M = Mn (9) and Zn (10)) where the rails are bridged by the acetate ligand. Replacing the carboxylic acid by a phosphate diester leads to the isolation of a 2 D polymer ([Zn(L- 4) (2) (AL(2)) ](n) (11)) due to the ability of phosphate to act exclusively as a bridging ligand. In addition to extensive analytical and spectroscopic characterization of the products, the solid-state structures of all the new compounds were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction...|$|R

The molecular structure of [(η^ 6 -p-cymene) RuCl(OC_ 6 H_ 4 - 2 -CH_ 2 NHC_ 6 H_ 4 -p-Me) ] (1) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The complexes are found to be catalytically active for transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone to (±) 1 -phenylethanol {{in the presence of}} KOH and isopropanol showing percent conversion of 98 with the catalysts having a bulky substituent adjacent to the O- and N-donor sites of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand...</b>|$|R
40|$|Derivatives of {{barbituric acid}} show very {{interesting}} pharmaceutical properties unlike the barbituric acid that is pharmacologically inactive, {{due to the}} side group attached to the C 5 atom of the pyrimidine ring. One {{of the most common}} method used for the functionalization of barbituric acid is the Japp-Klingemann reaction which leads to arylhydrazones of barbituric acid (AHBAs). Their coordination chemistry is still a little explored area of research, notwithstanding their interesting chemical and structural features. Coordination compounds with such ligands are already known, most of them being copper and zinc complexes. 1 Therefore, here we report some novel complexes of Co(II), Cu(II) and Ag(I) containing AHBAs ligand and imidazole as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> (Scheme). Results toward their catalytic, antimicrobial and biological activities will be also discussed in this report...|$|R
40|$|Late metal metal-ligand {{multiple}} {{bonds are}} of interest due to their novel structural motifs {{and their ability to}} participate in group transfer reactions. Recent work has included the synthesis of new late transition metal imido complexes (M=NR or M≡NR) involving iron, cobalt and nickel. As part of our contribution to this area of research, we have prepd. a no. of cobalt imido complexes which feature the tripodal <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligand</b> [PhBP_ 3] ([PhBP_ 3] = [PhB(CH_ 2 PPh_ 2) _ 3]-); these imides were obtained via the oxidative degrdn. of org. azides. Addnl., a μ_ 2 - bridging nitride complex of cobalt was prepd. by two routes and the magnetic properties and bonding of this bimetallic complex will be discussed. Furthermore, the potential of these species to undergo group transfer chem. will be addressed...|$|R
40|$|The syntheses and {{catalytic}} behaviour of rhodium catalysts encapsulated in zeolites are reported. Several {{parameters are}} investigated in this catalyst sys-tem, including the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ligands</b> and the zeolite supports used. I t is demon-strated that the zeolite support can be crucial {{in determining the}} types of prod-ucts formed from catalytic hydroform-ylation reactions. The results are rationulised in terms of fundamental principles of organometallic chemistry. This enhances the understanding of these catalyst systems at a molecular level and demonstrates that a synergy exists between the development of new, efficient catalyst systems and understanding chemistry at a fundamental level. Many organometallic complexes are used successfully in homogeneous catalysis, and as catalysts they are highly selective and operate under relatively mild reaction conditions. However, the benefits of homogeneous catalysts can be compromised by a diacult separation o...|$|R
40|$|Sulfoximines have {{attracted}} attention {{due to their}} applicability as chiral <b>auxiliaries,</b> <b>ligands</b> in asymmetric catalysis, and building blocks in pseudopeptides. A number of approaches have been investigated for their synthesis, which allows the preparation of various derivatives in a relatively straightforward manner. In order to extend the research in this area, {{it is essential to}} develop methods, which make a wide variety of enantiomerically pure sulfoximine derivatives accessible. This thesis is mainly centered on the search of new synthetic methodologies and the improvement of existing ones in order to prepare a variety of sulfoximine compounds conveniently. The strategies for these intentions involve: (i) aryl substitution on sulfoximines by palladium-catalyzed cross coupling, (ii) a-functionalization of sulfoximines by palladium-catalyzed C-arylation, (iii) copper-mediated N-arylation of sulfoximines and (iv) silver-catalyzed or metal-free iminations of sulfoxides to afford sulfoximines...|$|R
