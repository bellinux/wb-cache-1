5|$|One of the {{earliest}} recorded incidents to affect the town was the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, since when various flood defences have been installed. In 1911 a <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> was built. After the Second World War, further additions to the defences against the sea were added by bringing part of {{the remains of a}} Mulberry harbour used for the Normandy Landings, and burying them in the sand. Today the town is defended from flooding by a large curved <b>concrete</b> <b>wall,</b> completed in 1988 following serious flooding in 1981. The wall runs along the Esplanade, and serves as the canvas {{for a wide variety of}} graffiti and street art.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the chalk}} cliff near the lower {{terminus}} collapsed in 1957, forcing the railway's closure while a strengthening <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> was built. The new wall reduced the lower terminus {{to a single}} length of track. The second track at Hereson Road was closed at the same time, and removed to build a short siding {{near the bottom of}} the tunnel for stabling the trains. The wooden station platforms were replaced by modern concrete structures.|$|E
30|$|The above review {{indicates}} that the behavior of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> under fire exposure {{is affected by the}} wall thickness, magnitude of in-plane and lateral loads, concrete strength, and reinforcement ratio. However, no studies are reported on the quantitative relationship between the wall thickness and fire performance of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
40|$|Lightly {{reinforced}} <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> {{are commonly}} found in low-to-moderate seismic regions such as Australia. While many theoretical analyses on lateral load-displacement of structural walls have been proposed and widely used, not many {{have been developed for}} lightly reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b> The lateral load-displacement behaviour and failure mechanism of lightly reinforced structural walls differ to those of heavily reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>walls,</b> particularly in terms of tension stiffening effects, possible failure mechanisms and drift capacities. An analytical study on lightly reinforced rectangular <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> is presented in this paper. A parametric study was conducted to provide initial insight into the effect of four design parameters (aspect ratio, axial load ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio and longitudinal reinforcement ratio) on the ultimate displacement capacity of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b> Two analytical models were developed to predict the lateral load-displacement behaviour of lightly reinforced walls consisting of a detailed wall model and a simplified wall model that provides a quick and conservative estimate for initial design checking purposes using displacement-based principles. Both models are shown to provide good agreement with experimental results in the literature...|$|R

5|$|The two-story IDF outpost sat {{northwest}} of the junction. Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay directly behind it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a Palestinian National Security Forces outpost {{under the command of}} Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the Palestine National Council. The <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost.|$|E
5|$|A <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> {{was built}} at the Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as a safety {{precaution}} and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at {{the ground in the}} summer of 1959, costing £14,500, a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the <b>concrete</b> <b>wall.</b> In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigation on macro encapsulated phase change material (PCM) incorporated in <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> of room models in real conditions. The focus {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of positions (externally bonded, laminated within and internally bonded) of macro encapsulated PCM in <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> on indoor temperatures and humidity levels of room models. Experimental results indicated that PCM models could adjust the indoor temperature and humility levels, however, its effectiveness was found to be greatly dependent on the position of PCM in <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b> The model with PCM laminated within the <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> showed the best temperature control and was effective in reducing the maximum temperature by up to 4 °C. Whereas, the model with PCM placed on the inner side of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> showed the best humidity control and reduced the relative humidity by 16 % more than the control model. Therefore, it can be concluded that PCM models are thermally efficient and by reducing the relative humidity they provide comfortable and healthy indoor environment. Moreover, it is shown that the application of PCM in public housing flat of Hong Kong is economically visible with a recovery period of 11 years...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the thermal behaviors of load bearing normal strength <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> with various thicknesses when one surface exposed to fire. In addition, the effect of preheating on the thermal behavior of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> is investigated to evaluate the effect of moisture content on the performance of the walls.|$|R
5|$|First on the {{schedule}} were the scenes on the Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas {{on the site of}} a derelict hotel which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted with in 1977 during the filming of The Spy Who Loved Me. In the scene, Bond drives a digger toward the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> {{across the}} barge lock was removed, {{but there was}} no {{intention}} to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the Council had invested over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, and the bottom gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, but only to , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the deep cutting between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the District Council in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E

50|$|Studcast {{walls are}} prefabricated, ready-to-erect, {{high-performance}} <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> that weigh {{half as much}} as standard <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b> A hybrid between architectural precast concrete and panelized light-gage cold-formed steel framing, studcast walls combine the best features of each material in a way nullifies each material's weaknesses. They have been widely used as an exterior and interior wall system for over a decade.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} costs related to the construction of low-rise, low-cost and social welfare housing was carried out. The study included three of the most commonly used structural systems for low-rise housing in Latin America, such as the traditional system of confined masonry <b>walls,</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> conventionally reinforced with welded-wire meshes and <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> reinforced with steel fiber. The cost comparison was carried out by budgets analysis, which were performed based on construction quantities, unit prices and particular items for each structural system. It was found in the study that, from an economic point of view, the systems of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> reinforced with welded-wire meshes or steel fibers are more advantageous than confined masonry systems. In addition, the integral comparison of the three structural systems demonstrates that the industrialized system of steel fiber reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> allows obtaining greater advantages of cleaning and sustainability, faster construction, lower cost and a more attractive scenario for builders investing in such projects...|$|R
5|$|Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover {{against the}} <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> in the {{south-east}} quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally {{across from the}} Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat {{on top of the}} drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation {{that he was going to}} make one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren were going to make two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the <b>concrete</b> <b>wall,</b> with debris flying into the path of the other drivers.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi {{is known}} from four places on Madagascar, all below 80m (260ft) altitude, of which two {{are on the}} west and two {{on the east side}} of the island. Among the eastern {{collection}} sites, Kianjavato is a rural town surrounded by farmland and secondary forests, where P.raceyi were collected while leaving a hollow in the <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> of a house and in a mistnet over a river, and Tampolo is in a heavily disturbed agriculturally used area. Both western localities, Kirindy and Mikea, are in dry forest. In Kirindy, the pipistrelle Hypsugo anchietae has also been recorded. The true distribution of P.raceyi is probably larger than that currently known. Nothing is known about the diet, but vespertilionid bats generally eat insects.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} opened as Westminster Bridge on 24 December 1868 by the steam-operated District Railway (DR) (now the District line) when the railway opened {{the first section}} of its line from South Kensington. It was {{originally}} the eastern terminus of the DR and the station cutting ended at a <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> buffered by timber sleepers. The approach to the station from the west runs in cut and cover tunnel under the roadway of Broad Sanctuary and diagonally under Parliament Square. In Broad Sanctuary the tunnel is close to Westminster Abbey and St Margaret's church and care was required to avoid undermining their foundations when excavating in the poor ground found there.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} <b>concrete</b> <b>wall,</b> with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on the flashing television.|$|E
5|$|What Were You Hoping For? was {{released}} on September 27, 2011, by Hunt's independent record label Godless Hotspot in {{a joint venture with}} Nashville-based distributor Thirty Tigers. It was distributed by RED Distribution. Thirty Tigers reached out to Hunt during 2009 and offered their distribution and marketing services to him pending the album's completion. He subsequently assembled a marketing team and Godless Hotspot. What Were You Hoping For? was executive-produced by music manager and executive Randy Jackson, who originally helped Hunt get his first major-label record contract in 2003. The album's cover is a photograph taken by Hunt in North Hollywood that depicts an elderly woman looking askance at a collection of white garbage bags set against a <b>concrete</b> <b>wall.</b> The interior packaging of the album also features Hunt's photography, including a kaleidoscopic collage of photographed subjects in the fold-out CD booklet.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav {{remained}} well offshore, the difference in pressure between it and a high pressure area over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11. Wind gusts ranged from 35–45mph (55–70km/h), with stronger winds reported near the coast. A maximum wind gust of 60mph (100km/h) was reported at Keansburg. The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, a man was killed when the upper section of a <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and injuring the other. Elsewhere, while there were reports of trees falling on vehicles, no other serious injuries or deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a <b>concrete</b> <b>wall,</b> and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains from the yard may start service on the northern track.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days. In some areas, flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Irene in 1999. At the post office in Loxahatchee, {{the parking lot was}} flooded, forcing the building to close for several days. A major washout was reported in West Palm Beach at the intersection of State Roads 80 and 882. Also in West Palm Beach, a road collapsed and fire rescue crews quickly closed the road. On State Road 704, a portion of it became inaccessible to low-clearance vehicles. A man died in West Palm Beach after driving through the storm and crashing into a <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> along Interstate 95. Several major and minor roads were also inundated by water in Wellington. Additionally, there was flooding at the intersections of Meadow Avenue and Greenview Shores Boulevard, and Indian Mound Road and South Shore Boulevard. Heavy rainfall left several leaking roofs at an apartment complex in Pahokee.|$|E
