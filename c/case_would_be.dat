He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} remanded to the Ninth Circuit, which {{declared}} the arbitration agreement unconscionable under California law.

5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> closed as resolved.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of class, {{kindergarten}} teacher Rebecca Adler (Robin Tunney) becomes dysphasic, falls to the floor, and experiences seizures. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) attempts to convince the curmudgeonly Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic, a task House loathes because the cases are usually simplistic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic.|$|E
5|$|With the {{assistance}} of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive search and rescue operation. American special agents from the FBI, fifty Dutch soldiers and three specially-equipped Dutch Air Force F-16 aircraft participated in the search. In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body. Her remains were not found. On December 18, 2007, Aruban prosecutors announced that the <b>case</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> closed without any charges made. The Aruban prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Van der Sloot, {{under the influence of}} marijuana, saying that Holloway died on the morning of her disappearance, and that a friend had disposed of her body. Van der Sloot later denied that what he had said was true, and in an interview said that he had sold Holloway into sexual slavery. He later retracted his comments. In 2012, Van der Sloot was convicted of the May 30, 2010, murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru.|$|E
