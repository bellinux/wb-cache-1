By 2016, the bank saw a record loss of 1.96 billion euros ($2.1 billion), caused by 2.94 billion euros in provisions for bad shipping loans. As a result, it took full control of its loss-making Bremer Landesbank (BLB) unit, which suffered particularly from a weak shipping market that was chipping away at its capital. Between 2016 and 2017, the bank unsuccessfully led negotiating on selling a $1.5 billion portfolio of shipping loans to KKR Credit and a sovereign wealth fund. By late 2016, NORD/LB still had about 8 billion euros in non-performing shipping loans in its books.
