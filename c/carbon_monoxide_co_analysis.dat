40|$|We {{report a}} chromatographic {{technique}} {{in which a}} vortex method of gas extraction and a thermal con-ductivity detector are used to measure carbon mon-oxide in blood. This method has the advantages of a small sample volume (100 l), a rapid analysis time (3 mm), ease of operation, and a high correlation with results of the standard gasometric method over the entire possible range (r = 0. 999). The accuracy of this method (coefficient of variation) for measur-ing CO in human blood samples was 1. 7 %. With it, dissolved CO can be accurately measured, as dem-onstrated by the Bunsen solubility coefficient for plasma CO by this method of 22. 0 ml of CO per liter of water per atm. (101 kN/m 2) at 24 #{ 176 }C(theoretical value: 21. 8). Additional Keyphrases: toxicology #{ 149 }vortex method of gas extraction e gas chromatography #{ 149 }gasometric method compared The need for rapid, accurate measurement of car-bon monoxide in blood has led to development {{of a wide variety}} of techniques (Table 1). The major dif-ficulty has been that the more accurate techniques (1 - 4) are also the most difficult and time consuming, whereas the simpler and more rapid methods (5, 6) are not as sensitive. A recent report of a National Academy of Sciences Committee (7) emphasizes not only the general inadequacies of the existing meth-odology for <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (<b>CO)</b> <b>analysis</b> in blood but also the need for development of an adequate technique for assessing the influence of low concen-trations of carboxyhemoglobin on human perfor-mance. Gas chromatography has proved to be a very accu-rate method for measuring blood gases, and several such techniques have been developed for CO (3, 8, 9). However, they involve long, cumbersome tech-niques for gas release and elution of these gases onto the chromatographic columns, the most common being the coupling of a manometric apparatus to the sampling valve of the chromatograph (8, 9).

40|$|Studying the {{emission}} ratios of carbonaceous aerosols (element carbon, EC, and organic carbon, OC) from open biomass burning helps to reduce uncertainties in emission inventories and provides necessary constraints for model simulations. We measured apparent elemental carbon (EC a) and OC concentrations {{at the summit}} of Mount Tai (Mt. Tai) during intensive open crop residue burning (OCRB) episodes using a Sunset OCEC analyzer. Equivalent black carbon (BC e) concentrations were determined using a Multiple Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP). In the fine particle mode, OC and EC showed strong correlations (r > 0. 9) with <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (<b>CO).</b> Footprint <b>analysis</b> using the FLEXPART_WRF model indicated that OCRB in central east China (CEC) had a significant influence on ambient carbonaceous aerosol loadings at the summit of Mt. Tai. ΔEC a /ΔCO ratios resulting from OCRB plumes were 14. 3 ± 1. 0 ng m − 3 ppbv − 1 at Mt. Tai. This ratio was {{more than three times}} those resulting from urban pollution in CEC, demonstrating that significant concentrations of soot particles were released from OCRB. ΔOC/ΔCO ratio from fresh OCRB plumes was found to be 41. 9 ± 2. 6 ng m − 3 ppbv − 1 in PM 1. The transport time of smoke particles was estimated using the FLEXPART_WRF tracer model by releasing inert particles from the ground layer inside geographical regions where large numbers of hotspots were detected by a MODIS satellite sensor. Fitting regressions using the e-folding exponential function indicated that the removal efficiency of OC (normalized to CO) was much larger than that of EC a mass, with mean lifetimes of 27 h (1. 1 days) for OC and 105 h (4. 3 days) for EC a, respectively. The lifetime of black carbon estimated for the OCRB events in east China was comparably lower than the values normally adopted in the transport models. Short lifetime of organic carbon highlighted the vulnerability of OC to cloud scavenging in the presence of water-soluble organic species from biomass combustion...|$|R
