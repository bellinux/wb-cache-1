5|$|However, {{even among}} Senate Republicans, there were {{conflicting}} views. Senators Arlen Specter and Lindsey Graham (the latter a former military prosecutor) indicated Congress would work quickly to authorize tribunals, while influential Senator John Warner suggested a cautious and deliberative response. The potential for Congressional action also provided an avenue for politicking, as Republicans threatened Democratic members of <b>Congress</b> <b>with</b> being labeled weak on terrorism {{if they did}} not authorize tribunals.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-nine delegates {{signed the}} {{finalized}} Constitution. Thirteen delegates left {{before it was}} completed, and three who remained at the convention until the end refused to sign it: Mason, Gerry, and Edmund Randolph of Virginia.

5|$|Through the 1920s and 1930s, Trotter {{subsided}} into a genteel poverty, {{using the}} Guardian {{as an ongoing}} voice of protest. He lobbied for anti-lynching bills in <b>Congress,</b> <b>with</b> limited success. Even when the House overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922, the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of the bill for three years running. (White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to {{the total population of}} the South, after having disfranchised blacks.) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees, which were established by seniority.|$|E

5|$|When General Andrew Jackson {{tried and}} {{executed}} two British agents during the First Seminole War in Spanish-held Florida, it precipitated the Great Seminole Debate of 1818–1819 in <b>Congress,</b> <b>with</b> some claiming he exceeded his orders from President James Monroe and demanding his censure.

5|$|Du Bois {{traveled}} to Europe in 1921 {{to attend the}} second Pan-African Congress. The assembled black leaders {{from around the world}} issued the London Resolutions and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois's guidance, the resolutions insisted on racial equality, and that Africa be ruled by Africans (not, as in the 1919 <b>congress,</b> <b>with</b> the consent of Africans). Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Wright {{was elected}} to his old seat in Congress as a Democrat, but {{with support from the}} small Greenback movement. In 1878, the {{situation}} was reversed: Wright ran as a Greenbacker, but was reelected with support by Democrats. He attracted attention in <b>Congress</b> <b>with</b> his proposal to amend the Homestead Act of 1862 to establish government loans to would-be settlers of the West, making it easier for landless Easterners to claim homesteads there. Congress was, on the whole, not receptive to Wright's proposal. Wright proposed it again in 1879 and emphasized the conservatism of his proposal, that it was a loan secured by the homestead, not a gift from the state; even so, the bill went down to overwhelming defeat. Despite his failure, Wright, like Weaver, had raised his profile as a potential presidential nominee by attempting to advance Greenback ideas in Congress.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{eight years}} after their last {{official}} series, South Africa hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after {{the dismantling of the}} apartheid system, and was only done with permission of the African National <b>Congress.</b> <b>With</b> their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final. After a tense final that went into extra time, South Africa emerged 15–12 winners, with then President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, Francois Pienaar.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s {{with the}} {{emergence}} of the United States's first political parties. Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration. But in the next decade, Jeffersonian Republicans sought political advantage over their rival Federalists by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author. Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole <b>Congress,</b> <b>with</b> Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it. But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.|$|E
5|$|The IIC was {{formally}} disbanded in November 1918. Most {{of its members}} became closely associated with communism and the Soviet Union. Bhupendranath Dutta and Virendranath Chattopadhyay alias Chatto arrived in Moscow in 1920. Narendranath Bhattacharya, under a new identity of M. N. Roy, {{was among the first}} Indian communists and made a memorable speech in the second congress of the Communist International that rejected Leninist views and foreshadowed Maoist peasant movements. Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Jawaharlal Nehru to affiliate the Indian National <b>Congress</b> <b>with</b> the league in 1927. He later fled Nazi Germany for the Soviet Union but disappeared in 1937 under Joseph Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E

5|$|The Restudy {{came with}} a plan to stop the declining {{environmental}} quality, and this proposal was to be the most expensive and comprehensive ecological repair project in history. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted through <b>Congress</b> <b>with</b> an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} National Congress of the CPC {{was held}} on 23–31 July 1921. With only 50 members {{in the beginning of}} 1921, the CPC organization and authorities grew tremendously. While it was originally planned to be held in the Shanghai French Concession, police officers interrupted the meeting on 30 July and the congress was moved to a tourist boat on South Lake in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province. Only 12 delegates attended the <b>congress,</b> <b>with</b> neither Li nor Chen being able to attend, the latter sending a personal representative in his stead. The resolutions of the congress called {{for the establishment of a}} communist party (as a branch of the Communist International) and elected Chen as its leader.|$|E
5|$|The main {{political}} parties are the Left Front and the All India Trinamool <b>Congress</b> <b>with</b> the Bharatiya Janata Party having limited support base along with regional parties like IPFT, INPT and the Indian National Congress.

During 1988–1993, the Congress and Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti were in a ruling coalition. In the last elections held in February 2013, the Left Front won 50 out of 60 seats in the Assembly, 49 of which went to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). As of 2013, Tripura {{is one of the}} two states in India where the communist party is in power. The other state is Kerala. Formerly, one more state—West Bengal—had democratically elected communist governments.|$|E
