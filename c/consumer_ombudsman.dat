500|$|In June 2006, the Consumer Ombudsmen in Norway, Sweden and Denmark {{challenged}} Apple's iTunes {{end user}} license agreement (EULA) through the Norwegian <b>Consumer</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> Bjørn Erik Thon, {{who claimed that}} Apple was violating contract and copyright laws in their countries. Thon stated that Apple's [...] "being an international company does not entitle [...] to disregard the laws of the countries in which it operates. The company's standard customer contract violates Norwegian law". An official complaint was filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council in January 2006, after which German and French consumer groups joined the Nordic-led drive to force Apple to make its iTunes online store compatible with digital music players made by rival companies. A French law allows regulators to force Apple to make its player and store compatible with rival offerings. The consumer protection regulators of Norway, Sweden, and Finland met with Apple in September 2006 in hopes of resolving the issues without litigation, but the matter was only resolved after Apple discontinued its FairPlay digital rights management (DRM) scheme.|$|E

40|$|This report {{seeks to}} {{describe}} <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen</b> {{as they have}} developed in the United Kingdom. The recent European Union Directive on Consumer Alternative Dispute Resolution (2013 / 11 /EU) defines consumer dispute resolution mechanisms in general, but does not distinguish between them individually. It does not, for instance, distinguish between <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen,</b> arbitrators and adjudication schemes. Other existing approaches to definition, such as the Ombudsman Association’s criteria for ‘ombudsman membership’, provide principles for ombudsmen in general, but do not distinguish between public <b>ombudsmen</b> and <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen.</b> Our task in this report, therefore, has been to describe the distinguishing features of <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen.</b> Our approach, rather than seeking to provide a definition, has been to describe the key characteristics of <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen</b> through comparison with other forms of dispute resolution and to situate <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen</b> within the broader consumer protection landscape. Our {{view is that the}} fundamentally hybrid nature of <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen,</b> combined with broader developments in the <b>ombudsman</b> and <b>consumer</b> dispute resolution landscape, have led to a lack of clarity and confusion in relation to the nature of <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen...</b>|$|R

40|$|Problems of {{cost and}} funding {{in the civil}} {{procedure}} system of England and Wales have made courts unaccessible to citizens and small businesses. A radical response has been proposed to address this crisis in a Report led by the Judiciary. It is proposed {{to make a major}} investment in upgrading the information technology (IT) of the court process, and to shift all claims up to £ 25, 000 into an online court. The online court would operate in three stages, with significant automated IT support, case management by case officers facilitating mediated solutions, and ultimately (in a fairly small number of cases) decisions by judges. The process is similar to that adopted in a number of <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsmen,</b> but significant questions arise over whether it will be adequate, or sufficiently attractive to users, given various other options that may be more attractive. An important ‘better regulation’ issue arises over how policy is best made...|$|R
2500|$|The term Green {{transport}} {{is often}} used as a greenwash marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance Norway's <b>consumer</b> <b>ombudsman</b> has targeted automakers who claim that their cars are [...] "green", [...] "clean" [...] or [...] "environmentally friendly". Manufacturers risk fines {{if they fail to}} drop the words. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) describes green claims on products as very vague, inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them. In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its green marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court as misleading.|$|E

25|$|Many of his government’s {{reforms were}} due to his Minister for Justice, John Maddison, and Attorney-General Sir Kenneth McCaw, who {{initiated}} {{the establishment of the}} Law Reform Commission of New South Wales, the introduction of <b>consumer</b> laws, an <b>ombudsman,</b> legal aid, health labels on cigarette packs, breath-testing of drivers, limits on vehicle emissions, the liberalisation of liquor laws, and compensation for victims of violent crime. There was also a new National Parks and Wildlife Service to assist environment conservation and protection. Despite these positive reforms, Askin's government maintained a brutal prison and corrective regime that was to culminate in the Bathurst Gaol riots in 1970 and 1974.|$|R

Topic Description: Congress is empowered by the Constitution to enact 2 ̆ 2 uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States. 2 ̆ 2 Congress has enacted comprehensive statutes governing bankruptcy, primarily {{in the form of the}} Bankruptcy Code, located at Title 11 of the United States Code.

This presentation will discuss the various unique issues that arise in the restructuring of a healthcare business, including the unique issues that arise vis-à-vis the federal and state governments, as well as with regard to not-for-profit entities...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{customer}} service (CS) and complaints handling (CH) {{performance of the}} Australian Internet Service Provider (ISP) industry {{has been the subject}} of intense scrutiny over the past few years. Internet industry stakeholders such as the <b>ombudsman,</b> <b>consumer</b> association, regulator and government authorities have considered tighter regulation as a response to address the industry 2 ̆ 7 s poor CS track record. This paper explores the role of external stakeholder pressures on the very large ISP (vlISP) industry that resulted in significant revisions to the CS/CH sections of Telecommunication Consumer Protection (TCP) Code. Qualitative research using eleven in-depth interviews with senior vlISP industry executives was conducted. Data analysis found that three key pressures (regulatory, customer, competition) influenced the revisions to the TCP code. Very few studies in the Australian context examine personal viewpoints of vlISP industry stakeholders to understand how and why vlISPs respond to such pressures. This is the first study that examines such viewpoints using an institutional theory lens. The study findings are: encourage vlISPs to collaborate with relevant stakeholders to manage expectations regarding CS/CH performance; provide valuable information for regulatory agencies, the consumer association and the complaints authority to develop an understanding of what pressures drive the changes required to enhance service improvements in areas where vlISPs under-perform; and assist external stakeholders to understand the types of pressures to which vlISP managers respond. The study findings will inform future quantitative studies to examine the influence of such pressures on the actual CS/CH performance of vlISPs...|$|R
