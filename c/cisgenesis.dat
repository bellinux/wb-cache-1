50|$|Generally, genetic {{modification}} entails manipulation of DNA. The process {{is known as}} <b>cisgenesis</b> when a gene is transferred between organisms that could be conventionally bred, or transgenesis when a gene from one species is added to a different species.

5000|$|<b>Cisgenesis</b> (from [...] "same" [...] and [...] "beginning") is {{one term}} for organisms {{that have been}} {{engineered}} using {{a process in which}} genes are artificially transferred between organisms that could otherwise be conventionally bred. Unlike in transgenesis, genes are only transferred between closely related organisms. However, while future technologies may allow genomes to be directly edited within an individual organism, currently nucleic acid sequences must be isolated and introduced using the same technologies that are used to produce transgenic organisms. The term was first introduced in 2000 by Henk J.

40|$|Modern plant {{breeding}} is {{highly dependent on}} new technologies to master future problems. More traits have to be combined, frequently originating from wild species. Traditional breeding is connected with linkage drag problems. The crop plant itself and its crossable species represent the traditional breeders gene pool. GM-breeding is {{a new way of}} improving existing varieties. Transgenes originate from non-crossable species and are representing a new gene pool. For release of GM-plants into the environment and onto the market in Europe Directive 2001 / 18 /EC has been developed, primarily based on GM-technology and not on gene source. In society, opposition against GM crops is complicating the implementation of GM crops. In this paper, it is shown that not only transgenes, representing a new gene pool but also cisgenes and intragenes are available, representing the breeders gene pool. Cisgenes are natural genes and intragenes are composed of functional parts of natural genes from the crop plant itself or from crossable species. <b>Cisgenesis</b> is the combined use of only cisgenes with marker-free transformation, mimicking linkage drag free introgression breeding in one step. Therefore, <b>cisgenesis</b> is a new sub-invention in the traditional breeding field and indicates the need for reconsideration of GM Directives. Inventions are frequently containing not only hardware elements, but also software and orgware elements. For <b>cisgenesis</b> it is foreseen that the technical (hardware) and bioinformatic (software) elements will develop smoothly, but that implementation in society is highly dependent on acceptance and regulations (orgware). It could be made in a step by step approach by specific crop-gene derogations from the Directive, followed by adding <b>cisgenesis</b> to annex 1 b of Directive 2001 / 18 /EC for exemption. At present GM crops can only be introduced by large companies.

40|$|There are {{two ways}} for genetic {{improvement}} in classical plant breeding: crossing and mutation. Plant varieties can also be improved through genetic modification; however, the present GMO regulations are based on risk assessments with the transgenes coming from non-crossable species. Nowadays, DNA sequence information of crop plants facilitates the isolation of cisgenes, which are genes from crop plants themselves or from crossable species. The increasing number of these isolated genes, {{and the development of}} transformation protocols that do not leave marker genes behind, provide an opportunity to improve plant breeding while remaining within the gene pool of the classical breeder. Compared with induced translocation and introgression breeding, <b>cisgenesis</b> is an improvement for gene transfer from crossable plants: it is a one-step gene transfer without linkage drag of other genes, whereas induced translocation and introgression breeding are multiple step gene transfer methods with linkage drag. The similarity of the genes used in <b>cisgenesis</b> compared with classical breeding is a compelling argument to treat cisgenic plants as classically bred plants. In the case of the classical breeding method induced translocation breeding, the insertion site of the genes is a priori unknown, as it is in <b>cisgenesis.</b> This provides another argument to treat cisgenic plants as classically bred plants, by exempting <b>cisgenesis</b> of plants from the GMO legislations...|$|E

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of existing plant breeding techniques, such as <b>cisgenesis,</b> allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar quicker and {{with little to}} no genetic drag. <b>Cisgenesis</b> is the genetic modification of a recipient plant with natural gene(s) from a sexually compatible plant.

Currently, both cisgenic and transgenic products are classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and are labeled as such in countries which require mandatory GMO labeling.

40|$|Plant {{breeding}} is {{a multidisciplinary}} scientific activity with tool development as driving force. It {{is clear from}} history that availability of genetic variation and selection methods are bottom lines for variety development. The genetic source of traditional plant breeding is restricted to domestication of traits from the so-called 'breeders' gene pool', consisting of crossable sources. Gene cloning and genetic transformation broaden the available genetic variation to genes from all living organisms. The so-called new genes in genetically modified organism (GMO) plants, consist of transgenes, with (chimaeric) genes from outside the 'breeder's gene pool'. Transgenic plants needed additional biosafety rules such as Directive 2001 / 18 EC. However, these are not needed after transformation of the four rol-genes from wild-type Agrobacterium rhizogenes. In the meantime, cloned cisgenes, natural dominant genes from 'breeders' gene pool', are available, enabling cisgenic crops after marker-free transformation, which extends plant breeding with traditional traits. From long-term experience, {{it is clear that}} traditional breeding with the 'breeders' gene pool' has a history of safe use. Different scientific committees concluded that cisgenic crops are as safe as traditionally bred varieties. So, <b>cisgenesis</b> is a powerful new tool for plant breeding with traditional traits as indicated in the potential examples on: (1) breeding for durable resistance to potato late blight and apple scab by R-gene stacking; (2) the new possibility to come to stacking of monogenic resistance alleles in wheat; (3) engineering of restoration of cytoplasmic male sterility by cloned restorer genes and of altering gametophytic incompatibility by introducing additional S-alleles; (4) increasing phytase activity by gene dosage effect in barley; and (5) the possibility of changing hormone metabolism in (fruit) trees leading to important morphological alterations.

Results We pursued a <b>cisgenesis</b> approach to introduce two broad spectrum potato late blight R genes, Rpi-sto 1 and Rpi-vnt 1. 1 from the crossable species Solanum stoloniferum and Solanum venturii, respectively, into three different potato varieties. First, single R gene-containing transgenic plants were produced for all varieties to be used as references for the resistance levels and spectra to be expected in the respective genetic backgrounds. Next, a construct containing both cisgenic late blight R genes (Rpi-vnt 1. 1 and Rpi-sto 1), but lacking the bacterial kanamycin resistance selection marker (NPTII) was transformed to the three selected potato varieties using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Gene transfer events were selected by PCR among regenerated shoots. Through further analyses involving morphological evaluations in the greenhouse, responsiveness to Avr genes and late blight resistance in detached leaf assays, the selection was narrowed down to eight independent events. These cisgenic events were selected because they showed broad spectrum late blight resistance due to the activity of both introduced R genes. The marker-free transformation was compared to kanamycin resistance assisted transformation in terms of T-DNA and vector backbone integration frequency. Also, differences in regeneration time and genotype dependency were evaluated. Conclusions We developed a marker-free transformation pipeline to select potato plants functionally expressing a stack of late blight R genes. Marker-free transformation is less genotype dependent and less prone to vector backbone integration as compared to marker-assisted transformation. Thereby, this study provides an important tool for the successful deployment of R genes in agriculture and contributes to the production of potentially durable late blight resistant potatoes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction of {{resistance}} genes from wild Solanum species into potato cultivars {{is considered the}} most promising and environmentally safe approach to achieve late blight resistance. An R-gene stacking breeding program using <b>cisgenesis</b> is planning to trial its products in China. To adapt this approach to local conditions, we propose to assess the allelic diversity of known avirulent genes of P. infestans from the intended introduction regions of the GM-potatoes in China. So far, we have a large (~ 100 isolates) and geographically diverse collection of P. infestans. We measured diversity in the isolates based on sequences and functions of several known Avr genes. The work relied on molecular and modern computer tools to examine {{the dynamics of the}} pathogen population structure and evolutionary relationships among different genotypes. We aim to give an ecological assessment of the Chinese population of P. infestans, which would be a guideline for the release of cisgenetic plants with stacked R gene...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cisgenesis</b> {{represents}} {{a step toward}} {{a new generation of}} GM crops. The lack of selectable genes (e. g. antibiotic or herbicide resistance) in the final product {{and the fact that the}} inserted gene(s) derive from organisms sexually compatible with the target crop should rise less environmental concerns and increase consumer's acceptance. Here we report the generation of a cisgenic apple plant by inserting the endogenous apple scab resistance gene HcrVf 2 under the control of its own regulatory sequences into the scab susceptible apple cultivar Gala. A previously developed method based on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation combined with a positive and negative selection system and a chemically inducible recombination machinery allowed the generation of apple cv. Gala carrying the scab resistance gene HcrVf 2 under its native regulatory sequences and no foreign genes. Three cisgenic lines were chosen for detailed investigation and were shown to carry a single T-DNA insertion and express the target gene HcrVf 2. This is the first report of the generation of a true cisgenic plan...|$|E
