The six-jump-cycle (6 JC) {{diffusion}} {{mechanism is}} {{used to analyze the}} behavior of vacancy-wind <b>factors</b> and collective <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> in partially ordered B 2 intermetallic compounds at stoichiometric and near- stoichiometric compositions. Expressions for the vacancy-wind factors are obtained in the framework of the four-frequency model where the two sublattices exist a priori. The phenomenological coefficients on the two sublattices that remain hitherto independent in 6 JC mechanism are connected through a microscopic detailed balance condition. The present results for collective <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> when compared with our earlier calculation based on taking the harmonic mean of the sublattice <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> show much better agreement with Monte Carlo simulation results. The collective <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> and tracer <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> are used to calculate the vacancy-wind factors. Our results for vacancy-wind factors agree qualitatively with the simulation data when the frequency ratio (α) of structural and antistructural atoms jumps decreases up to the order of unity...|$|R

Since the predominant point defects are cationic vacancies at high temperature and especially at high oxygen partial pressures in many spinels, the cations are considered to move primarily via cationic vacancies in this study. Several input parameters including the lattice size, the number of jumps per cation. etc., were optimized to calculate the <b>correlation</b> <b>factors.</b> Then the <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> of cations moving via vacancies in simple spinels were calculated in different types of exchange jumps, i. e., diffusion that occurs on tetrahedral or octahedral or both cationic sites.

40|$|Diffusion {{data for}} both {{principal}} directions of silicon and molybdenum {{as well as}} germanium are briefly summarised. Analysis is performed of the defect formation energies (available from previous ab initio calculations and experimental measurements) for diffusion mechanisms via home and foreign sublattices. The home sublattice mechanism is shown to be the preferred one for both silicon and molybdenum. Tracer <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> for silicon and molybdenum diffusion via sublattice vacancies in the respective sublattices of the tetragonal C 11 b structure of molybdenum disilicide are calculated by a direct Monte Carlo simulation technique. <b>Correlation</b> <b>factors</b> for Si diffusion on its sublattice are compared with literature values that were calculated using a more complicated Monte Carlo method based on the matrix approach. It is shown {{that there is no}} need for this complicated approach and that the direct Monte Carlo simulation technique gives highly accurate <b>correlation</b> <b>factors.</b> <b>Correlation</b> <b>factors</b> and anisotropy ratios of vacancy-mediated diffusion in both sublattices are deduced and compared with experimental data. Tracer correlation in the tetragonal direction is shown to contribute 0. 40 eV (i. e. over 55 %) of the migration energy of the corresponding Si diffusivity. Two possible jump rates for Si diffusion are separately estimated. Mo diffusion <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> are calculated using the direct Monte Carlo technique.

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{was employed}} to investigate <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> of atoms (f(A)) diffusing via vacancies in nanofilms possessing a simple cubic lattice that was selected as a model system. The <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> change significantly with varying the film thickness, as well as jump frequency ratios. When the film thickness is sufficiently large, f(A) approaches 0. 6531, a limiting value for the 3 D bulk lattice. As the film thickness is considerably small, f(A) converges to 0. 4669, a limiting value for the 2 D square lattice. A minimum of the factors, corresponding to 2 / 3 x f(A(3 D-SC)) (= 0. 4354), occurred in a specific nanofilm regime ranging from about 100 to 500 atomic layers, which was mainly due to confinement of atoms movement to nanofilms. <b>Correlation</b> <b>factors</b> of vacancy diffusion (f(v)) were also investigated and exhibited similar trend of {{the relations between the}} factors and the film thickness in a certain nanofilm regime.

Different groups use different methods, ranging from completely secular to explicitly spiritual. Some programs may advocate {{a reduction in the}} use of illegal drugs rather than outright abstention, although this is typically not a sustainable treatment plan in the long term. One survey of members found active involvement in any addiction recovery group correlates with higher chances of maintaining sobriety. The survey found group participation increased when the individual members' beliefs matched those of their primary support group (often people will be members of multiple addiction recovery groups). Analysis of the survey results found a significant positive correlation between the religiosity of members and their participation in twelve-step addiction recovery groups and SMART Recovery, although the <b>correlation</b> <b>factor</b> was three times smaller for SMART Recovery than for the twelve-step addiction recovery groups. Religiosity was inversely related to participation in Secular Organizations for Sobriety.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>correlation</b> <b>factor</b> based {{islanding}} detection method {{for use of}} grid-connected distributed synchronous generator. The proposed <b>correlation</b> <b>factor</b> method is based on voltage fluctuation injection, which can be obtained through regulating the field current of the distributed synchronous generator periodically. The <b>correlation</b> <b>factor</b> between the periodic regulating signal and the perturbed voltage is then used as an islanding detection index. When distributed synchronous generator is grid-interconnected, the <b>correlation</b> <b>factor</b> is lower than a threshold value. In contrast, as an islanding occurs, the <b>correlation</b> <b>factor</b> would become {{much higher than the}} threshold value. In this paper, experiments are conducted to illustrate the principles of the proposed technique.

40|$|A {{methodology}} concerning how {{to determine}} the <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> between individual long-term dynamic load components for the prediction of the combined total stress is presented. The combined stress in short-term sea states can be expressed by the square root of sum of squares of the load components with corresponding stress <b>factors</b> and relevant <b>correlation</b> <b>factors.</b> One of advantages for this formulation is that the <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> do {{not depend on the}} relative magnitudes of the individual stress components. The long-term stress is expressed by an equation similar in format to one derived for the shortterm sea states. The weighted average values of the <b>correlation</b> <b>factors</b> over wave scatter diagram entry and wave headings are defined as the long-term load combination factors. For illustration, the direct calculations of the load combination factors are performed for end longitudinal connections in the midship tank of a modern crude oil tanker. The calculation results show that the load combination factors for short-term sea states strongly depend on wave heading and average zero-up crossing wave period. For long-term multiple sea states, it is shown that the load combination factors are not sensitive to the selected probability of exceedance level. It is found, however, that the long-term load combination factors can be noticeably different depending on the cargo loading and environmental wave conditions.

Experimental results of measurements of dielectric permittivity are reported. The molecular <b>correlation</b> <b>factor</b> was obtained {{with reference to the}} Kirkwood-Fröhlich theory and compared with the Abbott-Bolton model for non spherical molecules from above the MP to 392  K. On going from low to high temperature, the <b>correlation</b> <b>factor</b> increases from 0. 2 to 0. 5 and this, together with the increase of the static permittivity, suggests that the number of dimers in the liquid phase decreases with increasing temperature.
