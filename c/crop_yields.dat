An estimated three-quarters of them settled in New York City, primarily in the Lower East Side. Over 75,000 of these immigrants were from Romania, where Jews faced antisemitic laws, violence and expulsion. These hardships, combined with low <b>crop</b> <b>yields</b> and economic depression, resulted in 30 percent of the Jews in Romania emigrating to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing <b>crop</b> <b>yields.</b> Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E
5|$|The Haber-Bosch {{method for}} synthesizing {{ammonium}} nitrate represented {{a major breakthrough}} and allowed <b>crop</b> <b>yields</b> to overcome previous constraints. It was first patented by German chemist Fritz Haber. In 1910 Carl Bosch, while working for German chemical company BASF, successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents. In the years after World War II, the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, {{in sync with the}} increasing world population.|$|E

5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. <b>Crop</b> <b>yields</b> peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{agriculture}} is {{heavily dependent on}} the monsoon {{as a source of}} water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water shortages, resulting in below-average <b>crop</b> <b>yields.</b> This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines. These include the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876–1877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the Bengal famine of 1943, in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic nitrogen, {{along with}} mined rock phosphate, {{pesticides}} and mechanization, have greatly increased <b>crop</b> <b>yields</b> {{in the early}} 20th century. Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced {{as a part of}} the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world. Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.|$|E
40|$|Depending on the {{descriptions}} of <b>crop</b> <b>yield</b> and social response to crop failure/harvest from Chinese historical documents, we classified the <b>crop</b> <b>yield</b> of North China during 601 - 900 AD into six categories and quantified each category to be the <b>crop</b> <b>yield</b> grades. We found that the regional mean <b>crop</b> <b>yield</b> had a significant (P < 0. 01) negative trend {{at the rate of}} - 0. 24 % per decade. The interannual, multiple-decadal, and century-scale variability accounted for similar to 47 %, similar to 30 %, and similar to 20 % of the total variations of <b>crop</b> <b>yield,</b> respectively. The interannual variability was significantly (P < 0. 05) persistent across the entire period. The multiple-decadal variability was more dominant after 750 AD than that before 750 AD, while the century-scale variability was more dominant before 750 AD than that after 750 AD. The variations of <b>crop</b> <b>yield</b> could be partly explained by temperature changes. On one hand, the declining trend of <b>crop</b> <b>yield</b> cooccurred with the climate cooling trend from 601 to 900 AD; on the other hand, the <b>crop</b> <b>yield</b> was positively correlated with temperature changes at 30 -year resolution with the correlation coefficient of 0. 59 (P < 0. 1). These findings supported that high (low) <b>crop</b> <b>yield</b> occurred in the warming (cooling) climate...|$|R

5|$|Hamurabi in {{particular}} is mostly known for its appearance in Ahl's book. The original game, a text-based strategy video game of land and resource management, was developed by Doug Dyment at DEC in 1968 as The Sumer Game. Dyment created it as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in <b>crop</b> <b>yields</b> and plagues. Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in 101 BASIC Computer Games as Hamurabi, and later versions of the game, even in FOCAL, referenced the new title over the old. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of solar energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve <b>crop</b> <b>yields.</b> While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed <b>crop</b> <b>yields</b> to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|In {{central and}} {{northern}} Italy and in Flanders, {{the rise of}} towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities {{on the shores of}} the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean. Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in <b>crop</b> <b>yields,</b> which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money.|$|E

5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce <b>crop</b> <b>yields</b> by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|Termites can {{be major}} {{agricultural}} pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing {{this is the}} greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, {{making it difficult for}} farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting <b>crop</b> <b>yields</b> and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of SAS began in 1966 after North Carolina State University re-hired Anthony Barr to program {{his analysis of}} variance and regression software {{so that it would}} run on IBM System/360 computers. The project was funded by the National Institute of Health and was originally intended to analyze agricultural data to improve <b>crop</b> <b>yields.</b> Barr was joined by student James Goodnight, who developed the software's statistical routines, and the two became project-leaders. In 1968, Barr and Goodnight integrated new multiple regression and analysis of variance routines. In 1972, after issuing the first release of SAS, the project lost its funding. According to Goodnight, this was because NIH only wanted to fund projects with medical applications. Goodnight continued teaching at the university for a salary of $1 and access to mainframe computers for use with the project, until it was funded by the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations the following year. John Sall joined the project in 1973 and contributed to the software's econometrics, time series, and matrix algebra. Another early participant, Caroll G. Perkins, contributed to SAS' early programming. Jolayne W. Service and Jane T. Helwig created SAS' first documentation.|$|E
