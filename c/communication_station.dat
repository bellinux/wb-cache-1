5|$|Two United States {{intelligence}} and communications facilities {{are located in}} Australia; the Pine Gap satellite tracking station near Alice Springs and Naval <b>Communication</b> <b>Station</b> Harold E. Holt near Exmouth, Western Australia. Pine Gap is jointly operated by Australian and United States personnel and Naval <b>Communication</b> <b>Station</b> Harold E. Holt has been an exclusively Australian-operated facility since 1999. In early 2007 the Australian Government approved {{the construction of a}} new unmanned US communications installation at the Defence Signals Directorate Australian Defence Satellite Communications Station facility near Geraldton, Western Australia. The United States Military also frequently uses Australian exercise areas and these facilities have been upgraded to support joint Australian-United States training. As well as these facilities, between 200 and 300 US Military personnel are posted to Australia to liaise with the ADF and in November 2011 the Australian and American Governments announced plans to rotate United States Marine Corps and United States Air Force units through bases in the Northern Territory for training purposes.|$|E

When these loops {{are used to}} synchronize the transmission rate of digital <b>communication</b> <b>stations,</b> the system is capable of operating in two modes: (1) In master-to-slave mode when the <b>communication</b> <b>stations</b> are connected by digital transmission facilities, and (2) In slave-to-slave mode when these stations are connected by analog transmission facilities...|$|R
40|$|A mobile {{telecommunication}} sector {{has experienced a}} rapid growth in Libya and Al-Madar Al-Jadid is one of largest companies providing services in this sector. Currently, PV systems are widely used for powering remote GSM <b>communication</b> <b>stations</b> {{in the country and}} number of Al-Madar Al-Jadid <b>communication</b> <b>stations</b> powered by such stand-alone PV systems was about 135 in 2009. A Simulink Matlab model was built to dynamically simulate the operation of the stand alone PV system powering one of Al Madar Al Jadid remote <b>communication</b> <b>stations</b> in desert conditions, taking into account variation of insolation and ambient temperature during a day. The results of mathematical modelling on the producible and produced power, charging and discharging battery power and the state of charge of the battery bank are in a good agreement with real experimental data recorded on the station {{with the use of a}} data-logger. Results obtained clearly indicated that the existing system, including PV panels and the electrical storage, is excessively large for the current electrical demand on the station and therefore could be reduced in the size by a factor of two...|$|R
500|$|Each of {{the three}} {{services}} has its own intelligence collection assets. RAN doctrine states that [...] "all maritime units" [...] contribute to the collection of intelligence {{and many of the}} RAN's ships are capable of collecting communications and electronic transmissions. The Collins class submarines are particularly effective in this role. The Army's intelligence and surveillance units include the 1st Intelligence Battalion, 7th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), three Regional Force Surveillance Units and the Special Air Service Regiment. The RAAF monitors the airspace of Australia and neighbouring countries using the Vigilare system, which combines input from the service's Jindalee Operational Radar Network, other ADF air defence radars (including airborne and naval systems) and civilian air traffic control radars. The RAAF's other intelligence assets include No. 87 Squadron and the AP-3C Orion aircraft operated by No. 92 Wing. A Space Situational Awareness capability is currently being installed at Naval <b>Communication</b> <b>Station</b> Harold E. Holt to allow the tracking of space assets and debris. Australia also provides personnel to the US Joint Space Operations Center in Colorado Springs which tracks and identifies any man-made object in orbit.|$|E
500|$|Olivia and an {{oblivious}} alt-Charlie visit Peter to {{take him}} to a safe location. Olivia knocks out alt-Charlie and reveals herself to Peter, informing him of the machine's real purpose and Walternate's intentions. Peter tells her that he does not belong in either reality, following which Olivia admits her romantic feelings for him and convinces him to leave with her. The couple race to meet Walter and Bell at the Opera House, where Fauxlivia and a team of Fringe Commandos catch up with them. Bell and Olivia hold off the assault while Peter and Walter set up the dimensional device to enable their return home. Lacking a fuel source for the device, Bell sacrifices himself to create a nuclear reaction, using his body's unstable molecular state. Close to death, Bell reveals that he removed Walter's memories at his own request, and he and Walter are reconciled. Olivia, Walter, and Peter return home. Peter tells Walter he will never understand him, but because Walter traveled to another universe twice to save him—which has [...] "gotta count for something"—he forgives him. Olivia is revealed to be Fauxlivia, infiltrating Our Side, when she arrives at a typewriter <b>communication</b> <b>station</b> to await orders. The Olivia from our world is then seen in a military detention center on the Other Side. Walternate visits and stares at Olivia without speaking before leaving her in the dark, in solitary confinement.|$|E
2500|$|The turbine {{generator}} {{consists of a}} series of steam turbines interconnected to each other and a generator on a common shaft. There is usually a high-pressure turbine at one end, followed by an intermediate-pressure turbine, and finally one, two, or three low-pressure turbines, and the generator. As steam moves through the system and loses pressure and thermal energy, it expands in volume, requiring increasing diameter and longer blades at each succeeding stage to extract the remaining energy. The entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and [...] long. It is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down (at 3 rpm) so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced. This is so important that it is one of only six functions of blackout emergency power batteries on site. [...] (The other five being emergency lighting, <b>communication,</b> <b>station</b> alarms, generator hydrogen seal system, and turbogenerator lube oil.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of Holt's death, a {{commemorative}} plaque was bolted to a reef at Cheviot Beach, approximately [...] underwater. There are monuments to Holt on the cliff above the beach and at the Melbourne General Cemetery, the latter featuring the inscription [...] "he loved the sea". In September 1968, a naval <b>communication</b> <b>station</b> in Western Australia was renamed in Holt's honour. The following year, his widow was invited to Los Angeles to launch the USS Harold E. Holt – {{one of only a handful}} of U.S. Navy ships named after foreign leaders. In March 1969, the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre was opened in suburban Melbourne. It had been under construction at the time of Holt's death, and the Malvern City Council voted to name it in his honour, in part because he had been the local member of parliament. The Australian Army also dedicated a swimming pool to Holt's memory – the Harold Holt Memorial Pool at the Australian base in Vũng Tàu, Vietnam.|$|E
