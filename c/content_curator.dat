40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to compare the {{development}} trends of information and communication environment, the global educational space and pedagogical ideas, which directly or indirectly affect the application of ICT in education. The study {{has been based on}} the foresight results and the content of the Internet publications on the prospects for sustainable development of education in the context of UNESCO Incheon Declaration for Education 2030. The content analysis of pedagogical publications has demonstrated that the current understanding of knowledge appeals to its socialization and dissemination in the global network environment, whose technological basis is rapidly growing. The educational process in the Learning Society is regarded as a distributed one among some formal education establishments (“universities of the world for one”) and the community of <b>content</b> <b>curators.</b> The function of <b>content</b> <b>curators</b> is to deliver comments, generalize and promote new information that supports learning needs of different global network users.

40|$|The media {{curation}} craze {{has spawned}} a multitude of new sites that help users to collect and share web content. Some market themselves as spaces to explore a common interest through different types of related media. Others are promoted {{as a means for}} creating and sharing stories, or producing personalized newspapers. Still others target the education market, claiming that curation can be a powerful learning tool for web-based content. But who really benefits from the curation task: the <b>content</b> <b>curator</b> or the content consumer? This paper will argue that for curation to fully support learning, on either side, then the curation site has to allow the <b>content</b> <b>curator</b> to research and tell stories through their selected content and for the consumer to rewrite the story for themselves. This brings the curation task inline with museum practice, where museum professionals tell stories through careful selection, organization and presentation of objects in an exhibition, backed up by research.

40|$|So {{many people}} are now using {{handheld}} second screens whilst watching TV that application developers and broadcasters are designing companion applications – second screen content that accompanies a TV programme. The nature of such dual-screen use cases inherently causes attention to be split, somewhat unpredictably. Dual-screen complexity, a clear factor in this attention split, is largely unexplored by the literature and will have an unknown (and likely negative) impact on user experience (UX). Therefore, we use empirical techniques to investigate the objective and subjective effect of dual-screen visual complexity on attention distribution in a companion content scenario. Our sequence of studies culminates in the deployment of a companion application prototype that supports adjustment of complexity (by either <b>content</b> <b>curator</b> or viewer) to allow convergence on optimum experience. Our findings assist the effective design of dual-screen content, informing content providers how to managedual second screen complexity for enhanced UX through a more blended, complementary dual-screen experience...|$|E
40|$|As a {{technical}} writer I {{have come to}} see that the collaborative media landscape has started to change the way many B 2 C companies work with support information. It is companies producing software based consumer products that has taken the lead in this new way of approaching the customers. More and more companies in other product segments are starting to go in the same direction. But what happens to the technical writer when more and more customers are creating their own support information? The death of the technical writer has been proclaimed for several years. It is no wonder that one asks: What is the future role of the technical writer facing the challenges with collaborative media? That is also the research question for this thesis. To investigate this I have experimented with a method called scenario planning and scenario writing. In order to get a well-grounded base of trends to create the scenarios from I’ve concluded a rigorous empirical base. The following methods where used:  In-depth interviews with practitioners in the technical writer field  Content analysis of a support forum  Email interviews with frequent forum users. It was clear that when implementing new media structures it also involves new challenges. These challenges could potentially also lead to new roles for the technical writer. The challenges I consider to be most important were; trust, transparency, motivation and information overload. To facilitate those needs and challenges roles like community manager, <b>content</b> <b>curator</b> and content strategist are needed. With those roles in mind I created four scenarios. Each with a different take on collaborative media (and one that actually ignored this emerge).

40|$|From the website: 2 ̆ 2 SEVENTEEN MOMENTS IN SOVIET HISTORY is a {{multi-media}} {{archive of}} primary materials designed to introduce {{students and the}} general public to the richness and contradictions of Soviet history. It provides a cross-section of Soviet life in seventeen different years, following the title of a beloved television spy serial from the seventies. Each module covers politics, society, culture and economics, so that users might experience a given time through the words, sounds and sights that a common Soviet citizen would have encountered. We hope the materials presented here help students understand the more complicated truth about Soviet history — that at all times life in the Soviet Union offered experiences of great good and great evil. Soviet citizens lived their lives and made their country’s history in circumstances of incredible peril as well as promise. The objective of this web site is to give users a sense of what this total experience was like, using the original words of the participants. THE ARCHIVE MAY BE ACCESSED BY YEAR OR BY THEME. Subject essays written by a contributing scholar provide brief introductions to over 200 subjects. These essays are supported by more than 1400 images, 270 video clips, music with translated lyrics, and over 600 primary texts, as well as links to relevant materials outside the website. The Glossary tab features a list of historical terms and abbreviations, and the Personages tab provides dates, photos and basic biographical information for over 600 people in Soviet history. SEVENTEEN MOMENTS IN SOVIET HISTORY WAS CREATED by James von Geldern (Macalester College) and Lewis Siegelbaum (Michigan State University) with generous funding from an educational development grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 1999 to 2002. In 2014, Amy Nelson (Virginia Tech) joined the team as <b>content</b> <b>curator</b> and web director. The original site was developed in collaboration with MATRIX, the center for digital humanities and social sciences at Michigan State University. MATRIX supports and hosts the current version of the site as well. Over its long history, the site has benefited from the expertise and support of many people: Krzystof Karski designed the original site; at MATRIX, Dean Rehberger and Bartek Plichta offered valuable advice for the organization of the tangle of Soviet history into a coherent and useable web site; Emilia Simeonova of Macalester College, together with Ward McKee and Meredith Roman of Michigan State University undertook important work in developing materials for the original site; in 2008 Christian Meister oversaw the first redesign of the site, which was supported by a research grant from Macalester College and private donations; since 2007, Kristin Edwards (Notre Dame de Namur University) has collected materials for the site from the Hoover Archives and Stanford Libraries.

40|$|Many memory {{institutions}} hold large {{collections of}} hand-held media, which can comprise hundreds of terabytes of data spread over {{many thousands of}} data-carriers. Many of these carriers {{are at risk of}} significant physical degradation over time, depending on their composition. Unfortunately, handling them manually is enormously time consuming and so a full and frequent evaluation of their condition is extremely expensive. It is, therefore, important to develop scalable processes for stabilizing them onto backed-up online storage where they can be subject to highquality digital preservation management. This {{goes hand in hand with}} the need to establish efficient, standardized ways of recording metadata and to deal with defective data-carriers. This paper discusses processing approaches, workflows, technical set-up, software solutions and touches on staffing needs for the stabilization process. We have experimented with different disk copying robots, defined our metadata, and addressed storage issues to scale stabilization to the vast quantities of digital objects on hand-held data-carriers that need to be preserved.

40|$|Our growing {{knowledge}} about various molecular mechanisms {{is becoming increasingly}} more structured and accessible. Different repositories of molecular interactions and available literature enable construction of focused and high-quality molecular interaction networks. Novel tools for curation and exploration of such networks are needed, in order to foster {{the development of a}} systems biology environment. In particular, solutions for visualization, annotation and data cross-linking will facilitate usage of network-encoded knowledge in biomedical research. To this end we developed the MINERVA (Molecular Interaction NEtwoRks VisuAlization) platform, a standalone webservice supporting curation, annotation and visualization of molecular interaction networks in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) -compliant format. MINERVA provides automated content annotation and verification for improved quality control. The end users can explore and interact with hosted networks, and provide direct feedback to <b>content</b> <b>curators.</b> MINERVA enables mapping drug targets or overlaying experimental data on the visualized networks. Extensive export functions enable downloading areas of the visualized networks as SBGN-compliant models for efficient reuse of hosted networks.

Its functionalities allow overlay of multiple information layers, facilitating exploration of content and interpretation of data. Moreover, annotation and verification workflows of MINERVA improve the efficiency of curation of networks, allowing life-science researchers to better engage in development and use of biomedical knowledge repositories...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} Digital Library Systems (DLSes) has evolved overtime, both in sophistication and complexity, to {{complement}} the complex nature and sheer size of digital content being curated. However, {{there is also a}} growing demand from <b>content</b> <b>curators,</b> with relatively small-size collections, for simpler and more manageable tools and services to manage their content. The reasons for this particular need are driven by the assumption that simplicity and manageability might ultimately translate to lower costs of maintenance of such systems. This research proposes and advocates for a minimalist and simplistic approach to the overall design of DLSes. It is hypothesised that Digital Library (DL) tools and services based on such designs could potentially be easy to use and manage. A meta-analysis of existing DL and non-DL tools was conducted to aid the derivation of design principles for simple DLSes. The desig n principles were then mapped to design decisions applied to the design of a prototype simple repository. In order to assess the effectiveness of the simple repository design, two real-world case study collections were implemented based on the design. In addition, a developer-oriented study was conducted using one of the case study collections to evaluate the simplicity and ease of use of the prototype system. Furthermore, performance experiments were conducted to establish the extent to which such a simple design approach would scale and also establish comparative advantages to existing designs. In general, the study outlined some possible implications of simplifying DLS design; specifically the results from the developer-oriented user study indicate that simplicity {{in the design of the}} DLS repository sub-layer does not severely impact the interaction between the service sub-layer and the repository sub-layer. Furthermore, the scalability experiments indicate that desirable performance results for small- and medium-sized collections are attainable. The practical implication of the proposed design approach is two-fold: firstly the minimalistic design has the potential to be used to design simple and yet easy to use tools with comparable features to those exhibited by well-established DL tools; and secondly, the principled design approach has the potential to be applied to the design of non-DL application domains...|$|R
40|$|Preservation and {{long-term}} access to research materials is often achieved through public/private collaboration between repositories of print collections and academic publishers who can compile and disseminate content in new formats, such as microform or {{a variety of}} new electronic means to enable scholarly enquiry that might otherwise be impossible.

40|$|Teaching and {{research}} are core functions of all research {{higher education institutions}} in which information is used to perform those tasks but also on strategic planning and management. The main goals of knowledge management at higher education institutions are: to improve knowledge creation processes performed by researchers, to improve knowledge transmission by teachers, to improve learning processes performed by students and to improve knowledge use on management activities that support all the processes above mentioned. Academic libraries have to face three important changes {{in the world of}} academic communication: first, the rise of full-text periodicals available on Internet that has multiplied the opportunities of free information access; the second is a consequence of Internet development which allows and promotes knowledge democratization; the third, is the Open Access Movement to knowledge. In this sense and in order to maintain their relevance and their values, academic libraries must fight for being able to provide the amount of information their users need through an efficient use of all the financial and human resources available in order to improve organizational performance. Also, technological evolution introduced a considerable amount of changes in the way of using, storing and disseminating information. As a consequence, the roles performed by libraries and librarians have been modified. Increasingly librarians assume the responsibility of managing organizational knowledge, namely in what concerns scientific and academic production. In this sense they must be considered as information workers, more specifically, as community managers and as <b>content</b> <b>curators.</b> By knowledge management we understand the creation, storage, share and reuse of information at the organizational level in order to achieve the organizations goals. Librarians have always been considered as professionals that, in a silent way, organize information so that users could have access to the information they need. Nevertheless, the advancement in ICT, the increase on the amount of information available through Internet, the challenges that Higher Education institutions are facing, {{not only in terms of}} quality but also of socioeconomic relevance of the activities they perform, the competitive environment in which they operate as also the need to make profitable the resources at their disposal, constitute an opportunity for librarians to make more visible their abilities, competences and capabilities in the field of knowledge management. This role is not difficult to be performed by librarians not only because they already own the abilities and competences needed to manage information but also because they are prepared to think strategically, this is, taking on oneself the organizations mission and global objectives. The establishment of Institutional Repositories (IRs) is an example of knowledge management projects side by side with the publication in open access journals, both initiatives framed by the Open Access Movement. This has to do with the improvement of the scholarly communication system and with the ease of access to scientific publications through the Internet. The diminishing of obstacles to the free flow of information assumes special relevance in the context of a Society that wants to be known as a Knowledge Society, as it facilitates the diffusion and visibility of research results allowing that public financing reverts on behalf of the society improving its economic, social, scientific and cultural development. We consider important to highlight that, in a study conducted by Markey (2007), published by the Council on Library and Information (EUA), the leadership responsibility of almost 90 % of the repositories in operation, in pilot or in project, belongs to librarians and libraries. To academic libraries and their professionals this leadership role in the implementation of IRs turns into the following benefits: the library and their professionals are understood as partners in the research carried out in the organization; they are appreciated by the other members of the academic community as they assure the preservation of the organizations intellectual memory; they deserve acknowledgement as they provide value added services; they also contribute to the improvement of the services delivered in terms of learning as they facilitate the access to scientific information and other data; they have a real participation in promoting the organizations’ image through the disclosure of the research developed at the institution; providing relevant information to top management. The participation of libraries and their professionals on initiatives and projects directed to the delivery of cross organizational information services constitutes a common practice in order to assure their participation in global scope innovation projects. Their participation in the implementation of IRs projects must be understood at this level. It demands the development of a set of relationships (formal and informal) at different organizational levels and it demands also that librarians have a clear and well defined idea about the organizational information system, about information flows and about the institutional strategy and not only about the role that the library must perform in it. Besides identifying the external information resources needed in order that the organization and its members may develop their teaching, learning {{and research}} activities, the library and its professionals are urged to participate or, in many situations, to assume the leadership of projects of information and knowledge internally produced. In this sense, we consider very important to determine Open Access consequences to academic libraries, namely its impact on information delivery, which changes must be operated in the delivery of those services, how these changes go side by side with others that are affecting the future role of academic libraries and how libraries and librarians help to solve practical questions issued by the Open Access Movement. We should not forget that the creation and implementation of a Repository follows a set of phases more or less planned that are the same followed by any change or organizational innovation project. It implies a technical/operational dimension and a behavioral and mindset dimension not less important. In this paper we also present some motivations that may be considered when deciding to create and install an Institutional Repository at higher education institutions, the different steps taken underlining probable obstacles and the communication/marketing strategies that can be used to overcome it.

40|$|The NIF Registry {{developed}} and {{maintained by the}} Neuroscience Information Framework is a cooperative project aimed at cataloging research resources, e. g., software tools, databases and tissue banks, funded largely by governments and available as tools to research scientists. Although originally conceived for neuroscience, the NIF Registry has over the years broadened in the scope to include research resources of general relevance to biomedical research. The current number of research resources listed by the Registry numbers over 13 K. The broadening in scope to biomedical science led us to re-christen the NIF Registry platform as SciCrunch. The NIF/SciCrunch Registry has been cataloging the resource landscape since 2006; as such, {{it serves as a}} valuable dataset for tracking the breadth, fate and utilization of these resources. Our experience shows research resources like databases are dynamic objects, that can change location and scope over time. Although each record is entered manually and human-curated, the current size of the registry requires tools that can aid in curation efforts to keep content up to date, including when and where such resources are used. To address this challenge, we have developed an open source tool suite, collectively termed RDW: Resource Disambiguator for the (Web). RDW is designed to help in the upkeep and curation of the registry as well as in enhancing the content of the registry by automated extraction of resource candidates from the literature. The RDW toolkit includes a URL extractor from papers, resource candidate screen, resource URL change tracker, resource <b>content</b> change tracker. <b>Curators</b> access these tools via a web based user interface. Several strategies are used to optimize these tools, including supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms as well as statistical text analysis. The complete tool suite is used to enhance and maintain the resource registry as well as track the usage of individual resources through an innovative literature citation index honed for research resources. Here we present an overview of the Registry and show how the RDW tools are used in curation and usage tracking...|$|R
40|$|The {{city and}} its monuments of art and {{architecture}} together form a great stage of memory,capable of conveying essential cultural and historical meanings across time. Memories are formed in the brain through sensory inputs, and due to the dominance of vision over our other senses, spatial images play an especially important role in our collective memory of the city. This Master’s thesis in Architecture explores the relationship of space, time and memory in the historical downtown of Helsinki, Finland. The thesis consists of two parts,a historical analysis of downtown Helsinki cityscape and a project formulated as response to the ideas and themes that surfaced in the analysis. The sea-facing urban facade of downtown Helsinki is widely recognized as a national landscape, a city tableau unrivaled in its symbolic and iconographic meaning for the city. Formerly a modest trading town formed around a shallow natural bay, the cityscape {{dates back to the}} 19 th century, when Helsinki was made the capital of Finland under the Russian Empire. 19 th century Helsinki was a work of art, and its citizens were part of that work. In time, life in the city caught up with its monumental settings: the analysis part of this Thesis unfolds the South Harbour cityscape as a multilayered set of meanings embedded in its structure over time. With its monuments of art and architecture exposed to widely varying appreciation throughout time, the cityscape appears as a complex process of both remembering and forgetting, a public picture constantly redrawn. Today, preserved as public heritage and protected from change and the ravages of time, downtown Helsinki has developed as an outdoor museum that operates on strong historical narratives, leaving little room for new memories or interpretations to be made. The thesis project imagines a temporal space overlapping with the historical city that links citizens in a reflection about the cultural construction of memory images, their own identity relative to the pictorial cityscape and their own agency {{in the construction of the}} memory of place. A series of ‘living pictures‘ are framed in the space of the historical city, the <b>curators,</b> <b>content</b> creators, performers and spectators of which are the citizens themselves. The historical city is renewed as a living institution of memory through the situated interaction between its monuments of art and architecture and people looking for and creating new meanings within their content...|$|R
