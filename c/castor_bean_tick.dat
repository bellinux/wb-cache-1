40|$|ABSTRACT To {{evaluate}} the photosynthetic efficiency, gas exchange and yield of <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> intercropped with peanut under Brazilian semiarid conditions, a field experiment {{was set up}} with six treatments and four replicates arranged in a randomized block design. The experiment consisted of the cultivation of <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> &# 8216;BRS Energia&# 8217; in a monocrop system and intercropped with peanut &# 8216;BR 1 &# 8217;. One treatment was formed by monocropped <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> and the others by the <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> intercropped with peanut with different intercrop establishment times, i. e. peanut sowing times (0, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days after <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> sowing). The <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> photosynthetic and carboxylation efficiencies {{were higher in the}} intercrop system with a 25 -day interval between sowings. Peanut sowing at 0 to 10 days after <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> sowing in the intercropped system affected the photochemical efficiency of the latter, which resulted in its yield reduction.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> (Ricinus communis L.), a {{monotypic}} {{species in}} the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae, 2 n = 20), is an important non-edible oilseed crop widely cultivated in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate countries for its high economic value. Because of {{the high level of}} ricinoleic acid (over 85 %) in its seed oil, the <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> seed derivatives are often used in aviation oil, lubricants, nylon, dyes, inks, soaps, adhesive and biodiesel. Due to lack of efficient molecular markers, {{little is known about the}} population genetic diversity and the genetic relationships among <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> germplasm. Efficient and robust molecular markers are increasingly needed for breeding and improving varieties in <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> The advent of modern genomics has produced large amounts of publicly available DNA sequence data. In particular, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provide valuable resources to develop gene-associated SSR markers. Results In total, 18, 928 publicly available non-redundant <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> EST sequences, representing approximately 17. 03 Mb, were evaluated and 7732 SSR sites in 5, 122 ESTs were identified by data mining. <b>Castor</b> <b>bean</b> exhibited considerably high frequency of EST-SSRs. We developed and characterized 118 polymorphic EST-SSR markers from 379 primer pairs flanking repeats by screening 24 <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> samples collected from different countries. A total of 350 alleles were identified from 118 polymorphic SSR loci, ranging from 2 - 6 per locus (A) with an average of 2. 97. The EST-SSR markers developed displayed moderate gene diversity (H e) with an average of 0. 41. Genetic relationships among 24 germplasms were investigated using the genotypes of 350 alleles, showing geographic pattern of genotypes across genetic diversity centers of <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> Conclusion <b>Castor</b> <b>bean</b> EST sequences exhibited considerably high frequency of SSR sites, and were rich resources for developing EST-SSR markers. These EST-SSR markers would be particularly useful for both genetic mapping and population structure analysis, facilitating breeding and crop improvement of <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously encoded small RNAs that post-transcriptionally {{regulate}} {{gene expression}} and play essential roles in numerous developmental and physiological processes. Currently, little {{information on the}} transcriptome and tissue-specific expression of miRNAs {{is available in the}} model non-edible oilseed crop <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> (Ricinus communis L.), {{one of the most important}} non-edible oilseed crops cultivated worldwide. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have allowed the identification of conserved and novel miRNAs in many plant species. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technologies to identify and characterize the miRNAs in <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> RESULTS: Five small RNA libraries were constructed for deep sequencing from root tips, leaves, developing seeds (at the initial stage, seed 1; and at the fast oil accumulation stage, seed 2) and endosperms in <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> High-throughput sequencing generated a large number of sequence reads of small RNAs in this study. In total, 86 conserved miRNAs were identified, including 63 known and 23 newly identified. Sixteen miRNA isoform variants in length were found from the conserved miRNAs of <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> MiRNAs displayed diverse organ-specific expression levels among five libraries. Combined with criteria for miRNA annotation and a RT-PCR approach, 72 novel miRNAs and their potential precursors were annotated and 20 miRNAs newly identified were validated. In addition, new target candidates for miRNAs newly identified in this study were proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The current study presents the first high-throughput small RNA sequencing study performed in <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> to identify its miRNA population.

40|$|IgE {{responses}} are closely regulated in non-atopic humans and low IgE responder animals. After an initial period of IgE production following antigen exposure, IgE synthesis {{appears to be}} actively suppressed. Inhalation of the dust of <b>castor</b> <b>beans</b> induces persistent IgE responses in atopic and non-atopic humans alike. This phenomenon was investigated in animals. Hooded Lister rats were immunized intraperitoneally with different preparations of <b>castor</b> <b>bean.</b> These had been heated for different lengths of time, 60 and 15 mins, to inactivate the toxin ricin. Immunization with as much as 100 micrograms of the extract heated for 60 min failed to produce an IgE response, while injection of 100 micrograms of the extract heated for 15 min produced a marked IgE response to <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> proteins. Thus the component of <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> extract which induces the IgE response appears to be heat labile. The IgE potentiating component in <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> was found to enhance IgE responses to other antigens such as ovalbumin and when 0. 8 microgram of an unheated <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> extract was administered together with an optimal dose of ovalbumin, there was {{a substantial increase in}} ovalbumin-specific IgE but not IgG in all animals. In addition, total serum IgE but not IgG increased up to 20 -fold. The effect of <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> was more sustainable than that of an established IgE-specific adjuvant, Bordetella pertussis, and was able to boost an IgE response that had diminished and maintain an ongoing IgE response when re-administered at weekly intervals. In addition, it was possible to reproduce the IgE potentiating effects with purified <b>castor</b> <b>bean</b> ricin at 25 ng/rat. The way that it produces this effect is not known but it is possible that ricin blocks the normal IgE suppressive mechanisms that regulate IgE responses...|$|R
