40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to issue an opinion on the {{proposal}} made by the applicant for reducing the minimum content of monensin sodium (Mo-Na) from Coxidin ® 25 % in complete feedingstuffs for turkeys from the current 90 mg kg- 1 to 60 mg kg- 1. Five floor pen studies on turkeys for fattening were provided by the applicant. In four studies, growth and feed to gain ratio was improved, after four weeks, by 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin® kg- 1 <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuff.</b> In the following four-week period, comparable effects could be observed for growth rate, but not for feed to gain ratio. Clinical endpoints, indicative for coccidiosis control, were with one exception (intestinal lesion score seven days after inoculation in two studies) not influenced. Coccidiosis in turkey is commonly milder than in chicken, this may contribute to explaining the lack of conclusive clinical data in these studies. Cumulative data (after 84 days for female and 112 days for male turkeys) showed positive effects for 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin ® kg- 1 <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuff</b> for growth and feed to gain ratio in one study, for feed to gain ratio and reduced mortality in another study, and reduced mortality alone in a third study. Based on these three studies, 60 mg Mo-Na from Coxidin ® kg-...|$|E
40|$|The work {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of the Milk thistle (used substance Silymarin) on the carcass yield of hybrid combinations rabbits Hyla. Hybrid combination Hyla was purposefully bred for meat performance, showing excellent results in breeding. Rabbits behave primarily on meat, because nutritional properties correspond to the current requirements of rational nutrition. Therefore, it is appropriate to increase the carcass yield. The average slaughter yield is indicated from 40 to 53 % according to the breed. It was found that the addition of milk thistle {{in the form of a}} powder in the <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuff</b> at a concentration of 0. 2 % increased the carcass yield, relative to the control group (which was fed only KKS), on average by 0. 4 %. The group with the addition of 1 % showed an average value of 1. 2 % higher than the group control. The average slaughter yield of all the groups ranged from 54, 68 into 63, 02 %. In both farms also decreased the incidence of diarrheal disease. Silymarin has a favorable effect on the operation and growth of the liver. In the group with the addition of 0. 2 % increased the average liver weight of 8. 1 g, in the group with a concentration of 1 % weight on average picked up about 10 g. The average weight of the liver varied from 111, 19 to 121, 20 g. The control group in the case of carcass yield and liver weight showed better results than the authors of their articles...|$|E
40|$|Ferrous {{sulphate}} heptahydrate is safe when supplied up to {{a maximum}} iron content per kilogram <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuff</b> of 450 mg for bovines and poultry, 500 mg for ovines, 600 mg for pets, and 750 mg for other species/categories, except horses and fish; for piglets up to one week before weaning a maximum of 250 mg Fe/day is considered safe. Because of insufficient data, the FEEDAP Panel {{is not in a}} position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin. Consumer exposure in the EU is not associated with a risk of excess iron intake to the general population. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel does not foresee any concern for consumer safety resulting from the use of ferrous sulphate heptahydrate in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum iron content in complete feedingstuffs is respected. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is an irritant and corrosive to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract; thus, handling of the additive poses a hazard to the user/worker. Considering the high background concentration of iron and sulphur in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate is an effective source of iron for all animal species and categories. The FEEDAP Panel recommends that the currently authorised maximum iron content in complete feed be reduced for bovines and poultry from 750 to 450 mg Fe/kg, and for pets from 1250 to 600 mg Fe/kg...|$|E
40|$|Bonvital is a {{preparation}} of {{a strain of}} Enterococcus faecium authorised for use in piglets and pigs for fattening, in sows and in chickens for fattening. The applicant is seeking the further authorisation of Bonvital for use in {{chickens reared for laying}} and minor avian species. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. The safety of Bonvital in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs)</b> in chickens reared for laying, safety for this animal category can be presumed. As the same dose is proposed for minor avian species, this conclusion can be extrapolated to minor avian species to point of lay. The strain is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. Bonvital is not irritant to skin and eyes. In the absence of data, it should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of Bonvital under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. The efficacy in chickens for fattening has been established in a previous assessment. Since the applicant proposes the use of the same dose (5  x 108 CFU/kg <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs)</b> in chickens reared for laying, the conclusion on the major species can be extended to this category. As the same dose is proposed for minor avian species and as the mechanism of action of the additive can reasonably be assumed to be the same as in the major species, efficacy in minor avian species to point of lay can be presumed...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} opinion on Biosprint, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on {{the efficacy of}} this additive when used in feed for cattle for fattening because of insufficient evidence. The European Commission has requested the European Food Safety Authority to re-evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} additive Biosprint® when used as a zootechnical additive (functional group: gut flora stabilisers) in diets for cattle for fattening at a minimum dose of 4. 0 × 109 and a maximum dose of 9. 0 × 109 CFU/kg <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> In the present application, the results of two new efficacy studies performed in cattle for fattening were presented. Both showed significant improvements in final body weight, average daily gain and feed to gain ratio in Biosprint®-treated animals. Taking into account the positive result from the initial application, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Biosprint® {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in cattle for fattening at the dose of 3. 6 × 1010 CFU/head per day approximately equating to 4 × 109 CFU/kg feedingstuffs...|$|R

It is presently authorised for use with chickens for fattening at a minimum dose of 1 x 107 CFU/kg of <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> The applicant is now seeking authorisation for use with chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening and ostriches. B. subtilis is a species that is considered by EFSA to be suitable for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment. The sensitivity to antibiotics {{and the absence of}} toxigenic potential qualified the strain for QPS status. On this basis the product can be presumed safe for chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening, and ostriches, for consumers of products derived from thes...|$|R

The additive is intended for use in turkeys for fattening at a dose range of 1250 - 2500 U kg- 1 <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked {{to deliver an opinion}} on the efficacy and safety for the target animals, the consumer, user and the environment of the product Danisco Xylanase G/L. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the safety aspects other than those related to the new target species are covered in the previous opinion and would not be affected by this extension of use. Therefore, the present opinion focuses only on the safety and efficacy of this enzyme preparation for the target species turkeys for fattening. Four experiments have been provided by the applicant to support the efficacy of the product. In two of them, significant improvements in weight gain and feed conversion were observed at the minimum recommended dose (1250 U kg- 1). The meta-analysis of the data from the four experiments supports the efficacy of the product at the minimum recommended dose...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of {{screening}} of mycotoxins in animal feed originating from the region of Vojvodina. Permanent screening is needed on all levels of production and storage, {{as well as the}} use of known methods to reduce mould contamination or toxin content in feedstuffs and feed. A total of 56 representative samples were collected from feed companies from the region of Vojvodina. Samples were collected during February 2009. The collected samples included 41 samples of feedstuffs (soybean, soybean meal, soybean grits, soybean cake, maize, sunflower meal, barley, wheat feed flour, rapeseed meal, dehydrated sugar beet pulps, alfalfa meal, yeast, dried whey, fish meal, meat-bone meal) and 15 samples of <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> The amounts of aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, fumonisin and deoxynivalenol were determined. Screening method for the analysis was done using Neogen Veratox® testing kits. The test itself is a competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CD-ELISA). Mycotoxins were present in 71. 4 % of the samples, but the values determined were below the maximum allowed limits for both Serbian and EC reference values. Zearalenone was found with the highest incidence (57. 1 % of samples), followed by ochratoxin A (37. 5 %), fumonisin (33. 9 %), deoxynivalenol (14. 3 %) and aflatoxins (3. 6 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on {{the efficacy of the}} product Levucell SC 20 /Levucell SC 10 ME (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for use as a feed additive for leisure horses. Levucell SC 20 /Levucell SC 10 ME is a preparation of dried cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CNCM I- 1077). It is intended for use as a zootechnical additive in feed for leisure horses at a dose of 3 x 109 CFU kg- 1 of <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> In its previous opinion on Levucell SC 20 /Levucell SC 10 ME for leisure horses, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was not able to conclude on the efficacy of the preparation because of insufficient evidence provided by the company. The applicant has now provided an additional study aiming to demonstrate that the effect of Levucell SC 20 for leisure horses corresponds to that for other ruminants, e. g. increase of fibre digestibility. Thus, the current opinion focuses on the assessment of that new study. Evidence that Levucell SC 20 is able to produce a significant improvement on fibre digestion was shown in one experiment in adult horses. This effect was consistent with the microbiological analyses of faecal samples, which showed a significant increase in gut cellulolytic bacteria associated with Levucell SC 20 supplementation...|$|R
40|$|Quinoline Yellow {{is applied}} as a {{colourant}} to add colour to feedingstuffs for non food-producing animals at the maximum dose of 500 mg/kg feed. In {{the absence of}} specific data, the safe feed concentration for non food-producing animals could be derived from an established no observed adverse effect level of a chronic rat study applying a safety factor of 100. The resulting maximum safe concentration was calculated for dogs and cats and was extrapolated to other non food-producing animals. The maximum safe concentration was 25 mg Quinoline Yellow/kg complete feed for all non food-producing animals. Since no information regarding dusting potential was available, it would be prudent to regard both the powder and the granulated forms as hazardous if inhaled. In the absence of data on irritancy and sensitisation, {{it would also be}} prudent to treat Quinoline Yellow as an irritant and skin sensitiser. Although, in principle, no efficacy data would be required for authorised food additives, if the intended effect in feed is the same as in food, evidence of an effect in feed is needed considering the variety of feed materials and the low safe level for target animals (25 mg/kg). In the absence of any information, the efficacy of Quinoline Yellow, with respect to the dose {{and the nature of the}} feedingstuffs and their processing, could not be assessed. The derived maximum safe concentration in <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> (25 mg/kg) was recommended as a maximum content of Quinoline Yellow...|$|R
40|$|Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is {{the trade}} {{name for a}} feed {{additive}} based on viable spores of a strain of Bacillus subtilis. This species is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to establishing safety for the target species, consumers and the environment. This approach requires the identity of the active agent to be established and the absence of toxigenic potential and resistance to antibiotics of human or veterinary clinical significance to be demonstrated. EFSA considered these issues and reported the results in a previous opinion {{on the use of the}} product in chickens for fattening. The applicant is now requesting the authorisation of the additive in diets for turkeys for fattening and turkeys reared for breeding at a dose of 1 × 108 CFU/kg <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> In the course of the former assessment, safety for users was also examined. In the view of the FEEDAP Panel, the use with these additional avian species will not introduce hazards not already considered. Therefore, in the current assessment, the FEEDAP Panel has considered only the efficacy data for turkeys for fattening and turkeys reared for breeding. Based on results of three trials carried out in turkeys for fattening, the Panel concluded that B. subtilis PB 6 has the potential to improve the zootechnical performance parameters at the dose of 1 × 108 CFU/kg feed. This conclusion can be extended to turkeys reared for breeding...|$|R
40|$|Orthophosphoric acid is commercially {{available}} as an aqueous solution at various concentrations, typically {{in the range}} 67. 0 – 85. 7 %. This assessment {{is based on a}} source of orthophosphoric acid that meets the purity criteria established for a food additive. Orthophosphoric acid is safe for all animal species when used as a preservative, provided that the optimal ratio of Ca:P is maintained. It {{is considered to be a}} source of available phosphorus in the diet. Its contribution to the phosphorus supply of animals must be considered when formulating diets or including it in water for drinking. As the maximum tolerable content of dietary phosphorus for all animal species is well known, setting a maximum content for the additive is not considered necessary. The supplementation of phosphorus from the additive to feedingstuffs will not raise safety concerns for the consumer. Orthophosphoric acid is a bulk industrial chemical and the hazards for those handling the substance are well known and documented. It is corrosive to the skin and eyes and should be considered as hazardous to the respiratory tract. As phosphorus from the acid will not add to the total dietary phosphorus content, the use of orthophosphoric acid in animal nutrition is not expected to pose an additional risk for the environment. As orthophosphoric acid is used in food as a preservative, and its function in feed is essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary. It is expected that orthophosphoric acid would have the potential to contribute to the preservation of liquid feeds and sustain the quality of water for drinking. The FEEDAP Panel has reservations about the effectiveness of any preservative, including orthophosphoric acid, in <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs</b> with a typical moisture content of ≤ 12 %...|$|R
40|$|Ingestion of gossypol, {{depended}} on animal species, age and sex, leads in loss of appetite, diarrhea, infertility, disrupted oestrus cycle in female animals, anemia, erythrocyte osmotic fragility, heart failure and many more. Toxicosis due to gossypol feeding is time and dose depended. The latest European Commission Directive {{has set up}} specific maximum limits for free gossypol in <b>complete</b> <b>feedingstuffs.</b> Cotton by-products are used widely but thoughtless in our country for the diet of small ruminants despite the possibility of toxicosis. The opinion that prevails between breeders is that {{with the increase of}} quantity of cottonseed or cottonseed meal in the animal feed they will increase also the milk production of sheeps and their fertility due to the big content in proteins. For this reason a lot of breeders prefer to feed the animals before their reproductive period with cottonseed or cottonseed meal in big quantities. The content of feedingstuffs in gossypol that were fixed by the European Union are not toxic for the organism of rams, but there is no data concerning the potential effect of gossypol on the reproductive system. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential effect of free gossypol content in cottonseed on the reproductive system of Chios rams. According to the requirements, two groups (control and treated) of 6 Chios rams, consisted of 15 -month old animals respectively, were employed throughout. Treated group were fed a meal with the presence of whole cottonseed and estimated to ingest an average 500 ppm free gossypol per day throughout the trial period of 6 months. The control group were fed a soybean meal free of gossypol for the same period of time. Both supplements were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Scrotal circumference, body weight gain and blood sampling for plasma testosterone determinations was carried out at 2 -week intervals; blood was drawn from each animal at 30 -min intervals for a total period of 6 hours. Semen collection was carried out every week in order to assess the "qualitative" and "quantitative" semen characteristics and the nuclear chromatin instability. Following the termination of the treatment period, all animals were sacrificed and testis, epididymis, kidney suprarenal glands and liver samples were collected for histopathological examination. Statistical analysis of the obtained data yielded the following results: 1. There was no difference is scrotal circumference or body weight gain between the two experimental groups. 2. Gossypol treatment had adverse effect on the "qualitative" semen characteristics (semen density, viability, sperm abnormalities) compared to control animals. 3. Gossypol treatment had no effect on the germ cells contained within the germinal epithelium. 4. Gossypol treatment had a destabilizing effect on nuclear chromatin of ram spermatozoa compared to control animals. 5. There was a significant difference for peak amplitude between the two experimental groups indicated that gossypol may had a negative effect on steroidogenic activity of ram testes compared to control animals. 6. Further research for the maximum safe time of gossypol feeding in rams must be conducted. In the mean time it is necessary to inform breeders for the possible effects of gossypol feeding in growing rams. ...|$|R
