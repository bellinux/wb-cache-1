25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a good thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E

25|$|Part One (Chapters 1 to 15): Gilbert Markham narrates how {{a mysterious}} widow, Mrs Helen Graham, arrives at Wildfell Hall, a nearby mansion. A source of curiosity {{for the small}} community, the reticent Mrs Graham and her young son, Arthur, are slowly drawn into the social circles of the village. Initially Gilbert Markham casually courts Eliza Millward, despite his mother's belief that he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better.</b> His {{interest}} in Eliza wanes as he comes to know Mrs Graham. In retribution, Eliza spreads (and perhaps creates) scandalous rumours about Helen. With gossip flying, Gilbert is {{led to believe that}} his friend Mr Lawrence is courting Mrs Graham. At a chance meeting on a road Gilbert strikes the mounted Lawrence with a whip handle, causing him to fall from his horse. Though she is unaware of this confrontation, Helen Graham still refuses to marry Gilbert, but when he accuses her of loving Lawrence she gives him her diaries.|$|E

Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman.

During her time as an international soccer player, she signed endorsement deals with Gatorade, Nike, Dreyer's Ice Cream, Pepsi, Nabisco, Fleet Bank, Earthgrains, and Powerbar. Hamm was featured on a Wheaties box following the 1999 World Cup and endorsed the first Soccer Barbie by Mattel. She co-starred with Michael Jordan in a popular television commercial for Gatorade which featured the two athletes competing against each other in a variety of sports while the song Anything You Can Do (I <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Better)</b> is heard. The commercial ends with Hamm throwing Jordan to the ground in a judo match. In 1997, she starred in a popular commercial for Pert Plus. In 2000, the video game, Mia Hamm Soccer 64 was released for Nintendo 64. It was the first game to feature female athletes only and sold a [...] "relatively high" [...] 42,886 copies in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Although he had alienated much of London's Jewish community, Livingstone denied {{charges of}} anti-Semitism, holding regular {{meetings}} with the city's Jewish groups and introducing public Hanukkah celebrations in Trafalgar Square in December 2005.

He refused to apologise to the Reubens at the time, instead offering [...] "a complete apology to the people of Iran for the suggestion that they may be linked in any way to the Reuben brothers". The GLA rejected the accusation of misconduct against Livingstone over the incident in June 2006, but he did make a general apology for causing offence to Jews in the previous few years in December that year.|$|E

Right now I am very much engaged in doing that through the internet. But, I believe we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better.</b> Right now, the program has changed to the Ron Paul Liberty Report, {{and that is what we}} do, we report on liberty in context of what is going on in daily activity and what is going on in the news."

Liz finds him to be annoying, but they continually run into each other, which leads them to believe they are meant to be together. However, after visiting the dentist office where they met, Liz and Wesley {{come to terms with the}} fact that the anesthesia was the cause of whatever they experienced, and agree to stop seeing each other. But when they run into each other yet again, Wesley suggests that they should probably just [...] "settle" [...] for one another. Liz is horrified at this prospect and consults Jack for advice, but he is still disconsolate at the prospect of [...] "settling" [...] for a company without upward momentum, and cannot help her. Later, Liz meets Wesley to tell him her answer is no, and she believes both of them <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than being with each other; she is further dismayed to learn he shares his name with actor Wesley Snipes.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many things we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better...</b> If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown {{said he did not}} want to hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than that." ...|$|E
