The PfPC was originally co-sponsored by the United States and Germany to work {{in the spirit of the}} Partnership for Peace Program [...] "to strengthen defense and military education through enhanced national and institutional cooperation."

[...] The principles are named after Yogyakarta, the city where the conference was held.

5000|$|During the Cold War the {{official}} {{position in the}} First World was that the <b>concluding</b> <b>document</b> of the Potsdam Conference was not an international treaty, but a mere memorandum. It regulated {{the issue of the}} German eastern border, which was to be the Oder-Neisse line, but the final article of the memorandum said that the final status of the German state and therefore its territories were subject to a separate peace treaty between Germany and the Allies of World War II. During the period from 1945 to 1990 two treaties between Poland and both East and West Germany were signed concerning the German-Polish border. In 1950 the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Poland signed the Treaty of Zgorzelec, recognizing the Oder-Neisse line, officially designated by the Communists as the [...] "Border of Peace and Friendship". On 7 December 1970 the Treaty of Warsaw between the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland was signed concerning the Polish western border. Both sides committed themselves to nonviolence and accepted the existing de facto border - the Oder-Neisse line. However a final treaty was not signed until 1990 as the [...] "Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany".|$|E

Women and children will be freed from lives of poverty, hunger, death, disease, and despair. We support the promotion of these goals and work {{to ensure that all}} members of society, including the unborn, benefit from their promotion and achievement". FFL's international director and UN representative Marie Smith cautioned, however, that [...] "women's advocates must unite and direct our full attention to addressing the unmet needs of women—life-saving health care and nutrition, eliminating poverty through education and work opportunities, protecting women and children from violence and exploitation. Abortion is a sign that women's needs have not been met, and women deserve better". [...] "While Feminists for Life was gratified that the <b>concluding</b> <b>document</b> of the Summit was not compromised by the insertion of 'sexual or reproductive rights' (code for abortion), we believe caution must be taken with language that was adopted into the document. The inclusion, 'Ensuring equal access to reproductive health' is problematic. While 'reproductive health' has never been defined by the members of the United Nations to include abortion, proponents of abortion often use a broad definition of this term that includes abortion as a part of fertility regulation." [...] "Political word games do not serve women. Word games distract us and delay our efforts to help those in greatest need".|$|E

40|$|From the introduction]. This paper {{examines}} the mechanisms and {{strategies of the}} EU in supporting the process of democratization in Central and Eastern Europe by concentrating on one particular area which seemed most significant {{in view of the}} escalation of ethnic conflict in the region. I focus on the influence of the EU’s representatives and institutions in inducing cooperation between states and ethnic groups within states for the purpose of minority rights expansion and implementation by means of the promise of integration. By definition, democratization includes " [...] . the processes whereby the rules and procedures of citizenship are either applied to political institutions previously governed by other principles [...] . or expanded to include persons not previously enjoying such rights and obligations (e. g. ethnic minorities, women, foreign residents, etc.) or extended to cover issues and institutions not previously subject to citizen participation (state agencies, military establishments, etc.) " (Schmitter and O'Donnell, 1986 : 8). As early as 1993, the European Council had devised specific criteria for the evaluation of a country’s preparedness to gain membership in the Union, and on par with the economic requirements were political conditions which outlined the road towards integration. The political conditionality for the Central and Eastern European countries’ membership was spelled out in the <b>concluding</b> <b>document</b> of the Copenhagen summit on 21 - 22 June 1993, where the European Council put forward what {{came to be known as}} the “Copenhagen criteria” for EU admission: “Stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. ” (1) While minority rights were never specifically listed or clearly outlined, I will demonstrate that through the statements of its representatives and the official reports European institutions have issued on the countries’ progress towards accession, the EU has continuously had an essential role in the expansion of minority rights...|$|E

40|$|Companies {{participate}} at {{the civil}} circuit by <b>concluding</b> legal <b>documents.</b> According {{to the principle}} regarding {{the separation of powers}} in the company's governance, a distinction must be made between the duties of the company's shareholders general assembly and the duties of the administrator.

Such legal documents are considered the documents of the company itself. From the perspective of the two management bodies, we can ask ourselves what is the applicable sanction when the shareholders general assembly decides to nominate a third person to represent the company for the signing of a legal document? From a certain point of view this represents an extension of the legal powers, throughout the legal documents of the company's bodies (including the shareholders general assembly's resolutions) and a breach of the exclusive duties of the administrative bodies of a company. The applicable sanction regarding such legal documents is non-existence of legal acts...|$|R
