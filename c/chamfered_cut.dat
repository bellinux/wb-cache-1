50|$|The precise {{load-out}} {{of tools}} may change {{according to a}} particular job's needs. The CAD stage is also optimised for turret punching: an operation such as rounding a corner may be much quicker with a single <b>chamfered</b> <b>cut</b> than a fully rounded corner requiring several strokes. Changing an unimportant dimension such as {{the width of a}} ventilation slot may match an available tool, requiring a single cut, rather than cutting each side separately. CAD support may also manage the selection of tools to be loaded into the turret before starting work.|$|E

50|$|When {{viewed from}} the top, metal {{counterweight}} is basically rectangular, typically with 45-degree angle <b>chamfers</b> <b>cut</b> at two opposing corners. A slot is cut into {{each end of the}} weight so as to enable the weight to straddle, and be laterally secured by, the arbor rods. In order to facilitate removal of weights with angle cuts, it is customary to stack the weights in alternating orientations so that the square corners of any weight will be aligned with the angled corners of adjacent weights. This simplifies removal because the square corners of each weight protrude beyond the angled corners of the weight below, serving as handles that can be easily gripped, even with gloved hands.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} {{experimental}} data {{in support of}} a modified theoretical model for quantifying the effect of cutting tool edge geometry on machining forces. A previously published slip-line model is simplified and extended to the case of turning. Several sets of machining experiments were run with custom-fabricated cutting inserts of varying edge hone radius and <b>chamfer</b> geometry. <b>Cutting</b> forces were measured using a dynamometer during cutting. Results show that varying edge geometry can have a major effect on cutting forces. The developed model effectively captures the edge phenomenon and its effect on cutting forces and also offers a glimpse of how the edge geometry can affect dynamic process damping...|$|R
50|$|Few {{commercial}} {{feature recognition}} systems are also available. Though feature recognition {{technology can be}} applied for various applications, commercial software have effectively adopted feature recognition technology for recreating the feature tree from imported models so that even the imported models can be edited {{as if it were}} a native solid model. Major 3D CAD modelers have Feature Recognition to convert imported 3-D models into native feature based models. CAM software and design for manufacturing software are also built using this feature recognition technology. Few CAD/CAM software have used commercially available third-party feature recognition library, which recognizes various features from 3-D B-Rep models. Separate libraries are available for Design, Manufacturing and Sheet metal applications. Design feature recognition library can identify features such as holes of various types, split holes, hole-chains, fillets, <b>chamfers,</b> <b>cut</b> extrudes, boss extrudes, drafted extrudes, revolved cuts, revolved bosses, ribs, drafts, lofts and sweeps are identified. Manufacturing feature recognition library provides recognition of manufacturing features such as simple holes, tapered holes, counter-bore holes, counter-sunk holes, counter-drilled holes, hole-chains, hole patterns such as linear, rectangular and circular patterns, fillets, chamfers, blind pockets, through pockets, drafted pockets, filleted and chamfered pockets, simple slots, drafted slots, filleted and chamfered slots, islands in pockets and slots, machinable volumes, machinable slabs, multiple intersecting features, axi-symmetric features such as external turned profiles, internal turned profiles, turned grooves such as vee and dovetail grooves, and mill-turn features such as slots and pocket in turned profiles. Sheet metal feature recognition library extracts features from a sheet metal perspective. Various features identified through this library include walls, bends, holes, cutouts, flanged holes, flanged cutouts, notches, open hems, closed hems, teardrop hems, rolled hems (curls), jog flanges, edge flanges, contour flanges, stamps such as louver, lance, bridge, dimple, beads, embosses and ribs. Though such commercial systems can identify a variety of features listed above, further research can be driven to identify feature types that are not identified by such commercial systems. Manufacturing features such as 3-axis and 5-axis feature recognition are generally not available in such commercial systems.|$|R

50|$|The Frank Reed Three-Decker is a {{historic}} triple decker house at 913/915 Main Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was built c. 1888 for Frank Reed, an electrician and machinist who eventually opened his own business. The house is a particularly elegant example of a Queen Anne triple decker. Its porch has square <b>cut</b> <b>chamfered</b> posts, is decorated with lattice work, and has a projecting gabled top. The right side bay is round with a conical roof section, and is clad in shingles cut in a wavy pattern. The deep cornice is decorated with brackets near the corners.|$|R
40|$|In aero engines a {{thermally}} sprayed abradable lining {{is applied}} {{to the inside of the}} casing in order to provide a seal around the tips of the compressor blades. As engines become more efficient the materials used must be able to endure higher temperatures and moving parts must be made lighter. This combination is not currently possible in late stages of the compressor as hard abradable materials can cause titanium blades to wear excessively. One solution to this is to add a surface treatment to the blade tips. Two surface treatments have been investigated, firstly cubic boron nitride (cBN) grits are bonded to the tip of the blade by electroplating. Secondly blades are coated in Cr(Al) N by cathodic arc deposition. The performance of these surface treatments is investigated on a test rig capable of monitoring the blade length, rub forces and abradable temperature during the test. Additional tests are performed against stepped coatings giving insight into the condition of the blade and abradable during the test. S. E. M., E. D. S., X. R. F., profilometry and wear debris have been used to characterise the wear mechanisms produced during the tests. Grit (cBN) tipped blades load with abradable material after a period of efficient cutting causing grit pull out and fracture. Flat Cr(Al) N coated blades failed due to thermal damage to the coating caused by adhesion of abradable material onto the Cr(Al) N coating, while <b>chamfered</b> blades <b>cut</b> efficiently at low incursion rates...|$|R
30|$|All {{subjects}} in this study were treated with KA TKA. The following sequence of surgical steps, caliper measurements and adjustments were used to achieve quality assurance in kinematically aligning the femoral and tibial components coincident to the native joint lines (Howell et al. 2017; Howell et al. 2013 b). Step 1 : Identify the distal femoral condyles with cartilage wear. Step 2 : Remove partial cartilage wear to bone. Step 3 : Apply a distal femoral referencing guide that compensates 2  mm thickness when cartilage is worn on the distal medial femoral condyle in the varus knee, and 2  mm thickness when cartilage is worn on the distal lateral femoral condyle in the valgus knee. Step 4 : Measure the thicknesses of the distal femoral resections with a caliper. Step 5 : Adjust the thickness of each resection to match the thickness of the condyles of the femoral component after compensating for cartilage wear and kerf to within[*]±[*] 0.5  mm. When the distal resection is 1 – 2  mm too thin, angle the blade in the saw slot and recut the bone using the ~ 1  mm thickness of the sawblade as a gauge. When the distal resection is 1 – 2  mm too thick, apply a 1 or 2  mm thick washer on the peg of the 4 -in- 1 chamfer block, which shims a corrective gap between the condyle of the femoral component and the distal femur. Step 6 : Position the 4 -in- 1 chamfer block by drilling holes through a posterior femoral referencing guide set at 0 ° rotation. Step 7 : Measure the thicknesses of the posterior femoral resections with a caliper before making the anterior and <b>chamfer</b> <b>cuts.</b> Step 8 : Adjust the thickness of each resection to match the thickness of the condyles of the femoral component after compensating for cartilage wear and kerf to within[*]±[*] 0.5  mm. When a posterior femoral resection is 1 – 2  mm too thick or too thin, eccentrically elongate the pin hole {{in the direction of the}} correction and translate the 4 -in- 1 chamfer block as needed. Step 9 : Secure the chamfer block in the corrected position with compression screws. Step 10 : Make the anterior resections and chamfer femoral resections. These caliper measurements and adjustments are quality assurance steps that align the femoral component coincident to the native distal and posterior femoral joint lines. Step 11 : Remove medial and lateral osteophytes. Step 12 : Apply a conventional extramedullary tibial resection guide to the ankle and place an angel wing in the saw slot of the guide. Step 13 : Adjust the varus-valgus angle of the tibial resection guide until the saw slot parallels the proximal tibial articular surface and the angel wing parallels the slope of the medial tibia after compensating for wear. Step 14 : Resect the proximal tibia. Step 15 : Measure the thickness of the medial and lateral tibial condyles at the base of the tibial spines. When one tibial condyle is thinner than the other by 1  mm or more, expect tightness in that compartment and slackness in the other when assessing varus-valgus laxity with trial components with the knee in full extension. Step 16 : When asymmetric laxity is observed, use a 2 ° varus or valgus recut guide to fine-tune the tibial resection until the laxity is 1 ° or less in full extension like the native knee (Roth et al. 2015). These caliper measurements and adjustments are quality assurance steps that the tibial component is coincident to the native proximal tibial joint line and co-aligns the components to the three rotational axes of the native knee (Howell et al. 2017; Howell et al. 2013 b).|$|R
5000|$|Penpol is a Grade II listed cottage, {{having been}} added to the listed {{buildings}} register on 20 July, 1987 as a [...] "particularly unspoilt seventeenth century house". The property has been considerably altered over the years but was originally erected in the mid-seventeenth century. It is built from rubble stone and has a cement-washed slated roof with gable ends and projecting chimney-stacks on each end. The front of the house has three nearly symmetrical windows and there are signs that there was a porch at one time. All the windows {{on the front of the}} house date from the twentieth century, with only the main door frame still with a seventeenth century lintel. At the rear, there are two seventeenth century lintels for windows, but one has been blocked up. The house has two rooms with a passage between, each heated by a fireplace with a granite lintel. The wall to the left of the passage is substantial but the partition to the right has been removed and the rear door blocked up. The beams supporting the upper floor are slightly <b>chamferred</b> and roughly <b>cut.</b> The left room has a twentieth century extension at the back. The staircase is probably twentieth century but occupies the same position as the original staircase. The upper floor and attic were not available for inspection at the time of listing.|$|R
