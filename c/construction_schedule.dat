5|$|Prince of Wales was {{originally}} named King Edward VIII but upon the abdication of Edward VIII {{the ship was}} renamed even before she had been laid down. This occurred at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 January 1937, {{although it was not}} until 3 May 1939 that she was launched. She was still fitting out when war was declared in September, causing her <b>construction</b> <b>schedule,</b> and that of her sister, , to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the late delivery of gun mountings caused delays in her outfitting.|$|E
5|$|Site {{preparation}} for L'Enfant promenade and plaza began in November 1965. Air rights over 9th Street SW were granted for a rent of $500 {{per year for}} 99 years on November 23, 1965. The actual groundbreaking for L'Enfant Plaza occurred on December 9 but the project was still hindered by delays. The federal government was building the James V. Forrestal Building at {{the northern end of}} L'Enfant promenade, and the whole northern end of the promenade and the associated roadway was a year behind its <b>construction</b> <b>schedule</b> by June 1967. Meanwhile, over-optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages meant L'Enfant Plaza Corp's building of the North and South buildings were six months behind projected schedules. The $23 million complex neared completion in January 1968, and the office buildings, plaza, and promenade opened to the public and businesses in June 1968. The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday, November 16, 1968.|$|E
5|$|The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 and the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 {{significantly}} increased tensions in Europe, which saw the dismemberment of large swaths of the Ottoman Empire. These conflicts provided the background {{for a major}} naval expansion program in Austria-Hungary, which received broad support in the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments. Admiral Anton Haus, then the Marinekommandant (Navy Commander) used the growing risk of war with Austria-Hungary's nominal ally, Italy, to push his construction program. As part of its construction program, the navy projected to build three cruisers, and adopted a secret <b>construction</b> <b>schedule</b> on 12 January 1914, which called for the first vessel to be laid down on 1 July 1914, followed by the other two on 1 July 1915. The first ship was projected {{to be completed by}} 31 December 1917, with the second and third following on 31 December 1918.|$|E
40|$|In <b>construction</b> engineering, a <b>schedule’s</b> input data, {{which is}} usually not exactly known in the {{planning}} phase, is considered deterministic when generating the schedule. As a result, <b>construction</b> <b>schedules</b> become unreliable and deadlines are often not met. While the optimization of <b>construction</b> <b>schedules</b> with respect to costs and makespan has {{been a matter of}} research in the past decades, the optimization of the robustness of <b>construction</b> <b>schedules</b> has received little attention. In this paper, the effects of uncertainties inherent to the input data of <b>construction</b> <b>schedules</b> are discussed. Possibilities are investigated to improve the reliability of <b>construction</b> <b>schedules</b> by considering alternative processes for certain tasks and by identifying the combination of processes generating the most robust schedule with respect to the makespan of a construction project...|$|R

5|$|By mid-1991, however, falling {{inflation}} {{had reduced}} WMATA's construction costs {{so much that}} the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money. WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its <b>construction</b> <b>schedule,</b> a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years. Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E
5|$|The report {{calculated}} the costs at 8.7 million kronor which corresponds in today's money to around $70 million (as of 2011), spent over a total <b>construction</b> <b>schedule</b> of one four-year period and two three-year periods. The cost was still considerably {{lower than that}} of many of the recently built or modernised fortifications on the continent; Belgium had spent the equivalent of 62 million kronor on the fortified positions of Liège and Namur along the Meuse while Romania had spent 63 million kronor to strengthen the defence of Bucharest and 16 million kronor on fortifications along the Siret River. In 1899, Rappe proposed to the Riksdagin line with the plans of the Fortification Committeethat construction of already existing fortificatory works in Sweden would commence, while the question on Boden would be postponed to the next year. The plan gained support from the first chamber but not from the second chamber, but when put to a joint vote of both chambers, the proposition passed. Even though the result did not really mean anything concrete for the possible construction in Boden, it was considered a great success for that question as well. During the last years of the century, the Riksdag's general attitude towards the army became more positive, most likely due to the increased Russification of Finland, increased tension in the Union between Sweden and Norway, and rumors that the Russian sawfilers that worked in Sweden also worked for the Okhrana, the secret Russian police.|$|E

25|$|The {{contract}} {{to build the}} stadium was issued the Nussli Group of Switzerland, which specializes {{in the construction of}} temporary stadiums. They used their NT grandstand system, which allowed for modular construction of stands. Construction implemented 2,500 tonnes of material. Nussli's senior project manager, Florian Weber, stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the construction was the occupancy permit, caused by the short <b>construction</b> <b>schedule.</b> Construction took 111 days, and was completed in late June 2010. Several commentators stated that use of temporary stadiums on a permanent basis could be used for other MLS and CFL stadia.

25|$|At first, {{the idea}} of two 35,000-ton running mates was {{considered}} to replace Ile de France and Liberté.

The idea of such a publicly funded liner was controversial, leading to raucous debates in the French parliament. The dealing lasted three and a half years, and though the letter commissioning the construction was finally signed by the Chairman of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Jean Marie, on 25 July 1956, debate about the form, cost and <b>construction</b> <b>schedule</b> for the France lasted a further year.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Rodionov, {{chief of}} the Department of Construction, {{estimated}} that the lead ship could be launched {{in the spring of}} 1906 and be ready for a shooting practice in the spring of 1907. By the end of 1903 this schedule was already broken by a confusion over working drawings. Both master builders (Skvortsov for the New Admiraly and Ratnik for Baltic Shipyard) complained about poorly executed drafts. Ratnik noticed that the bilge keels added by the NTC did not fit into existing drydocks of his yard. He again alerted the admirals of the inevitable overload and demanded redesign of belt armor to match the expected rise in waterline level. According to Skvortsov, the proposed technology called for unnecessary breaks in <b>construction</b> <b>schedule</b> because deck armor could only be ordered and made to measure after completion of underlying structure. He proposed replacement of armor deck with softer steel which could be cut on site, saving a whole year of idle time, but the NTC insisted on following the original plan.|$|E
