One <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Euclid's axioms were arrived upon in this manner.

Along with the forfeiture of the Albany Stewarts in the reign of James I, the destruction of the Black Douglases saw royal power in Scotland take a major step forward.|$|E
25|$|Status Planning {{suggests}} that a particular language or variety may be chosen for specific purposes and given official status.

In this view, one <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> language status planning issues are related to political issues as status planning focuses on legislative decisions that affect the reallocation of language functions. Language status can also mean the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.|$|E

The series is presented without explanation or narration as a showcase of surreal footage arranged around a single loose theme (expressed in the episode title) and blended without pause {{into a single}} continuous presentation.

Many audience members claim it caters to the [...] "trip-head" [...] community, offering LSD/DMT ready images.

500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 2010 Hungarian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello {{attempted}} to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight.

Barrichello said [...] "It is the most dangerous thing that I have been through", and [...] "There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it." [...] Schumacher said that [...] "Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, so I guess I just left enough space for him to come through." [...] Ross Brawn said [...] "at {{the end of the}} day he gave him enough space. You <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it was marginal, but it was just tough – tough racing." [...] A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there was no accident, the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 Nürburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that [...] "would have shown a better example to our young drivers". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the next race. Schumacher accepted the decision, and apologised.|$|E

2500|$|Proximate cause {{means that}} you {{must be able to}} show that the harm was caused by the tort you are suing for. The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a {{superseding}} intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. [...] A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.|$|E

2500|$|According to Human Rights Watch, [...] "Abortion is {{a highly}} {{emotional}} subject and one that excites deeply held opinions. However, equitable access to safe abortion services {{is first and foremost}} a human right. Where abortion is safe and legal, no one is forced to have one. Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, women are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or suffer serious health consequences and even death. Approximately 13% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually." [...] According to Human Rights Watch, [...] "the denial of a pregnant woman's right to make an independent decision regarding abortion violates or poses a threat {{to a wide range of}} human rights." [...] One <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> even though women die from unsafe abortion, the legalization of abortion is considered a human right violation since it supports a cause that deprives the unborn of their humanity, which must be respected, and therefore another solution is needed in order to avoid maternal deaths (e.g., psychological and physiological support during and after pregnancy) whilst also avoiding abortion. According to World Health Organization, 56 million abortions on average occurred worldwide each year in 2010-2014.|$|E
2500|$|... This {{theory is}} {{based on the fact that}} some of the {{foundation}} stock used by Cornelius Van Rooyen during the creation of the breed was sighthound stock. Support for this theory has grown in areas (most notably in the United States) where ridgebacks have been allowed to compete with sighthounds in lure-coursing field trials. The theory's detractors contend that success in lure coursing trials does not in and of itself make a dog a true sighthound, and further bolster their contention by pointing out that ridgebacks are very poor performers when allowed to run in unofficial open field courses where they typically cannot keep up with the true sighthounds. Even so, no one <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> ridgebacks have not been successful at lure coursing events. In fact ridgebacks have been very competitive in almost every lure coursing venue in which they have been allowed to compete. Proponents of this theory will often further defend it with a (debated) claim that while ridgebacks are versatile and use all their senses, their first and strongest inclination is to find game by sightwhich itself is considered normal for dogs of any type, when the game is actually in sight.|$|E
2500|$|Despite, and at {{the same}} time {{precisely}} because of, its claim of authority on the English language, the Oxford English Dictionary has been criticised since at least the 1960s from various angles. It has become a target precisely because of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes, its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence. The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement, University of Oxford linguist Roy Harris writes that criticizing the OED is extremely difficult because [...] "one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution", one that [...] "has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle". He further notes that neologisms from respected [...] "literary" [...] authors such as Samuel Beckett and Virginia Woolf are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less [...] "respectable" [...] sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the OEDs [...] "lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage", faulting the dictionary's prescriptive rather than descriptive usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as [...] "erroneous" [...] and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the [...] "social bias" [...] of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of [...] "erroneous and catachrestic" [...] usages is being removed from third edition entries, sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one <b>can</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna had to listen to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E

[...] "I {{can understand}} the artist who would rather be the man of action, the poet who would rather be the statesman or the warrior; though personally my sympathies are precisely the other way--with Wolfe who thought it a more glorious work, the writing of a great poem, than the burning of so many cities and the killing of so many men. We all serve the community. It is difficult, looking at the matter from the inside, to say who serves it best. Some feed it, some clothe it.
