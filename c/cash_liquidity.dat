50|$|Dynamic {{discounting}} offers suppliers {{the flexibility}} of discounting {{some or all of}} their receivables, eliminating the need to use high-cost financing options like factoring or asset-based lending to obtain <b>cash</b> <b>liquidity</b> and stronger balance sheet positions. It also mitigates the uncertainty surrounding the timing and amount of payments, allowing for superior cash flow forecasting capabilities. On the other hand, supplier financing can enable buyers to extend their payment terms with the injection of third party capital. These benefits accrue without adversely affecting trading partner relations. And interestingly, dynamic discounting is based on a buyer’s credit rating instead of being pegged to the supplier’s risk, further strengthening buyer-supplier relationships.|$|E

Only since 2001, thanks to institutional improvements, have the conditions been created in the Ministry of Finance for <b>cash</b> and <b>liquidity</b> management. Thus payments operations, previously {{in the hands of a}} government institution, were taken over by the banks; the financial operations of budgetary spending agencies were channelled via the Single Account of the Treasury; and government deposits were gradually transferred from numerous commercial banks to the Single Account of the Treasury in the Croatian National Bank and the state-owned Croatian Postal Bank. Unfortunately, however, the Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the Croatian National Bank, still carries out no operation of <b>cash</b> and <b>liquidity</b> management within the government Treasury system, nor does it operate on the money market with its surplus budgetary resources.

In particular, perceptions of a persistent reduction in market liquidity in a number of segments of global financial markets have raised questions about their potential vulnerability to financial disturbances.

The first section defines two closely related notions of liquidity, namely market and <b>cash</b> <b>liquidity.</b> The second explains the reasons for the growing interest in market liquidity. The third draws some lessons about the determinants of market liquidity from past episodes of market turmoil. It argues that for a proper understanding of liquidity under severe stress, the interaction of basic order imbalances with <b>cash</b> <b>liquidity</b> constraints and counterparty risk needs to be explained. Leverage and risk management play a key role. It also suggests that some factors that may contribute to liquidity in normal times can actually make it more vulnerable under stress.

Moreover, {{the increase in the}} cash saving rate after covenant violations is more pronounced among firms that are likely to be financially constrained, firms that have greater hedging needs, and firms that depend more on external finance. These findings are consistent with the argument that covenant violations lead to a tightening of external credit, which then causes firms to rely more on self-produced <b>cash</b> for <b>liquidity.</b> Additional tests suggest that this effect is not driven by other alternative explanations or selection bias.

This paper presents a research on holding companies. The aim is to analyse the reasons for and purposes of holding companies being established and the advantages they may bring to the owners trying to find out whether the level of association between the companies influences their performance. The research was carried out in two stages. First a questionnaire enquiry was made with interviews and, subsequently, financial ratios were quantified and their correlation investigated with the extent of efficient cash flow management. The correlation was expressed by Spearman’s rank coefficient. The benefits of creating a holding company were mostly found in the owners’ investment risk diversification, reduction of the capital invested, and improved negotiating position of a holding company. Also, a correlation was determined between the method of cash flow management and financing strategy (measured by net working capital – the value of Spearman’s coefficient is 0. 761849 in average and by ratio debt to assets – the value of Spearman’s coefficient is 0. 813525 in average), liquidity of companies (measured by <b>cash</b> <b>liquidity</b> the value of Spearman’s coefficient is − 0. 800436 in average) and performance (measured by return on assets – the value of Spearman’s coefficient is 0. 474 in average) ...|$|E
40|$|Bankruptcy {{has long}} been an {{important}} research topic in business. Despite extensive research bankruptcies still occur regularly for companies that fails to adapt to the market. An increasingly globalized society has increased the competition for Swedish companies, which now compete not only with each other but with companies from all around the world. While the business environment has become tougher, the opportunity to grow in new markets has flourished for those with an attractive business proposition. In order toavoid companies with high risk of bankruptcy and investment losses, external stakeholders are required new knowledge to understand how companies communicate. This study is quantitative in nature and focuses on identifying connections of the bankruptcy companies information signals. The sample consists of 105 companies in three different time periods, where the two most recent annual reports before bankruptcy are analyzed. Based on previous {{research in the area of}} bankruptcy and signal theory, eight hard and seven soft signals has been selected. The empirical material has been processed through correlation-, regression- and variance analysis. The results show that companies tend to weight the annual reports with positive signals, in an attempt to downplay the negative news and results. This by focusing on historically good results, or on the company’s potential and opportunities for returns in the future. Even when companies found themselves in a precarious financial situation, there have been more positive than negative signals. Of the eight hard signals the most significant indicators of the company’s financial condition are capital turnover, <b>cash</b> <b>liquidity</b> and solvency.

40|$|In May 2000 share repurchases were legalized in Sweden, {{with the}} purpose to provide {{companies}} with an efficient and flexible way to distribute capital. To buy back shares gives companies several benefits which are discussed in our study. The lack of academic research about this topic for Swedish companies gave us an incentive to provide knowledge specifically for this market. When companies announce a share repurchase program {{they are subject to}} uncertainty about the society’s reaction and economic consequences. Individuals within a well established organizational field deal rationally with uncertainty by adjusting to their institutional environment. The institutional environment can be defined as an abstract structure of regulations and behavioral norms that guide human’s decisions. This often leads to homogeneity in companies’ culture, structure and output. We ask the question if companies are realizing repurchase programs in a similar way over time, and if share repurchases have been developed as a more common used financial instrument since 2000. Our second question is if companies that decide to buy back shares pursue this under similar economic conditions as a result from becoming homogeneous. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe how institutional pressures in form of coercive, normative and mimetic isomorphism have affected companies’ decision to repurchase shares. We want to explain if there is an upward going trend of share repurchases, a standardized way to repurchase over time and if this decision can be determined by similarities in certain financial indicators of a company’s economic situation. To answer our purpose we used a quantitative research strategy with a deductive approach. The collected data was analyzed in a logistic regression analysis and by interpretations of descriptive statistics. We decided to examine for mimetic isomorphism public companies listed within the industrial sector on Stockholm Stock Exchange from the years 2000 - 2006. For the test of coercive and normative isomorphism with a logistic regression analysis we had to limit ourselves to investigate the years 2001 - 2003. In reality the three institutional pressures are working simultaneously and should together lead to a common perception about share repurchases among companies. For our testing we separated institutional isomorphism based on our theoretical preconceptions. This allowed us to analyze each individual institutional pressure and how they interact together. We defined mimetic isomorphism as companies adjusting their repurchase behavior to other companies within the industrial sector. Our result has not shown any indications of such a behavior concerning time, amount or frequency of the buybacks. Testing if certain financial indicators such as excess <b>cash,</b> <b>liquidity,</b> solvency, dividends, volatile operative income, prior year return, growth opportunities, companies’ size, ownership concentration, institutional and individual shareholders could explain stock repurchase activity gave us the possibility to evaluate coercive and normative isomorphism. But the question how institutional isomorphism affects companies’ repurchase decisions still remains unanswered. We have not found any certain financial indicator which motivates companies’ decision to buy back their own shares. The decision might therefore be carried out under very different economic conditions and with different objectives. In the industrial sector and generally in the whole Swedish market only a relatively low proportion of companies buy back shares. The stated findings for the Swedish market imply a need for further investigations over a longer time horizon and for a larger population. Further investigations in this topic which has the potential to provide recent insight into the stock repurchase decision for Swedish companies would enhance and verify our statements...|$|E
