40|$|An {{outbreak}} of encephalitis affecting 265 patients (105 fatally) occurred during 1998 – 1999 in Malaysia and {{was linked to}} a new paramyxovirus, Nipah, that infected pigs, humans, dogs, and cats. Most patients were pig farmers. Clinically undetected Nipah infection was noted in 10 (6 %) of 166 community-farm controls (persons from farms without reported encephalitis patients) and 20 (11 %) of 178 case-farm controls (persons from farms with encephalitis patients). Case patients (persons with Nipah infection) {{were more likely than}} community-farm controls to report increased numbers of sick/dying pigs on the farm (59 % vs. 24 %, P=. 001) and were more likely than case-farm controls to perform activities requiring direct <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs (86 % vs. 50 %, P=. 005). Only 8 % of case patients reported <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> pigs. The <b>outbreak</b> stopped after pigs in the affected areas were slaughtered and buried.

This surveillance was based on national mandatory reporting of STEC infections and the associated complication of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), as well as on data obtained from a questionnaire. Between the outbreak’s end (5 July) and 31 December 2011, a total of 33 post-outbreak cases were recorded. Post-outbreak cases occurred with diminishing frequency towards the year’s end and resembled the outbreak cases in many respects, however the proportion of HUS among all post-outbreak cases was smaller than during the outbreak. Two thirds of the post-outbreak cases were likely infected by <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> known <b>outbreak</b> cases. Both laboratory and nosocomial spread was noted in this period. No post-outbreak case recalled sprout consumption as a potential source of infection. The scarcity of information conveyed by the nonculture tests routinely used in Germany to diagnose STEC made linkage of post-outbreak cases to the outbreak difficult. Though post-outbreak surveillance demonstrated the outbreak strain’s potential for lengthy chains of transmission aided by prolonged shedding, our results and continued routine surveillance until the end of 2013 do not support the notion, that the outbreak strain has been able to establish itself in the German environment...|$|R

Almost half of the general outbreaks reported (137) occurred in long-term care facilities for the elderly, 51 outbreaks were recorded in hospitals and 31 occurred in the wider community.

The virulence of the North American WNV prototype strain (NY 99) in differ-ent avian species has been assessed experimentally in a number of studies [7 - 13] from which it is apparent that this strain is highly pathogenic for certain species of birds, notably – but not exclusively – Nearctic corvids [7].

40|$|Biochemical profiles, {{restriction}} endonuclease analysis (REA) and ribotyping {{were used to}} investigate a total of 38 Pasteurella multocida isolates from four separate outbreaks of pasteurellosis in Australian piggeries. Six isolates were obtained from Outbreak 1, 16 from Outbreak 1 and eight each from outbreaks 3 and 4. Outbreaks 1 and 2 were cases of pneumonic pasteurellosis while outbreaks 3 and 4 involved systemic pasteurellosis. Biochemical characterisation established {{that a number of}} different types of P. multocida were present in outbreaks 1 and 3 while outbreaks 2 and 4 were associated with a single type of P. multocida. Outbreaks 1 and 3 yielded isolates of P. multocida that belonged to the subspecies multocida and gallicida, with the subspecies multocida isolates being identified as biovar 3 (6 in total) or 12 (1 in total) and the subspecies gallicida isolates (7 in total) being identified as biovar 8. All 24 isolates from outbreaks 2 and 3 belonged to the subspecies multocida and were all biovar 3, REA and ribotyping showed that, in outbreaks 1 and 3, there were three different types of P. multocida in each <b>outbreak</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> common strains between the outbreaks. The molecular methods showed that only a single strain of P, multocida was associated <b>with</b> <b>outbreaks</b> 2 and 4, although the <b>outbreaks</b> were associated <b>with</b> strains that differed in REA profiles but shared a ribotype profile. This study has shown that both, systemic and pneumonic pasteurellosis can be associated with either a single strain or multiple strains of P. multocida. The results also indicate that the molecular typing methods of REA and ribotyping are superior to biochemical characterisation for epidemiological investigation of porcine pasteurellosis.

40|$|The present {{risk profile}} {{describes}} mainly {{the risk of}} introduction and spread of HPAI in Estonia. The release assessment has revealed five main scenarios, which {{may lead to the}} introduction of the HPAI virus. The probability of introduction of HPAI virus into Estonia by means of infected migratory birds is the highest (moderate) as bird migration is very intense in Estonia during the migration seasons. There is also a moderate probability of development of HPAI from circulating LPAI viruses in wild bird populations. The rest factors have a very low probability regarding virus release, provided that HPAI virus is not spreading in the regions surrounding Estonia, and the restrictions on imports of birds and poultry products from risk areas are followed. Exposure assessment shows that the probability of exposure of the local bird population is very high in case of introduction of HPAI by means of introduction of infected domestic birds into poultry farms or migration of infected wild birds (exposure of local wild population), as well as in case of transformation of LPAIV into HPAIV (exposure of wild population). The exposure of poultry flocks through indirect <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> initial <b>outbreaks</b> and the probability of the spread of the infection in the poultry population are moderate. The consequence analysis shows that the outbreak of HPAI of any scale among domestic birds would have at least serious economic consequences for Estonia causing an export ban of live birds and poultry products. In case of the wider spread of the disease in Estonia the economic consequences would be severe. The impact of an outbreak on animal health at the country level would be serious, whereas environmental consequences would be significant as well. Risk estimation. Although the overall probability of the outbreak of HPAI is low, the consequences of the outbreak would be serious or severe. As a result, the risk estimate for HPAI is moderate for Estonia...|$|R

40|$|A multi-locus {{sequence}} typing {{scheme was}} designed for the Corynebacterium diphtheriae group comprising C. diphtheriae, C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis. Five MLST genes (atpA, dnaE, fusA, odhA and rpoB) were analysed to resolve the inter-species relationships of the three organisms. No alleles were shared between the species and MLSA analysis indicated that they represent distinct populations with no evidence of recombination between the organisms. One hundred and fifty four C. diphtheriae isolates were analysed by MLST using the same five loci and two additional genes (dnaK and leuA). The data derived was in concordance with previous ribotyping studies and identified two clonal complexes associated <b>with</b> diphtheria <b>outbreaks.</b> <b>No</b> correlation between ST and toxin production or clinical presentation was observed. In contrast to the biovars gravis, mitis and intermedius the atypical belfanti strains were distinct by phylogenetic analysis. Although two C. diphtheriae cultures isolated from a horse clustered with the human strains four isolates obtained from two cats shared no alleles with the other isolates examined. MLST analysis of 69 C. ulcerans isolates using the five MLST genes and the virulence determinant phospholipase D (PLD) revealed that veterinary and human isolates were not genetically distinct. As with the C. diphtheriae population recombination was shown {{to play an important}} role in the evolution of the organism. The 73 C. pseudotuberculosis isolates were examined with the five MLST loci, pld and two genes within the Fe acquisition operon; fagCand fagD. The nitrate negative and positive strains were distinguished by MLST but shared ancestry was apparent as the same alleles were identified in two to three of the genes. MLST supported previous studies which indicate that C. pseudotuberculosis biovar ovis is a genetically homogenous species. This is the first MLST scheme designed for the C. diphtheriae group and the first to encompass multiple species within the Corynebacterium genus. MLST provides a useful tool for the discrimination of the three species and will enable the detection of genetic exchange events between and within the organisms.
