5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing {{it back into}} the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme <b>chitinase</b> produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} the genus as a truly {{carnivorous}} plant has been repeatedly put into question. In their natural habitat, all species have been observed playing host to live bugs of the genus Setocoris, which nourished themselves by eating prey caught by the plants. Following this discovery it was assumed that, as with the genus Roridula, the plants don't actually digest their prey themselves, rather relying on the bugs to do that. The plants, it was reasoned, benefited by absorbing nutrients from the excrements of the bugs, either through their leaves or through the ground. An indirect digestion of these nutrients by a <b>chitinase</b> producing fungus was even proposed. It wasn't until 2005 that direct digestion of insect prey by enzymes secreted by the sessile glands of B. filifolia was proven. Soon thereafter similar results were found with B. liniflora. These results clearly place this genus among the true carnivorous plants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this review}} is to present {{the current state of}} {{knowledge}} on plant <b>chitinases</b> and their regulation and function. <b>Chitinases</b> are up-regulated by a variety of stress conditions, both biotic and abiotic, and by such phytohormones as ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid. Like other PR proteins, <b>chitinases</b> play a role in plant resistance against distinct pathogens. Moreover, by reducing the defence reaction of the plant, <b>chitinases</b> allow symbiotic interaction with nitrogen-fixing bacteria or mycorrhizal fungi. However, recent investigations have shown that these enzymes are also involved in numerous physiological events. The involvement of <b>chitinases</b> in development and growth processes is also described...|$|R
30|$|Chitin can be enzymatically cleaved by {{two main}} enzyme classes: <b>chitinases</b> and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase. <b>Chitinases</b> (E.C. 3.2. 1.14) {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of the linear polymer β- 1, 4 linkages in chitin and chitooligomers {{resulting in the}} release of short chitooligomers. Depending on their cleavage pattern <b>chitinases</b> can be divided in endochitinases and exochitinases. Endochitinases degrade chitin from any point along the polymer chain forming random size length products while exochitinases cleave from the non-reduced end and the released product is (GLcNac) 2 (Seidl 2008). Fungal <b>chitinases</b> {{can be divided into}} three different subgroups, namely, A, B and C, based on the amino acid sequences of their GH 18 modules. These subgroups differ in the architectures of their substrate-binding cleft and, thus, their enzymatic activities (exo vs. endo) and also contain different carbohydrate-binding modules (Gruber et al. 2011; Seidl 2008). Horn et al. (2006) studying the chitinolytic system of the bacterium Serratia marcescens demonstrated another way to classify the enzymatic properties of <b>chitinases</b> by grouping them into processive and non-processive enzymes. Processive <b>chitinases</b> do not release the substrate after hydrolytic cleavage but slide it through the active site-tunnel for the next cleavage step to occur. The presence of a carbohydrate binding domain can enhance processivity, but is not essential for it. Non-processive <b>chitinases</b> dissociate completely from the substrate after hydrolysis.|$|R
30|$|<b>Chitinases</b> are {{encoded in}} a wide range of organisms {{including}} viruses, bacteria, fungi, insects, higher plants, and animals for different purposes such as nutrition, morphogenesis, and defense against chitin-containing pathogens [5 – 7]. Based on amino acid sequence similarity, chitinolytic enzymes are grouped into glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families numbered 18, 19, and 20. Bacterial <b>chitinases</b> are mainly from family 18, although some Streptomyces <b>chitinases</b> are from family 19. Family 20 includes the β-N-acetylhexosaminidases from bacteria [8, 9].|$|R
50|$|Although mammals do {{not produce}} chitin, they have two {{functional}} chitinases, Chitotriosidase (CHIT1) and acidic mammalian <b>chitinase</b> (AMCase), as well as chitinase-like proteins (such as YKL-40) that have high sequence similarity but lack <b>chitinase</b> activity.|$|E

Unfortunately, relationships between protein structure and capacity to induce the immune response have not been completely clarified yet, which precludes possible improvements in the diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of allergies. Plant <b>chitinases</b> constitute a good example of food allergenic proteins for which structural analysis of allergenicity has only been carried out partially. In plants, there are at least five structural classes of <b>chitinases</b> plus a number of chitinase-related polypeptides. Their allergenicity has been mostly investigated for <b>chitinases</b> of class I, due to both their higher prevalence among plant <b>chitinases</b> and by the high structural similarity between their substrate-binding domain and hevein, a well-known allergen present in the latex of rubber trees. Even if allergenic molecules have been identified for at least three other classes of plant <b>chitinases,</b> the involvement of the different structural motifs in the allergenicity of molecules has been disregarded so far.

30|$|<b>Chitinases</b> (EC 3.2. 1.14) are {{carbohydrate}} degrading {{enzymes that}} hydrolyze the β-(1  →  4)-glycosidic linkages in chitin, {{and are usually}} composed of a catalytic domain, one or more carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), and other modules, such as a fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain, but some <b>chitinases</b> have only a catalytic domain. Based on amino acid sequence similarity of the catalytic domain, <b>chitinases</b> are classified into two different families, GH 18 and GH 19, in the CAZy database ([URL] Lombard et al. 2014). They have different three-dimensional structures and act with different catalytic mechanisms (Iseli et al. 1996; Tews et al. 1997). In {{a wide variety of}} living organisms, <b>chitinases</b> degrade chitin, which serves as a nutrient that supplies nitrogen and carbon sources to the organisms. <b>Chitinases</b> and chitin-binding proteins also serve as virulence factors for bacteria pathogen to support the infection of non-chitinous mammalian hosts (Tran et al. 2011; Frederiksen et al. 2013).|$|R
