40|$|Changes in {{agricultural}} production {{methods have been}} associated with environmental pressure and a loss of natural habitats. This paper explores the extent to which farmer participation in off-farm work (an increasing phenomenon in most developed countries) changes the intensity of agricultural input use focusing, in particular, on fertilizer and <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> use. A sample selection model that accounts for both unobserved heterogeneity between farms and the potential simultaneity between farm operations and hours worked off-farm is estimated for 2, 419 farms in England and Wales. The econometric evidence indicates that the input intensity of products which have well-established links to environmental damage can increase as well as decrease. The results suggest that that fertilizer intensity may decline as off-farm labor increases while the use of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> per hectare increases as off-farm work increases.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For a <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> <b>product</b> {{to achieve}} its goal, the product must be applied and remain on the leaves until it is absorbed. This {{situation}} may be compromised due to rainfall after spraying, thus necessitating reapplication which increase the overall cost. Application technology {{research has focused on}} alternatives and solutions to mitigate this effect through the use of adjuvants. The objective of this research was to evaluate the deposit of spraying liquid on citrus seedlings using the products spirodiclofen, propargite, imidacloprid, lambda cyhalothrin, copper oxychloride, and copper hydroxide with water mixed with the adjuvants polydimethylsiloxane and phosphatidylcholine. Seedlings were subjected to simulated rains of 10 mm at intervals of 1, 6, 12 and 24 h after spraying, and the remaining deposits of spraying liquid per leaf area were analyzed by spectrophotometry by assessing a metallic marker previously added in the spraying liquids. Variables were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey's test (P< 0. 05). The rains that occurred soon after spraying resulted in decreased spraying liquids deposits on citrus leaves. Adjuvant phosphatidylcholine promoted the greatest retention of spraying liquid on citrus leaves after rainfall...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential of reduced application rates in apple trees {{as well as the}} potential of selective spray applications by using sensor-based tree detection techniques in Serbian fruit production. Their economical and biological effect was evaluated based on the quality and efficiency of the <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> and techno-economic analysis.

A two-year efficiency trial on Venturia inaequalis and Podosphaera leucitricha infecting apple also showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> results for different types of orchard application techniques and application rates.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the extent to which systems approaches to innovation are reflected in the <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> literature and how such approaches are used. A systematic literature review is conducted to study the relation between <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> and systems approaches to innovation in 107 publications. The analysis of the <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> literature demonstrates that only a small fraction is systems-oriented as compared to the bulk of publications with a technology-oriented approach. The analysis of agricultural innovations systems literature shows that, although <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> is addressed, the potential of this systems approach remains largely unexplored for <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> innovation. A large share of the publications included in this review focus on cropping or farming ‘systems’ while ‘innovation’ often equals the development, transfer, adoption and diffusion of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> technologies at farm level. There is relatively little attention for the institutional and political dimensions of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> and the interactions between farm, regional and national levels in <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> systems. The traditional division of roles and responsibilities of researchers as innovators, extension personnel as disseminators, and farmers as end-users, is challenged only to a limited extent. The majority of publications discusses ways to optimise existing features of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> systems, without exploring more structural transformations that may be required to enhance the resilience of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> systems...|$|R
