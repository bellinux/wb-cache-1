2500|$|Ducati is {{best known}} for {{high-performance}} motorcycles characterized by large-capacity four-stroke, 90° V-twin engines, with a desmodromic valve design. Ducati refers to this configuration as L-twin because one cylinder is vertical while the other is horizontal, making it look like a letter [...] "L". Modern Ducatis remain among the dominant performance motorcycles available today partly because of the desmodromic valve design, which is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> and lifter instead of the conventional valve springs used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a [...] "passive" [...] closing mechanism under the same conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Sliding {{friction}} between {{the surface of the}} cam and the cam follower which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the cam and follower are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant motor oils contain additives specifically to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve lifters slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the cam and follower are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new lifters on an old cam but never old lifters on a new cam. In some engines the followers have rollers which eliminate the sliding friction and wear but add mass to the valvetrain.|$|E
5000|$|These designs use an {{oscillating}} or rocking {{motion in}} a part <b>cam</b> <b>lobe,</b> which acts on a follower. This follower then opens and closes the valve. Some oscillating cam systems use a conventional <b>cam</b> <b>lobe,</b> while others use an eccentric <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> and a connecting rod. The principle is similar to steam engines, where the amount of steam entering the cylinder was regulated by the steam [...] "cut-off" [...] point.|$|E
25|$|The {{radial engine}} {{normally}} uses fewer <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> than other types. As with most four-strokes, the crankshaft takes two revolutions {{to complete the}} four strokes of each piston (intake, compression, combustion, exhaust). The camshaft ring is geared to spin slower and {{in the opposite direction}} to the crankshaft. The <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> are placed in two rows for the intake and exhaust. For the example, four <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> serve all five cylinders, whereas 10 would be required for a typical inline engine with the same number of cylinders and valves.|$|R
50|$|It was {{essentially}} a 4R with a DOHC head designed by Yamaha. The <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> activated the valves directly via a bucket over shim arrangement. This same arrangement was used on the 2M, 8R-G, 10R, 18R-G, 2T-G, 4A-GE and 3T-GTE engines (all designed by Yamaha).|$|R
50|$|The engine {{features}} hollow stainless-steel dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) with powder-metal <b>cam</b> <b>lobes,</b> pent-roof combustion chambers and shimless bucket tappets in the cylinder head. BorgWarner Morse TEC supplies the complete timing system which uses the company's proprietary silent timing chains. Continuously {{variable valve timing}} (CVVT) works on the intake side.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Coaxial two shaft {{combined}} <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> profile ...|$|E
50|$|For the {{camshaft}} shown, the minimum duration {{is the same}} as the original camshaft's, about 260°, and the maximum duration is 345°. The mechanism is a coaxial shaft arrangement where the outer shaft carries the main body of the <b>cam</b> <b>lobe.</b> The main body of the <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> is in its maximum duration form.|$|E
50|$|Roller rockers {{can also}} be used in {{overhead}} cam engines. However, OHC roller rockers generally have the roller {{at the point where the}} <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> contacts the rocker rather than at the point where the rocker contacts the valve stem. This helps to reduce <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> friction and wear in the same way as roller lifters on pushrod engines.|$|E
50|$|The LU3 also {{received}} a quiet cam to help reduce vibration at both idle and high engine speeds. This camshaft used the same lift and duration as the older design, but the cam was reprofiled to keep the valve lifters in full contact with the <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> as the <b>cam</b> ramps down.|$|R
5000|$|The unit {{construction}} of the Harley-Davidson Sportster, which has essentially been unchanged since its inception as the side-valve 750cc [...] "K" [...] Model in 1952, was retained with the Evolution engine upgrade in 1986, resulting in a unique valve train configuration. Unlike almost any other engine in production today, the Sportster Evolution uses one cam per engine overhead valve, resulting in four individual, single-lobe, gear-driven camshafts. The <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> are thus all located one behind another, and pushrods are arrayed in pairs (front and rear) parallel to the cylinder axis as a result. This allows each lifter and pushrod to deflect from the <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> perpendicular to the lobe plane. This configuration is friendly to radical, high-output cams, making the Sportster Evolution a natural choice for the once Harley-Davidson owned line of Buell Motorcycle Company sportbikes from 1986 up to late 2009 (2010 model year).|$|R
25|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines with pistons, the camshaft {{is used to}} operate poppet valves. It consists of a cylindrical rod running {{the length of the}} cylinder bank with a number of oblong lobes protruding from it, one for each valve. The <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> force the valves open by pressing on the valve, or on some intermediate mechanism, as they rotate.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{cam drive}} of a Ford I4 DOHC engine, showing the tappet {{just under the}} <b>cam</b> <b>lobe.</b>|$|E
50|$|This system {{consists}} of a <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> that varies along its length (similar to a cone shape). One end of the <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> has a short duration/reduced lift profile, and the other end has a longer duration/greater lift profile. In between, the lobe provides a smooth transition between these two profiles. By shifting area of the <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> which is {{in contact with the}} follower, the lift and duration can be continuously altered. This is achieved by moving the camshaft axially (sliding it across the engine) so a stationary follower is exposed to a varying lobe profile to produce different amounts of lift and duration. The downside to this arrangement is that the cam and follower profiles must be carefully designed to minimise contact stress (due to the varying profile).|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} VTEC-E implementation is {{a variation}} of SOHC VTEC {{which is used to}} increase combustion efficiency at low RPM while maintaining the mid range performance of non-vtec engines. VTEC-E is the first version of VTEC to employ the use of roller rocker arms and because of that, it forgoes the need for having 3 intake lobes for actuating the two valves—two lobes for non-VTEC operation(one small and one medium-sized lobe) and one lobe for VTEC operation(the biggest lobe). Instead, there are two different intake cam profiles per cylinder—a very mild <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> with little lift and a normal <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> with moderate lift. Because of this, at low RPM, when VTEC is not engaged, one of the two intake valves is allowed to open only a very small amount due to the mild <b>cam</b> <b>lobe,</b> forcing most of the intake charge through the other open intake valve with the normal <b>cam</b> <b>lobe.</b> This induces swirl of the intake charge which improves air/fuel atomization in the cylinder and allows for a leaner fuel mixture to be used. As the engine's speed and load increase, both valves are needed to supply a sufficient mixture. When engaging VTEC mode, a pre-defined threshold for MPH (must be moving), RPM and load must be met before the computer actuates a solenoid which directs pressurized oil into a sliding pin, just like with the original VTEC. This sliding pin connects the intake rocker arm followers together so that, now, both intake valves are following the [...] "normal" [...] camshaft lobe instead of just one of them. When in VTEC, since the [...] "normal" [...] <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> has the same timing and lift as the intake cam lobes of the SOHC non-VTEC engines, both engines have identical performance in the upper powerband assuming everything else is the same.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves are {{actuated}} directly by a rocker arm, finger, or bucket tappet. Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> contact, while pushrod engines use rocker arms. Rocker arms are actuated by a pushrod, and pivot on a shaft or individual ball studs in order to actuate the valves.|$|R
50|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines with pistons, the camshaft {{is used to}} operate poppet valves. It consists of a cylindrical rod running {{the length of the}} cylinder bank with a number of oblong lobes protruding from it, one for each valve. The <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> force the valves open by pressing on the valve, or on some intermediate mechanism, as they rotate.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{pressure}} {{is an important}} factor in the longevity of most internal combustion engines. With a forced lubrication system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into bearings, such as the main bearings, big end bearings and camshaft bearings or balance shaft bearings. Other components such as <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil jets.|$|R
50|$|The VTEC system {{consists}} of two separate <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> profiles. Variable cam phasing is not used. Roller followers are used to reduce friction in the valvetrain. The rocker arms are constructed using metal injection molding.|$|E
50|$|Eccentric {{cam drive}} systems {{operates}} through an eccentric disc mechanism which slows and speeds up the angular {{speed of the}} <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> during its rotation. Arranging the lobe to slow during its open period is equivalent to lengthening its duration.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the engine}} was cylinder-ported and {{required}} no poppet valves, each bank had a camshaft, driven at crankshaft speed. This was used solely to drive the fuel injection pumps, each cylinder having its own injector and pump, driven by its own <b>cam</b> <b>lobe.</b>|$|E
50|$|The sidevalve's poppet valves {{are usually}} sited {{on one side}} of the {{cylinder}}(s). A recess in the cylinder head creates a corridor connecting the valves and the combustion chamber. The valve gear comprises a camshaft which operates the valves via simple tappets, most commonly without any further valvetrain components (such as pushrods, rocker arms, overhead valves or overhead camshafts). Indian, however, employs both rocker arms and pushrods to transmit motion from the <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> to the valve stems.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Speed Six engine suffered from poor valve train durability leading to many warranty claims against TVR. Subsequent third party development work has mitigated this issue by using revised material harnesses for the <b>cam</b> <b>lobes,</b> finger followers and valve guides. Softer valve springs and valves with thicker stems were also utilised. Engines that have had these modifications performed have much improved durability. Another third party development offers a redesigned cylinder head with cam and bucket valve actuation so eliminating the use of finger followers altogether.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} effects of valve timing and how it {{influences}} the in-cylinder fluid flow, the combustion, and the efficiency of the engine. An engine load of 4. 0 bar imepdndedt was achieved by setting the inlet valve closing time early or late to enable unthrottle operation. Inlet valve deactivation was also used and asymmetrical valve timing, i. e., valve timing with the two inlet valves opening and closing at different times. The valve timing was altered by switching <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> between the experiments...|$|R
50|$|The {{duration}} can {{be increased}} until the closing flank of the <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> reaches the opening flank - a duration of 720 degrees. In a typical application the helical camshaft would have a continuous duration range from about average for a road-going general purpose engine (about 250 degrees measured at normal valve clearance) to about 100 or 150 degrees above this.|$|E
50|$|A cam follower, {{also known}} as a track follower, is a {{specialized}} type of roller or needle bearing designed to follow <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> profiles. Cam followers come in a vast array of different configurations, however the most defining characteristic is how the cam follower mounts to its mating part; stud style cam followers use a stud while the yoke style has a hole through the middle.|$|E
50|$|Valve float is {{an adverse}} {{condition}} which can occur at high engine speeds when the poppet valves in an {{internal combustion engine}} valvetrain do not properly follow the closure phase of the <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> profile. This reduces engine efficiency and performance and potentially increases engine emissions. There is also a significant risk of severe engine damage due to valve spring damage and/or pistons contacting the valves.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> act {{directly}} on bucket type tappets, which are adjusted {{by means of}} shims between {{the underside of the}} bucket and the top of the valves. Two duplex chains drive the camshafts, one from the crankshaft to a sprocket {{at the level of the}} combustion chambers, and one from the sprocket to each camshaft. The original sprung slipper design of the lower cam chain tensioner proved to be too weak and after a couple of years was changed to an improved hydraulic design, using engine oil pressure.|$|R
50|$|The VTEC system {{provides}} the engine with valve timing optimized for both {{low and high}} RPM operations. In basic form, the single barring shaft-lock of a conventional engine is replaced with two profiles: one optimized for low-RPM stability and fuel efficiency, and the other designed to maximize high-RPM power output. The switching operation between the two <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> {{is controlled by the}} ECU which takes account of engine oil pressure, engine temperature, vehicle speed, engine speed and throttle position. Using these inputs, the ECU is programmed to switch from the low lift to the high lift <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> when the conditions mean that engine output will be improved. At the switch point a solenoid is actuated which allows oil pressure from a spool valve to operate a locking pin which binds the high RPM cam follower to the low RPM ones. From this point on, the valves open and close according to the high-lift profile, which opens the valve further and for a longer time. The switch-over point is variable, between a minimum and maximum point, and is determined by engine load. The switch-down back from high to low RPM cams is set to occur at a lower engine speed than the switch-up (representing a hysteresis cycle) to avoid {{a situation in which the}} engine is asked to operate continuously at or around the switch-over point.|$|R

5000|$|Intake, {{induction}} or suction: The intake valves {{are open}} {{as a result}} of the <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> pressing down on the valve stem. The piston moves downward increasing the volume of the combustion chamber and allowing air to enter in the case of a CI engine or an air fuel mix in the case of SI engines that do not use direct injection. The air or air-fuel mixture is called the charge in any case.|$|E
50|$|Some {{overhead}} cam engines employ short rocker arms {{in which the}} <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> pushes down (rather than up) on the rocker arm to open the valve. On this type of rocker arm, the fulcrum {{is at the end}} rather than the middle, while the cam acts on the middle of the arm. The opposite end opens the valve. These types of rocker arms are particularly common on dual {{overhead cam}} motors, and are often used instead of direct tappets.|$|E
50|$|Valves {{are driven}} by roller-follower rocker arms with low {{friction}} roller bearings, and a unique, concave <b>cam</b> <b>lobe</b> design to increase valve lift over the traditional shimless lifter type system of the 1GR-FE. This increases overall cylinder head height to accommodate the slightly taller roller rocker system. Moreover, the cylinder head is segmented into 3 parts: valve cover, camshaft sub-assembly housing, and cylinder head sub-assembly. As such, this valvetrain is used across all other GR engines with Dual VVT-i. Its service weight is 163 kg.|$|E

2500|$|... at 2700rpm, Minimum {{fuel grade}} 100LL avgas, {{compression}} ratio 9.00:1. Same as H1AD but with provisions for a fixed-pitch propeller. This was the troublesome engine that was {{installed on the}} 1977 to 1980 Cessna 172N Skyhawk. [...] It was notable from all other Lycoming models by incorporating hydraulic lifters that were barrel shaped instead of mushroom type, {{in an attempt to}} make the lifters possible to be serviced without having to disassemble the entire engine case, but the higher load on the <b>cam</b> <b>lobes</b> resulted in severe spalling. Multiple service bulletins and airworthiness directives have been issued regarding this specific model, and multiple modifications exist to attempt to mitigate its design defects.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used cam is the cam plate (also known as disc cam or radial cam)which is cut out {{of a piece of}} flat metal or plate. Here, the follower moves in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the camshaft. Several key terms are relevant in such a construction of plate cams: base circle, prime circle (with radius equal to the sum of the follower radius and the base circle radius), pitch curve which is the radial curve traced out by applying the radial displacements away from the prime circle across all angles, and the lobe separation angle (LSA - the angle between two adjacent intake and exhaust <b>cam</b> <b>lobes).</b>|$|R
