40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a global model of micro-hollow cathode discharges working in argon gas. Inspired by experiments and two-dimensional numerical simulations, the discharge is decomposed into two main regions, labelled the <b>cathodic</b> <b>region</b> and the positive column region. The first {{is composed of}} a cathode sheath (surrounding the cathode) and a plasma in the centre, while the positive column region is essentially filled with plasma. A cathode sheath model is developed to calculate the sheath size and the power dissipated by ions and electrons in the sheath. Charged-particle transport equations are solved in one-dimensional cylindrical coordinates, in the quasi-neutral plasma region, {{in order to determine}} the radial density profiles and the electron temperature in the microhole. A global power balance is then performed in the two distinct regions {{in order to determine the}} absolute electron density. We found that the electron density is one order of magnitude higher in the <b>cathodic</b> <b>region</b> than in the positive column, showing that the power dissipation is mainly located in the cathode sheath. The calculated electron density in the <b>cathodic</b> <b>region</b> is in reasonable agreement with experiments...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of triethylenetetramine-tribenzylidene (TTTB) and triethylenetetramine-trisalicylidene (TTTS) as corrosion inhibitors for zinc in hydrochloric acid is investigated. At lower concentrations, both inhibitors accelerate the attack but inhibit corrosion at higher concentrations, e. g., 96 - 100 % with 1. 0 % concentration in 0. 5 M and 1. 0 M HCl. The efficiency of TTTB decreases while that of TTTS remains almost constant (&# 8805; 99. 7 %) up to 120 minutes {{and in the}} temperature range 35 - 65 ºC. The activation energies are higher in inhibited than in plain acid with both inhibitors. The free energy of adsorption (&# 916;Gads) and heat of adsorption (Qads) are negative, which {{suggests that there is}} spontaneous adsorption on metal surface, and from the values of (&# 916;Gads) and (Qads), the values of entropy of adsorption (&# 916;Sads) were calculated. Galvanostatic polarization shows that corrosion is under mixed control with predominance of the cathodic part. In uninhibited 1. 0 M HCl, complete cathodic protection is achieved at a current density of 4. 2224 Adm- 2, but in presence of these inhibitors, much lower current densities are required. Plot of log (&# 952;/ 1 -&# 952;) versus log Cinh gives a straight line, suggesting that inhibitors cover both the anodic and <b>cathodic</b> <b>regions</b> through general adsorption following Langmuir isotherm.

40|$|The {{effect of}} part per billion (ppb) levels of SO 2 on the {{atmospheric}} corrosion on Al (99. 999 %) {{was investigated in}} the laboratory at 22 degrees C. Exposure time was 20 and 672 h. The effect of SO 2 concentration (46 - 1300 ppb), relative humidity (70 - 99 % RH), {{and the amount of}} NaCl applied prior to exposure (0 - 250 mu g/cm(2)) was studied. In addition, the effect of O- 3 and NO 2 on the SO 2 deposition rate was addressed. The samples were investigated by gravimetry, grazing incidence X-ray powder diffraction, ion chromatography, optical microscopy, and environmental scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence. SO 2 accelerates the atmospheric corrosion of Al, forming corrosion product "islands" containing aluminum hydroxy sulfate. Combining NaCl and SO 2 has a synergistic effect on the average corrosion rate. In contrast, the chloride-induced pitting of aluminum is significantly reduced by SO 2. The corrosivity of SO 2 is attributed to the acidification of the surface electrolyte that destabilizes the alumina passive film. The suppression of pitting corrosion by SO 2 is attributed to the formation of aluminum hydroxy sulfates that are less soluble than the corresponding chlorides and slows down pit propagation. At relative humidities above 70 % RH, there is a measurable steady-state deposition of SO 2 that corresponds to the rate of formation of sulfate. The SO 2 deposition rate is not limited by the oxidation of (IV) -valent sulfur on the surface. SO 2 deposition is enhanced by sodium chloride because the corrosion reactions in the NaCl(aq) electrolyte result in high pH in the <b>cathodic</b> <b>regions</b> and the formation of aluminum hydroxide. Ozone in the ppb range has only transient effects on the SO 2 deposition rate, whereas ppb levels of NO 2 had no effect at (c) 2005 The Electrochemical Society...|$|R

40|$|The {{present state}} of {{understanding}} of localized corrosion of passive metals is based primarily upon behavior under fully immersed solutions. There has been limited analysis of localized corrosion in moist layers of dust, particulate and deposits. This work {{as part of a}} multi-university Corrosion Cooperative of the DOE-OCRWM Science and Technology Program established to enhance the understanding of corrosion processes and materials performance. The objective of this project is to develop models to simulate localized corrosion. The present analysis focuses specifically on the <b>cathodic</b> <b>region</b> near a corrosion crevice with the objective of characterizing the effects of the critical process parameters on the required current to sustain the crevice corrosion. Previous related analytical and numerical studies have focused on galvanic corrosion where the rates of the anodic and cathodic processes are comparable, analyzing mostly the effects of the electrode kinetics and the thickness of the electrolyte layer. A recent study considers the <b>cathodic</b> <b>region</b> for crevice corrosion. The work here determines two and three dimensional current and potential distributions over the cathode. The analyzed cathodic oxygen reduction region adjacent to the crevice is depicted in Fig. 1. This region is modeled for the presence of extremely thin (G{sub r} = 1 - 2000 {micro}m) electrolyte film. The electrolyte film may become discontinuous thus limiting the cathode behavior. Spatial variation of pH affecting the oxygen reduction kinetics, and oxygen diffusion limitations in the film are analyzed. Additionally, the presence of particulates is considered. The effects of macroscopic scale parameters, including the extent of the <b>cathodic</b> <b>region</b> (L = 0. 1 - 30 mm), the crevice gap (G{sub a} = 1 - 25 {micro}m) and the film conductivity (0. 012 - 1. 2 mS/cm) on the current and potential distributions were modeled using an electrochemical CAD software. The total current which a specific cathode can provide to sustain the crevice corrosion, was calculated for limiting potential conditions (to prevent anode passivation) set at the crevice opening. Sample results are shown in Fig. 2. A range of electrode kinetics is explored including data typical to oxygen reduction kinetics on stainless-steel and on nickel based alloys. The time-dependent effects of the varying pH due to oxygen reduction were also simulated. The effect of solid particulate in the electrolyte layer was analyzed on both the macroscopic and microscopic level. The particulate effects on the current distribution were analyzed on the macroscopic scale applying Bruggeman's equation for average, ''effective'' properties, and on the microscopic scale, using detailed distributions around single particles and particle arrays. Experiments performed on cells emulating the simulated cathode region to validate the modeling data are reported.

Stress corrosion cracking, at potentials below - 800 mV(SCE), was attributed to hydrogen embrittlement. Stress corrosion cracking, in the potential range from about - 700 to - 500 mV(SCE), was attributed to an anodic dissolution mechanism. In the anodic potential region, the SCC initiation stress was larger than the yield stress and was associated with significant plastic deformation at the cracking site. The relative SCC initiation resistance decreased with increasing yield strength. In the <b>cathodic</b> potential <b>region,</b> the SCC initiation stress was smaller than the yield stress of steel; it was approximately equal to the stress at 0. 1 pct strain (sigma(0. 1 pct) for all the steels.

In the anodic potential region (− 0. 90 to − 0. 95 V vs. SCE) a significantly different transfer coefficient is found, β= 0. 60 ± 0. 03, which indicates that the mechanism of the electrode reaction depends on the d. c. potential.

The concentration range used was 1 x 10 (- 5) M to 8 x 10 (- 4) M. The weight loss and electrochemical techniques used were corrosion potential measurement, anodic and cathodic polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
