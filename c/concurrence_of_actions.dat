40|$|After {{a meeting}} in Paris during which the {{director}} of the bureau de droit des obligations explained some of the needs of the ministry to us, we chose two main topics of study: the mitigation <b>of</b> damages and <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> However, beyond this focus some of our members were able to shed light on some further particular problems. This led us to create an additional section dedicated to some separate themes such as private penalty or the question of links. From this experimental work the topic of imputation and causation was addressed. We also added some relevant topics such as proportionality and transition law. More precisely, we conceived our work as an exchange between laws, leading us to build two national reports and comparing them...|$|R
5000|$|The devices most {{inherent}} to classical Hollywood cinema {{are those of}} continuity editing. This includes the 180-degree rule, {{one of the major}} visual-spatial elements of continuity editing. The 180-degree rule keeps with the [...] "photographed play" [...] style by creating an imaginary 180-degree axis between the viewer and the shot, allowing viewers to clearly orient themselves within the position and direction <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in a scene. According to the 30-degree rule, cuts in the angle that the scene is viewed from must be significant enough for the viewer to understand the purpose of a change in perspective. Cuts that do not adhere to the 30-degree rule, known as jump cuts, are disruptive to the illusion of temporal continuity between shots. The 180-degree and 30-degree rules are elementary guidelines in film-making that preceded the official start of the classical era by over a decade, as seen in the pioneering 1902 French film A Trip to the Moon. Cutting techniques in classical continuity editing serve to help establish or maintain continuity, as in the cross cut, which establishes the <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in different locations. Jump cuts are allowed {{in the form of the}} axial cut, which does not change the angle of shooting at all, but has the clear purpose of showing a perspective closer or farther from the subject and therefore does not interfere with temporal continuity.|$|R

40|$|<b>Concurrence</b> <b>of</b> {{duties of}} a member of the Board of Directors and an {{employee}} within a joint-stock company The aim of this thesis is to describe a situation, where a member of the Board of Directors of a joint-stock company is simultaneously an employee of the same company (so called <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties) and to analyze problems arising from this situation. In this context it is important to show the differences between labour-law relationship and commercial-law relationship, as well as to look at <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties in the past. An amendment to the Commercial Code made performance of the business management in the framework of parallel labour-law relationship possible, but the recodification of Civil Law that shall come into effect as of January 1, 2014 does not take <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties into consideration. One of the most important parts of this thesis will be thus looking for an answer to the question, what the situation regarding <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties will be in the future. The second crucial problem, that this thesis is focused on, is issue <b>of</b> <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> the powers to act on behalf of the company, i. e. if a member of the Board of Directors is entitled to act even as a contractual or legal representative of a company.
