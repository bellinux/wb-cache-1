40|$|Prisoners and detainees {{have the}} same right to access, equity and quality of health care as the general population. Because prisoners will return to society after their imprisonment, their health {{is an issue of}} concern to the general population. The health of prisoners is also {{important}} for the occupational health and safety of the staff of <b>correctional</b> <b>facilities.</b> Governments and prison authorities have a duty of care to all prisoners and detainees under their control, including those in private <b>correctional</b> <b>facilities.</b> The physical environment of <b>correctional</b> <b>facilities</b> influences the health of prisoners and detainees. Governments must provide basic humane standards and should strive to achieve world's best practice in all Australian <b>correctional</b> <b>facilities.</b> <b>Correctional</b> <b>facilities</b> should accommodate the language, cultural and religious needs of prisoners and detainees. The provision of health care is potentially constrained due to the physical and social environment of <b>correctional</b> <b>facilities.</b> Prisoners and detainees may face particular health problems, both pre-existing and associated with incarceration, such as exposure to blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections, inadequate provision of a broad range of harm-minimisation measures, and lack of access to health education programs. <b>Correctional</b> <b>facilities</b> should provide suitable health facilities with appropriate equipment and trained staff, or arrange for such services to be made available, for the continuing treatment and care of all prisoners and detainees. i. <b>Correctional</b> <b>facilities</b> should also assist the continuation of medical care following the prisoner's release. Medical practitioners should not deny treatment to any prisoner or detainee {{on the basis of their}} culture, ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, gender, sexual orientation or the nature of their illness. The duty of medical practitioners to treat all patients professionally with respect for their human dignity and privacy applies equally to the care of those detained in prison, whether convicted or on remand ii, irrespective of the reason for their incarceration...|$|R

5|$|In 1995, Dammasch State Hospital {{was closed}} {{by the state}} of Oregon, and the site was then {{proposed}} as a location for what became the Coffee Creek <b>Correctional</b> <b>Facility,</b> which opened in 2001 at a different site {{to the north of the}} old hospital grounds. In protest of the construction of the prison, specifically the effect on property values, Larry Eaton began erecting school buses on his property. The former grounds of the state hospital are, as of 2009, under development as Villebois, a primarily residential complex. Also in 1995, Wilsonville High School opened as part of the West Linn-Wilsonville School District, the first high school in the city's history. In 1998, lack of an adequate long-term water supply forced the city to suspend adding any new developments to the city. A new water treatment plant on the Willamette River opened in 2002 to address this need.|$|E
5|$|Manning was {{ultimately}} charged with 22 offenses, including aiding the enemy, {{which was the}} most serious charge and could {{have resulted in a}} death sentence. She was held at the Marine Corps Brig, Quantico in Virginia, from July 2010 to April 2011, under Prevention of Injury status—which entailed de facto solitary confinement and other restrictions that caused domestic and international concern—before being transferred to the Joint Regional <b>Correctional</b> <b>Facility</b> at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she could interact with other detainees. She pleaded guilty in February 2013 to 10 of the charges. The trial on the remaining charges began on June 3, 2013, and on July 30 she was convicted of 17 of the original charges and amended versions of four others, but was acquitted of aiding the enemy. She was sentenced to serve a 35-year sentence at the maximum-security U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth.

K-383 and US-36 intersect US-283 (State Street) north of the downtown area. The highways become a two-lane road again as they leave Norton.
