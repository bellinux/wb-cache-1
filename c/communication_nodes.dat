In this configuration, a pairwise information exchange and a channel condition based node pair selection for simultaneous information transfer provide the best performance. For such schemes, {{the relationship between the}} minimum number of time slots required for complete information exchange among <b>communication</b> <b>nodes</b> and the number of <b>communication</b> <b>nodes</b> is derived. Furthermore, this paper proposes an improved joint channel decoding-network coding algorithm, which is to be employed at the relay node. In the proposed joint decoding algorithm, the soft information of the information bits is exchanged between the channel decoders corresponding to different node pairs transmitting simultaneously. We also propose three different schemes for soft information exchange between the different channel decoders. The proposed algorithm is highly scalable with respect to the number of <b>communication</b> <b>nodes.</b> Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint decoding algorithm offers improved error performance over the existing joint decoding algorithms for a three-way relay system under the three different information exchanging schemes.
