5|$|Meanwhile, back in Boston, a distraught Walter (John Noble) {{suffers a}} small mental {{breakdown}} at a supermarket. Olivia (Anna Torv) and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) escort him home, discovering his house is in disarray. After they ask why he didn't <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> for help, Walter replies {{he needs to}} learn to care for himself if Peter fails to return. He discovers a way to find Peter using his unique energy signature, but changes his mind after worrying that Peter will not forgive him. However, Olivia learns Peter's whereabouts from Broyles; they prepare to fly to Washington.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to larvae that have portable cases, {{members of the}} Annulipalpia have a completely different feeding strategy. They make fixed retreats in which they remain stationary, waiting for food to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Members of the Psychomyiidae, Ecnomidae and Xiphocentronidae families construct simple tubes of sand and other particles held together by silk and anchored to the bottom, and feed on the accumulations of silt formed when suspended material is deposited. The tube can be lengthened when the growing larva needs to feed in new areas. More complex tubes, short and flattened, are built by Polycentropodidae larvae in hollows in rocks or other submerged objecte, sometimes with strands of silk suspended across the nearby surface. These larvae are carnivorous, resembling spiders in their feeding habits and rushing out of their retreat to attack any unwary small prey crawling across the surface.|$|E
25|$|Calling is a {{traditional}} wolf hunting method of Mongolia. The hunters go {{to the place where}} the pack is located {{early in the morning and}} will imitate a wolf's howl. The hunters howl in unison with the wolves and wait for the animals to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Mongolian wolf hunting is usually done with the assistance of local herders.|$|E

25|$|The sangha {{traveled}} through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except {{during the four}} months of the Vassa rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason {{was that it was}} more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Abdul Rahman's son planned {{from there}} to move from city to city, fortifying as they went, and if Charles wished {{to stop them from}} making a {{permanent}} enclave for expansion of the Caliphate, he would have to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> in the open, where, he, unlike his father, would dictate the place of battle. All worked as he had planned, until Charles arrived, albeit more swiftly than the Moors believed he could call up his entire army. Unfortunately for Rahman's son, however, he had overestimated the time it would take Charles to develop heavy cavalry equal to that of the Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Tracing the parlourmaid, they {{discover}} {{she is now}} the married housekeeper at Bobby's home. Carstairs {{was trying to find}} her. Returning to Wales, they find Moira, who claims she is being followed by Roger and has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> for help. Frankie is not deceived and spoils Moira's attempt to poison their coffee. Moira was Mrs Templeton and is Roger's co-conspirator. Moira then attempts to shoot Frankie and Bobby in the café when she is exposed, but is overpowered and arrested. Several weeks later, Frankie receives a letter from Roger, posted from South America, in which he confesses to murdering Carstairs, murdering his brother, and conspiring in all of Moira's past crimes. Bobby and Frankie realise they are in love and become engaged.|$|E

25|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that fathers generally tend to avoid sexual conversations with their children. Many fathers have uncertainties on how to start to the conversation. Other times they simply put the initiative on their daughters to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> with questions or issues. Even when the conversation is launched fathers tend to be judgmental or only talk about abstinence. Fathers {{are more likely to}} forbid daughters from having sex when they are talking. Wilson et al. (2010) found that some fathers felt that talking about the potential consequences of sex was easier than talking about sex itself. Fathers overall tend to apply more orders when talking to their daughters than giving them unbiased information or simply listening and trying to give them their best advice.|$|E
25|$|The Village of Wish: This is {{the tiny}} town of Wish, where Lyra lives with her parents, Fidget and Faye, and her grandparents, Tangle and Aeval. It’s an insular place, far from cities and civilization. The town is {{surrounded}} by tall walls, not to keep the residents inside, for they have no desire to leave the safety and warmth of their community. The walls are there to keep the outside world outside, and are secured with complex weighted locks first seen in Dream Chronicles. The streets are cobbled, lined with colorful dwellings and stores. Beyond the walls of Wish lie lush forests and winding roads that, eventually, lead to other larger towns. But the folk of Wish have little desire to visit those distant places. Their homes are secure in their beloved village where, they believe, no harm can <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> rather than hunting for it.|$|E
500|$|Aggressive mimicry often {{involves}} the predator employing signals which draw its potential prey towards it, a strategy which allows predators to simply {{sit and wait}} for prey to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The promise of food or sex are most commonly used as lures. However, this need not be the case; {{as long as the}} predator's true identity is concealed, it may be able to approach prey more easily than would otherwise be the case. In terms of species involved, systems may be composed of two or three species; in two-species systems the signal receiver, or [...] "dupe", is the model.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Satisfied began {{soon after}} the release of DecembeRadio and {{occurred}} in spurts, as the band found more success in letting ideas <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> spontaneously than in meeting for dedicated writing sessions. [...] The chorus melody of [...] "Be Alright", for example, popped into bassist and lead singer Josh Reedy's head while showering. [...] On another occasion, Reedy came up with a riff on GarageBand while traveling between gigs. [...] Two of the earliest completed songs, [...] "Satisfy Me" [...] and [...] "Find You Waiting", were included in the band's live shows by April 2008. [...] The former was the first song written for the album, and the latter was first released on the expanded edition of DecembeRadio in November 2007.|$|E

500|$|The caddisflies, {{or order}} Trichoptera, are {{a group of}} insects with aquatic larvae and {{terrestrial}} adults. There are approximately 14,500 described species, [...] most {{of which can be}} divided into the suborders Integripalpia and Annulipalpia {{on the basis of the}} adult mouthparts. Integripalpian larvae construct a portable casing to protect themselves as they move around looking for food, while Annulipalpian larvae make themselves a fixed retreat in which they remain, waiting for food to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The affinities of the small third suborder Spicipalpia are unclear, and molecular analysis suggests it may not be monophyletic. Also called sedge-flies or rail-flies, the adults are small moth-like insects with two pairs of hairy membranous wings. They are closely related to the Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) which have scales on their wings; the two orders together form the superorder Amphiesmenoptera.|$|E
500|$|OV-10 pilot Clark (Nail 38 Bravo) was {{closest to}} the team's {{position}} and would be rescued first. Clark was relayed instructions {{to get in the}} water and float downstream where Norris and his team would intercept him. The rescuer's initial plan was to swim upriver and meet Clark, but Norris tested the current and decided it was too strong. They would have to insert along the riverbank, a much more hazardous route. Anderson, Norris, and five Vietnamese commandos set up an overwatch position near the Mieu Giang River, which ran near the positions of both downed airmen. Anderson ordered Norris to take his team no more than [...] forward and wait for the survivors to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but after departing, Norris ignored the order and turned off his radio. Traveling twice that distance upriver, he avoided frequent North Vietnamese patrols, truck, and columns of tanks.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, Junpei wakes up in a cabin inside a cruise liner, wearing a {{bracelet}} displaying the number [...] "5". He escapes the room, and encounters eight people, including June. Zero announces over a loudspeaker that all nine are participants in the Nonary Game. Zero explains the rules, and states each carry an explosive in their stomach that will go off if they try to bypass the digital root door locks. The 9th Man still goes through a door by himself, and is killed. Fearing what harm might <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> the group adopts code names, and splits up to explore the ship. The player has the option to select which group that Junpei travels with, which affects the story; several choices lead to Junpei's death. Through various choices, Junpei learns of a previous Nonary Game, played nine years earlier, and the connections of the other characters through that, as well as studies about morphic resonance and stories of the Egyptian priestess Alice, who is frozen in ice-9.|$|E

500|$|Jean and Jeannette {{felt they}} had succeeded by {{reaching}} the stratosphere, and they became popular lecturers. They prepared brochures and souvenirs to attract attention to the flight, one titled [...] "Who Said We Couldn't Do It." [...] But they had developed perhaps unreasonable expectations that lucrative university positions would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Both wrote to dozens of colleges and universities, aiming high—even at college presidencies, trying to secure positions, but they received only rejections. In December 1934, Jeannette wrote to Swann to ask if Jean might {{become a member of}} the chemistry staff of Bartol Research at the Franklin Institute, and also offered her services, but was turned down. Luckily, they met a new advocate while on lecture tour to Minneapolis. Thanks to John Akerman of the department of aeronautical engineering at the University of Minnesota, Jean became an untenured professor in Minnesota by 1936, teaching and doing aeronautical studies until 1946 when he received tenure. During 1943, Jeannette was briefly an executive secretary at the housing section of the Minnesota Office of Civil Defense.|$|E
500|$|The bullet time {{mode that}} Max Payne {{was known for}} was improved; the {{developers}} {{referred to it as}} [...] "version 2.0". The mode, which allows Max to move in slow motion to react and kill enemies more easily, was enhanced to give Max a refill of a portion of the Bullet Time gauge, as well as slowing down the passage time even further, as Max moves further [...] "into the zone" [...] with each consecutive kill. This was done to encourage players to aggressively dive head-on into dangerous situations rather than crouching at a safe distance and waiting for enemies to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> A new reload animation was also introduced, which, when Max reloads while in Bullet Time, allows him to duck to avoid bullets, spin around to survey the combat situation, and briefly pause to give the player a moment to think of a strategy. Development tools were made available for Max Payne 2 by Rockstar Games and Remedy Entertainment to allow players to create modifications for the game. Modifications can perform several functions, such as the ability to add new weapons, skills, perspectives, surroundings, and characters.|$|E
500|$|In {{the episode}} of the {{delusion}} of Sati in Ramcharitmanas, Sati sees many a Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu serving Rama and bowing at his feet. When Manu and Shatarupa perform penance, they crave to see that Supreme Lord [...] "from a part of whose being emanate a number of Shivas, Brahmas and Vishnus." [...] Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> many times tempting them with a boon, but Manu and Shatarupa do not stop their penance. They are finally satisfied only {{by the appearance of}} Rama, on whose left side is Sita, from a part of whom are born [...] "countless Lakshmis, Umas (Parvatis) and Brahmanis (Sarasvatis)." [...] In the episode of marriage of Sita and Rama in Balkand, the trio of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is present – Brahma is astounded as he finds nowhere anything that is his own handiwork, while Vishnu is enchanted with Lakhmi on seeing Rama. In the Sundarkand, Hanuman tells Ravana that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva can create, preserve and destroy by the might of Rama. In the Lankakand, Tulsidas presents the universe as the cosmic form of Rama, in which Shiva is the consciousness, Brahma is the reason and Vishnu is his intelligence. As per Tulsidas, Rama is not only an avatar, but also the source of avatars – Krishna is also an Avatar of Rama. Thus, Tulsidas clearly considers Rama as supreme brahman and not an avatar of Vishnu.|$|E
