40|$|Using one- and {{two-dimensional}} NMR spectroscopy {{applied to}} $^{ 13 }$C spin-labeled (TMTTF) $_ 2 $AsF$_ 6 $ and (TMTTF) $_ 2 $PF$_ 6 $, we demonstrate {{the existence of}} an intermediate charge-ordered phase in the TMTTF family of charge-transfer salts. At ambient temperature, the spectra are characteristic of nuclei in equivalent environments, or molecules. Below a continuous charge-ordering transition temperature T$_{co}$, the spectra are explained by assuming there are two inequivalent molecules with unequal electron densities. The absence of an associated magnetic anomaly indicates only the charge degrees of freedom are involved and the lack of evidence for a structural anomaly suggests that charge/lattice <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to drive the transition.

We show that sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling and an appropriate sign of g-factor could transform the Wigner crystal to a topological phonon system.

We explore the possibility of realizing the topological phonon system in two-dimensional Wigner crystals confined in semiconductor quantum wells/heterostructure. We find that the spin-orbit <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> for driving a topological phase transition in these systems.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{mechanism}} {{to explain the}} frequently observed and thus certainly permanent warping of spiral galaxies. We consider the possibility of non-linear coupling between the spiral wave of the galaxy and two warp waves, such that the former, which is linearly unstable and extracts energy and angular momentum from the inner regions of the galactic disk, can continuously feed the latter. We derive an expression for the coupling coefficient in the WKB approximation. We show that the <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> in the stellar disk, except at the Outer Lindblad Resonance where the spiral slows down and is efficiently coupled to warp waves. There, the spiral can be almost completely converted into ``transmitted'' warps, which we can observe in HI, and a ``reflected'' one, which we can observe as a corrugation. Our mechanism reproduces the observed amplitudes of the warp and of the corrugation, and might explain related phenomena such as {{the behavior of the}} line of nodes of the warp. Furthermore we show that the energy and momentum fluxes of observed spirals and warps are of the same order of magnitude, adding a strong point in favor of this model.

40|$|Recently, Prakash et al. have {{discovered}} bulk superconductivity in single crystals of bismuth, {{which is a}} semimetal with extremely low carrier density. At such low density, we argue that conventional electron-phonon <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> {{to be responsible for}} the binding of electrons into Cooper pairs. We study a dynamically screened Coulomb interaction with effective attraction generated on the scale of the collective plasma modes. We model the electronic states in bismuth to include three Dirac pockets with high velocity and one hole pocket with a significantly smaller velocity. We find a weak-coupling instability, which is greatly enhanced by the presence of the hole pocket. Therefore we argue that bismuth is the first material to exhibit superconductivity driven by retardation effects of Coulomb repulsion alone. By using realistic parameters for bismuth we find that the acoustic plasma mode does not play the central role in pairing. We also discuss a matrix element effect, resulting from the Dirac nature of the conduction band, which may affect T[subscript c] in the s-wave channel without breaking time-reversal symmetry.

40|$|AbstractPerception, cognition, {{and social}} {{interaction}} depend upon coordinated neural activity. This coordination operates within noisy, overlapping, and distributed neural networks operating at multiple timescales. These networks are built upon a structural scaffolding with intrinsic neuroplasticity that changes with development, aging, disease, and personal experience. In this article, we begin {{from the perspective}} that successful interregional communication relies upon the transient synchronization between distinct low-frequency (< 80 Hz) oscillations, allowing for brief windows of communication via phase-coordinated local neuronal spiking. From this, we construct a theoretical framework for dynamic network communication, arguing that these networks reflect a balance between oscillatory coupling and local population spiking activity and that these two levels of activity interact. We theorize that when oscillatory <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> strong, spike timing within the local neuronal population becomes too synchronous; when oscillatory <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> <b>weak,</b> spike timing is too disorganized. Each results in specific disruptions to neural communication. These alterations in communication dynamics may underlie cognitive changes associated with healthy development and aging, in addition to neurological and psychiatric disorders. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders—including Parkinson’s disease, autism, depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety—are associated with abnormalities in oscillatory activity. Although aging, psychiatric and neurological disease, and experience differ in the biological changes to structural gray or white matter, neurotransmission, and gene expression, our framework suggests that any resultant cognitive and behavioral changes in normal or disordered states or their treatment are a product of how these physical processes affect dynamic network communication...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} four decades, one of the {{simplest}} nervous systems across the animal kingdom, that of the nematode worm C. elegans, has drawn increasing attention. This system {{is the subject of}} an intensive concerted effort to understand the behaviour of an entire living animal, from the bottom up and the top down. C. elegans locomotion, in particular, {{has been the subject of}} a number of models, but there is as yet no general agreement about the key (rhythm generating) elements. In this paper we investigate the role of one component of the locomotion subsystem, namely the body wall muscles, with a focus on the role of inter-muscular gap junctions. We construct a detailed electrophysiological model which suggests that these muscles function, to a first approximation, as mere actuators and have no obvious rhythm generating role. Furthermore, we show that within our model inter-muscular <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to have a significant electrical effect. These results rule out muscles as key generators of locomotion, pointing instead to neural activity patterns. More specifically, the results imply that the reduced locomotion velocity observed in unc- 9 mutants is likely to be due to reduced neuronal rather than inter-muscular coupling.

40|$|An {{effective}} Hamiltonian {{which could}} model {{the interaction between}} a tunneling proton and the conduction electrons of a metal is investigated. A remarkably simple correlation between {{the motion of the}} $TLS$-atom and an angular-momentum change of scattering electron is deduced, at the first-order Born level, by using a momentum-space representation with plane waves for initial and final states. It is shown that the angular average of the scattering amplitude-change at the Fermi surface depends solely on the difference of the first two phase shifts, for small-distance displacements of the heavy particle. For such a limit of displacement, and within a distorted-wave Born approximation for initial and final states, the change in the scattering amplitude is expressed via trigonometric functions of scattering phase shifts at the Fermi energy. The numerical value of this change is analyzed in the framework of a self-consistent screening description for impurity-embedding in a paramagnetic electron gas. In order to discuss the so-called antiabatic limit on the same footing, a comparison with matrix elements obtained by the potential-gradient of an unscreened Coulomb field is given as well. The coupling of the tunneling proton to a free-electron-like electron gas is in the typical range obtained, by ultrasound experiments for different metallic glasses, from scattering rates for a Korringa-type relaxation process.

40|$|Graphene, the atomic-thin {{layer of}} carbon atoms, was first {{isolated}} on an insulating substrate in 2004 by two groups in Manchester University [1, 2] and Columbia [3]. Those milestone experiments established the Dirac {{nature of the}} charge carriers in graphene. The same year, C. L. Kane and E. G. Mele predicted that intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in graphene, if strong enough, {{would lead to a}} novel state of electronic matter called the Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) state [4, 5]. The QSH state is characterized by conducting gapless edge states circulating around an insulating bulk. Those edge states are protected from moderate disorder and interactions by a new topological invariant of the Z_ 2 nature. While the strength of spin-orbit <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> in graphene, it was soon predicted [6] and verified by transport experiments [7, 8] that the QSH state is realized in HgTe/CdTe quantum wells.

40|$|We perform {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} black-hole binaries {{to study the}} exchange of spin and orbital angular momentum during the last, highly nonlinear, stages of the coalescence process. To calculate the transfer of angular momentum from orbital to spin, we start with two quasi-circular configurations, one with initially non-spinning black holes, the other with corotating black holes. In both cases the binaries complete almost two orbits before merging. We find that, during these last orbits, the specific spin (a/m) of each horizon increases by only 0. 012 for the initially non-spinning configuration, and by only 0. 006 for the initially corotating configuration. By contrast, the corotation value for the specific spin should increase from 0. 1 at the initial proper separation of 10 M to 0. 33 when the proper separation is 5 M. Thus the spin-orbit <b>coupling</b> is far <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> to tidally lock the binary to a corotating state during the late-inspiral phase. We also study the converse transfer from spin into orbital motion. In this case, we start the simulations with parallel, highly-spinning non-boosted black holes. As the collision proceeds, the system acquires a non-head-on orbital motion, due to spin-orbit coupling, {{that leads to the}} radiation of angular momentum. We are able to accurately measure the energy and angular momentum losses and model their dependence on the initial spins.

40|$|The {{representation}} of sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics in coupled climate models has improved considerably in recent years. How good are the sea ice simulation results submitted for the 4 th assessment {{report of the}} IPCC? Here, we focus on Arctic sea ice thickness variability over {{the second half of}} the 20 th century. Sea ice thickness observations for validation are very scarce. We resort to results from hindcasts with ocean-sea ice models driven with realistic atmospheric forcing. We first assess the sea ice results of hindcasts of different sea ice-ocean models that participated in the Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (AOMIP). The results are such that we think that they can serve as a benchmark for the performance of climate models in the climate of the 20 th century experiment (20 C 3 M). Multi-decadal sea ice volume variability is larger in the hindcasts than in most coupled models. This indicates that the corresponding atmospheric variability in the <b>coupled</b> models is <b>too</b> <b>weak.</b> In contrast to the climate models, significant trends over the whole period since 1950 cannot be identified in the AOMIP results although there are strong trends over sub-periods. We shall present first results of a hindcasts with AWIs NAOSIM (North Atlantic/Arctic Sea Ice Ocean Model) that cover the whole 20 th century. Over this period, it is possibleto distinguish a clear negative Arctic sea ice thickness trend from the multi-decadal fluctuations in Arctic ice volume...|$|R

40|$|International audienceReasonably {{realistic}} climatology {{of atmospheric}} and oceanic parameters over the Asian monsoon region is a pre-requisite for models used for monsoon studies. The biases in representing these features lead to problems in representing {{the strength and}} variability of Indian summer monsoon (ISM). This study attempts to unravel {{the ability of a}} state-of-the-art coupled model, SINTEX-F 2, in simulating these characteristics of ISM. The coupled model reproduces the precipitation and circulation climatology reasonably well. However, the mean ISM is weaker than observed, as evident from various monsoon indices. A wavenumber-frequency spectrum analysis reveals that the model intraseasonal oscillations are also weaker-than-observed. One possible reason for the weaker-than-observed ISM arises from the warm bias, over the tropical oceans, especially over the equatorial western Indian Ocean, inherent in the model. This warm bias is not only confined to the surface layers, but also extends through most of the troposphere. As a result of this warm bias, the <b>coupled</b> model has <b>too</b> <b>weak</b> meridional tropospheric temperature gradient to drive a realistic monsoon circulation. This in turn leads to a weakening of the moisture gradient as well as the vertical shear of easterlies required for sustained northward propagation of rain band, resulting in weak monsoon circulation. It is also noted that the recently documented interaction between the interannual and intraseasonal variabilities of ISM through very long breaks (VLBs) is poor in the model. This seems {{to be related to the}} inability of the model in simulating the eastward propagating Madden-Julian oscillation during VLBs...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of state and parameter estimation in nonlinear systems. The need to evaluate unknown parameters in models of nonlinear physical, biophysical and engineering systems occurs throughout the development of phenomenological or reduced models of dynamics. When verifying and validating these models, it is important to incorporate information from observations in an efficient manner. Using the idea of synchronization of nonlinear dynamical systems, this thesis develops a framework for presenting data to a candidate model of a physical process {{in a way that makes}} efficient use of the measured data while allowing for estimation of the unknown parameters in the model. The approach presented here builds on existing work that uses synchronization as a tool for parameter estimation. Some critical issues of stability in that work are addressed and a practical framework is developed for overcoming these difficulties. The central issue is the choice of coupling strength between the model and data. If the <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> strong, the model will reproduce the measured data regardless of the adequacy of the model or correctness of the parameters. If the <b>coupling</b> is <b>too</b> <b>weak,</b> nonlinearities in the dynamics could lead to complex dynamics rendering any cost function comparing the model to the data inadequate for the determination of model parameters. Two methods are introduced which seek to balance the need for coupling with the desire to allow the model to evolve in its natural manner without coupling. One method, ̀balanced' synchronization, adds to the synchronization cost function a requirement that the conditional Lyapunov exponents of the model system, conditioned on being driven by the data, remain negative but small in magnitude. Another method allows the coupling between the data and the model to vary in time according to a specific form of differential equation. The coupling dynamics is damped to allow for a tendency toward zero coupling and driven by the synchronization error to increase coupling when needed. This method, along with a suitable cost function, allows for the determination of model parameters without the complexity of calculating Lyapunov exponents. Lastly, a method is developed allowing the coupling to vary in time without the constraint of following a differential equation. This approach shows the equivalence of the parameter and state estimation problem to that of tracking within an optimal control framework. This equivalence allows the application of powerful numerical methods that provide robust practical tools for model development and validation. Examples of each of these methods are presented with both simulated data and data measured from electrical circuit implementations of several dynamical system...|$|R
