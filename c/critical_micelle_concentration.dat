25|$|The <b>critical</b> <b>micelle</b> <b>concentration</b> (CMC) in {{pure water}} at 25°C is 8.2 mM, and the {{aggregation}} number at this concentration is usually {{considered to be}} about 62. The micelle ionization fraction (α) is around 0.3 (or 30%).|$|E
25|$|When {{surfactants}} {{are present}} above the <b>critical</b> <b>micelle</b> <b>concentration</b> (CMC), they {{can act as}} emulsifiers that will allow a compound that is normally insoluble (in the solvent being used) to dissolve. This occurs because the insoluble species {{can be incorporated into}} the micelle core, which is itself solubilized in the bulk solvent by virtue of the head groups' favorable interactions with solvent species. The most common example of this phenomenon is detergents, which clean poorly soluble lipophilic material (such as oils and waxes) that cannot be removed by water alone. Detergents clean also by lowering the surface tension of water, making it easier to remove material from a surface. The emulsifying property of surfactants is also the basis for emulsion polymerization.|$|E

40|$|Lipophilic {{compounds}} of {{the culture}} suspension containing Rhodococcus erythropolis DSM 43215 had surfactant properties when the bacteria were cultivated with n-alkanes as the sole carbon source. Thirteen main components from a dichloromethane-methanol extract of the R. erythropolis cultures were isolated and characterized to specify quantitatively their surfactant properties, e. g., minimum surface and interfacial tensions and <b>critical</b> <b>micelle</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The interfacial activity of the organic extract was dominated by α,α-trehalose- 6, 6 ′-dicorynomycolates which reduced interfacial tension from 44 to 18 mN/m. Phosphatidylethanolamines which were also present in the organic extract reduced the interfacial tension below 1 mN/m.

2500|$|Micelles form {{only when}} the {{concentration}} of surfactant {{is greater than the}} <b>critical</b> <b>micelle</b> <b>concentration</b> (CMC), and the temperature of the system is greater than the critical micelle temperature, or Krafft temperature. The formation of micelles can be understood using thermodynamics: Micelles can form spontaneously because of a balance between entropy and enthalpy. In water, the hydrophobic effect is the driving force for micelle formation, despite the fact that assembling surfactant molecules is unfavorable in terms of both enthalpy and entropy of the system. At very low concentrations of the surfactant, only monomers are present in solution. As the concentration of the surfactant is increased, a point is reached at which the unfavorable entropy contribution, from clustering the hydrophobic tails of the molecules, is overcome by a gain in entropy due to release of the solvation shells around the surfactant tails. At this point, the lipid tails of a part of the surfactants must be segregated from the water. Hence, they start to form micelles. In broad terms, above the CMC, the loss of entropy due to assembly of the surfactant molecules is less than the gain in entropy by setting free the water molecules that were [...] "trapped" [...] in the solvation shells of the surfactant monomers. Also important are enthalpic considerations, such as the electrostatic interactions that occur between the charged parts of surfactants.|$|E

Foam is a good mobility control agent in {{enhanced oil}} recovery for improving the mobility ratio. In the present work, the foaming behavior of three nonionic ethoxylated surfactants, namely Tergitol 15 -S- 7, Tergitol 15 -S- 9, and Tergitol 15 -S- 12, was studied experimentally. Among the surfactants, Tergitol 15 -S- 12 shows the highest foamability. The effect of NaCl concentration and synthetic seawater on foaming behavior of the surfactants was investigated by the test-tube shaking method. The <b>critical</b> <b>micelle</b> <b>concentrations</b> of aqueous solutions of the different nonionic surfactants were measured at 300  K.

40|$|Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) {{monomers}} or micelles {{in water}} {{give rise to}} a narrow, isotropic phosphorus- 31 NMR signal (40. 6 ppm; v 1 / 2 1. 7 Hz; 32. 2 MHz). Upon addition of praseodymium ions, the phosphorus signals are shifted downfield. However, the downfield shifts for the longer-chain lysophosphatidylcholines, which exist in the aggregated state, are far greater than those for the shorter-chain homologues, which exist as monomers. At a Pr 3 +/lysoPC molar ratio of 0. 5, the signals of C 12 lysoPC through C 18 lysoPC were shifted by 12. 1 ppm, whereas the signals of C 6 lysoPC and C 8 lysoPC were shifted by only 2. 26 ppm. This very pronounced difference in lanthanide-induced downfield shifts between micelles and monomers can be utilized to determine with accuracy lysoPC <b>critical</b> <b>micelle</b> <b>concentrations</b> (CMC) from downfield shift-vs. -concentration plots. The CMC values we determined were 57 mM for C 8 lysoPC, 5. 7 mM for C 10 lysoPC, and 0. 6 mM for C 12 lysoPC.

Gibbs energies of micellization (ΔmicG°) were calculated from the <b>critical</b> <b>micelle</b> <b>concentrations.</b> N-Acyl-N-alkylaldosylamines (acyl = acetyl/propionyl, aldosyl = glucosyl/lactosyl) and N-acyl-N-alkylamino- 1 -deoxyalditols (acyl = acetyl/propionyl, alditol = glucitol/lactitol) with alkyl chain lengths of 8, 10, and 12 carbon atoms show a 10 -fold decrease in cmc when {{the length of the}} chain is increased by two methylene groups. The enthalpograms for the C 8 analogs are more complicated than those for the C 10 and C 12 analogs. Therefore, the enthalpograms were modeled using a computer-based program which takes account of the nonideal properties of the solutions, yielding enthalpies of micelle formation. Increments in the thermodynamic parameters show satisfactory self-consistency. EachCH 2 group contributes - 2. 4 kJ mol- 1 to ΔmicH°, ΔmicG°(CH 2) is - 3. 0 kJ mol- 1 for each series, and TΔmicS°(CH 2) is 0. 7 kJ mol- 1 at 40 °C.
