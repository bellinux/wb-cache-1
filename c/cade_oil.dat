5000|$|Chemically, the cadinenes are bicyclic sesquiterpenes. The term cadinene has {{sometimes}} been used in a broad sense to refer to any sesquiterpene with the so-called cadalane (4-isopropyl-1,6-dimethyldecahydronaphthalene) carbon skeleton. Because of {{the large number of}} known double-bond and stereochemical isomers, this class of compounds has been subdivided into four subclasses based on the relative stereochemistry at the isopropyl group and the two bridgehead carbon atoms. [...] The name cadinene is now properly used only for the first subclass below, which includes the compounds originally isolated from <b>cade</b> <b>oil.</b> Only one enantiomer of each subclass is depicted, with the understanding that the other enantiomer bears the same subclass name.|$|E
40|$|Different {{doses of}} 12 plant {{extracts}} and 6 secondary plant metabolites were incubated for 24 h in diluted ruminal fluid with a 50 : 50 forage:concentrate diet. Treatments were: control (no additive), plant extracts (anise oil, <b>cade</b> <b>oil,</b> capsicum oil, cinnamon oil, clove bud oil, dill oil, fenugreek, garlic oil, ginger oil, oregano oil, tea tree oil, and yucca), and secondary plantmetab-olites (anethol, benzyl salicylate, carvacrol, carvone, cinnamaldehyde, and eugenol). Each treatment was supplied at 3, 30, 300, and 3, 000 mg/L of culture fluid. At 3, 000 mg/L, most treatments decreased total vola-tile fatty acid concentration, but <b>cade</b> <b>oil,</b> capsicum oil, dill oil, fenugreek, ginger oil, and yucca had no effect. Different doses of anethol, anise oil, carvone, and tea tree oil decreased {{the proportion of}} acetate and propio-nate, which suggests that these compounds may not be nutritionally beneficial to dairy cattle. Garlic oil (300 and 3, 000 mg/L) and benzyl salicylate (300 and 3, 000 mg/L) reduced acetate and increased propionate and butyrate proportions, suggesting that methane production was inhibited. At 3, 000 mg/L, capsicum oil, carvacrol, carvone, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamon oil, clove bud oil, eugenol, fenugreek, and oregano oil re-sulted in a 30 to 50 % reduction in ammonia N concen-tration. Careful selection and combination of these ex-tracts may allow the manipulation of rumen micro-bial fermentation. Key words: plant extract, rumen fermentatio...|$|E
40|$|Essential oils from {{thyme and}} cade {{have been shown}} to be {{effective}} acaricides against the poultry red mite. Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer) when tested over a 24 h period. Data on the actual rate of knock-down achieved with these products is lacking and potentially important as essential oils are likely to display only short-term toxicity. When tested over periods of less than 24 h, thyme essential oil killed D. gallinae relatively quickly and so may make for an effective acaricide even if the residual toxicity of this product is low. However, <b>cade</b> essential <b>oil</b> did not display such a high level of mite knock-down, suggesting it may hold less promise in D. gallinae management. Comparison of the results with those obtained elsewhere using alternative D. gallinae products further confirms the possibility that thyme essential may be useful in control of this pest. This might be especially true if thyme essential oil were employed as part of an integrated pest management approach...|$|R
40|$|Delivery of magistral (extemporaneous) {{preparations}} {{must comply}} with quality standards, {{as described in the}} "Guide to Good Officinal Pharmaceutical Practice" and the pharmacy's Quality Manual (Royal Decree of 21 January 2009). In this study, the shampoo Simplex Herdewijn, prepared with Texapon NSO, is compared with commercially available basic shampoos (Shampoo Fagron and Shampoo Simplex Conforma) with respect to its composition as well as its physicochemical properties. These basic shampoos were used to develop medicinal shampoos. The active compounds of these shampoos were: 0. 5 % hexachlorophene, 1 % ichtammol, 1 % <b>cade</b> <b>oil</b> or 2 % liquor carbonis detergens. The necessary concentration of Cetomacrogol 1000, required to solubilise the active compounds was determined, as well as the amount of sodium chloride needed to adjust the viscosity of the shampoo. The viscosity of the basic and medicinal shampoos was determined by means of rheograms and by calculating their apparent viscosity. Additionally, a number of fundamental aspects of the formulation of shampoos are discussed in this paper. The results can be useful to pharmacists as guidelines for the preparation of medicinal shampoos. Beside patient instruction and pharmaceutical care, the intrinsic quality of magistral preparations is a prerequisite for therapeutic activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of alternative approaches in ectoparasite management is currently required. Essential oils {{have been demonstrated}} to exhibit fumigant and topical toxicity {{to a number of}} arthropods. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the potential efficacy of ten essential oils against Sarcoptes scabiei. Methods The major chemical components of the oils were identified by GC-MS analysis. Contact and fumigation bioassays were performed on Sarcoptes mites collected from experimentally infected pigs. For contact bioassays, essential oils were diluted with paraffin to get concentrations at 10, 5, and even 1 % for the most efficient ones. The mites were inspected under a stereomicroscope 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after contact. For fumigation bioassay, a filter paper was treated with 100  μL of the pure essential oil. The mites were inspected under a stereomicroscope for the first 5 min, and then every 5 min until 1 h. Results Using contact bioassays, 1 % clove and palmarosa oil killed all the mites within 20 and 50 min, respectively. The oils efficacy order was: clove[*]>[*]palmarosa[*]>[*]geranium[*]>[*]tea tree[*]>[*]lavender[*]>[*]manuka[*]>[*]bitter orange[*]>[*]eucalyptus[*]>[*]Japanese cedar. In fumigation bioassays, the efficacy order was: tea tree[*]>[*]clove[*]>[*]eucalyptus[*]>[*]lavender[*]>[*]palmarosa[*]>[*]geranium[*]>[*]Japanese cedar[*]>[*]bitter orange[*]>[*]manuka. In both bioassays, <b>cade</b> <b>oil</b> showed no activity. Conclusion Essential oils, especially tea tree, clove, palmarosa, and eucalyptus oils, are potential complementary or alternative products to treat S. scabiei infections in humans or animals, as well as to control the mites in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Preparations of coal-tar and juniper tar (<b>cade</b> <b>oil)</b> {{that are}} used in the {{treatment}} of psoriasis are known to contain numerous potentially carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Evidence of covalent binding to DNA by components of these mixtures was sought in a) human skin biopsy samples from 12 psoriasis patients receiving therapy with these agents, b) human skin explants maintained in organ culture and treated topically with the tars, and c) the skin and lungs of mice treated with repeated doses of the formulations following the regimen used in the clinic. DNA was isolated from the human and mouse tissues and digested enzymically to mononucleotides. 32 P-Post-labeling analysis revealed the presence of aromatic DNA adducts in the biopsy samples at levels of up to 0. 4 fmol total adducts/μg DNA. Treatment of human skin in organ culture produced similar levels of adducts, while treatment with dithranol, a non-mutagenic therapeutic agent, resulted in chromatograms indistinguishable from those from untreated controls. In mouse skin, coaltar ointment and juniper tar gave similar DNA adduct levels, with a similar time-course of removal: maximum levels (0. 5 fmol/μg DNA) at 24 h after the final treatment declined rapidly to 0. 05 fmol/μg at 7 d, thereafter declining slowly over the succeeding 25 d. However, while coal-tar ointment produced only very low levels of adducts in mouse lung (< 0. 03 fmol/μg DNA), juniper tar produced adducts at a high level (0. 7 fmol/μg DNA) that were persistent in this tissue. These results provide direct evidence for the formation of potentially carcinogenic DNA damage in human and mouse tissue by components of these therapeutic tar preparations...|$|E
40|$|Bactrocera latifrons is a tephritid {{fruit fly}} (Diptera: Tephritidae) {{which has a}} host list of 59 plant species from 14 plant {{families}}, with over 70 % of the host plant species coming from the plant families Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae. Bactrocera latifrons is of primarily Asian distribution, but its range has expanded through introductions into Hawaii, Okinawa (Japan), Tanzania, and Kenya. The documented introductions into countries outside its native distribution show that this species poses a risk of introductions into other countries where it does not presently occur, particularly through the movement of infested fruit. As with other tephritid fruit fly species, establishment of B. latifrons can have significant economic consequences, including damage and loss of food production, as well as requirements for implementation of costly quarantine treatments to permit export of commodities susceptible to infestation by B. latifrons and inspection of susceptible imported commodities. Because of the economic importance of B. latifrons, reliable methods are needed to detect, monitor, and control this species. We conducted field trials with a wild B. latifrons population, supported by the invasive weed, turkeyberry, Solanum torvum (Solanaceae), to compare attractive- ness of prospective new lures with several attractants that have often been used for detection and/or monitoring of tephritid fruit flies. The tests reported here have again shown higher B. latifrons catch in traps baited with alpha-ionol + <b>cade</b> <b>oil</b> relative to traps baited with protein baits. Among the attractants to which {{both male and female}} B. latifrons are attracted, fly response is significantly better to a Solulys AST–based protein bait than to other attractants tested. Beyond this, {{there was no significant difference}} in catch among the (wet) torula yeast baited trap and four (dry) alternative attractants (ammonia, biolure, rainbow plug and cucumber volatile plug). This shows that these dry trap alternatives have a comparable ability to catch B. latifrons adults as a wet protein bait trap (though not comparable to a Solulys AST–based wet trap) ...|$|E
