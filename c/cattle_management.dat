40|$|Adoption of new <b>cattle</b> <b>management</b> {{practices}} by Indonesian smallholders occurs {{less as a}} ‘technology transfer’ in the classical sense {{but rather as a}} series of conscious decisions by farming households weighing risks and resources as well as matching innovations to livelihood strategies. This paper uncovers the context of decisions and communication of innovations by way of social networks. The research looks at two geographically distinct cases where new <b>cattle</b> <b>management</b> practices have been introduced. We apply the lens of a common sense framework initially introduced by Clifford Geertz. Smallholder decisions are analysed within a socio-cultural context and a particular set of resources, risks and livelihood objectives. We show that the respective value placed on land, cattle and food security is central to adoption of new <b>cattle</b> <b>management</b> techniques. Far from accepting everything novel, smallholders are selective and willing to make changes to their farming system if they do not conflict with livelihood strategies. Innovations are communicated through a range of existing social networks and are either matched to existing livelihood strategies or perceived as stepping-stones out of agriculture...|$|E

Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the TAMU Beef Cattle Short Course to determine characteristics of participants and evaluate what influence the course had with respect to participants' beef <b>cattle</b> <b>management.</b> Methodology: The course included concurrent workshops and two and one-half days of lectures, exhibits, and cattle demonstrations of proven and new beef <b>cattle</b> <b>management</b> practices. The participants consisted of beef cattle producers with operations of all sizes from Texas as well as some producers residing outside Texas. A survey instrument was designed to address overall satisfaction with the TAMU Beef Cattle Short Course, characteristics of the participants, and participants' current beef <b>cattle</b> <b>management</b> practices. Data were collected during August 6 - 8, 2001. The survey instrument was distributed throughout the course in an effort to increase response rate. The participants were asked to return the completed survey at the end of the course. The survey data were analyzed statistically using SPSS. Descriptive statistics were used to determine satisfaction with the current course, characteristics of participants, and participants' current management practices. Correlation techniques were used to illustrate any relationships between participant characteristics, knowledge levels, and practice adoption. Major Findings: The audience (95. 2 %) lived in Texas. The average age of the participants was 53, and 74. 3 % were male. Herd size varied greatly with the most common (46 %) herd size being less then 50 head. The participants spend an average of 55 % of their time ranching and receive approximately a quarter of their income from raising cattle. A majority (59 %) of the attendees were returning participants. Ninety-nine percent of the respondents reported that they were satisfied with the course, 98 % deemed the course as an important source of information, and 97. 6 % stated they would return to future courses.

Eighteen households of Jumja, Gedu and Chasilakha villages under Bongo geog of Chukha district having over hundred milking cows of different breed types were purposively selected and interviewed. All farms were also visited to observe their management practices. Results indicate that majority of farmer-herders periodically migrated their cattle and managed them under traditional "low input-low output system", {{allowing them to}} graze freely {{for most of the}} year in the natural grazing lands (tshadrog) in and around the broadleaf forests, while few farmer-herders with few heads of cattle or with cattle of higher Jersey inheritance open grazed in the vicinity of the homestead.
