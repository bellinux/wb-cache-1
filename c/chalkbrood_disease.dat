50|$|Ascosphaera is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Ascosphaeraceae. It was {{described}} in 1955 by mycologists Charles F. Splitoir and Lindsay S. Olive. Members of the genus are insect pathogens. The type species, A. apis, causes <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease</b> in honey bees. The reproductive ascospores of the fungus are produced within a unique structure, the spore cyst, or sporocyst.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chalkbrood</b> <b>disease</b> in M. rotundata, {{specifically}} larvae, {{was discovered}} in 1974 in Nevada. This disease occurs from exposure of M. rotundata to Ascosphaera aggregata, which is introduced into the nest cells through nectar and pollen provisions that females bring back from foraging visits. Signs of chalkbrood infection have been observed {{to occur in the}} fifth instar larva, leading to the milky appearance of the larval hemolymph and development of a pink, tan, or gray cast in the head or abdominal region. These changes are accompanied by the spread of pink, tan, or gray color throughout the body of the larva and dark-colored, fungal cysts appear under the cuticle.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to isolate and characterize bacterial strains associated with the gut of the hybrid Carniolan honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, and to determine their in vitro and in vivo potential against Ascosphaera apis, the causal organism of <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease,</b> with the purpose of exploring feasible biological control. Six bacterial strains were isolated from healthy worker honey bees by culture-dependent methods. Six fungal strains (A 3, A 4, A 7, A 8, A 9, and A 15) of A. apis were isolated from larvae suffering from <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease</b> on Yeast-Glucose-Starch agar (YGPSA) medium. All bacteria were identified by a combination of morphology, Gram stain, and 16 S rRNA sequence analysis, and fungal strains were identified by morphology and 5. 8 S rRNA. In vitro and in vivo inhibition assays were carried out to determine the ability of bacterial isolates to inhibit A. apis, the causal agent of <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease.</b> The analysis of 16 S rRNA sequences revealed that four bacterial strains (B 2, B 4, B 10, and B 100) belong to Bacillus subtilis species, and two strains (P 1 and P 5) belong to Pseudomonas fluorescence. Significant differences in antagonistic activity of all bacterial strains were observed. B. subtilis isolate B 2 showed the highest antagonistic activity, as measured by the inhibition zone against A. apis, followed by the P 1 strain of P. fluorescence. SEM analysis also supports the antagonistic activity of these bacteria against A. apis.

40|$|Abstract. American foulbrood, European foulbrood, <b>Chalkbrood</b> <b>diseases</b> and the {{varroa mite}} are all serious {{problems}} for beekeepers. These problem {{have led to}} the death of bee larvae and adults and ultimately in many cases severe economic loss. The most common method to treat these problems is through chemical treatments, however, such treatments are not generally acceptable due to the harmful chemical residues for the consumers. Here we pursue an alternative approach using essential oils studied in vitro. Lemon grass oil {{has been found to be}} the most effective agent against some microbial diseases and the parasitic mite. In this study we pursue an effective means to deliver the volatile oils by using porous ceramic materials as supporting media. In field trials, we used porous ceramics prepared using diatomaceous earth and activated charcoal as the main starting materials. The amount of activated charcoal was varied at 10, 20, 25, and 42. 1 g. to determine optimal adsorption and control emission of the volatile lemongrass oil...|$|R

40|$|Ascosphaera apis {{is one of}} {{the major}} fungal {{pathogens}} of honey bee broods and the causative agent of <b>Chalkbrood</b> <b>disease.</b> The factors responsible for the pathogenesis of <b>Chalkbrood</b> <b>disease</b> are still not fully understood, and the increasing resistance of A. apis to commonly used antifungal agents necessitates a search for new agents to control this disease. The in vitro antifungal activities of 27 plant essential oils against two isolates of A. apis (Aksu- 4 and Aksu- 9) were evaluated. Out of the 27 plant essential oils tested, 21 were found to be effective in killing both isolates of A. apis. Based on their minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values, the effective oils were grouped into three categories: highly effective, moderately effective and minimally effective. Mountain pepper oil, Kala Bhangra oil, spearmint oil, babuna oil, betel leaf oil, carrot seed oil, cumin seed oil and clove bud oil were highly effective, with MBC values between 50. 0  μg/mL and 600. 0  μg/mL. Mountain pepper was the most effective essential oil, with an MBC value of 50. 0  μg/mL. Citral and caryophyllene containing oils were the most effective with MIC 50  ppm.

40|$|INTRODUCTION:Honey bees, Apis mellifera, have {{a diverse}} {{community}} of pathogens. Previous research has mostly focused on bacterial brood diseases of high virulence, but milder diseases caused by fungal pathogens have recently attracted more attention. This interest has been triggered by partial evidence that co-infection with multiple pathogens {{has the potential}} to accelerate honey bee mortality. In the present study we tested whether co-infection with closely related fungal brood-pathogen species that are either specialists or non-specialist results in higher host mortality than infections with a single specialist. We used a specially designed laboratory assay to expose honey bee larvae to controlled infections with spores of three Ascosphaera species: A. apis, the specialist pathogen that causes <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease</b> in honey bees, A. proliperda, a specialist pathogen that causes <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease</b> in solitary bees, and A. atra, a saprophytic fungus growing typically on pollen brood-provision masses of solitary bees. RESULTS:We show {{for the first time that}} single infection with a pollen fungus A. atra may induce some mortality and that co-infection with A. atra and A. apis resulted in higher mortality of honey bees compared to single infections with A. apis. However, similar single and mixed infections with A. proliperda did not increase brood mortality. CONCLUSION:Our results show that co-infection with a closely related fungal species can either increase or have no effect on host mortality, depending on the identity of the second species. Together with other studies suggesting that multiple interacting pathogens may be contributing to worldwide honey bee health declines, our results highlight the importance of studying effects of multiple infections, even when all interacting species are not known to be specialist pathogens...|$|E

40|$|The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, {{represents}} a relevant productive livestock due to both hive products {{and to its}} indispensable role as commercial pollinator of many agricultural crops. In addition, honeybees contribute to the pollination of wild flowers, thereby helping the maintenance of natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Recently, the number of managed honeybee colonies has declined in both North America and Europe. Beside environmental causes, e. g. the loss of forage {{as a consequence of}} agricultural intensification, another cause is the increasing relevance of pests and diseases affecting honeybee colonies. In the honeybee, hygienic behaviour (HB) is a heritable phenotype that confers to the colony resistance to foulbrood <b>diseases,</b> <b>chalkbrood,</b> and the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Nurse bees manifesting HB are able to detect, uncap, and remove infested and/or parasitized pupae from the colony. The genetic and biochemical factors that drive the manifestation of this behaviour are under investigation. Therefore, the selection of such trait still relies on field assays. Heretofore, there are two main tests to measure HB: the Pin Killed Brood (PKB) test and the Freeze Killed Brood (FKB) test. Concerning the FKB test, a comparison between the standard FKB test and a variant of this method (E. Bonfanti) has been performed in order to optimize the methodology in terms of time, costs, feasibility and safety for the operator and to choose the best option for a subsequent large scale phenotypic characterization for genetic selection...|$|R

Therefore, utilizing qRT-PCR, we probed some of the immune related genes to determine whether the lack of up-regulation of their transcripts in our analysis can be attributed to lack of immune activation or to limitations of the cDNA-AFLP approach. Conclusions Using a combination of cDNA-AFLP and qRT-PCR analyses, we were able to determine several key transcriptional events that constitute the overall effort in the honey bee larvae to fight natural fungal infection. Honey bee transcripts identified in this study are involved in critical functions related to transcriptional regulation, apoptotic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, nutritional regulation, and RNA processing. We found that immune regulation of the anti-fungal responses in honey bee involves highly coordinated activation of both NF-κB signaling pathways, leading to production of anti-microbial peptides. Significantly, activation of immune responses in the infected bee larvae was associated with down-regulation of major storage proteins, leading to depletion of nutritional resources. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} transcriptome {{analysis of the}} fungus Ascosphaera apis, an economically important pathogen of the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) that causes <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease.</b> Our goals were to further annotate the A. apis reference genome and to identify genes that are candidates for being differentially expressed during host infection versus axenic culture. Results We compared A. apis transcriptome sequence from mycelia grown on liquid or solid media with that dissected from host-infected tissue. 454 pyrosequencing provided 252 [*]Mb of filtered sequence reads from both culture types that were assembled into 10, 087 contigs. Transcript contigs, protein sequences from multiple fungal species, and ab initio gene predictions were included as evidence sources in the Maker gene prediction pipeline, resulting in 6, 992 consensus gene models. A phylogeny based on 12 of these protein-coding loci further supported the taxonomic placement of Ascosphaera as sister to the core Onygenales. Several common protein domains were less abundant in A. apis compared with related ascomycete genomes, particularly cytochrome p 450 and protein kinase domains. A novel gene family was identified that has expanded in some ascomycete lineages, but not others. We manually annotated genes with homologs in other fungal genomes that have known relevance to fungal virulence and life history. Functional categories of interest included genes involved in mating-type specification, intracellular signal transduction, and stress response. Computational and manual annotations have been made publicly available on the Bee Pests and Pathogens website. Conclusions This comprehensive transcriptome analysis substantially enhances {{our understanding of the}} A. apis genome and its expression during infection of honey bee larvae. It also provides resources for future molecular studies of <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease</b> and ultimately improved disease management. </p...|$|E

40|$|Parasites {{are thought}} to be a major driving force shaping genetic {{variation}} in their host, and are suggested to be a significant reason for the maintenance of sexual reproduction. A leading hypothesis for the occurrence of multiple mating (polyandry) in social insects is that the genetic diversity generated within-colonies through this behavior promotes disease resistance. This benefit is likely to be particularly significant when colonies are exposed to multiple species and strains of parasites, but host-parasite genotypic interactions in social insects are little known. We investigated this using honey bees, which are naturally polyandrous and consequently produce genetically diverse colonies containing multiple genotypes (patrilines), and which are also known to host multiple strains of various parasite species. We found that host genotypes differed significantly in their resistance to different strains of the obligate fungal parasite that causes <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease,</b> while genotypic variation in resistance to the facultative fungal parasite that causes stonebrood disease was less pronounced. Our results show that genetic variation in disease resistance depends in part on the parasite genotype, as well as species, with the latter most likely relating to differences in parasite life history and host-parasite coevolution. Our results suggest that the selection pressure from genetically diverse parasites might be an important driving force in the evolution of polyandry, a mechanism that generates significant genetic diversity in social insects...|$|E

We investigated the fungistatic effect of cinnamic acid and pinocembrin on the pathogen Ascosphaera apis causing <b>chalkbrood</b> <b>disease</b> in bee colonies in the laboratory with an agar diffusion test on malt extract agar. The minimal fungicide inhibitory concentration was 0. 5 % for cinnamic acid and 1. 5 % for pinocembrin (MIC -values). Both substances were tested by individual application for adult bee tolerance {{in a range of}} dosages and for brood tolerance (L 1 - L 5) referring to the MIC values. The dermal toxicity of adult bees for cinnamic acid and pinocembrin was low, a maximum of 3. 3 % even in the highest dosage of 1000 μg (concentration 20 %) and 250 μg (concentration 5 %) per bee, respectively. The mortality rates showed no significant differences to the controls (z-test, p≤ 0. 05). First results on brood tolerability after application of test substances resulted in larval mortality but primarily in the group of young larvae. The mortality reduced simultaneous with the increasing larval weight. The total larval mortality 72 hours after the application over all stages was 28. 7 % for cinnamic acid and 13. 1 % for pinocembrin (positive control group 24. 8 %; negative control group 15. 4 %). The test groups showed no significant increased mortality compared to the control groups (z-test, p≥ 0. 05).
