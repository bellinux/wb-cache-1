5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a <b>convex</b> <b>lens)</b> was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E

25|$|The way {{in which}} the beam profile of a laser beam changes as it propagates is {{determined}} by diffraction. When the entire emitted beam has a planar, spatially coherent wave front, it approximates Gaussian beam profile and has the lowest divergence for a given diameter. The smaller the output beam, the quicker it diverges. It is possible to reduce the divergence of a laser beam by first expanding it with one <b>convex</b> <b>lens,</b> and then collimating it with a second <b>convex</b> <b>lens</b> whose focal point is coincident with that of the first lens. The resulting beam has a larger diameter, and hence a lower divergence.|$|E

25|$|The {{crystalline}} {{lenses of}} fishes' eyes are extremely convex, almost spherical, and their refractive indices {{are the highest}} of all the animals. These properties enable proper focusing of the light rays and in turn proper image formation on the retina. This <b>convex</b> <b>lens</b> gives the name to the fisheye lens in photography.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how a spatial soliton can exist, {{we have to make}} some considerations about a simple <b>convex</b> <b>lens.</b> As shown in the picture on the right, an optical field approaches the lens and then it is focused. The effect of the lens is to introduce a non-uniform phase change that causes focusing. This phase change {{is a function of the}} space and can be represented with , whose shape is approximately represented in the picture.|$|E
25|$|Electron lenses are {{designed}} {{to act in a}} manner emulating that of an optical lens, by focusing parallel electrons at some constant focal distance. Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use electromagnetic coils to generate a <b>convex</b> <b>lens.</b> The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as astigmatism, and worsens spherical and chromatic aberration. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys, such as permalloy. These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as magnetic saturation, hysteresis and permeability.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel method of {{fabricating}} nearly hemispherical polymer lenses using water droplets as moulds. Owing to the naturally forming meniscus of water, {{the surface of the}} lens is smooth. This technique allowed us to fabricate small lenses of diameter approximate to 1 mm, which makes them easy to integrate with lab-on-chip platforms. The focal length of the <b>convex</b> <b>lenses</b> was estimated to be approximate to 1 mm. Due to their hemispherical nature, these lenses have a high numerical aperture. The method is simple and cost effective as it eliminates the need for specialized and expensive equipment such as surface plasma cleaner. We fabricated both concave and <b>convex</b> <b>lenses</b> in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using water droplets and PDMS lenses as moulds...|$|R
2500|$|The {{use of a}} <b>convex</b> <b>lens</b> to form an enlarged/magnified {{image was}} most likely {{described}} in Ptolemy's Optics (which however only survives in a poor Arabic translation). Ptolemy's description of lenses was commented upon and improved by Ibn Sahl (10th century) and most notably by Alhazen (Book of Optics, ca. 1021).

2500|$|The Italian polymath Galileo Galilei was in Venice in June 1609 {{and there}} {{heard of the}} [...] "Dutch {{perspective}} glass" [...] by means of which distant objects appeared nearer and larger. Galileo states that he solved {{the problem of the}} construction of a telescope the first night after his return to Padua from Venice and made his first telescope the next day by fitting a <b>convex</b> <b>lens</b> in one extremity of a leaden tube and a concave lens in the other one. A few days afterwards, having succeeded in making a better telescope than the first, he took it to Venice where he communicated the details of his invention to the public and presented the instrument itself to the doge Leonardo Donato, who was sitting in full council. The senate in return settled him for life in his lectureship at Padua and doubled his salary.|$|E

60|$|I {{handed him}} over the watch with some slight feeling of {{amusement}} in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes {{and then with a}} powerful <b>convex</b> <b>lens.</b> I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back.|$|E

60|$|He {{had never}} {{said as much}} before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his {{indifference}} to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply {{it in a way}} which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a <b>convex</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
50|$|When a {{refractive}} error is corrected with spectacle lenses, the retinal images change size. It is magnified with <b>convex</b> <b>lenses</b> and minified with concave lenses. One difficulty, then, in prescribing glasses {{to an individual}} with a disparity in {{refractive error}} between the two eyes is that a disparity in image size between the two eyes may be created.|$|R
5000|$|Farsightedness: When {{the optics}} are too weak {{for the length}} of the eyeball, one has {{hyperopia}} or farsightedness. This can arise from a cornea or crystalline lens with not enough curvature (refractive hyperopia) or an eyeball that is too short (axial hyperopia). This can be corrected with <b>convex</b> <b>lenses</b> which cause light rays to converge prior to hitting the cornea.|$|R
50|$|Original bifocals were {{designed}} {{with the most}} <b>convex</b> <b>lenses</b> (for close viewing) in {{the lower half of}} the frame and the least <b>convex</b> <b>lenses</b> on the upper. Up until the beginning of the 20th century two separate lenses were cut in half and combined together in the rim of the frame. The mounting of two half lenses into a single frame led to a number of early complications and rendered such spectacles quite fragile. A method for fusing the sections of the lenses together was developed by Louis de Wecker at the end of the 19th century and patented by Dr. John L. Borsch, Jr. in 1908.Today most bifocals are created by molding a reading segment into a primary lens and are available with the reading segments in a variety of shapes and sizes.The most popular is the D-segment, 28 mm wideneeded. While the D-segment bifocal offers superior optics, an increasing number of people opt for progressive bifocal lenses.|$|R
60|$|Water Spectacles.--When a man {{opens his}} eyes under water, he can see nothing distinctly; but {{everything}} is as much out of focus, as if he looked, in air, through a pair of powerful spectacles that were utterly unsuited to him. He cannot distinguish {{the letters of the}} largest print in a newspaper advertisement; he cannot see the spaces between the outstretched fingers, at arm's length, in clear water; nor at a few inches' distance in water that is somewhat opaque. I read a short paper on this subject, at the British Association in 1865, in which I showed the precise cause of this imperfection of vision and how it might be remedied. If the front of our eyeballs had been flat, we should have had the power of seeing under water as clearly as in air; but instead of being flat, they are very convex, consequently our eye stamps a concave lens of high power into the water, and it is the seeing through this concave eyeglass which our eyeball makes for itself, that causes the indistinctness of our vision. Knowing the curvature of the eyeball, it is easy to calculate (as I did in the memoir mentioned above) the curvature of a <b>convex</b> <b>lens</b> of flint-glass that should, when plunged into water, produce effects of an exactly equal and contrary value, exactly neutralizing the effects of the concave eyeglass of water, if it were held immediately in front of the pupil of the eye. I have made several experiments with a view to obtaining serviceable spectacles, for seeing under water. The result is as follows:--experience has shown the distance from the eyeball at which spectacle-glasses can be most conveniently placed; now at that distance, the joint effect of the concave water-lens and the convex glass spectacle-lens, is to produce an opera-glass of exceedingly low magnifying power, that requires a small adjustment for accurate definition at different distances.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} pictorial {{evidence for}} the use of eyeglasses is Tommaso da Modena's 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Provence reading in a scriptorium. Another early example would be a depiction of eyeglasses found north of the Alps in an altarpiece of the church of Bad Wildungen, Germany, in 1403. These early glasses had <b>convex</b> <b>lenses</b> that could correct both hyperopia (farsightedness), and the presbyopia that commonly develops as a symptom of aging. It was not until 1604 that Johannes Kepler published the first correct explanation as to why <b>convex</b> and concave <b>lenses</b> could correct presbyopia and myopia.|$|R

Although Lippershey did not receive his patent, news of the new invention soon spread across Europe. The design of these early refracting telescopes consisted of a <b>convex</b> objective <b>lens</b> and a concave eyepiece. Galileo improved on this design the following year and applied it to astronomy. In 1611, Johannes Kepler described how a far more useful telescope could be made with a <b>convex</b> objective <b>lens</b> and a <b>convex</b> eyepiece <b>lens</b> and by 1655 astronomers such as Christiaan Huygens were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces.|$|R
