Measurements were made of N losses, N uptake and herbage DM yields. Result showed that manure type had a significant effect on N utilisation only for maize. N balances were negative in maize (approximately - 247 to - 10 kg N) compared to grass (approximately 5 - 158 kg N).

Two separate field experiments were conducted. In experiment (1), impact of three animal <b>manures</b> sources (<b>cattle,</b> sheep & poultry manures) and P levels was studied along with one control plot (no animal manure and P applied) as check was investigated. In experiment (2), three plant residues sources (peach leaves, garlic residues & wheat straw) and P levels was studied along with one control plot (no plant residues and P applied) as check. Both the experiments were carried out on small land farmer field at District Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (Northwest Pakistan) during summer 2015. The results revealed that in both experiments the control plot had significantly (p≤ 0. 05) less productivity than the average of all treated plots with organic sources and P level. The increase in P levels in both experiments (animal manure vs. plant residues) had resulted in higher rice productivity (90 = 60 > 30 > 0 kg P ha- 1). In the experiment under animal manures, application of poultry manure increased rice productivity as compared with sheep and <b>cattle</b> <b>manures</b> (poultry > sheep > <b>cattle</b> <b>manures).</b> In the experiment under plant residues, application of peach leaves or garlic resides had higher rice productivity over wheat straw (peach leaves = garlic residues > wheat straw).
