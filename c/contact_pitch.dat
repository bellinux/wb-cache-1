40|$|A local contact {{formation}} {{process and}} integration scheme {{have been developed}} for the fabrication of rear passivated point contact solar cells. Conversion efficiency of 19. 6 % was achieved using [*]mm, pseudo square, p-type single crystalline silicon wafers. This is a significant improvement when compared to unpassivated, full area aluminum back surface field solar cells, which exhibit only 18. 9 % conversion efficiency on the same wafer type. The effect of rear contact formation on cell efficiency was studied as a function of contact area and <b>contact</b> <b>pitch,</b> hence the metallization fraction. Contact shape and the thickness of Al-BSF layer were found to be heavily dependent on the laser ablation pattern and contact area. Simulated cell parameters as a function of metallization showed that there is a tradeoff between open circuit voltage and fill factor gains as the metallization fraction varies. The rear surface was passivated with an Al 2 O 3 layer and a capping layer. The rear surface contact pattern was created by laser ablation and the contact geometry was optimized to obtain voids free contact filling, resulting in a uniform back surface field. The efficiency gain in rear passivated cells over the reference cells is mainly due to improved short circuit current and open circuit voltage...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{more and}} more {{wearable}} electronic systems are being realized on flexible substrates. Main limiting factor for the mechanical flexibility of those wearable systems are typically the rigid components - especially the relatively large active components - mounted on {{top and bottom of}} the flex substrates. Integration of these active devices inside the flex multilayers will not only enable for a high degree of miniaturization but can also improve the total flexibility of the system. This paper now presents a technology for the 3 D embedding of ultra-thin active components inside standard flex laminates. Active components are first thinned down to 20 - 25 mu m, and packaged as an Ultra-Thin Chip Pack-age (UTCP). These UTCP packages will serve as flexible interposer: all layers are so thin, that the whole package is even bendable. The limited total pack-age thickness of only 60 mu m makes them also suitable for lamination in between commercial flex panels, replacing for example the direct die integration. A fan-out metallization on the package facilitates easy testing before integration, solving the KGD issue, and can also relax the chip <b>contact</b> <b>pitch,</b> excluding the need for very precise placement and the use of expensive, fine-pitch flex substrates. The technology is successfully demonstrated for the 3 D-integration of a Texas Instrument MSP 430 low-power microcontroller, inside the conventional double sided flex laminate of a wireless ECG system. The microcontrollers are first thinned down and UTCP pack-aged These pack-ages are then laminated in between the large panels of the flex multilayer stack and finally connected to the different layers of the flex board by metallized through-hole interconnects. The thinning down, the UTCP pack-aging and the 3 D-integration inside the commercial flex panels did not have any affect on the functionality of the TI microcontroller.

40|$|Performance {{requirements}} in high end microprocessors have increased tremendously {{in the last}} several years, leading to higher I/O counts and interconnect densities. As greater currents pass through the microprocessor interconnect, higher temperatures driven by Joule heating are expected to pose reliability risks to high pin count microprocessor sockets. In this study Joule heating and its effect on the reliability of stamped metal land grid array (LGA) sockets was investigated using a combination of experimental and numerical methods. A methodology to determine socket temperature environments under electrical loading was developed. Knowledge of socket operating temperatures can allow original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and socket manufacturers to test for and mitigate failure mechanisms under thermal aging. The factors that influence Joule heating and contribute to premature socket failure were examined. Processor temperature, contact alloy and <b>contact</b> <b>pitch</b> were all found to significantly influence socket temperatures driven by Joule heating, with the contact alloy and processor temperature having the most significant effects. The resulting temperatures at higher currents were found to significantly influence the mechanical properties of the polymer housing and adversely affect socket stress relaxation behavior. The properties of the polymer housing were found to be sensitive to temperature owing to its visco-elastic nature. Polymer housing relaxation was therefore identified as a principle contributor to failure in stamped metal sockets under high temperature environments. In {{the latter part of the}} study, numerical modeling was used to develop a methodology for assessing socket life expectancy under temperature and deformation loads. A full visco-elastic characterization of the polymer housing was conducted and the measured properties were subsequently used to model socket stress relaxation time to failure. The results of this study indicate that socket temperatures under electrical loading can be significantly higher than those called for by EIA test specifications for LGA sockets. Passing tests that are not stringent enough to account for worst case scenarios can pave the way for field failures. The methodology outlined in this dissertation may be used to determine socket temperature environments and their effect on socket life expectancy...|$|E

40|$|To {{reach the}} goal of grid parity, {{technology}} improvements to enhance the conversion efficiency of solar cells at similar or reduced manufacturing cost must be found. The research presented in this thesis describes industrially applicable high efficient Passivated Emitter and Rear Locally Diffused and Contacted (PERL) cell technology with a hydrogenated amorphous silicon and silicon nitride (a-Si:H/SiNx:H) layer stack for rear surface passivation. This thesis starts with studying the dependence of the film physical characteristics, chemical bond configurations, surface passivation quality and the thermal stability of the intrinsic a-Si:H on the deposition conditions. The deposition conditions include deposition time, deposition temperature and microwave power. This was done {{for the purpose of}} growing uniform films with good film quality and ideal surface passivation. The surface passivation properties of the intrinsic a-Si:H on a textured surface with relatively small pyramid size was also studied. As a result, an effective surface recombination velocity (Seff) below 8 cm/s was achieved on 1 &# 937;. cm boron doped p-type FZ wafers. The second part of this work focuses on developing a thermally stable a-Si:H/SiNx:H stack with good surface passivating property. The dependence of the surface passivating property and the thermal stability of the a-Si:H/SiNx:H stack on the deposition conditions of both layers was investigated for the purpose of optimizing these two aspects. With the optimized deposition conditions, excellent &# 964;eff values of 1. 7 ms was achieved on 1 &# 937;. cm p-type FZ wafers with an upper bound for the corresponding Seff of 5. 8 cm/s. The surface passivating quality of the optimized a-Si:H/SiNx:H stack remains stable for over 90 min at 400 °C which is sufficiently stable for the formation of metal contacting schemes that require relatively low metal sintering temperatures and the implementation of hydrogenation passivation processes. Optimized iVoc of 717 mV was achieved on cell precursors prior to laser-doping processes. As high as 54 % reflectance at 1200 nm indicates that the a-Si:/SiNx:H stack acts as a good rear reflector when combined with an overlying thin layer of Al. The third part of this work focuses on developing a rear localised metal contact in conjunction with the a-Si:H/SiNx:H passivated rear surface, based on laser-doping combined with a low temperature annealing step for an overlying Al layer. A 355 nm Q-Switched laser was selected as a suitable tool to form high quality local back surface field (LBSF) through the a-Si:H/SiNx:H stack. The quality of the LBSF, including the sheet resistance (R&# 9633;), doping profile and the recombination properties of the laser-doped LBSF were investigated {{in a wide range of}} laser parameters to optimize the process. As a result, an LBSF with R&# 9633; of about 5 &# 937;/&# 9633;, a surface doping concentration above 1020 cm- 3 and the lowest effective SRV in the LBSF region of 6400 cm/s was obtained with the lowest laser scanning speed and a relatively low laser power. The laser-induced defects in the LBSF region can be hydrogenated by the H atoms released from the passivating layers during a thermal annealing process, resulting in a remarkably reduced effective SRV to about 4600 cm/s. To avoid potential damage induced by Al during the thermal annealing process for ohmic contact formation, the influence of the capping SiNx:H layer thickness and the characteristics of the underlying a-Si:H layer on the performance of cell test structures was studied. Contact resistance (Rc) values as low as 2 m&# 937;. cm 2 were achieved after annealing for 20 min at temperatures ranging from 350 °C to 450 °C. The final stage of this work presents the development of the rear a-Si:H/SiNx:H passivated PERL cells with the developed a-Si:H/SiNx:H rear surface passivating stack and the rear local contacting scheme. Best cell efficiency of 20. 24 % with a Jsc of 40. 2 mA/cm 2 and Voc of 671 mV was achieved on 1. 8 - 2. 4 &# 937;. cm p-type commercial CZ wafers. To optimize the cell performance, the influence of the rear contact pattern on the electrical performance, including point contact patterns and line contact patterns, was studied. It was found that, by using closer spaced point <b>contact</b> <b>pitch,</b> the Rs can be effectively reduced, which therefore improves the FF. However this leads to increased dark saturation current and hence reduced Voc and Jsc. As a compromise, the highest efficiency of 20. 3 % was achieved on the cell with an optimal point <b>contact</b> <b>pitch</b> of 0. 4 mm.

These are essential in teaching-learning process. Teachers can utilize a variety of verbal and non-verbal skills to aid students comprehension of difficult conceptsIt was an experimental study that looked into the impact of non-verbal communication on the learning outcomes of students of 9 th and 10 th classes in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This study highlighted the importance of non-verbal communication in the subject of English (Compulsory) of classes (IX-X), further it explored the impact of non-verbal communication on students' learning by observing teachers and students in classrooms and;finding out how this mechanism contributed to better learning outcomes of students. The study examined the hypotheses that there is an impact of nonverbal communication on students learning outcomes both in rural and urban areas; and there is an impact of non-verbal communication on the learning outcomes of male and female students. Population of the study included students and teachers of 103 Govt. secondary schools in rural and urban areas of Peshawar. The sample included 2 teachers and 40 students from each school in the subject of English (Compulsory). The total number of sample teachers and students is 40 and 800 respectively. Tools of the data collection were questionnaires and experiment in the actual classrooms setting. The significance difference between pre and post tests of the control and experimental groups was tested through paired t-test. Furthermore the questionnaires were interpreted with the help of frequency and percentagemethods, while the correlation between teachers and studentsquestionnaires was carried out through Gamma correlation. The important conclusions indicated that teachers made the learning environment active through their non-verbal communication whereby students felt alert in the classrooms and participated in the learning process, which consequently enhanced the level of their retention and understanding. Proper use of facial expressions, movements, eye <b>contact,</b> <b>pitch</b> of voice, and spatial distance helped the teachers to provide better understanding to the students in the attainment of their learning outcomes.

40|$|The {{suspension}} system {{of a vehicle}} is conventionally designed such that the spring-damper element is configured in the vertical direction, and the longitudinal connection between the vehicle chassis and wheels is always very stiff compared to the vertical one. This mechanism can isolate vibrations and absorb shocks efficiently in the vertical direction but cannot attenuate the longitudinal impacts caused by road obstacles. In order to overcome such a limitation, a planar {{suspension system}} (PSS) is proposed. This novel vehicle suspension system has a longitudinal spring-damper strut between the vehicle chassis and wheel. The dynamic performance, including ride comfort, pitch dynamics, handling characteristics and total dynamic behaviour, of a mid-size passenger vehicle equipped with such planar suspension systems is thoroughly investigated and {{compared with those of}} a conventional vehicle. To facilitate this investigation, various number of vehicle models are developed considering the relative longitudinal motions of wheels with respect to the chassis. A 4 -DOF quarter-car model is used to conduct a preliminary study of the ride quality, and a pitch plane half-car model is employed to investigate the pitch dynamics in both the frequency and time domain. A 5 -DOF yaw plane single-track half-car model along with a pitch plane half-car model is proposed to carry out the handling performance study, and also an 18 -DOF full-car model is used to perform total dynamics study. In addition to these mathematical models, virtual full-car models are constructed in Adams/car to validate the proposed mathematical models. For the sake of prediction of the tire-ground interaction force, a radial-spring tire model is modified by adding the tire damping to generate the road excitation forces due to road disturbances in the vertical and longitudinal directions. A dynamic 2 D tire friction model based on the LuGre friction theory is modified to simulate the dynamic frictional interaction in the tire-ground <b>contact</b> <b>pitch.</b> The ride quality of a PSS vehicle is evaluated in accordance with the ISO 2631 and compared with that of a conventional vehicle. It is shown that the PSS system exhibits good potential to attenuate the impact and isolate the vibration due to road excitations in both the vertical and longitudinal directions, resulting in improved vehicles’ ride and comfort quality. The relatively soft longitudinal strut can absorb the longitudinal impact and, therefore, can protect the components. The investigation of handling performance including the steady-state handling characteristics, transient and frequency responses in various scenarios demonstrates that the PSS vehicle is directionally stable and generally has comparable handling behaviour to a similar conventional vehicle. The application of PSS in vehicles can enhance the understeer trend, i. e. the understeer becomes more understeer, neutral steer becomes slightly understeer, and oversteer becomes less oversteer. The total dynamic behaviour combining the bounce, pitch, roll and the longitudinal dynamics under various scenarios such as differential brake-in-turn and asymmetric obstacle traversing was thoroughly investigated. Simulation results illustrate that the PSS vehicle has a relatively small roll angle in a turning manoeuvre. In some cases such as passing road potholes, the PSS vehicle has a better directional stability...|$|E

40|$|For many years, the {{photovoltaic}} {{industry has}} been using Al to form the back contact of crystalline silicon solar cells. The objective of this PhD is to reach {{a better understanding of}} the contact formation at the rear side of the Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) type solar cell. This type of cell features at the rear side a stack of dielectrics as a passivation layer which is pre-opened in order to allow the subsequent metallization step. The way this dielectric stack is opened, by laser ablation, the deposition of the metal, with various techniques, and the high temperature step required for the formation of the Al-Si alloy which serves as a contact, will be investigated in this work. It will be demonstrated that Si dissolution in Al plays an important role in the formation of the contacts, giving on one hand the needed dopants to create an effective Back Surface Field (BSF) layer, and on the other hand forming a deep pyramidal shape in the contact region which might affect the reflection of the light inside in the cell, and increase the surface recombination velocity of the device. A novel method to characterize the local Al-Si alloy formation is introduced, allowing the in-situ observation of the high temperature step for the contact formation. By doing this, details of the process which cannot be taken into account once the device is finished, are studied and explained through hypotheses involving the phase diagram between both elements. The performance at cell level of the different combination of parameters affecting the formation of the BSF region has been evaluated. For this, changes in <b>contact</b> <b>pitch,</b> firing temperature and profile, Al thickness and composition are studied for the PERC cells. At the end, the rear reflectance loss mechanisms are also investigated by altering the dielectric layers used for passivation, together with the study of the effect of Si incorporation during the firing step, showing that this Si presence at the back side is the main responsible for the loss observed.

[...] Close-up camera work of the following descriptions can be viewed for example at:. [...] Both Walsh & Ambrose used a forward wrist flick that imparted back-spin to the ball as it left the hand. [...] However, significantly, their choice of finger position causes the ball to exhibit precession (similar to a gyroscope), with the seam remaining broadly upright but oscillating repeatedly between a 5 o'clock & 7 o'clock position (if viewed {{from the bottom of}} the seam). [...] This effectively destroys seam induced swing (as the ball is constantly changing between outswing & inswing seam positions through the air). [...] Thus, the ball travels straight onto the pitch (in theory allowing the bowler to be more accurate). [...] However, when the seam of the ball <b>contacts</b> the <b>pitch</b> at the 5 o'clock position, the result is movement to the left (away to the right-handed batsman), when the seam of the ball <b>contacts</b> the <b>pitch</b> at the 7 o'clock position, the result is movement to the right (in to the right-handed batsman). [...] It can be seen that only rarely would the ball be at the purely 6 o'clock position to continue completely straight after pitching. [...] This aligns with the unpredictable nature of seam bowling, but appears primarily driven by the technique of the bowler, rather than irregularities in the pitch surface.|$|R

5000|$|About {{two years}} before the series premiered on NBC, Guy Fieri's agent, who had {{attended}} a meeting in France, <b>contacted</b> him, <b>pitching</b> to him the idea of hosting the show. Fieri was eventually chosen to host the series, and the show premiered with two back-to-back episodes on March 14, 2010, airing 27 new episodes through September of that year. The second season, which consisted of 41 episodes, began on December 7, 2010 with a Christmas special. Executive producers for the NBC versions included Craig Plestis, Tim Puntillo, Mattias Olsson, Jock Millgårdh and Estelle Bodén. On May 13, 2012, NBC canceled the series, electing not to renew it for a third season.|$|R
