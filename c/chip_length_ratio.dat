Milling experiments at various cutting speeds and <b>chip</b> <b>lengths</b> were performed, which resulted to different tool wear developments. To explain these results, a FEM simulation of the cutting process was conducted and the related chip geometries were predicted and compared to the corresponding experimental ones. Based on these results, the Coulomb friction coefficient between chip and tool rake was appropriately adjusted to achieve a sufficient correlation between experimental and computational data. By additional FEM calculations, the mechanical and thermal loads of the cutting edge were estimated and insight was provided concerning the effect of <b>chip</b> <b>length</b> on coated tool stresses and film fatigue fracture. The obtained results revealed that the <b>chip</b> <b>length</b> reduction improves the cutting performance of coated tools and a significant increase of the removed material volume and material removal rate as well can be achieved. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{proportion}} {{of increase in}} mean length in stream segments of two successive watersheds orders is defined as <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> (Singh 1978). The <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> values obtained for the watersheds {{of the study area}} range from 0.37 (watershed 29) to 3.77 (watershed 24). Higher <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> values (>[*] 1.5) were observed for watersheds 9, 16, 17, 24, 27 and 35. The lower <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> values (<[*] 0.5) were observed for 4, 5, 7, 15, 25, 30, 34 and 36. <b>Length</b> <b>ratios</b> are found to be moderate in other watersheds. According to Kumaraswamy and Sivagnanam (1988), the larger <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> values indicate lower order sources for the next higher order streams, whereas the smaller values indicate the limited length of lower order streams to serve as hydrological sources. The watersheds 9, 16, 17, 24, 27 and 35 contain more lower order sources for the next higher order, whereas for watersheds 4, 5, 7, 15, 25, 34 and 36 the lower order sources are relatively less.|$|R

40|$|Alignment of {{parallel}} corpora {{is a crucial}} step prior to training statistical language models for machine translation. This paper investigates compression-based methods for aligning sentences in an English-Chinese parallel corpus. Four metrics for matching sentences required for measuring the alignment at the sentence level are compared: the standard sentence <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> (SLR), and three new metrics, absolute sentence length difference (SLD), compression code <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> (CR), and absolute compression code length difference (CD). Initial experiments with CR show that using the Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) compression scheme, a method that also performs well at many language modeling tasks, significantly outperforms the other standard compression algorithms Gzip and Bzip 2. The paper then shows that for sentence alignment of a parallel corpus with ground truth judgments, the compression code <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> using PPM always performs better than sentence <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> and the difference measurements also work better than the ratio measurements...|$|R

30|$|It is {{the ratio}} of the mean length of streams of one order to that of the next higher order. It tends to be {{constant}} throughout the successive orders of a watershed (Horton 1945). Estimation of <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> and the mean <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> for the various stream orders of the watersheds and for each watershed were made. Variations in <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> exist between successive stream orders in all the watersheds of the study area and such differences are commonly observed in several other studies (Horton 1945; Mesa 2006). These differences are attributed mainly due to differences in slope and topographic conditions within the watersheds. Among the watersheds of the study area, the mean <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> is found to range from 0.41 (for Belur watershed) to 3.37 (Gangavalli watershed). The ratio is low (≤  0.50) in Belur, Kalungi and Valaiyur watersheds and high (>  0.90) in Gangavalli, Maruvattur and Koneri watersheds.

The weight: <b>length</b> <b>ratios</b> of adults, V and IV stage nymphs correlated with their time since feeding. The weight: <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> of V stage nymphs correlated with their life expectancy expressed as days until moulting to the adult stage. The weight: <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> of wild females measured on capture did not correlate with the number of eggs laid during the next 30 days, but after feeding on chicken in the laboratory this correlation was shown. The mean weight: <b>length</b> <b>ratio</b> of different classes of bugs was used to compare the nutritional status of T. infestans populations in three rural houses in central Brazil. One house was recently constructed, containing a newly-established popu-lation of bugs. One house was over 15 years old, containing a long-established bug population. The third house had been abandoned for six months and the bug population was in decline. The three houses were carefully demolished to allow a large sample of bugs to be collected from each. The mean weight: <b>length</b> <b>ratios</b> of adults, unfed V stage, fed and unfed IV stage, and fed and unfed III stage nymphs from the newly-colonized house were significantly higher than those of corresponding classes of bugs from the long-established bug population, and from the declining bug population.
