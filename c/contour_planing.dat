40|$|The {{human brain}} is an {{extremely}} complex system performing demanding information processing tasks rapidly. It consists of billions of neurons, each connected to others through thousands of synapses or interconnections. This huge network has many electric and chemical processes that {{can be measured in}} various ways. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a technique of measuring and recording the minute and very weak magnetic fields generated by the currents in the neurons. There are two types of problems in MEG, the forward problem and the backward or the inverse problem. The forward problem deals with finding the magnetic fields when the current source distribution is given or known. On the other hand, the inverse problem is to find the neural current source distribution given a series of magnetic fields measurements. This study has proposed the model FTTM 2 (Fuzzy Topographic Topological Mapping Version 2) which is an extension to the novel mathematical modeling FTTM 1 (Fuzzy Topographic Topological Mapping Version 1). The model FTTM 2 comprises four components namely the Image <b>Contour</b> <b>Plane</b> (IC), Base Image Plane (BI), Fuzzy Image Field (FI) and Topographic Image Field (TI). In the process of applying FTTM 2, emphasis is made on its first component, the IC where two different algorithms are being applied to the data. The first is the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm which is used to determine the region where the current sources lie and also to approximate the number of current sources. The second is the seed-based region growing (SBRG) algorithm which is used to confirm the number of current sources available in the system by automation. Two theorems and three corollaries are derived and proven as theoretical basis of the proposed system. Finally, FTTM 2 is tested on the generated and experimental data and subsequently verified using forward and backward calculations...|$|R

Three injection geometries were assessed: cylindrical holes with stream-wise injection, cylindrical holes with cross-stream injection, and fan-shaped holes. The data demonstrated that the cylindrical holes produced discrete jets, which lifted off the surface at high coolant-to-mainstream momentum flux ratios; these jets were characterised by the kidney-shaped stream-tubes expected for injection into cross-flow. The jets injected with cross-stream momentum exhibited a more obvious kidney-shaped cross-section, which rotated with distance downstream of injection. The jets from the fan-shaped holes were attached to the surface even at high momentum flux ratios, were more diffuse, and exhibited two cores of high temperature.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the design, implementation, evaluation and original enhancements to the Live-Wire method for 2 D and 3 D image segmentation. Live-Wire 2 D employs a semi-automatic paradigm; the user {{is asked to}} select a few boundary points of the object to segment, to steer the process in the right direction, while the result is displayed in real time. In our implementation segmentation is extended to three dimensions by performing this process on a slice-by-slice basis. User's time and involvement is further reduced by allowing him to specify object <b>contours</b> in <b>planes</b> orthogonal to the slices. If these planes are chosen strategically, Live-Wire 3 D can perform 2 D segmentation in the plane of each slice automatically. This report also proposes two improvements to the original method, path heating and a new graph edge feature function based on variance of path properties along the boundary. We show that these improvements lead up to a 33 % reduction in interaction with the user, and improved delineation in presence of strong interfering edges. Comment: University of Oxford B. A.

On this volatility <b>contour</b> <b>plane,</b> we observe characteristics of "VIX location line" (i. e. zero value relative with daily VIX index) in various VIX levels, and find out its flow path is independent of VIX level, but relate to underlying index variation. We then define DLTvix as Black-Scholes Delta deviation between ATM and VIX location line projection component along Delta moneyness axis. We state that DLTvix can be considered as option participators'expectation on underlying index return over the next 30 calendar days. For the put (call) option, DLTvix is negative (positive); and the lower (higher) value of DLTvix, represents the less (more) expected return. We calculate DLTvix and RT 30 (index return over the next 30 calendar days) from 2006 / 12 / 01 to 2010 / 02 / 28, a total of 802 trading days. These results computed by OLS regression model show that, DLTvix have statistically significant predictive power on RT 30.
