5|$|Broadly speaking, Anons oppose Internet <b>censorship</b> and control, and the {{majority}} of their actions target governments, organizations, and corporations that they accuse of <b>censorship.</b> Anons were early supporters of the global Occupy movement and the Arab Spring. Since 2008, a frequent subject of disagreement within Anonymous is whether members should focus on pranking and entertainment or more serious (and, in some cases, political) activism.|$|E

5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based <b>censorship</b> of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for <b>censorship.</b> Not in Front of the Children concludes that <b>censorship</b> under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the <b>censorship</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a history of <b>censorship</b> of artworks. The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating <b>censorship,</b> as a method of diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that <b>censorship</b> of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins describes for the reader the history of the 1873 Comstock laws. It's stated that,"such laws were put forth by United States Postal Inspection Service inspector Anthony Comstock, and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail".|$|E
5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy: A Guide to America's <b>Censorship</b> Wars is a non-fiction book by {{lawyer and}} civil libertarian Marjorie Heins {{that is about}} {{freedom of speech and}} the <b>censorship</b> of works of art in the early 1990s by the U.S. government. The book was {{published}} in 1993 by The New Press. Heins provides an overview of the history of <b>censorship,</b> including the 1873 Comstock laws, and then moves on to more topical case studies of attempts at suppression of free expression.|$|E
5|$|The Free Expression Policy Project {{was founded}} by Marjorie Heins, who became its initial director. It was formed as a nonprofit {{organization}}. Founded in 2000, the organization formed with goals of assisting researchers with assembling information related to freedom of speech, media democracy, and copyright, and advocating for these issues. It started as {{an outgrowth of the}} National Coalition Against <b>Censorship.</b> Prior to founding the organization, Heins served as director of the Art <b>Censorship</b> Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. The FEPP monitors incidents of <b>censorship</b> against artists, and is based in Manhattan, New York.|$|E
5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing <b>censorship.</b> She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of <b>censorship.</b> Heins advises the impact on society from <b>censorship</b> could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E
5|$|The book {{argues that}} artists have been scapegoated by those advocating <b>censorship,</b> {{as a method}} of {{deflecting}} debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that <b>censorship</b> of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of <b>censorship</b> and suppression of dissent.|$|E
5|$|The success {{prompted}} the ACLU to broaden their {{freedom of speech}} efforts beyond labor and political speech, to encompass movies, press, radio and literature. The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from <b>Censorship</b> in 1931 to coordinate this effort. By the early 1930s, <b>censorship</b> in the United States was diminishing.|$|E
5|$|David Darts {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in {{an article}} for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over {{time in the history}} of <b>censorship.</b> He observed that the rationale for justifying <b>censorship</b> of artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|Evasion of the <b>censorship</b> – in his {{correspondence}} with his brother-in-law, Speyer had used various means including aliases and intermediaries {{to avoid the}} censor inspecting his letters.|$|E
5|$|Films {{produced}} {{under such}} <b>censorship</b> could only introduce homosexuality as a disguised undercurrent, and still flirted with controversy in doing so, {{such as in}} the cult horror film White Zombie.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that <b>censorship</b> of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for <b>censorship.</b> Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in <b>censorship</b> choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at the National Coalition Against <b>Censorship.</b> In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based <b>censorship</b> of material on the Internet was far too broad and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National Coalition Against <b>Censorship</b> and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the FCC {{revealed}} the Parents Television Council {{as the primary}} source of most content complaints received. Throughout its existence, the Parents Television Council has been accused of promoting <b>censorship.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of <b>censorship</b> in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of {{nothing of the sort}} having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual <b>censorship</b> had occurred within the game.|$|E
5|$|The New Walford Guide to Reference Resources {{praised the}} FEPP website for its links to {{resources}} {{on freedom of}} expression and <b>censorship.</b> FEPP has been characterized by the Austin American-Statesman as a think tank devoted to researching the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Denver Post described the organization as a <b>censorship</b> , and a separate article from the same newspaper called it a left-of-center politically aligned group, which advocated for both intellectual freedom and artistic freedom.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartheid}} government greatly limited {{freedom of}} expression, through <b>censorship,</b> reduced economic freedom, and reduced mobility for black people. However, {{it did not}} have the resources to effectively enforce <b>censorship</b> of written and recorded material. The government established the Directorate of Publications in 1974 through the Publications Act, but this body only responded to complaints, and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it. Less than one hundred pieces of music were formally banned by this body in the 1980s. Thus music and performance {{played an important role in}} propagating subversive messages.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on VCD and DVD in Indonesia on 14 July 2010 by EZY Home Entertainment, after passing through the <b>censorship</b> board in February. The DVD featured English-language subtitles and a behind the scenes documentary.|$|E
5|$|To voice her {{disapproval of}} the banning and unbanning of the book, Gordimer {{published}} What Happened to Burger's Daughter or How South African <b>Censorship</b> Works, {{a book of}} essays written by her and others. It was published in Johannesburg in 1980 by Taurus, a small underground publishing house established in the late-1970s to print anti-apartheid literature and other material South African publishers would avoid for fear of <b>censorship.</b> Its publications were generally distributed privately or sent to bookshops {{to be given to}} customers free to avoid attracting the attention of the South African authorities.|$|E
5|$|With {{the passage}} of the Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Communications Commission was {{chartered}} to monitor the radio and TV industries, meaning broadcasts were subject to <b>censorship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apple's App Store, which {{provides}} iPhone and iPad applications, imposes <b>censorship</b> of content, {{which has become}} an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use the platform. The Guardian newspaper described the role of Apple as analogous to that of British magazine distributor WH Smith, which for many years imposed content restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Author Marjorie Heins, an {{attorney}} {{with a focus on}} civil liberties, received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1967. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, receiving a juris doctor degree in 1978. At the time of the book's publication, Heins was director of the Free Expression Policy Project at the National Coalition Against <b>Censorship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of film <b>censorship</b> and social research seeming to indicate that movies which were seen to be immoral could promote bad behavior, was enough pressure to force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.|$|E
5|$|Born in a {{small town}} in the state of Veracruz, Martínez Pérez left her {{hometown}} to study journalism at Universidad Veracruzana. After graduating from university, she went to work at a state-owned television company in Chiapas in the early 1980s, but she encountered various forms of <b>censorship</b> that convinced her to pursue a career in print media. After five years in Chiapas, Martínez Pérez relocated to Veracruz and worked for several local newspapers. In Veracruz, Martínez Pérez faced several challenges of <b>censorship</b> by the political establishment for her direct reporting, and particularly for being an outspoken critic of human rights violations, government corruption, abuse of authority, and for her in-depth coverage of the drug trafficking organizations that operate in Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government <b>censorship</b> as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private <b>censorship</b> can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Censorship</b> {{and musical}} rights issues kept a complete, {{pristine}} version of Witchfinder General from being released on videotape, laserdisc or DVD for many years. Although uncensored theatrical prints {{have been available}} for archival showings in the US for several years, video releases of the title were repeatedly compromised.|$|E
5|$|<b>Censorship</b> was {{commonplace in}} the early 20th century. State laws and city {{ordinances}} routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization. Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass <b>censorship</b> of art and literature. In that year, H. L. Mencken deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned American Mercury magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal. The ACLU {{went on to win}} additional victories, including the landmark case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book Ulysses by James Joyce. The ACLU only achieved mixed results {{in the early}} years, and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the Roth v. United States and Memoirs v. Massachusetts cases.|$|E
5|$|Conditions {{improved}} slightly {{after the}} death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the <b>censorship</b> and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him {{as the head of the}} mathematics department.|$|E
5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy {{to hold it in}} a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the <b>censorship</b> is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.|$|E
5|$|Dubček’s {{relaxation}} of <b>censorship</b> {{ushered in a}} brief period of freedom of speech and the press. The first tangible manifestation of this new policy of openness was the production of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literarni noviny, renamed Literarni listy.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tool's {{incorporation}} {{of visual arts}} and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by <b>censorship,</b> and the band's insistence on privacy.|$|E
5|$|During Romania's {{restrictive}} communist period, {{which lasted}} between 1948 and 1989, the critical evaluation of Ion Creangă's work went through several periods, complementing political developments. Throughout {{the first part}} of this interval, when socialist realism was politically imposed on Romanian letters, Creangă was spared the posthumous <b>censorship</b> which affected several other classical writers (see <b>Censorship</b> in Communist Romania). His work was officially praised for its aesthetic qualities, but its association with the condemned Junimea was omitted from critical commentary, and readers were instead referred to Creangă as a realist critical of bourgeois society. In 1948, the new authorities granted him posthumous membership in the Romanian Academy. The following year, at the height of Soviet occupation, official critic Barbu Lăzăreanu controversially described Creangă as a writer indebted to Russian folklore.|$|E
