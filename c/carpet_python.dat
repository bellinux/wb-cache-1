5|$|Reptiles {{recorded}} on North Island include Binoe's prickly gecko (Heteronotia binoei), the gecko Christinus marmoratus, the Jew lizard (Pogona barbata), King's skink (Egernia kingii), the western limestone ctenotus (Ctenotus australis), the western worm lerista (Lerista praepedita), the common dwarf skink (Menetia greyii), and the Abrolhos bearded dragon (Pogona minor minima). The <b>carpet</b> <b>python</b> was reported as {{present on the}} island in very low numbers before 1960, but {{it has never been}} observed there by naturalists, and is now absent.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, five tammar {{wallabies}} {{were introduced}} onto North Island, {{and the population}} established successfully. Possible reasons for this success include {{the absence of the}} wallabies' natural predator, the <b>carpet</b> <b>python</b> (Morelia spilota imbricata); the availability of additional food and water from the fishers' huts, which are occupied during the harshest time of the year; and the presence of the air strip, which apparently provides additional food for them. By the 2000s, there were over 450 tammar wallabies on the island. The wallabies overgrazed and ringbarked the native vegetation, particularly the area burnt in 1935, thus reducing vegetation cover and causing a serious decline in populations of some plant species. In 2003, island residents asked the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM; now the Department of Environment and Conservation) for help in managing the issue. CALM staff visited the island in April and May of that year and produced a report recommending an investigation into controlling population levels by the use of implanted contraceptives. Exploration of this option began in 2005, but in July 2007 the research was discontinued. Around 60 wallabies were removed to educational institutions for research purposes, and culling began. By February 2008, the wallaby population had been reduced to around 25 individuals.|$|E
25|$|The Reptile Encounter {{was opened}} on World Environment Day in 1997. It {{contains}} 17 exhibits designed {{to match the}} animal's natural habitat. The building is climate controlled, and displays reptile species {{from around the world}} including examples of the black-headed python, dugite, frilled dragon, turtle, olive python, perentie, pygmy python, reticulated python, south-west <b>carpet</b> <b>python,</b> tiger snake, Merten's water monitor, blue-tongued skink, spiny-tailed lizard, and woma.|$|E

25|$|The {{two small}} Western Australia populations {{apparently}} {{were able to}} survive because both areas have many hollow logs that may serve as refuge from predators. Being diurnal, the numbat is much more vulnerable to predation than most other marsupials of a similar size: its natural predators include the little eagle, brown goshawk, collared sparrowhawk and <b>carpet</b> <b>python.</b> When the Western Australia government instituted an experimental program of fox baiting at Dryandra (one of the two remaining sites), numbat sightings increased {{by a factor of}} 40.|$|E
25|$|Some of the mammals {{found in}} the Great Western Woodlands region include the greater long-eared bat (Nyctophilus timoriensis), western brush wallaby (Macropus irma), red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura), and the western quoll or chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii). Some of the {{reptiles}} {{found in the}} region include the <b>carpet</b> <b>python</b> (Morelia spilt imbricata), the western bearded dragon (Pogona minor minima), and the common slender blue tongue (Cyclodomorphus branchialis). Birds found in the region include the Australian bustard (Ardeotis australis), the bush stone-curlew (Burins grallarius), Carnaby’s cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris), and the malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).|$|E
2500|$|... 23 {{terrestrial}} reptile {{species are}} known to occur on the islands of the Houtman Abrolhos. This relatively low biodiversity is apparently due to the homogeneity of habitat on the islands, which provide few distinct ecological niches. The most significant terrestrial reptile species are the spiny-tailed skink (Egernia stokesii stokesii) and the <b>carpet</b> <b>python</b> (Morelia spilota imbricata), {{both of which are}} listed as rare and therefore afforded special protection under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950; and the Abrolhos dwarf bearded dragon (Pogona minor minima), a Houtman Abrolhos endemic that is listed as a Priority 4 species by the Department of Environment and Conservation. For a full list of species, see list of reptiles of the Houtman Abrolhos.|$|E
50|$|Areas {{adjacent}} to the Forbes River were {{an important source of}} logging timber with several sawmills operating along the river.

In a further 23 pythons we used a refinement of the technique, which anchored the tracking device, using non-dissolvable sutures, to the snake's rib-cage.

2500|$|Numbats are {{insectivores}} and eat {{an exclusive}} diet of termites. An adult numbat requires up to 20,000 termites each day. The only marsupial fully active by day, the numbat {{spends most of}} its time searching for termites. [...] It digs them up from loose earth with its front claws and captures them with its long, sticky tongue. Despite its banded anteater name, it apparently does not intentionally eat ants; although the remains of ants have occasionally been found in numbat dung, these belong to species that themselves prey on termites, so were presumably eaten accidentally, along with the main food. Known predators on numbats include <b>carpet</b> <b>pythons,</b> introduced red foxes, and various falcons, hawks, and eagles.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} predators to the {{false water rat}} {{including}} foxes, cats, <b>carpet</b> <b>pythons,</b> rough-scaled snakes, tawny frog mouths, and pigs. [...] However, {{the biggest threat to}} the false water rat is man. Due to man, their habitat is severely fragmented and less than 2,000 km. The quality of their habitat and area of occupancy continue to decline primarily due to the development of mangrove areas. Increasing development creates oil pollution, wastewater and acid sulphate contamination, alteration of natural hydrology, and increasing infections from chemicals and waste. [...] Overall, the habitat is being destroyed because of water quality changes due to agriculture, livestock grazing, urbanisation, and swamp drainage. [...] Because of all of these circumstances, they are classified as vulnerable.|$|R

Over a six-year period, we collected 258 'nuisance' pythons from two cities (Brisbane and Ipswich) in south-eastern Queensland. Most of these snakes were reported {{by members of the}} general public, often after the snakes had consumed domestic pets or cage-birds. We provide data on seasonal activity patterns, body sizes, sexual size dimorphism, reproduction and food habits of these snakes. Snakes were active and fed year-round, primarily on domestic and commensal birds and mammals. Dietary composition shifted with body size: one small snake consumed a lizard, intermediate-sized snakes took mostly mice, rats and parrots, and large snakes fed on larger items such as cats, brushtail possums and poultry. Adult male pythons engaged in combat bouts during the breeding season, and (perhaps as an adaptation to enhance success in such bouts) grew larger and were more heavy-bodied than conspecific females...|$|R

40|$|Sunshine {{virus is}} a {{paramyxovirus}} of pythons associated with neurorespiratory disease and mortalities. This report provides evidence for its vertical transmission.

The surface of all three eggs was negative for Sunshine virus but swabs of the allantois and amnion were positive in all three eggs. Embryo tissue samples were tested from the two 49 day old eggs. From one embryo, a sample of brain and a pooled sample of lung, liver, kidney and intestine were positive, while for the other embryo, a pooled sample of lung, liver, kidney, intestine and brain was positive.
