40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{study which}} and how project {{management}} methodologies are applied in consulting firmsApproachThe study begins by reviewing literature on Traditional Project Management (TPM) andAgile Project Management (APM) methodologies ending with {{characteristics of the}} twomethodologies that identify a project as applying one methodology or another. The literaturethen reviews the nature of <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> emphasising on elements such as the professional,professional services and professional service firms before reviewing how projects areimplemented in <b>consulting</b> <b>firms.</b> A case study design is adopted and semi-structuredinterviews were conducted with PricewaterhouseCoopers-Ghana staff. Patterns from theinterviews are identified and compared with the characteristics of both Traditional and Agileproject management before drawing conclusions on which methodologies are applied andhow they are applied. Since APM is presumed to deal with problems of TPM in complexenvironments, challenges in applying TPM in <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> are assessed and the extent towhich APM responds to those challenges are also discussed. FindingsThe findings indicate that TPM is applied in <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> mainly for structured projects,whilst APM methods are also applied for some structured projects but very much forunstructured and ‘executory’ projects. APM also deals with some challenges of TPM butthose which are organisation related are not solved by applying APM methods. Research limitationThe limited number of people interviewed for this research is one key issue that limitsgeneralization to all <b>consulting</b> <b>firms.</b> However, {{it is hoped that}} this work serves as a basis forfurther research in this field. Practical implicationsThe study shows that whilst TPM will continuously be applied in <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> due to thenature of some projects, APM can also be applied to the benefit of consulting projects that areunstructured and ‘executory’. Therefore <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> do not need to ‘force’ structure intoall projects.

40|$|The {{focus in}} {{research}} upon resources, dynamic capabilities and competences has challenged firms to apply these concepts {{to improve their}} competitive position. Management <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> may assist clients in these efforts. However, the roles that management <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> fulfill in these processes can differ considerably and are under-researched. Therefore, insight in these different roles {{and the impact of}} these roles on clients’ competitive positioning in their industries is required. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a conceptual framework that highlights the importance of distinguishing both roles and the implications for management <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> and for their clients. We illustrate the framework by elaborating on the relationship between both roles and the strategic renewal context of client firms. We conclude by pointing out the increasing importance of the competence leverage role of management <b>consulting</b> <b>firms</b> and how this development might contribute to a more hypercompetitive context for their clients...|$|R
