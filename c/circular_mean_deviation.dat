40|$|Circular {{statistics}} {{has found}} substantial application {{in science and}} engineering. One of the fundamental problems in circular statistics is that of estimating the mean direction of a circular random variable {{from a number of}} observations. The standard approach in the literature is called the sample <b>circular</b> <b>mean</b> and its asymptotic properties are well known. It can also be computed efficiently in a number of arithmetic operations that is linear in the number of observations. In this paper we consider an alternative estimator called the sample intrinsic mean that is based on minimizing squared arc length. We show how this estimator can be computed efficiently in a linear number of operations using an algorithm from algebraic number theory and we derive its asymptotic properties. In some scenarios the sample <b>circular</b> <b>mean</b> and the sample intrinsic mean are estimators of the same quantity and can therefore be compared. We show both theoretically and by simulation that in some of these scenarios the sample intrinsic mean is statistically more accurate than the sample <b>circular</b> <b>mean.</b> As such the results in this paper potentially have implications for the wide variety of fields in science, engineering and statistics that currently use the sample <b>circular</b> <b>mean.</b> 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{asymptotic}} {{relative efficiency}} of the <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> {{with respect to the}} standard deviation is 88 % at the normal distribution. In his seminal 1960 paper A survey of sampling from contaminated distributions, J. W. Tukey points out that, if the normal distribution is contaminated by a small -fraction of a normal distribution with three times the standard <b>deviation,</b> the <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> is more efficient than the standard deviation— already for < 1 %. This came as a surprise to most statisticians at the time, and the publication is today considered as one of the main pioneering works in the development of robust statistics. In the present article, we examine the efficiency of the <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> and Gini’s <b>mean</b> difference (the mean of all pairwise distances). The latter is known to have an {{asymptotic relative efficiency}} of 98 % at the normal distribution. Our findings support the viewpoint that Gini’s mean difference combines the advantages of the <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> and the standard deviation. We also answer the question, what percentage of contamination in Tukey’s 1 : 3 normal mixture model renders Gini’s mean difference more efficient than the standard deviation. 2010 MSC: 62 G 35, 62 G 05, 62 G 20 1...|$|R
