When he heard Thornton's <b>command</b> <b>repeated,</b> he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as though for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. He swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.|$|R

5000|$|The {{view of the}} Reformed churches or Calvinism, {{referred}} to as Covenant Theology, {{is similar to the}} Roman Catholic view in holding that Mosaic Law continues under the New Covenant, while declaring that parts of it have [...] "expired" [...] and are no longer applicable. The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) divides the Mosaic laws into three categories: moral, civil, and ceremonial. In the view of the Westminster Divines, only the moral laws of the Mosaic Law, which include the Ten Commandments and the <b>commands</b> <b>repeated</b> in the New Testament, directly apply to Christians today. Ceremonial laws, in this view, include the regulations pertaining to ceremonial cleanliness, festivals, diet, and the Levitical priesthood.|$|R

50|$|The Ottomans' {{strategic}} {{situation was}} difficult, as their borders were {{almost impossible to}} defend against a co-ordinated attack by the Balkan states. The Ottoman leadership decided to defend the entirety of their territory. As a result, the available forces—which could not be easily reinforced from Asia due to Greek control {{of the sea and}} the inadequacy of the Ottoman railway system—were dispersed too thinly across the region. They failed {{to stand up to the}} rapidly mobilized Balkan armies. The Ottomans had three armies in Europe (the Macedonian, Vardar and Thracian Armies), with 1,203 pieces of mobile and 1,115 fixed artillery on fortified areas. The Ottoman High <b>Command</b> <b>repeated</b> its error of previous wars by ignoring the established command structure and by creating new superior commands, the Eastern Army and Western Army, reflecting the division of the operational theater between the Thracian (against the Bulgarians) and Macedonian (against Greeks, Serbs and Montenegrins) fronts.|$|R
50|$|Two {{reasons are}} {{commonly}} cited for the delay: the slowness {{of decision making}} within the Supreme Council of Government because of ongoing disagreement within the military high <b>command</b> and <b>repeated</b> maneuverings by the military government to manipulate the electoral process, thereby controlling its outcome. Like the Rodríguez Lara government, the Council was particularly interested in seeing a poor electoral performance by the CFP and, especially, preventing Bucaram from winning the presidency.|$|R

5000|$|The {{gameplay}} of The Thompson Twins Adventure {{falls within}} the early graphical adventure idiom. The player is presented with a simple graphical scene with a text caption below describing important features of the scene and prominent manipulable items. Below the text caption is the parser line through which the player can type commands to the player characters. Typical typed commands follow a simple VERB-NOUN format such as [...] "take jar" [...] or [...] "read newspaper". To move from one scene to the next, a player must type a directional command such as [...] "North", [...] "Down", or [...] "Out". The player characters will follow the typed instructions and a new scene will {{take the place of}} the former scene. Further specialized commands follow conventions previously established in non-graphical text adventures. Thus the [...] "look" [...] <b>command</b> <b>repeats</b> back to the player the original description of the scene, and the [...] "inv" [...] command can be used to gain information on the player characters' inventory. Compass directions in the game are not always intuitive and the graphical depictions are not always accurate so gameplay often involves the creation of a game map on paper.|$|R

In a message sent from U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk to U.S. Ambassador Walworth Barbour, in Tel Aviv, Israel, Rusk asked for [...] "urgent confirmation" [...] of Israel's statement. Barbour responded: [...] "No request for info on U.S. ships {{operating}} off Sinai was made until after Liberty incident."

5000|$|... "Do {{the right}} thing" [...] was a {{fundamental}} change in the user-interface model of previous news software; rather than requiring users to navigate menus or learn a distinct command vocabulary for every operating mode of the program, certain single-keystroke <b>commands</b> were <b>repeated</b> throughout the user interface, performing the most obviously appropriate function for the task at hand. The most important of these commands was the space character, which means [...] "go on to the next thing", where the next thing could be the next page, the next article, or the next newsgroup, depending on where the user {{was in the process of}} reading news.|$|R

Her ten-part series had been shown at over one hundred stations in the United States and in Britain it proved so popular it was run twice.

5000|$|A common {{theory is}} that the town was named for a giant oak tree - the [...] "Royal" [...] Tree of England - that stood in the public square during colonial days where Chester and Main Streets now join. It was there that the local militia were drilled. During drills, a {{frequent}} command given by the drill sergeant was, [...] "front the Royal Oak!" [...] The <b>command</b> was <b>repeated</b> and eventually shortened to simply [...] "Front Royal". This theory is supported by a bulletin published by the United States Geological Survey in 1905, which states that the town was first known as Royal Oak, with the current name being derived from the commands of a confused colonel.|$|R

Casualties among the men were by no means rare.

50|$|After the {{successful}} {{defense of the}} city, he returned to civilian life only to rejoin the Polish Army after {{the outbreak of the}} Polish-Soviet War. During the Budennyi's assault on Lwów he was chosen as a commander of a volunteer battalion of roughly 330 men, mostly pupils and students. All but 12 men of that unit perished in an 11-hours long battle of Zadwórze. For entire day the unit under his <b>command</b> withheld <b>repeated</b> attack by an entire cavalry division. After their defenses were finally broken, Zajączkowski committed suicide not to fall into enemy hands. For his merits he was posthumously promoted to the rank of Major and awarded with Virtuti Militari medal.

I therefore ignored the <b>repeated</b> <b>commands</b> to [...] "sak," [...] and each time they were made I motioned to my mouth and rubbed my stomach.|$|R
40|$|During adaptation, motor <b>commands</b> tend to <b>repeat</b> as {{performance}} plateaus. It {{has been}} hypothesized that this repetition produces plasticity in the motor cortex (M 1). Here, we considered a force field reaching paradigm, varied the perturbation schedule to potentially alter {{the amount of}} repetition, and quantified the interaction between disruption of M 1 using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and the schedule of perturbations. In the abrupt condition (introduction of the perturbation on a single trial followed by constant perturbation), motor output adapted rapidly and was then followed by significant repetition as performance plateaued. TMS of M 1 {{had no effect on}} the rapid adaptation phase but reduced adaptation at the plateau. In the intermediate condition (introduction of the perturbation over 45 trials), disruption of M 1 had no effect on the phase in which motor output changed but again impaired adaptation when performance had plateaued. Finally, when the perturbation was imposed gradually (over 240 trials), the motor commands continuously changed during adaptation and never repeated, and disruption of M 1 had no effect on performance. Therefore, TMS of M 1 appeared to reduce adaptation of motor commands during a specific phase of learning: when motor <b>commands</b> tended to <b>repeat.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Western Digital has {{developed}} extensions to the SMART command protocol to support highly-valued features of enterprise media drives, but {{which are not}} available in the ATA/ATAPI command set. These commands are typically used in OEM development, factory configuration, and testing. The new extensions utilize the SMART command and avoid creation of new commands or protocols that would cause device or host hardware changes. This method also allows vendor specific commands to be created and operate under a standardized protocol. Key OEM’s have requested that Western Digital make this methodology available to the industry and that it be submitted for standardization.

5000|$|In {{the story}} {{recorded}} in this chapter, Saint Peter {{had a vision}} of a sheet full of animals being lowered from heaven. A voice from heaven told Peter to kill and eat, but since the sheet contained unclean animals, Peter declined. The <b>command</b> was <b>repeated</b> two more times, along with the voice saying, [...] "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common" [...] (verse 15) and then the sheet was taken back to heaven (Acts 10:16). The triple refusal here echoes the denial of Peter described in the Synoptic Gospels. At this point in the narrative, messengers sent from Cornelius the Centurion arrive and urge Peter to go with them. He does so, and mentions the vision as he speaks to Cornelius, saying [...] "God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean" [...] (Acts 10:28, KJV). Peter related the vision again in Acts 11:4-9.|$|R
