40|$|Effect of lactic, acetic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> on {{the quality}} changes and {{shelf-life}} extension of green mussel stored at 4 oC was investigated. The inhibitory effect on bacterial growth was pronounced when the concentration of lactic, acetic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> increased (P< 0. 05). Green mussel dipped with lactic acid had the lower total volatile base, trimethylamine, ammonia and TCA-soluble peptides contents than those dipped in acetic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids.</b> However, the increases in exudates loss and cooking loss were observed in samples dipped in organic acids, causing the denaturation of muscle protein by acids used. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) increased as the organic acid concentration increased (P< 0. 05). Lactic acid dipped samples, particularly with 0. 2 M, showed the greater acceptability than did those dipped in other acids throughout the storage of 27 days.

40|$|Low-molecular-weight {{organic acids}} play an {{important}} role in the mobilization of soil phosphorus (P). The molybdate blue colorimetric method, based on the formation of P molybdenum blue compound, is commonly used for analysis of phosphate in soil and environmental samples. However, some organic acids can act as a ligand to bond with molybdenum acid, which subsequently interfere with the colorimetric reaction. The recoveries of P were inhibited by the addition of oxalic (> 2 mM) and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> (> 3 mM) both in standard P solutions and soil extracts, but formic and maleic acids did not interfere with the P determination. The inhibition of oxalic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> on P recovery remained even at higher level of P (up to 100 姠P 100 ml- 1) though such interferences decreased by increasing P concentration. Comparison between oxalic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> revealed the more pronounced interference by the addition of oxalic acid. The results suggested that the interference of organic acids with P determination is related to the types of organic acids and the ratio of organic acid ligands to P anions in the solutions. Thus, analysis of P using the molybdate blue colorimetric method should be undertaken cautiously in the presence of relative strong ligands like oxalic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|In the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are regenerated {{during each}} {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form <b>citric</b> <b>acid.</b> This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between polygalacturonic acid and Fe(III) was {{studied in the}} presence {{and in the absence}} of pyruvic, malic, and <b>citric</b> <b>acids.</b> Kinetical data and FT‐IR analyses show that the polysaccharidic matrix acts as an accumulator of Fe(III) and that the metal ion interacts electrostatically with both the carboxylic and other functional groups of the polysaccharidic matrix. Copper(II) ions, which have a high affinity towards the carboxylic groups of the polysaccharide, do not influence markedly the Fe(III) absorption indicating that the carboxylic groups are not determining in the Fe(III) accumulation process. Furthermore, the results suggest that iron inside the fibrils is under an hydrolyzed form or as Fe(III) hydroxy polymer. In the presence of malic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> the amount of Fe(III) accumulated at pH 4. 7 and 6. 0 is markedly lower than that found in the presence of pyruvic acid what was attributed to the higher affinity of <b>citric</b> and malic <b>acid</b> towards the metal ion...|$|R
40|$|Oxalic, glyoxylic, glycolic, malonic, pyruvic, lactic, levulinic, and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> {{as well as}} glycine {{have been}} {{evaluated}} as possible substitutes for formic acid {{in the preparation of}} feed for the Hanford waste vitrification plant using a non-radioactive feed stimulant UGA- 12 M 1 containing substantial amounts of aluminum and iron oxides as well as nitrate and nitrite at 90 C in the presence of hydrated rhodium trichloride. Unlike formic acid none of these carboxylic acids liberate hydrogen under these conditions and only malonic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> form ammonia. Glyoxylic, glycolic, malonic, pyruvic, lactic, levulinic, and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> all appear to have significant reducing properties under the reaction conditions of interest as indicated by the observation of appreciable amounts of N{sub 2 }O as a reduction product of,nitrite or, less likely, nitrate at 90 C. Glyoxylic, pyruvic, and malonic acids all appear to be unstable towards decarboxylation at 90 C in the presence of Al(OH) {sub 3 }. Among the carboxylic acids investigated in this study the {alpha}-hydroxycarboxylic acids glycolic and lactic acids appear to be the most interesting potential substitutes for formic acid in the feed preparation for the vitrification plant because of their failure to produce hydrogen or ammonia or to undergo decarboxylation under the reaction conditions although they exhibit some reducing properties in feed stimulant experiments...|$|R
40|$|Organic acids play an {{important}} role in metal uptake by, and accumulation in, plants. However, the relevant mechanisms remain obscure. Acetic, malic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> increased the uptake of lanthanum (La) by barley (Hordeum vulgare) roots and enhanced La content in shoots under hydroponic conditions. Concentration-dependent net La influx in the absence and presence of organic acids yielded nonsaturating kinetic curves that could be resolved into linear and saturable components. The saturable component followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The K-m values were similar; however, the V-max values in the presence of acetic, malic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> were 4. 3, 2. 8, 1. 5 -times that of the control, respectively. Enhanced uptake of La by organic acids was mediated mainly, but not solely, by Ca 2 + channels. X-ray absorption spectroscopic techniques provided evidence of La-oxygen environment and established that La(III) was coordinated to 11 oxygen atoms that are likely to be involved in the binding of La(III) to barley roots via carboxylate groups and hydration of La(III) ...|$|R
5|$|The central {{pathways}} of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle, {{are present}} in all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor.

The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E
5|$|Beta {{oxidation}} is {{the metabolic}} {{process by which}} fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, {{a reversal of the}} process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP, CO2, and H2O using the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if {{there is little or no}} glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the <b>citric</b> <b>acid</b> cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBio-based {{organic acids}} are {{promising}} renewable carbon {{sources for the}} chemical industry. However energy-consuming purification processes are used, like distillation or crystallization, to reach high purities required in some applications. That is why preparative chromatography was studied as an alternative separation technique. In a previous work dealing with the purification of lactic, succinic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids,</b> the Langmuir model was insufficient to explain the elution profiles obtained with a strong anionic resin. Consequently the Langmuir model was coupled with a usual ion-exchange model {{to take into account}} the retention of their conjugate bases (< 2 %), which are commonly neglected at low pH (< 1. 5). Elution simulations with both uptake mechanisms fitted very well with experimental pulse tests. Only two parameters were optimized (equilibrium constant of acid uptake and ion-exchange selectivity coefficient of conjugate base) and their value were coherent with experimental and resin suppliers’ data. These results confirmed that the singular tailing and apparent delay observed with succinic and <b>citric</b> <b>acids</b> can be explained by the high affinity of succinate and citrate for resin cationic sites.
