40|$|Effects of {{frequency}} mistuning on cascade flutter are studied using a computational method with coupled structural dynamics and aerodynamics. An implicit finite-volume scheme of second-order accuracy {{is used to}} solve the unsteady Euler equations. The structural equations with bending and torsional degrees of freedom for a rigid blade profile are integrated in time simultaneously with the flow equations. Investigations are performed on flutter of a turbine cascade in bendingmotion andwith alternatemistuning of the structural eigenfrequency. Previousworkby an uncoupled method shows a beneficial effect of alternating frequency mistuning on flutter stability. This paper shows that fluid–structure interaction tends to decrease the effective amount of mistuning. There exists a minimum amount of mistuning required to stabilize the cascade. The same qualitative behavior is shown to exist with a compressor <b>cascade.</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> b = half-chord of blade Cl = lift coefficient Cm = moment coefficient about the elastic axis h = translational displacement of the blade Kh = bending stiffness of the blade K = torsional stiffness kc = reduced frequency,!c= 2 U 1 m = mass per unit span of blade rb = radius of moment of inertia about elastic axis xb = distance between center of gravity and elastic axis = rotational displacement of the blade = mass ratio, m= 1 b 2 !h = natural angular frequency for translation! = natural angular frequency for rotatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of effects of axially non-uniform tip clearances on aerodynamic {{performance of a}} compressor cascade. The tests were performed in a low-speed large-scale cascade with different axially non-uniform tip clearances while the flow filed at an exit of the cascade was measured at three incidence angles of- 5 º, 0 º and 5 º using a mini five-hole pressure probe. The three-dimensional flow field was compared with each other. The effects of axially non-uniform tip clearances on the flow capability and the flow loss were discussed. The measurement results showed that a proper axially non-uniform tip clearance {{may result in a}} beneficial leakage flow which could blow down the low-energy fluids at the tip corner and decrease the accumulation of the low-energy fluids which cause the flow blockage in the blade passage. In this way, the axially non-uniform tip clearance can restrain the development of the corner flow and mixing which would reduce the flow blockage and the flow loss in the <b>cascade.</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> V 0 = main flow velocity at cascade inlet Va = axial velocity at cascade outlet ρ = fluid density Pt 1 = total pressure at cascade inlet Pt 2 = total pressure at cascade outlet ΔPt = Pt 1 -Pt 2 W = ΔPt/ 0. 5 ρV 02 total pressure loss coefficient I...|$|E
40|$|Using a high-response {{pressure}} sensor and a single-slanted hot-wire sensor, the upstream and the downstream flows of an annular turbine rotor were surveyed in detail. The data were time-split to produce animated movies, and the unsteady rotor-stator interaction {{and the associated}} secondary flow behaviors in the rotor passage were analyzed. The loss decreases when the free stream part of the stator cascade is going to enter the downstream cascade passage and thus the flow will pass the rotor cascade smoothly. On the other hand, the loss increases when the stator wake will dominate the downstream rotor <b>cascade</b> passage. <b>NOMENCLATURE</b> CPt = Total pressure loss coefficient, Eqs.
