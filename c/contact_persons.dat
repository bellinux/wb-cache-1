40|$|Subjects: All {{residents}} {{during an}} 18 month period {{were included in}} this study. Intervention: Hip protectors were introduced as {{a regular part of}} health care service for all residents. Residents at high risk were encouraged to use hip protectors regularly. Each nursing home had a <b>contact</b> <b>person.</b> Main outcome measures: The percentage of residents accepting the hip protector offer, probability of continued use, reasons for terminating use, and percentage of falls with hip protector were evaluated. Results: Fifty five percent of the residents accepted the hip protector offer. The percentage increased by age, but showed no significant dependence on gender, profession of the <b>contact</b> <b>person,</b> or size of nursing home. The probability of continued use showed no significant dependence on age and gender. Nursing homes with a nurse as <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> showed 51 % higher risk of residents terminating regular hip protector use than nursing homes with a physiotherapist as <b>contact</b> <b>person</b> (relative risk (RR) 1. 51, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 11 to 2. 05, p = 0. 008). The corresponding result for large (75 – 92 beds) compared with small (24 – 68 beds) nursing homes was RR= 1. 44 (95 % CI 1. 02 to 2. 02, p = 0. 036).
