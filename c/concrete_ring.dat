2500|$|Just after 1 p.m on February 17, 2014, {{one week}} after {{demolition}} of the stadium bowl had begun, demolition crews were working on taking down the <b>concrete</b> <b>ring</b> beam that encircled to top of the Metrodome, when {{a portion of the}} ring beam collapsed out of sequence, bringing an immediate halt to the work. No one was hurt and no equipment was damaged by the collapse. After five days of investigation from structural and demolition experts, it was decided that the remaining portion of the <b>concrete</b> <b>ring</b> beam would be destroyed using controlled explosive charges—virtually the same method that was used to bring down the Metrodome's steel support cables for the roof. This second controlled explosion was a continued deviation from the original plan to not use explosives to destroy the stadium. However, it was determined that this was the safest way to bring down the remaining ring beam structure. On February 23, 2014, just after 7:30a.m., with 84 explosive charges of dynamite, set in 24 columns of the upper concourse of the stadium, the remaining ring beam and corners of the Metrodome were brought down in 11 seconds. Once the <b>concrete</b> <b>ring</b> beam was brought down successfully, this enabled demolition crews to continue with the original wrecking ball demolition method that was originally chosen (though the order in which the sections would be brought down were changed {{as a result of the}} ring beam implosion), to bring down what was left of the Metrodome. Despite this unexpected setback, Mortenson Construction said that the demolition of the Metrodome and construction of U.S. Bank Stadium were both still on schedule.|$|E
2500|$|The {{city was}} subject to a {{widespread}} regeneration effort following the Birmingham Blitz during World War II. This public demand for modern buildings, combined with Victorian architectural styles falling out of favour, resulted in dozens of fine Victorian buildings like the intricate glass-roofed Birmingham New Street Station, and the old Central Library being destroyed in the 1950s and 1960s by the city planners.

2500|$|With the {{approval}} of the new Vikings stadium at the Dome site by the Minnesota legislature, the fate of the Metrodome was sealed. The Vikings played their final game at the Metrodome on December 29, 2013, beating the Detroit Lions 14-13. The following day, a local company began removal of seats for sale to the public and various charities and nonprofits. Individual chairs went for $40/each to charities, $60/each to the public, and $80 apiece for specific seat requests. [...] The roof was deflated for the final time on January 18, starting at 7:15a.m. The process took about 35 minutes. After the deflation, demolition crews began cutting out individual panels of the teflon roof that would continue all the way up until the morning that the roof cables were severed, and no more than a week after the deflation, the entire loading dock section of the Metrodome was demolished. Much like the first few early phases of demolition, it was decided that the Metrodome would be torn down via wrecking ball, rather than implosion—due to the concern that vibration and dust from an implosion would have on nearby downtown Minneapolis neighborhoods and Hennepin County Medical Center, which sat catacorner from the now-demolished Metrodome. The original demolition plan called for the Metrodome to be torn down section by section in a counter-clockwise motion (starting with the northeast corner of the stadium) as the exterior of the new stadium was built adjacent to and around the continuously-diminishing structure of the Metrodome, as this animation shows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDnJsZJsH-M However, when part of the <b>concrete</b> <b>ring</b> beam collapsed out-of-sequence during demolition on February 17 (additional information below), the order in which the sections were actually torn down was completely changed and rather disorganized. Nevertheless, all sections were successfully and eventually taken down and no setbacks in the demolition process occurred {{as a result of the}} ring beam collapse.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{elliptical}} {{ring test}} method is proposed {{to replace the}} circular ring test recommended by ASTM and AASHTO for faster and more reliable assessment of cracking tendency of concrete. Numerical models are also established to simulate stress development and crack initiation/propagation in restrained <b>concrete</b> <b>rings.</b> Cracking age, position and propagation in various rings are obtained from numerical analyses that agree well with experimental results. Elliptical thin rings of certain geometry can shorten the ring test duration as desirable. In thin rings, crack initiation is caused by external restraint effect so that a crack occurs at the inner circumference and propagates towards the outer one. In thick rings, crack initiation is mainly due to the self-restraint effect so that a crack occurs at the outer circumference and propagates towards their inner one. Therefore, thick elliptical <b>concrete</b> <b>rings</b> do not necessarily crack earlier than circular ones as observed from experiment...|$|R

5000|$|According to {{the article}} [...] "To Cover This Assembly Bowl: A 400 ft Prestressed Saucer" [...] by Engineering News-Record, the total weight of Assembly Hall is carried by 48 massive buttresses to a 16 ft wide and 3.5 ft thick <b>concrete</b> <b>ring</b> foundation, with a 109 ft radius. The {{construction}} crews first dug down 15 ft from ground level and poured the <b>concrete</b> <b>ring</b> on high-density, hard gray clay. The center floor of the stadium is 24 ft below ground level, however the contractors decided not to excavate all of the dirt before the roof was constructed. This decision gave the construction crews more surface area to work on, and decreased the height of scaffolding used when forming the concrete roof. After the roof was completed and the scaffolding was removed, {{the rest of the}} soil was excavated through the building's entrances. By building the structure into the ground, the top row is only 36 ft above the ground line. The construction of Assembly Hall required excavation of 60,000 cu yd of soil.

50|$|The Statnamic weight packs usually {{consist of}} steel or <b>concrete</b> <b>rings</b> {{placed over the}} Statnamic silencer. As the device does not rely on gravity to apply loads as in static or drop weight testing {{it can be used}} vertically, {{horizontally}} and inclined to test raked piles. The ability to test horizontally has led to the method being used for lateral load testing of piles and simulation of ship impacts on mooring bodies (Middendorp, 2000). In order to improve the flexibility of the device and minimise transportation costs for offshore works a device has also been tested that can apply up to 14MN using water as a reaction mass. This is achieved in an over water pile tests by connected the Statnamic device to a vessel full of water below the water bodies surface (Middendorp, 2000), thus removing the need for heavy reaction weights.|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} method by utilizing elliptical rings to replace circular rings recommended by ASTM and AASHTO was explored for assessing cracking potential {{of concrete and}} other cement-based materials under restrained condition. A series of thin and thick elliptical <b>concrete</b> <b>rings</b> were tested alongside circular ones until cracking. Cracking age, position, and propagation were carefully examined. It is found that thin elliptical rings with appropriate geometry can initiate cracks quicker than circular ones, which is desirable for accelerating the ring test. However, thick elliptical rings seem not to exhibit a desirable geometry effect of accelerating ring test compared with circular ones. There were multiple visible cracks that occurred in an elliptical ring and some cracks were initiated but did not propagate through the ring wall. In comparison, {{there was only one}} crack in the circular rings. Finally, the features of multiple cracks in restrained elliptical rings were examined and their impact on interpreting elliptical ring test results was elaborated...|$|R

40|$|The tensile {{characteristics}} of concrete are usually neglected {{in the design}} of structures. The treatise discusses the important bearing these very characteristics have on the performance of different concrete structures. The investigations are supported by experiments, theoretical models and simulations by finite element methods. The following structures are studied: thick-walled <b>concrete</b> <b>rings</b> subjected to inner pressure, tensioned rebars embedded in concrete prisms and fullscale reinforced concrete beams under flexural loading. A hierarchic approach is adopted meaning that for the analysis of the beams, the results of the reinforced concrete prisms are used as constitutive law. In turn, for modelling the behaviour of the prism, the {{characteristics of}} the rebar and concrete are used as input. Being based on a mechanical foundation rather than empirical, this approach enables to consider how the behaviour of a structure will alter if its constituents are e g exposed to environmental effects.
