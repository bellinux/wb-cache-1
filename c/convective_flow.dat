25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and <b>convective</b> <b>flow</b> of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} time-dependent {{computer code}} {{based on the}} modified Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) technique, has been developed to simulate non-spherical droplet dynamics and evaporation under <b>convective</b> <b>flows</b> at real rocket combustion chamber conditions. The equations of mass, momentum, energy and species are simultaneously solved for both liquid and gas phases with an accurate dynamic interface tracking. The jump boundary conditions across the deforming droplet surface are obtained by applying the integral forms of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. At each time step, the interface geometry and flow properties at the droplet surface are implicitly solved by satisfying the interface boundary conditions. A Lagrangian technique was developed to track the arbitrarily moving interface between the liquid droplet and the external gas. An elliptic grid generator is adopted to dynamically reconstruct grids {{both inside and outside}} the droplet surface.

40|$|Isotachophoresis (ITP), {{a mode of}} electrophoresis, was studied {{experimentally}} and theoretically. Although {{this technique}} has not been used widely for protein separations, it has features conducive to large scale purification. These include high product concentrations {{and the use of}} common biochemical buffers. This technique was applied in this work to purify major proteins of human plasma. Experiments were performed on the Recycling Isotachophoresis (RITP) apparatus, which was developed earlier in our research group. The separations were optimized by varying the buffers, polarity of separation, buffer pH and the use of spacers. Computer simulations were used to optimize these separations. Two novel operating schemes were developed to use the advantages of ITP and scale up the apparatus by semi-continuous operation. The effect of imposed <b>convective</b> <b>flows</b> on the separation process was studied through experiments and computer modeling.

Transport modeling has also been used to study the effect of recycling in the RITP apparatus. The effect of CF velocity profile on ITP steady state zonal structure was analyzed. Imposed CF with parabolic flow profile increases the effective dispersivity in the direction of electromigration, thus reducing the resolution.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is devoted to the}} problem of the onset of {{instability}} in time dependent <b>convective</b> <b>flows</b> of an electrically conducting fluid, subject to an externally applied magnetic field and to gravity forces. Linear stability theory is applied to investigate <b>convective</b> <b>flows</b> confined by two rigid walls and opposed by the magnetic field. These magnetohydrodynamic channel flows are studied for non-zero magnetic Prandtl numbers {{as well as in the}} inductionless approximation. The following configurations are considered: the Rayleigh-B´enard problem, the horizontal layer with longitudinal temperature gradient and the vertical channel with internal heating sources. The numerical results are obtained giving characteristic laws by critical values of parameters, beyond which the flows become unstable. The comparison is made between these problems for small, but non-zero Prm, with the inductionless approximation, in order to determine the validity of that approximation. The analysis of perturbations shows that the instabilities critically depend on the electrical and thermal boundary conditions and on the Prandtl (Pr), magnetic Prandtl (Prm), and Hartmann (Ha) numbers. The instabilities are driven by di↵erent mechanisms and set in either as two- or three-dimensional modes, stationary or oscillatory, depending on these parameters and on the orientation of magnetic field and gravity. New instability structures are observed in the horizontal layer heated for the side for small ranges of Prm.
