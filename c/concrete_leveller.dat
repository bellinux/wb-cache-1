The model, which follows an incremental development approach using Event-B, focuses on goals and organisations at the abstract level and introduces resources at the <b>concrete</b> <b>level.</b> The model is motivated {{by the type of}} virtual organisations used in the domain of scientific experiments. Individual organisations, at the abstract level, are allowed to pursue conflicting goals within a virtual organisation. However, at the <b>concrete</b> <b>level,</b> these conflicts are isolated by applying a separation of resources mechanism. This ensures that no resource is allocated to any two conflicting goals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The user {{experience}} of any software or website consists of elements from the conceptual to the <b>concrete</b> <b>level.</b> These elements of {{user experience}} {{assist in the}} design and development of user interfaces. On the other hand, ontologies provide a framework for computable representation of user interface elements and underlying data. This paper discusses strategies of introducing ontologies at different user interface layers adapted from user experience elements. These layers range from abstract levels (e. g. User needs/Application Objectives) to <b>concrete</b> <b>levels</b> (e. g. Application User Interface) in terms of data representation. The proposed ontological framework enables device independent, semi-automated GUI construction which we will demonstrate at a personal information management example...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsing a component-based approach, {{applications}} can {{be defined}} as an assembly of abstract components, requiring services from and providing services to each other. At the time of execution, they are mapped to the <b>concrete</b> <b>level</b> after identifying the deployed components. However, several problems can be detected at init time that prevent the mapping to be achieved successfully, e. g., heterogeneity of connection interfaces. Moreover, applications in pervasive environment are challenged by the dynamism of their execution environment due to, e. g., users and devices mobility, which make them subject to unforeseen failures. Both of these problems imply mismatches between abstract and <b>concrete</b> <b>levels</b> detected at init time or during the execution. Therefore, abstract applications have to be adapted to carry out their mapping and their execution. In this article, we propose a new dynamic structural adaptation approach for abstract applications. Our approach is based on adaptation patterns that provide solutions to the captured mismatches between abstract and <b>concrete</b> <b>levels.</b> We also compare and contrast our approach with the existing ones concluding that our approach is not only generic, but it is also applicable both at init time and at runtim...|$|R

40|$|Finding and {{accessing}} suitable {{geographic information}} to satisfy various {{applications in the}} open and distributed environments of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) is a crucial task. However, because of the semantic heterogeneity in conventional exploitations and descriptions of geographic information, {{it is difficult to}} find suitable geographic information which exactly meets the requirements of application. To solve the problems caused by semantic heterogeneity, this paper presents an ontology-based semantic description model which explicitly represents geographic information semantics in abstract and <b>concrete</b> <b>level.</b> It is an integrated model consisting of three parts: Data Profile, Data Content, and Data Binding. Data Profile tells users what the data are about in abstract level. Data Content describes what the data contain in <b>concrete</b> <b>level.</b> Data Binding tells users where and how to access the data. Moreover, this paper puts forward an ontology based approach to enhance the efficiency of discovery and retrieval of geographic information. 1...|$|R

In the development of the model, several levels of abstraction are distinguished: from an abstract level to a more <b>concrete</b> <b>level.</b> Every level of abstraction is described by one equation. This equation has both an input-function and an output-function. With the development of this model, the gap between the bookkeeping literature and bookkeeping practice has been reduced. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGoals, events, {{and actions}} can be mentally {{represented}} within a hierarchical framework {{that ranges from}} more abstract to more <b>concrete</b> <b>levels</b> of identification. A more abstract level of identification involves general, superordinate, and decontextualized mental representations that convey the meaning of goals, events, and actions, “why” an action is performed, and its purpose, ends, and consequences. A more <b>concrete</b> <b>level</b> of identification involves specific and subordinate mental representations that include contextual details of goals, events, and actions, and the specific “how” details of an action. This review considers three lines of evidence for considering that dysregulation of level of goal/action identification may be a transdiagnostic process. First, {{there is evidence that}} different levels of identification have distinct functional consequences and that in non-clinical samples level of goal/action identification appears to be regulated in a flexible and adaptive way to match the level of goal/action identification to circumstances. Second, there is evidence that level of goal/action identification causally influences symptoms and processes involved in psychological disorders, including emotional response, repetitive thought, impulsivity, problem solving and procrastination. Third, there is evidence that the level of goal/action identification is biased and/or dysregulated in certain psychological disorders, with a bias towards more abstract identification for negative events in depression, GAD, PTSD, and social anxiety...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{questions}} concerned with modelbased testing is how to find ”interesting ” test cases. We consider test cases to be interesting if firstly, they cover the user requirements and secondly, they have a high probability to find potential errors. In this paper we introduce an approach to derive test cases along different levels of abstraction during the design phase. These levels start with services representing user requirements on the topmost level and result in models for a specific technical platform on the most <b>concrete</b> <b>level.</b> Within the presented test process we use design models of different abstraction levels as test models out of which test cases can be generated. The test cases are executed on more <b>concrete</b> <b>levels</b> and finally on the implementation. An exception is the (topmost) service level which {{is used for the}} derivation of the test case specification. One main advantage of our approach lies in preserving the link from test cases to corresponding user requirements. Furthermore the danger of using too abstract models which do not reflect inevitable crucial aspects of the realization is avoided. Finally this yields to a front loading of quality control activities to a point as early as possible in the development process. In our work we focus on embedded reactive systems especially in the field of automotive software.
