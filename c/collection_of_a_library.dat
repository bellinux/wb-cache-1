50|$|The Ayer Public Library is a Carnegie library {{located at}} 200 Locust Street in Delavan, Illinois. The library was the city's fifth attempt at forming a library; it succeeded and assumed the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>library</b> founded in 1902 by the Blue Button Army temperance organization. When the Blue Button library closed in 1907, {{supporter}} Amos K. Ayer {{called for the}} city to establish a permanent public library. With Ayer's financial backing, a library for all citizens of Delavan Township was approved the same year; however, it used a temporary space and lacked a permanent home until the city applied to the Carnegie Foundation for assistance in 1912. After a protracted misunderstanding with James Bertram, who expected a city library tax and did not understand that the township provided tax support, the Foundation provided a $10,000 grant for the library and construction began in 1914. The Classical Revival library opened later in the year; it remains open to this day.|$|E

He was one of the signatories of the constitution of the Philadelphia Library Company of Colored Persons, instituted on January 1, 1833. The Company's object was [...] "the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>library</b> of useful works of every description, for the benefit of its members, who might there successfully apply without comparatively any cost, for that mental good which they could not readily obtain elsewhere". For a membership fee of $1, African Americans of all classes were afforded an opportunity to further educate themselves. The library's members adopted a system of organized reading and weekly debate that enabled its members to practice elocution and public speaking. In spite of its name, the Library Company was a male institution. Bowers also supported the education of women, writing to the Liberator in 1834 in praise of women's literary groups. Bowers was involved in starting the Gilbert Lyceum, instituted on January 31, 1841, which enabled women and men to work together in literary and scientific pursuits. He became secretary of the weekly newspaper The Colored American in 1841.|$|E

The decision rules that governed selection of items for the bibliography are specified in detail. A total of 178 items published between 1915 and mid- 1968 met the selection criteria. The list of items is supplemented by a keyword index derived from titles. Half the items are journal articles; a third of these articles appeared in the Bulletin, and most of the remainder in thirteen other library and information science journals. Most of the non-journal items are technical reports issued by the organization that conducted or sponsored the work.

40|$|Abstract. All search {{happens in}} a {{particular}} context—such as the particular <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> digital <b>library,</b> its associated search tasks, and its associated users. Information retrieval researchers usually agree {{on the importance of}} context, but they rarely address the issue. In particular, evaluation in the Cranfield tradition requires abstracting away from individual differences between users. This paper investigates if we can bring some of this context into the Cranfield paradigm. Our approach is the following: we will attempt to record the “context ” of the humans already in the loop—the topic authors/assessors—by designing targeted questionnaires. The questionnaire data becomes part of the evaluation test-suite as valuable data on the context of the search requests. We have experimented with this questionnaire approach during the evaluation campaign of the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval (INEX). The results of this case study demonstrate the viability of the questionnaire approach as a means to capture context in evaluation. This can help explain and control some of the user or topic variation in the test collection. Moreover, it allows to break down the set of topics in various meaningful categories, e. g. those that suit a particular task scenario, and zoom in on the relative performance for such <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> topics. ...|$|R
