5|$|Seattle {{replaced}} Lamar Neagle with Pappa in the 74th {{minute in}} an attempt to create an advantage. Philadelphia answered with two more chances that almost won the match. Casey received a yellow card at the 57th minute and was later replaced by Pedro Ribeiro. In the 88th minute, Raymon Gaddis won the ball and took a shot that was deflected. Ribeiro took a shot but it lacked power. In stoppage time, Vincent Nogueira had another <b>close</b> <b>shot</b> that struck the post and ricocheted dangerously close to the goal before being cleared.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on December 24, 2010. It was directed by Don Tyler, who previously worked on videos for the bands A Day to Remember and Flyleaf. It was digitally released on June 14, 2011 via iTunes Store and the same day was also uploaded on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube. Shot in an animated technique, the video starts with an animated version of lead singer Levine singing on a microphone while hands are behind his back touching his body. As the video progresses, a nude animated woman is shown dancing around him and flirting with {{the other members of}} the band. Several animation effects such as angel wings and devil elements are shown behind Levine as he is singing, while the woman is also dancing for the other members. The video finishes with a <b>close</b> <b>shot</b> of Levine's face.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a <b>close</b> <b>shot</b> of Knowles face who's wearing a similar make-up to English model Twiggy. The video then shows shots of Knowles moving her arms like a clock and wearing a black T-shirt and black trousers. Scenes similar to 1957 film Funny Face follow with Knowles looking like Audrey Hepburn. Those shots are cut {{by a variety of}} brightly colored bathing suits and a {{black-and-white}} hat, set against a constantly changing background of colors which is similar to Vogue photo shoots. Knowles' baby bump is less visible in the bathing suit scenes but is featured prominently earlier in the video. The clip cuts quickly from the bathing suit sequence to shots of Knowles in an audition space similar to the 1980 film Fame. The sequence features choreographed moves from Knowles and her back-up dancers who snap with their fingers which is a reference to 1961 musical West Side Story.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the opening}} {{sequence}} of Seven Samurai in the peasant village, the axial cut is used twice. When the villagers are outdoors, {{gathered in a}} circle, weeping and lamenting the imminent arrival of the bandits, they are glimpsed from above in extreme long shot, then, after the cut, in a much <b>closer</b> <b>shot,</b> then in an even <b>closer</b> <b>shot</b> at ground level as the dialogue begins. A few minutes later, when the villagers go to the mill to ask the village elder's advice, {{there is a long}} shot of the mill, with a slowly turning wheel in the river, then a <b>closer</b> <b>shot</b> of this wheel, and then a still <b>closer</b> <b>shot</b> of it. (As the mill is where the elder lives, these shots forge a mental association in the viewer's mind between that character and the mill.) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice", {{directed}} by Sophie Muller, uses {{the contrast of}} dark and white colors. The video starts with a scene of Natalie painting the white clothes {{of the other two}} band members, Martie and Emily, with black paint, which symbolizes the boycott of the band. Then, Natalie is seen wearing a black dress with her hands on a puddle of black paint. In another scene, the band members are sitting in a chair and when Natalie gets up to say something, Martie and Emily pull her back in to the chair. Then, Natalie and the other Dixie Chicks are seen in an environment that looks like a classroom and the teacher sends Natalie to write the English proverb [...] "To talk without thinking is to shoot without aiming" [...] on the blackboard. On the final scenes of the video, Natalie is seen in front of three doctors in {{what appears to be a}} mental institution, trying to escape from them. The video ends with a <b>close</b> <b>shot</b> of Natalie.|$|E

60|$|With the {{exception}} of hares, of which a good many were snared, the hunting was not productive. Tracks of deer were seen not unfrequently, but it was extremely difficult, even when the animals were sighted, to get {{across the surface of}} the snow to within range of the clumsy arquebuses that two or three of the men carried. They did, however, manage to shoot a few by erecting a shelter, just high enough for one man to lie down under, and leaving it until the next snowstorm so covered it that it seemed but a knoll in the ground, or a low shrub bent down and buried under the weight of the snow. These shelters were erected close to paths taken by the deer, and, by lying patiently all day in them, the men occasionally managed to get a <b>close</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

60|$|Lifting the {{double-barrelled gun}} he carried, he {{fired at the}} first Kaffir, {{a young man who}} chanced to be the eldest son and heir of the chief of the tribe, and, as the range was very <b>close,</b> <b>shot</b> him dead. Thereon his companion, leaving go of the horse, ran for his life. At him Leblanc fired also, {{wounding}} him slightly in the thigh, but no more, so that he escaped to tell the tale of what he and every other native for miles round considered a wanton and premeditated murder. The deed done, the fiery old Frenchman mounted his nag and rode quietly home. On the road, however, as the peach brandy evaporated from his brain, doubts entered it, with the result that he determined to say nothing of his adventure to Henri Marais, who he knew was particularly anxious to avoid any cause of quarrel with the Kaffirs.|$|E

5000|$|After a fine save {{from a very}} <b>close</b> <b>shot</b> by Nándor Hidegkuti, he was {{described}} by the sports reporter Herbert Zimmermann with the words [...] "Toni, you're a football God". He later had to apologize for that comment because the church complained about the comparison of a football player with God.|$|E
5000|$|Hitch held up {{his hands}} the way {{directors}} do when they're framing a shot. Palms out, fingers together, thumbs extended and touching to form a perfect square. Moving his hands toward my face, like a camera coming in for a <b>close</b> <b>shot,</b> he said, [...] "Evan, when he sticks it in her, I want that camera right on her face".|$|E
5000|$|For {{the opening}} scene, the crew {{spent the morning}} {{painstakingly}} recreating a bus stop. Because of Dudzik's love for <b>close</b> <b>shots,</b> {{no part of the}} replica bus stop made it into the final cut.|$|R

60|$|The {{young man}} found his cousin {{stalking}} {{up and down}} in an extremely nervous manner. She wrung her delicate fingers with a swift, spasmodic motion. Her eyes, nearly <b>closed,</b> <b>shot</b> red rays through their slits.|$|R
50|$|The second leg at Old Trafford {{was held}} on 15 March, and United won 2-1. Wayne Rooney passed superbly to Ryan Giggs before firing across goal for Javier Hernández to tuck in the opener. André-Pierre Gignac side-footed over soon after and Souleymane Diawara missed a header from six yards out. Hernández then made it 2-0 with another <b>close</b> <b>shot</b> but a Wes Brown own goal from a corner ensured a tense finish.|$|E
50|$|Another example {{would be}} if two {{characters}} are shown in a medium shot, say from the waist up, looking at each other, it is generally established that one {{is on the left}} of screen and the other on the right. The one on the left looks right to the other character and vice versa. When the editor cuts to a <b>close</b> <b>shot</b> of a person, it would be disorienting if the character looked the other way. The audience would assume that the character is looking at something else.|$|E

50|$|In the 1995 film Dead Presidents, {{the title}} {{sequence}} directed by Kyle Cooper features <b>close</b> <b>shots</b> of burning U.S. bills; {{it took two}} days of shooting and experimenting with the paper to get the effect right.|$|R

50|$|Cinematography of {{the film}} is quite brilliantly done with distant and <b>close</b> <b>shots</b> of rural areas and greenery. Moreover, in the story a subtle {{distinction}} of village and city are drawn which is validated by cinematography too.|$|R
