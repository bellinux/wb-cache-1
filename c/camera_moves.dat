5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish <b>camera</b> <b>moves,</b> repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} been called both a {{platform}} game and an action-adventure game. GameSpot asserts that it combines elements of ToeJam & Earl and its platformer sequel, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, while GameNOW and Electronic Gaming Monthly liken it to the former game. The game features both single- and two-player modes; in both, players control {{one of the three}} protagonists. ToeJam moves quickly and jumps high, but has weak attacks; Earl is tougher and has more powerful attacks, but is slow and jumps lower than ToeJam; Latisha ranks between the two in terms of athleticism, and gains additional power-ups later in the game. In the game's two-player mode, the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> between single and split-screen as players maneuver their characters away from each other. Characters can share power-ups when in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E

5|$|The series' title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by production studio Elastic for HBO. Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world. The map is projected {{on the inside of}} a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere. As the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map. Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear. The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writer(s) and director. Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} a coin dropped onto ground after which a title card that reads Roberts' name and the track title is shown. As the title changes color, Roberts walks and skips down a New York City street wearing a floral T-shirt dress. Effects are placed on Roberts' with sperm cells graffitied on it shadow her {{movement}} with neon colors and throughout becomes increasingly prominent, and during the second verse Roberts performs a short dance movement with two back-up dancers before she walks past a wall with sperm graffitied on it, which also changes to multiple neon colours. As the video progresses, Roberts interacts with buildings and objects, such as New York style newspaper dispensers and following this her entire body has effects placed upon it as she changes color and shades and the last frames of the video show {{more of the same}} effects and finally shows a frame of a New York street with Roberts walking out of the frame before the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> upwards to show a purple sky.|$|E

5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Stereoscopic {{vision is}} a {{capability}} {{that supports the}} ability of robots to interact with visually complex environments. Epipolar geometry captures the projective relationship between the cameras in a stereo vision system, assisting in the reconstruction of three-dimensional information. However, a basic problem arises for robots with active vision systems whose <b>cameras</b> <b>move</b> with respect to each other: the epipolar geometry changes with this motion. Such problems are especially noticeable in work with humanoid robots, whose <b>cameras</b> <b>move</b> in order to emulate human gaze behavior. We develop an epipolar kinematic model that solves this problem by building a kinematic model based on the optical properties of a stereo vision system. We show how such a model {{can be used in}} order to update the epipolar geometry for the head of a humanoid robot. ...|$|R
50|$|Digital PTZ has the {{potential}} to reduce equipment maintenance and failure, by replacing a physically moving camera with a fixed very high resolution <b>camera.</b> <b>Moving</b> <b>cameras</b> have a tendency to fail over time due to wear of the drive motors, belts, and bearings. They may also be sensitive to temperature changes, and fail to function at temperature extremes. A fixed position camera removes these components, relying solely on digital translation of the high detail camera image.|$|R
500|$|All Captain Scarlet episodes, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the pilot episode, incorporate two sets of opening titles. The first of these sequences displays the title card and the primary production credits. The <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> forward through the scale-model set of a run-down, night-time alleyway, forming the point-of-view shot of an unseen assassin, who turns a corner only to meet his death at the gun barrel of Captain Scarlet. The two seven-letter words [...] "Captain Scarlet" [...] gradually appear in time with the seven strikes of the Captain Scarlet staccato drum beat composed by Barry Gray. This opening sequence is accompanied by a voice-over from Ed Bishop, which states: ...|$|E
500|$|The figure {{remains in}} shadow, with an insert showing it with cloaked arms spread, as the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> further away and slowly circles to the right. [...] After a jump cut, the {{lighting}} around the figure improves, revealing {{that the figure}} is wearing an outfit that resembles a plague doctor costume, a long dark long-sleeved hooded cloak with its face masked by a long, downward-pointing dark leather beak and goggles. The figure holds up their right hand, palm facing outward at shoulder height, to reveal a blinking light {{in the center of}} the palm. Beeping noises appear on the soundtrack in coordination with the blinks.|$|E
500|$|The opening title {{sequence}} itself {{begins with}} a deck of Tarot cards falling into the sand, while the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> in and enters one card into a separate world presenting layers of artwork and footage from iconic moments of the American Depression era; the camera then moves back out of a different card and repeats the procedure several times. The sequence ends with the camera shifting from the [...] "Judgement" [...] Tarot card to the [...] "Moon" [...] and the [...] "Sun", identifying the Devil and God respectively, until the wind blows away all cards and the underlying sand to reveal the Carnivàle title artwork.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} {{animated}} film to use a <b>camera</b> <b>move.</b> The POV shot from the plane made it appear as if the camera was tracking into the ground. In fact, when they shot this scene, they piled books under the spinning background to move the artwork closer to the camera.|$|R
50|$|Match moving is {{primarily}} used {{to track the}} movement of a camera through a shot so that an identical virtual <b>camera</b> <b>move</b> can be reproduced in a 3D animation program. When new animated elements are composited back into the original live-action shot, they will appear in perfectly matched perspective and therefore appear seamless.|$|R
2500|$|Filming {{lasted for}} 12 or 13 weeks, the longest {{shooting}} time {{of any of}} Resnais's films. [...] According to Resnais, there were around 800 shots in the film {{instead of the usual}} 450; the many static camera set-ups were time-consuming; and {{it was only in the}} final shot of the film that the <b>camera</b> <b>moved.</b>|$|R
500|$|Kurosawa's {{style is}} marked by a number of devices and {{techniques}} which Kurosawa introduced in his films over the decades. In his films of the 1940s and 1950s, Kurosawa frequently employs the [...] "axial cut", in which the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> closer to, or further away from, the subject, not through the use of tracking shots or dissolves, but through a series of matched jump cuts. Another stylistic trait which scholars have pointed out is Kurosawa's tendency to [...] "cut on motion": that is, to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots, rather than one uninterrupted shot.|$|E
500|$|A man (Henry Ian Cusick) {{wakes up}} from his bunk bed and {{immediately}} presses a few keys on {{what appears to be}} a late 1970s-era computer. He then gets dressed, and begins his day as the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> about the surrounding rooms, which contain an assortment of objects from the 1960s to the present. He puts on some music, begins an exercise routine, has a shower, makes himself some breakfast, and injects himself with a vaccine. He is interrupted by an explosion, spurring the man to arm himself before using a telescope-and-mirror system. His gaze reveals the faces of Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) standing around the now-open [...] shaft.|$|E
500|$|The picture's {{significance}} {{has been}} the subject of broad speculation. Washington Post reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, the final scene [...] "feels more like a punchline for punchline's sake, a trumped-up coda". In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers' films, Rowell suggests that Barton's fixation on the picture is ironic, considering its low culture status and his own pretensions toward high culture (speeches to the contrary notwithstanding). She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach. This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film, when Barton finds himself– [...] in a sense– [...] inside the picture.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to pillarboxing is [...] "tilt-and-scan" [...] (reversed pan and scan), horizontally matting the original 1.33:1 television images to the 1.78:1 aspect ratio, which {{at any given}} moment crops part of the top and/or bottom of the frame, hence the need for the [...] "tilt" [...] component. A tilt is a <b>camera</b> <b>move</b> in which the camera tilts up or down.|$|R
50|$|It is {{necessary}} to take two photographs from different horizontal positions to get a true stereoscopic image pair. This {{can be done with}} two separate side-by-side cameras; with one <b>camera</b> <b>moved</b> from one position to another between exposures; with one camera and a single exposure by means of an attached mirror or prism arrangement that presents a stereoscopic image pair to the camera lens; or with a stereo camera incorporating two or more side-by-side lenses.|$|R

500|$|Barton Fink uses several stylistic {{conventions}} {{to accentuate}} the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> downward. This motion is repeated {{many times in the}} film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to [...] "plumb the depths" [...] while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements– [...] combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence– [...] create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that [...] "the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling".|$|E
500|$|Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke {{said that}} [...] "It {{was such a}} major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, {{and we had to}} do it in {{different}} stages of production. We had shots with complex linking <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's taken two years– getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Campbell had {{to sleep}} wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with <b>camera</b> <b>moves</b> and camera speeds, [...] "taking it a little further than we had gone before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.|$|E
40|$|Multiview {{geometry}} is {{the study}} of two-dimensional images of three-dimensional scenes, a foundational subject in computer vision.
