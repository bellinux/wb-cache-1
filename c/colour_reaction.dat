The spore print is white to cream. The oval spores are 5.5–7 by 4–4.5micrometres (µm), with walls {{that tend to}} thicken in age. The spores are cyanophilous, meaning that they will readily stain dark blue in methyl blue solution. Staining with Melzer's reagent often produces a dextrinoid (reddish-brown) <b>colour</b> <b>reaction.</b> Basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 25–40 by 5–8µm, and can be two-, three-, or four-spored.

2500|$|As {{noradrenaline}} is {{an intermediate}} {{on the path}} to adrenaline, dopamine is {{on the path to}} noradrenaline (and hence adrenaline.) In 1957 dopamine was identified in the human brain by researcher Kathleen Montagu. In 1958/59 Arvid Carlsson and his group in the Pharmacology Department of the University of Lund, including the medical students Åke Bertler and Evald Rosengren, not only found dopamine in the brain, but also – like noradrenaline in Marthe Vogt’s exemplary study – in uneven distribution, quite different from the distribution of noradrenaline. This argued for a function beyond an intermediate. The concentration was highest in the corpus striatum, which contained only traces of noradrenaline. Carlsson’s group had previously found that reserpine, which was known to cause a Parkinsonism syndrome, depleted dopamine (as well as noradrenaline and serotonin) from the brain. They concluded that ″dopamine is concerned with the function of the corpus striatum and thus with the control of motor function″. Thus {{for the first time the}} reserpine-induced Parkinsonism in laboratory animals and, by implication, Parkinson's disease in humans was related to depletion of striatal dopamine. A year later Oleh Hornykiewicz, who had been introduced to dopamine by Blaschko and was carrying out a <b>colour</b> <b>reaction</b> on extracts of human corpus striatum in the Pharmacological Institute of the University of Vienna, saw the brain dopamine deficiency in Parkinson’s disease ″with [...] own naked eye: Instead of the pink colour given by the comparatively high concentrations of dopamine in the control samples, the reaction vials containing the extracts of the Parkinson’s disease striatum showed hardly a tinge of pink discoloration″.|$|E

At Imperial College, he created a new research group to work on analytical atomic absorption and atomic fluorescence spectroscopy. Under West's leadership this group very quickly became established as a leading centre of research in these fields. His many contributions included those to electrothermal methods of atomisation, microwave-excited atomic spectral lamps, low-luminosity flames, and atom-trapping techniques.

40|$|PHOTOS 1 - 3 : Urine {{samples are}} {{important}} diagnostic tools. Urine can be collected by free catch collection, manual compression of the urinary bladder, cystocentesis or catheterization. Cytological examination of urine {{can be used}} to diagnose several pathological conditions. The Sternheimer – Malbin stain is compounded of gentian violet and safranin and is used for the examination of urinary deposits. It is useful in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections and for the differentiation between pyelonephritis and cystitis. The Sternheimer – Malbin stain divides urinary leucocytes into two types of which the nuclei stain either dark reddish purple or pale blue. Cells with blue staining nuclei are characteristic of pyelonephritis. PHOTOS 4 - 5 : Once urine has been collected it should be examined within 30 minutes. Delay of examination may allow the growth of contaminating bacteria and a change of urine pH. Delay in examination will also allow time for fragmentation and disruption of cells and loss of casts. If a delay is unavoidable the urine sample should be refrigerated. The urine sample is centrifuged and the pellet resuspended. A few drops of stain can be added. Staining of urine with Methylene blue or the Sternheimer – Malbin stain facilitates differential staining of cells and nuclei. A drop of the resulting fluid is placed on a clean glass slide and a coverslip is placed over it. Bright field microscopic evaluation of urine sediment is done with reduced illumination. The chemical dipstick analysis is performed on urine at room temperature before centrifugation. The <b>colour</b> <b>reactions</b> on the dipstick should be read within the specified time interval as these reactions are a function of time.
