50|$|On 1 July 2015, Ofcom made {{a number}} of changes to the way phone calls to UK service numbers would be charged. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> made to service numbers is now split into two parts: an access charge and a service charge. Under the new legislation, which was {{promoted}} by an information campaign entitled UK Calling, call charges must be clearly stated on all materials that advertise a service number. The 1 July changes also saw ‘freephone numbers’ 0800 and 0808 become free to call from both mobiles and landlines. Meanwhile, 0500 numbers remain chargeable as previously from mobiles (free from landlines, also as previously). Plans are afoot to migrate these to 08085 numbers in mid-2017, whereupon they will become free from mobiles.|$|E

50|$|Odds {{are most}} {{commonly}} expressed as ratios, but converting them to percentages will often make them easier to work with. The ratio has two numbers: {{the size of}} the pot and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>call.</b> To convert this ratio to the equivalent percentage, we add these two numbers together and then divide the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>call</b> by this sum. For example, the pot is $30, and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>call</b> is $10. The pot odds in this situation are 30:10, or 3:1 when simplified. To get the percentage, we add 30 and 10 to get a sum of 40 and then divide 10 by 40, giving us 0.25, or 25%.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Non-failure {{analysis}} aims at inferring {{that calls}} to the predicates of a program will never fail. This type of information has many applications in functional/logic program-ming. It is essential for determining lower bounds on the computational <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> useful {{in the context of}} program parallelization, instrumental in partial evaluation and other program transformations, and has also been used in query optimization. In this paper, we re-cast the non-failure analysis proposed by Debray et al. as an abstract interpretation, which not only allows to investigate it from a standard and well studied theoretical framework, but has also several practical advantages. It allows us to incorporate non-failure analysis into a standard, generic abstract interpretation engine. The non-failure analysis thus bene¯ts from the ¯x-point propagation algorithm, which leads to improved information propagation. Also, the analysis takes advantage of the multi-variance of the generic engine, so that it is now able to infer separate non-failure information for di®erent call patterns for a given predicate in a program. Moreover, the implementation is simpler, and allows to perform non-failure and covering analyses alongside other abstract interpretation based analyses, such as those for modes and types, in the same framework. Finally, besides the precision improvements an...|$|E

The study makes use of statistical techniques such as simple percentage analysis and Chi- square test in analyzing the data for finding the result. The results revealed that the social media application needs to improve their services to satisfy all types of users. Whatsapp is a great application that offers various benefits to the customer.

This paper {{demonstrates}} {{how to reduce}} the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> remote procedures from Haskell by using the remote monad design pattern, which amortizes the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> remote <b>calls.</b> This gives the Haskell community access to remote capabilities that are not directly supported, at a surprisingly inexpensive cost. We explore the remote monad design pattern through six models of remote execution patterns, using a simulated Internet of Things toaster as a running example. We consider the expressiveness and optimizations enabled by each remote execution model, and assess the feasibility of our approach. We then present a full-scale case study: a Haskell library that provides a Foreign Function Interface to the JavaScript Canvas API. Finally, we discuss existing instances of the remote monad design pattern found in Haskell libraries...|$|R

40|$|This {{consultation}} paper sets out the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s views on future arrangements for call charges to freephone and local rate numbers. Together these number ranges {{are known as}} freephone and local rate numbers (FLRNs). During 2010 – 11, the ACMA undertook a program of work (the Numbering Work Program) to examine the regulatory framework for telephone numbers and provide an analysis of reform options. As part of this process, the ACMA assessed {{a range of issues}} related to the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to FLRN services from fixed and mobile phones. Submissions The ACMA invites submissions on the following issues: 	Details of costs, revenues and charges related to the use of FLRNs and costs associated with the proposed changes that might have the effect of materially altering the ACMA’s view. 	Whether the proposed time period for implementing the proposed changes is appropriate and, if not, what reasons there might be for a shorter or longer implementation period. 	Whether there is a preferred mechanism by which the proposed changes are made to the Numbering Plan. 	Specific details of any alternative industry based measures to achieve the desired outcomes.

40|$|The current <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> and {{interconnection}} {{rates in}} South Africa {{are perceived to}} be high and unnecessary unaffordable {{for the majority of the}} users. An assertion fully supported by ICASA – the communication regulatory body had since mandated all the telephone network operators to review and revised their call and inter-connection rates. To this end, Telecommunication industry in South Africa recently introduced a new functionality Mobile Number Portability (MNP) which presents the subscribers with freedom of changing a network provider without them having to change their mobile number. MNP is seen as a great opportunity which can increase acquisition and to a greater extent encourage healthy competition among telephone operators but the process, functionality, subsequent administration and maintenance is a complex one, involving the careful planning and balancing of factors such as cost, convenience, simplicity, speed, reliability, heterogeneous integration and robustness. The reduced tariff transparency, increased competitiveness and lower cost of call and inter-connection rate that would normally result from the introduction of MNP is a problem that could seriously affect the usability, affordability, on-line connection of mobile services for users and have great impact on the profit margin. Understanding impact and extents at which the students understand the implication of this project will inform the level of acceptability, promotes low cost mobile call rates and lower interconnection and on-line connection rate and charges, further enhanced their on-line activities and will be a major step towards implementing comprehensive on-line education in our institution...|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of Information and Communication technologies, and the relatively cheap <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> (voice and data), the use of call centers to provide new services to citizens has grown extensively. Evolution in call centers technologies, systems and infrastructures allowed the transformation of industries and services in big enterprises and organizations, customer support services, marketing services and after sales support are examples of such transformations. The objective {{of this paper was}} to introduce a new technique that can support decision makers in the call centers industry to evaluate, and analyze the performance of call centers. The technique presented is derived from the research done on measuring {{the success or failure of}} information systems. Two models are mainly adopted namely: the Delone and Mclean model first introduced in 1992 and the Design Reality Gap model introduced by Heeks in 2002. Two indices are defined to calculate the performance of the call center; the success index and the Gap Index. An evaluation tool has been developed to allow call centers managers to evaluate the performance of their call centers in a systematic analytical approach; the tool was applied on 4 call centers from different areas, simple applications such as food ordering, marketing, and sales, technical support systems, to more real time services such as the example of emergency control systems. Results showed the importance of using information systems models to evaluate complex systems as call centers. The models used allow identifying the dimensions for the call centers that are facing challenges, together with an identification of the individual indicators in these dimensions that are causing the poor performance of the call center...|$|E
