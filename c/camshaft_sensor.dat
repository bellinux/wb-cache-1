50|$|In {{a strong}} lead, Patrese pitted for {{originally}} {{what appeared to}} be an early stop to slicks {{turned out to be more}} serious - a misfire with a faulty <b>camshaft</b> <b>sensor.</b> He restarted last before retiring for good 9 laps later.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A data {{collection}} terminal for performance testing of non-continuous signal of the automotive <b>camshaft</b> <b>sensor</b> is designed, Using NI- 6259 data acquisition card {{to connect the}} data of collection terminal with pc, and composed of a complete monitoring system of performance testing of automotive sensor. The system can display the maximum, minimum, average, duty cycle, frequency and frequency multiplication or not of the high level and low level in real-time. And the frequency range of the measured signal is between 1 Hz and 8 KHz. Compare measured data with standard data, determine automatically whether it is reasonable and save them according to their classification. The test personnel are avoided to test continuously and monitor in real-time, offsetting the lack of single function of the display of test platform and running short of features of analysis and judgment...|$|E
50|$|The active {{valve control}} system (AVCS) is an {{automobile}} {{variable valve timing}} technology used by Subaru. It varies {{the timing of the}} intake valves by using hydraulic oil pressure to rotate the camshaft in order to provide optimal air flow {{in and out of the}} engine. The system is closed loop using <b>camshaft</b> <b>sensors,</b> crankshaft sensors, air flow meter, throttle position as well as oxygen sensors and/or Air-Fuel ratio sensors in order to calculate engine load. The ECU is programmed to operate control valves that adjust the delivery of the hydraulic pressure in order to move the camshaft into the position that will provide the engine with the best performance while minding emissions standards.|$|R
50|$|The four {{camshafts}} incorporate VCT (variable camshaft timing). VCT {{allows the}} timing of the intake and exhaust valves to be adjusted independently of each other. The VCT system is controlled by the Bosch ECM (engine control module) using information from CMP (<b>camshaft</b> position) <b>sensors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ignition {{takes place}} with {{individual}} ignition coils {{placed on the}} respective spark plug. The spark plugs, together with the ignition coils and combustion detection module (CDM), are used to detect combustion and possible knocking. This means {{there is no need}} for a <b>camshaft</b> position <b>sensor</b> or separate knock sensor.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{mounting}} locations {{include the}} main crank pulley, the flywheel, the camshaft {{or on the}} crankshaft itself. This sensor is the 2nd most important sensor in modern-day engines after the <b>camshaft</b> position <b>sensor.</b> When it fails, there is a probability the engine will not start, or cut out while running.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} MX-5 {{came with}} a 1.6 L dual overhead cam inline four-cylinder engine, producing [...] at 6500 rpm, and 136 Nm of torque at 5500 rpm. The engine employs an {{electronic fuel injection system}} using a vane-type air flow meter and an electronic ignition system with a <b>camshaft</b> angle <b>sensor</b> instead of a distributor. This engine, codename B6ZE(RS), was specifically designed for the MX-5 and featured a lightened crankshaft, flywheel, and aluminum sump with cooling fins.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} block was redesigned {{for use with}} a balance shaft. Cylinder heads (10238181 casting) used with the L35 will have intake ports with eyebrows that clear the fuel injectors. Timing cover flange area was thickened in 1995 {{when some of the}} balance shaft motors had a 6 bolt timing cover - some engines had a crankshaft position sensor (in conjunction with a redesigned distributor containing a pickup assembly which functions as a <b>camshaft</b> position <b>sensor)</b> when OBDII was phased in.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crank sensor}} {{can be used}} in {{combination}} with a similar <b>camshaft</b> position <b>sensor</b> to monitor the relationship between the pistons and valves in the engine, which is particularly important in engines with variable valve timing. This method is also used to [...] "synchronise" [...] a four stroke engine upon starting, allowing the management system to know when to inject the fuel. It is also commonly used as the primary source for the measurement of engine speed in revolutions per minute.|$|R
5000|$|In older vehicles, the {{tachometer}} {{is driven}} by the RMS voltage waves from the low tension (LT) side of the ignition coil, while on others (and nearly all diesel engines, which have no ignition system) engine speed is determined by the frequency from the alternator tachometer output. This is from a special connection called an [...] "AC tap" [...] which is a connection to one of the stator's coil output, before the rectifier. Tachometers driven by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the camshaft) exist - usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems. On recent EMS found on modern vehicles, the signal for the tachometer is usually generated from an ECU which derives the information from either the crankshaft or <b>camshaft</b> speed <b>sensor.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1997, for {{the fourth}} {{generation}} Camry, the 5S-FE was updated for the last time. This engine received a direct ignition system with external <b>camshaft</b> and crankshaft <b>sensors.</b> This system used a waste-spark design, and the coils had integrated igniters. The engine did not use a typical coil-on-plug design, but rather two coil+igniter assemblies mounted near cylinder four, and provided spark via normal high-tension cords (spark plug wires). This change means that the 1997-01 Camry 5S-FE has a blocked off distributor mounting hole and could be used with older 5S-FEs without swapping cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position <b>sensor,</b> <b>camshaft</b> position <b>sensor,</b> air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|R
50|$|Commonly used in {{distributors}} for {{ignition timing}} (and in {{some types of}} crank and <b>camshaft</b> position <b>sensors</b> for injection pulse timing, speed sensing, etc.) the Hall effect sensor {{is used as a}} direct replacement for the mechanical breaker points used in earlier automotive applications. Its use as an ignition timing device in various distributor types is as follows. A stationary permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall effect chip are mounted next to each other separated by an air gap, forming the Hall effect sensor. A metal rotor consisting of windows and tabs is mounted to a shaft and arranged so that during shaft rotation, the windows and tabs pass through the air gap between the permanent magnet and semiconductor Hall chip. This effectively shields and exposes the Hall chip to the permanent magnet's field respective to whether a tab or window is passing though the Hall sensor. For ignition timing purposes, the metal rotor will have a number of equal-sized tabs and windows matching the number of engine cylinders. This produces a uniform square wave output since the on/off (shielding and exposure) time is equal. This signal is used by the engine computer or ECU to control ignition timing. Many automotive Hall effect sensors have a built-in internal NPN transistor with an open collector and grounded emitter, meaning that rather than a voltage being produced at the Hall sensor signal output wire, the transistor is turned on providing a circuit to ground through the signal output wire.|$|R
50|$|Engine bore, {{stroke and}} redline {{remained}} unchanged; {{everything else was}} completely new. The clutch was changed from hydraulic to cable-operated. The generator was moved from behind the cylinder to the more conventional location at the left end of the crank. There was now no balance shaft. The valvetrain switched to direct valve actuation, and the cylinder head was plumbed for then-new plug-top ignition coils, replacing more conventional remote coils and high-tension leads. Notably, the new engine also featured a Hall-type cam position sensor on the exhaust <b>camshaft.</b> Cam position <b>sensors</b> are typically {{used in conjunction with}} electronic fuel injection. As the ZX900C featured induction by Keihin 40 mm CVKD carburettors, a cam position sensor wasn't necessary. Its inclusion could indicate that Kawasaki had designs to include fuel injection on the engine in the future. This first happened on the 2000 ZX-12R Kawasaki's first fuel-injected sport bike since the 1981-1985 GPZ1100.But this did not happen on this engine until the 2003 introduction of the Z1000, which uses a bored-out ex-ZX-9R engine.|$|R
50|$|The Trionic system lacks a <b>camshaft</b> {{position}} <b>sensor.</b> This sensor {{is normally}} {{a prerequisite for}} a sequential pre ignition/pinging regulation and fuel injection. Saab Trionic must decide whether cylinder one or cylinder four ignites when the crank shaft position sensor indicates that cylinder one and four is at TDC. This is done by help of ionization current. One of the poles of the secondary coil of the spark coils {{is connected to the}} spark plugs in an ordinary manner. The other pole isn’t grounded directly but connected to an 80 V voltage. This means that an 80 V voltage is applied across the spark gap of the spark plugs, except when the spark is fired. When combustion has occurred the temperature in the combustion chamber is very high. The gases are formed as ions and start to conduct electric current. This results in a current flowing in the spark plug gap (without resulting in a spark). The ionisation current is measured in pairs, cylinder one and two is one pair and cylinder three and four in the other pair. If combustion occurs in cylinder one or two the ignition cassette sends battery voltage (B+) pulse to the ECU, pin 17. If the combustion takes place in cylinder three or four the B+ pulse is fed to pin 18 in ECU. If the crankshaft position sensor indicates that cylinders one and four are at TDC and a B+ pulse enters the ECU via pin 17 simultaneously, then the ECU know that it is cylinder one that has ignited. Upon starting, the ECU doesn’t know which cylinder is in compression phase, hence ignition is initiated in both cylinders one and four and 180 crank shaft degrees later sparks in cylinder two and three are fired. As soon as the combustion signals enters the ECU via pin 17 and pin 18 the ignition and fuel injection is synchronised to the engines firing order. The combustion signals are also used to detect misfires.|$|R
