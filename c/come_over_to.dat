5|$|In late 1968, {{the members}} of the Jimi Hendrix Experience were living in a rented house in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. One night bassist Noel Redding was warned about a pending visit from law enforcement, so he {{immediately}} phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell, who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and asked him to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the house so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs. They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house.|$|E

Professor and Mrs. Chaudhary were unable to come to Kailashnath's house for the ceremony marking the impending arrival of the baby. They send Nisha instead, who is present at the birth.

Professor and Mrs. Chaudhary <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Kailashnath's house to celebrate the birth of their grandchild. When the time comes to part, their hosts are dejected, especially Prem. He and Nisha promise each other that they will soon reunite for ever.|$|E
5|$|Roger de Busli died {{around the}} end of the 11th century, and was succeeded by a son, who died without an heir. The manor of Hallamshire passed to William de Lovetot, the {{grandson}} of a Norman baron who had <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> England with the Conqueror. William de Lovetot founded the parish churches of St Mary at Handsworth, St Nicholas at High Bradfield and St. Mary's at Ecclesfield {{at the start of the}} 12th century in addition to Sheffield's own parish church. He also built the original wooden Sheffield Castle, which stimulated the growth of the town.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} led by Montfort soon {{ran into}} problems. He negotiated a treaty with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the Prince of Wales, {{an act that}} made him unpopular with the English Marcher lords. In May Edward escaped captivity, {{with the help of}} Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who had now <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the royal side. Edward started on a campaign of re-conquest, while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches. He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn, and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon. Edward, however, routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle, and on 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham, forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals. The battle soon turned into a massacre; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field. Even with Montfort dead resistance remained, particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle. In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons, {{and by the end of}} the year the garrison surrendered.|$|E
5|$|In spring, however, Bardas Skleros, now {{appointed}} doux of Mesopotamia, rose in revolt {{and proclaimed}} himself emperor at his base in Melitene. Bourtzes was commanded by Constantinople {{to lead his}} force north, join the army of Eustathios Maleinos, now governor of Cilicia, and block the rebel from crossing the Antitaurus Mountains. Leaving his son in control of Antioch, Bourtzes complied and marched north. In the ensuing battle at the fortress of Lapara {{in the province of}} Lykandos (autumn 976), however, the combined loyalist force was routed, with Bourtzes being the first to retreat according to the chroniclers. As Skylitzes pointedly comments, Bourtzes' conduct during the battle was attributed either to cowardice or to malice; certainly soon after, he deserted the imperial camp and joined Skleros. According to the contemporary Yahya of Antioch, Bourtzes at first fled to a fortress in the Anatolic Theme, but was followed by Skleros and persuaded to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his side. Bourtzes's defection brought Skleros control of Antioch as well: Bourtzes commanded his son Constantine to join him, and the city was left {{in the hands of the}} Arab Kulayb, who was soon overthrown by another Arab, Ubaydallah, who also joined Skleros. In the summer of 977, Boutzes was deployed, along with Romanos Taronites, in command of Skleros's forces shadowing the operations of the imperial army advancing from Kotyaion to Ikonion. The presence of the tribute caravan from Aleppo entangled the two forces in an impromptu fight at Oxylithos, which ended in a bloody defeat for the rebels. After this, Bourtzes again switched sides and rejoined the imperial army, now led by Bardas Phokas.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on their sex life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, {{has a couple of}} drinks, and goes to see the film Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons. Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially claims to be a Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> be with her.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, the {{fighting}} sparked between the Uzbek fighters {{and the native}} militant groups by the killing of Arab fighter Saiful Adil, an al-Qaeda operative, blamed on the Uzbeks fighters by Maulvi Nazir, described as a top pro-Taliban militant commander in the region. According to the other version, {{the fighting}} started after Maulvi Nazir, whom the government claimed had <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> its side, ordered the Uzbek followers of former Soviet fighters, Tohir Abduhalilovich Yo'ldoshev and Kamolitdinich Jalolov, to disarm, both were formerly the close confidants of Osama bin Laden.|$|E

25|$|The first {{trickle of}} Scotch-Irish {{settlers}} arrived in New England. Valued for their fighting prowess {{as well as}} for their Protestant dogma, they were invited by Cotton Mather and other leaders to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> help settle and secure the frontier. In this capacity, many of the first permanent settlements in Maine and New Hampshire, especially after 1718, were Scotch-Irish and many place names as well as the character of Northern New Englanders reflect this fact. The Scotch-Irish brought the potato with them from Ireland (although the potato originated in South America, it was not known in North America until brought over from Europe). In Maine it became a staple crop as well as an economic base.|$|E
25|$|Whilst in Ireland Wilson began courting Cecil Mary Wray, who was {{two years}} his senior. Her family, who had <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Ireland late in Elizabeth I’s reign, had owned an estate called Ardamona near Lough Eske, Donegal, the {{profitability}} of which had never recovered from the Irish potato famine of the 1840s. On 26 December 1849 two kegs of explosive were set off outside the house, after which the family only ever spent one more winter there. From 1850 Cecil‘s father George Wray {{had worked as a}} land agent, latterly for Lord Drogheda’s estates in Kildare, until his death in 1878. Cecil grew up in straitened circumstances, and her views on Irish politics appear to have been rather more hardline than her husband’s. They were married on 3 October 1891.|$|E
25|$|In the typed diary, Haig {{also claimed}} that on {{returning}} to GHQ at 3am on 25 March he telegraphed to Wilson (CIGS) and Milner (listed as Secretary of State for War – an error on Haig’s part, as Milner {{did not hold}} this position until April, and thus evidence that the account was written up later) to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. There is no record of any such telegram. Wilson’s diary records that Haig telephoned him at 7 or 8pm on 24 March, before the meeting with Petain, and after Haig’s evening visit to Third Army. Milner, whom as a Cabinet Minister Haig had no authority to “summon”, was already in France (on Lloyd George’s orders after a War Cabinet meeting on 23 March), having visited Tavish Davidson at GHQ whilst Haig and Lawrence were with Petain, then reaching Versailles at 2.30am on Monday 25 March.|$|E

25|$|Gandhiji {{stayed in}} the Ashram {{and spoke to the}} volunteers. He tried to boost up their morale, by {{explaining}} to them the principle of Satyagraha and the role of scarifies and suffering in it, and the need for extreme patience. He tried to reach a compromise with the orthodoxy and for this; he had to meet the Savarna leaders. His secretary sent a note of invitation to the Savarna leader Idanthuruthil Devan Neelakandan Namboothiri to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the camp. The haughty Namboothiri not only refused to accept the invitation, but also said that those who wanted to see him must go over to his house. So it was that Gandhiji and his party reached the Indanthuruthil Mana (a Namboothiri household) on the next day noon. They were made to sit in the portico of the house, while the Namboothiri and his Savarna comrades occupied the inner room. The Namboothiri believed that Gandhi and his followers were polluted by the touch of untouchables, and could not be admitted into the pure interior of an orthodox Mana.|$|E
25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking what I thought of situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. I said I would come over and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E
