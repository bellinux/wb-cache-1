40|$|In a {{continuously}} expanding wireless world, {{the number}} of ra-dio systems increases every day, and efficient spectrum usage be-comes a more significant requirement. Ultrawideband (UWB) and cognitive radio are two exciting technologies that offer new ap-proaches to the spectrum usage. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to shed the first light on the marriage of these two important approaches. The strength of orthogonal frequency division multi-plexing (OFDM) based UWB in co-existing with licensed systems is investigated. The opportunity concept is defined, and the require-ments of the opportunistic spectrum usage are explained. It is pro-posed to take the UWB-OFDM from the current underlay imple-mentation, and evolve it to a <b>combined</b> <b>underlay</b> and opportunistic spectrum usage technology, leading to cognitive UWB-OFDM. This way, we aim at making UWB more competitive in the wireless mar-ket with extended range, higher capacity, better performance, and a wide variety of applications...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{electron}} transfer (DET) to proteins is of considerable {{interest for the}} development of biosensors and bioelectrocatalysts. While protein structure is mainly used as a method of attaching the protein to the electrode surface, we employed bioinformatics analysis to predict the suitable orientation of the enzymes to promote DET. Structure similarity and secondary structure prediction were <b>combined</b> <b>underlying</b> localized amino-acids able to direct one of the enzyme's electron relays toward the electrode surface by creating a suitable bioelectrocatalytic nanostructure. The electro-polymerization of pyrene pyrrole onto a fluorine−doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode allowed the targeted orientation of the formate dehydrogenase enzyme from Rhodobacter capsulatus (RcFDH) by means of hydrophobic interactions. Its electron relays were directed to the surface, thus promoting DET. The reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) generating a maximum current density of 1 μA cm− 2 with 10 mM NAD+ leads to a turnover number of 0. 09 electron/s/molRcFDH. This work represents a practical approach to evaluate electrode surface modification strategies in order to create valuable bioelectrocatalysts...|$|R
40|$|The MAPK/ERK pathway {{is a major}} signal {{transduction}} system which regulates many fundamental cellular processes including the growth control and the cell death. As {{a result of these}} roles, it has a crucial importance in cancer as well as normal developmental processes. Therefore, it has been intensively studied resulting in a wealth of knowledge about its activation. It is also well documented that the activation kinetics of the pathway is crucial to determine the nature of the biological response. However, while individual biochemical steps are well characterized, it is still difficult to predict or even understand how the activation kinetics works. The aim {{of this paper is to}} estimate the stochastic rate constants of the MAPK/ERK network dynamics. Accordingly, taking a Bayesian approach, we <b>combined</b> <b>underlying</b> qualitative biological knowledge in several competing dynamic models via sets of quasireactions and estimated the stochastic rate constants of these reactions.

But how could a sender dynamically adjust its data transfer rate to best match the apparent residual absorption capacities of this system? To resolve this question, use could be made of the concept of saturation curves whereby a system responds linearly (or almost) to increasing load and then yield. The purpose of this report is to investigate the rate control mechanisms and the rate control performance capabilities of one implementation of the Xpress Transport Protocol (XTP) - SandiaXTP. The structure of SandiaXTP as a whole, and also more particularly its rate control mechanisms, are analysed with the help of Object Modeling Notation (O. M. T.). Some changes to the rate control algorithm are proposed, followed by the presentation and interpretation of 26 unicast and multicast rate control experiments done in a LAN environment. The study shows that rate control with a user level implementation such as SandiaXTP needs careful consideration of many factors if the quality of the rate control effectively exercised by the software should meet the expectations...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} stellar and nebular energy {{distributions}} of starbursts using our evolutionary synthesis model PEGASE coupled to the photoionization code CLOUDY. The originality {{of this study}} is to relate the evolution and the metallicity of the starburst to the past star formation history of the host galaxy. We compare our model predictions to an observed sample of ~ 750 starbursts. the most striking feature from line ratio fitting is the decreasing spread in ionization parameter U at high metallicity Z. The best fits of emission line ratios are obtained with a combination of a high- and a low-ionization components. No additional source of ionizing photons [...] shocks or hidden AGN [...] is needed. Colors and equivalent widths are fitted in coherency with emission line ratios. An underlying population is needed, even for small-aperture observations. This evolved population not only reddens the continuum and dilutes the equivalent width of the emission lines, but also participates in the ionization process. Its main effect on line ratios is to maintain a high level of excitation when the burst stops.

Readers {{of these sites}} may comment a story, and, as a consequence, a single story might receive {{thousands}} of comments. The quality of these comments may vary a lot, from spams and trolls to truly useful information. Separating good from bad comments is an important task, and is {{the primary goal of}} comment moderation. Moderators usually classify and score the comments, promoting high quality ones and, likewise, discouraging low quality ones.

40|$|This thesis explores {{fundamental}} {{improvements in}} unsupervised deep learning algorithms. Taking a theoretical {{perspective on the}} purpose of unsupervised learning, and choosing learnt approximate inference in a jointly learnt directed generative model as the approach, the main question is how existing implementations of this approach, in particular auto-encoders, could be improved by simultaneously rethinking the way they learn {{and the way they}} perform inference. In such network architectures, the availability of two opposing pathways, one for inference and one for generation, allows to exploit the symmetry between them and to let either provide feedback signals to the other. The signals can be used to determine helpful updates for the connection weights from only locally available information, removing the need for the conventional back-propagation path and mitigating the issues associated with it. Moreover, feedback loops can be added to the usual usual feed-forward network to improve inference itself. The reciprocal connectivity between regions in the brain's neocortex provides inspiration for how the iterative revision and verification of proposed interpretations could result in a fair approximation to optimal Bayesian inference. While extracting and <b>combining</b> <b>underlying</b> ideas from research in deep learning and cortical functioning, this thesis walks through the concepts of generative models, approximate inference, local learning rules, target propagation, recirculation, lateral and biased competition, predictive coding, iterative and amortised inference, and other related topics, in an attempt to build up a complex of insights that could provide direction to future research in unsupervised deep learning methods...|$|R

40|$|The haze {{pollution}} in December {{has become increasingly}} serious over recent decades and imposes damage on society, ecosystems, and human health. In addition to anthropogenic emissions, climate change and variability were conducive to haze in China. In this study, {{the relationship between the}} snow cover over East Europe and West Siberia (SC ES) and the number of haze days in December in central North China was analyzed. This relationship significantly strengthened after the mid- 1990 s, which is attributed to the effective connections between the SCES and the Eurasian atmospheric circulations. During 1998 – 2016, the SCES significantly influenced the soil moisture and land surface radiation, and then, the <b>combined</b> <b>underlying</b> drivers of enhanced soil moisture and radiative cooling moved the East Asia jet stream northward and induced anomalous, anti-cyclonic circulation over central North China. Modulated by such atmospheric circulations, the local lower boundary layer, the decreased surface wind and the more humid air were conducive to the worsening dispersion conditions and frequent haze occurrences. In contrast, from 1979 to 1997, the linkage between the SCES and soil moisture was negligible. Furthermore, the correlated radiative cooling was distributed narrowly and far from the key area of snow cover. The associated atmospheric circulations with the SCES were not significantly linked with the ventilation conditions over central North China. Consequently, the relationship between the SCES and the number of hazy days in central North China was insignificant before the mid- 1990 s but has strengthened and has become significant since then...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSEWe {{sought to}} study the {{possible}} association between parental age and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by using both a cohort design and a sibling design. METHODSOur cohort included all singleton births in Denmark from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2003, a total of 1, 311, 736 children. Cases of ASDs {{were obtained from the}} Danish National Psychiatric Register using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) - 8 and ICD- 10. RESULTSA total of 9556 children were diagnosed with an ASD. Both maternal and paternal age were associated with a greater risk of ASD in the offspring (hazard ratios ranging from 1. 21 (1. 1022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 1. 34) to 1. 65 (1. 0922 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2. 48) depending on combinations of parental age categories; < 35, 3522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 39, and 40 + years). For mothers younger than 35 years, the risk of ASD increased with increasing father 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s age group. For fathers younger than 35 years, the risk of ASD increased with increasing maternal age. CONCLUSIONSWe found an association between parental age and ASD in the cohort study, but the <b>combined</b> <b>underlying</b> mechanisms through which paternal and maternal age impact ASD risk do not seem to act synergistically. The results of the sibling analysis suggest that the association between parental age and ASD found in the cohort study cannot be accounted for by common genetic and environmental factors.
