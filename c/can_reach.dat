5|$|As {{early as}} 1881, {{industrialists}} proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation. Changes {{to the river}} {{over the years have}} included the construction of jetties at the river's mouth, dredging, and the construction of canals and navigation locks. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> as far inland as Lewiston, Idaho.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may even be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E

50|$|Simon Tatham and Gareth Taylor {{have shown}} that the fifth row <b>can</b> be <b>reached</b> via an {{infinite}} series of moves http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/solarmy/; this result is also in a paper by Pieter Blue and Stephen Hartke http://www.math.unl.edu/~shartke2/. If diagonal jumps are allowed, the 8th row <b>can</b> be <b>reached</b> but not the 9th row. It has also been shown that, in the n-dimensional version of the game, the highest row that <b>can</b> be <b>reached</b> is 3n-2. Conway's weighting argument demonstrates that the row 3n-1 cannot be reached. It is considerably harder to show that row 3n-2 <b>can</b> be <b>reached</b> (see the paper by Eriksson and Lindstrom).|$|R
5|$|Corrosion {{and heat}} {{resistance}} makes iridium an important alloying agent. Certain long-life aircraft engine parts {{are made of}} an iridium alloy, and an iridium–titanium alloy is used for deep-water pipes because of its corrosion resistance. Iridium is also used as a hardening agent in platinum alloys. The Vickers hardness of pure platinum is 56HV, whereas platinum with 50% of iridium <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> over 500HV.|$|E

5|$|Metamorphs weigh about 2g, {{while the}} largest adults <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> 50g. Individual frogs can vary {{substantially}} in body weight due {{to changes in}} the amount of stored fat, recent eating, and egg formation.

5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake. In addition, discrepancies between shell and other organic material ages <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb carbon-14 from the air. Other research has documented no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the populations}} of this species are spreading, and these <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> densities up to {{thousands}} of snails per square meter. Females lay egg capsules, each of which contains {{a large number of}} eggs, but only one snail hatches from the capsule. The snails reach sexual maturity in a year, and the total lifespan is 2 or 3 years.|$|E
5|$|The Catlins has a cool {{maritime}} temperate climate, somewhat {{cooler than}} {{other parts of}} the South Island, and strongly modified by the effect of the Pacific Ocean. Winds <b>can</b> <b>reach</b> considerable strength, especially on the exposed coast; most of the South Island's storms develop to the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.|$|E
