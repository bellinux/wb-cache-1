5|$|The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) {{was formed}} in 1989 as a project {{under the auspices of}} the National Association of Manufacturers. The GCC was formed to {{represent}} the interests of the major producers and users of fossil fuels, to oppose regulation to mitigate global warming, and to challenge the science behind global warming. Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA <b>climatologist</b> James Hansen's congressional testimony that climate change was occurring. The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the Montreal Protocol, the international treaty that phased out ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons, and the Clean Air Act in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Climatologists</b> have {{a unique}} role in {{providing}} various stakeholders and public data users with weather and climate information. In the north central region (NCR) of the United States, farmers, the agricultural sector, and policy makers are important audiences for climate science. As local and global climate conditions continue to shift and affect agricultural productivity, {{it is useful to}} understand how <b>climatologists</b> view their role as scientists, and how this influences their communication of climate science to agricultural stakeholders. In this study, data from interviews (N = 13) and surveys (N = 19) of state and extension <b>climatologists</b> in the NCR are analyzed to identify perceived roles and responsibilities as scientists and communicators. Pielke’s (The honest broker: making sense of science in policy and politics, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2007) framework of the idealized roles of scientists and their communication patterns are used to develop a typology of climate science communication. Findings reveal {{that more than half of}} <b>climatologists</b> perceive their role to provide information as pure scientists, while some engage in an arbiter role when requested. Fewer <b>climatologists</b> view their role as not only producing new knowledge, but also relating it to society and providing an expanded variety of alternative applications. <b>Climatologists</b> who perceive their role as simply providing information and letting data users interpret its application are missing an opportunity to reduce the gap between what scientists know and farmers believe. This suggests that if <b>climatologists</b> would frame their climate science message in terms of agricultural impacts, hazard mitigation and risk management alternatives they could help the agricultural sector adapt to and mitigate environmental risks from a changing climate...|$|R

[...] He illustrates by pointing out that steroids in a baseball player's system do not cause home runs all by themselves but do make home runs more likely.

40|$|Agriculture is {{particularly}} sensitive to environmental {{risks associated with}} uncertain atmospheric conditions, such as extreme weather events and variable climate patterns. As a result, {{it is important for}} farmers and the agricultural sector to access current climate science information while developing management portfolios to remain resilient and productive while adapting to and mitigating against environmental risks. State and extension <b>climatologists</b> have a unique role in collecting climate science information and disseminating this information to public data users, such as farmers. Because of complex social, cultural, and political factors that hinder the transfer of current scientific consensus on weather and climate knowledge from scientists to decision makers, {{it is important to understand}} how this information is communicated. This study presents data from surveys (N= 19) and interviews (N= 13) with state and extension <b>climatologists</b> in the North Central Region of the United States regarding their perceived roles and currently employed patterns of communication. Results are analyzed utilizing an adaptation of Fischoff 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) stages of uncertain risk communication, and Pielke 2 ̆ 7 s (2007) idealized roles of science in society. Findings indicate that the majority of <b>climatologists</b> in this region are focused on providing objective information in the role of a pure scientist. A lesser number of <b>climatologists</b> acknowledge the need to frame information as relevant and important, while considering connections of science to societal impacts. Very few <b>climatologists</b> recognize communication strategies of engaging and building trust with the audience, while outlining and enlarging options for individual and collective decision makers, including public policy development. There is an urgent need for agriculture to adapt to extreme weather events and variable climate conditions so that local communities and the global society may continue to obtain food, fiber, feed, and fuel. <b>Climatologists</b> have an important role in communicating current knowledge regarding climate systems to assist agriculture in remaining resilient and productive. As society demands scientific information to assist in individual and collective decision making, scientists will be tasked with making connections between science and societal impacts. By relating scientific research to risk management and hazard mitigation, <b>climatologists</b> will be taking the necessary steps to help farmers, as well as society...|$|R
