5|$|Denied {{the use of}} <b>compulsion,</b> Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Roman recruits, {{the vast majority}} of barbarian recruits were probably volunteers, drawn by conditions of service and career prospects that to them probably appeared desirable, in {{contrast to}} their living conditions at home. A minority of barbarian recruits were enlisted by <b>compulsion,</b> namely dediticii (barbarians who surrendered to the Roman authorities, often to escape strife with neighbouring tribes) and tribes who were defeated by the Romans, and obliged, as a condition of peace, to undertake to provide a specified number of recruits annually. Barbarians could be recruited directly, as individuals enrolled into regular regiments, or indirectly, as members of irregular foederati units transformed into regular regiments.|$|E
5|$|Pardelup Prison Farm {{opened in}} 1927, near Mount Barker, while Barton's Mill, though {{planned to be}} a {{temporary}} measure, remained open as a prison after World War II. Pardelup operated as a working farm, with a large-scale dairy, cattle and pig raising, and crops, and Barton' Mill prisoners cut timber to supply hospitals, houses, and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme's pumping station at Mundaring. In both cases, the only aspects resembling a prison were the presence of guards, and the <b>compulsion</b> to remain there – enforced by the remoteness of the facilities {{and the integrity of}} prisoners chosen to be transferred there. Escapees were generally punished with extended sentences at the harsher Fremantle Prison, which had little change over the four decades from 1920 to 1960.|$|E

50|$|Some common <b>compulsions</b> include hand washing, cleaning, {{checking}} things (e.g., {{locks on}} doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning {{on and off}} switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance. <b>Compulsions</b> are different than tics (such as touching, tapping, rubbing, or blinking) and stereotyped movements (such as head banging, body rocking, or self-biting), which usually aren't as complex as <b>compulsions</b> and aren't precipitated by obsessions. It can sometimes be difficult {{to tell the difference}} between <b>compulsions</b> and complex tics. About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.|$|R
40|$|Obsessive–compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) {{is characterized}} by the presence of either obsessions or <b>compulsions,</b> but commonly both. To make the diagnosis in ICD- 10, either obsessions or <b>compulsions</b> must be present on most days for at least 2 weeks (DSM-IV is broadly similar in its definition of OCD). Furthermore, the obsessions or <b>compulsions</b> must cause significant distress or interfere with the patient’s social or individual functioning, usu-ally by wasting time. Obsessions or <b>compulsions</b> can occur in the context of other disorders such as schizophrenia, depression and Tourette’s syndrome. This contribution discusses each of the main areas of psychopathology of OCD, namely obsessions, emotions, <b>compulsions,</b> avoidance and safety-seeking behaviours, and then briefly covers the nature of the handicap, family involvement and epidemiology.

5|$|Varney the Vampire was a {{landmark}} popular mid-Victorian era gothic horror story by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest, which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 {{in a series}} of pamphlets generally referred to as penny dreadfuls because of their inexpensive price and typically gruesome contents. The story was published in book form in 1847 and runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney. Another important addition to the genre was Sheridan Le Fanu's lesbian vampire story Carmilla (1871). Like Varney before her, the vampire Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the <b>compulsion</b> of her condition is highlighted.|$|E
5|$|With Arundel's {{change of}} {{allegiance}} came {{a conflict of}} interest. In August 1321, a demand was made to the king that Hugh Despenser and his father, Hugh Despenser the elder, be sent into exile. The king, facing a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, {{had no choice but}} to assent. Arundel voted for the expulsion, but later he claimed that he did so under <b>compulsion,</b> and also supported their recall in December. Arundel had suffered personally from the rebellion, when Roger Mortimer seized his castle of Clun. Early in 1322, Arundel joined King Edward in a campaign against the Mortimer family. The opposition soon crumbled, and the king decided to move against Thomas of Lancaster, who had been supporting the marcher rebellion all along. Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March, and executed.|$|E
5|$|During the Principate, {{it appears}} that most recruits, both legionary and auxiliary, were volunteers (voluntarii). Compulsory {{conscription}} (dilectus) was never wholly abandoned, but was generally only used in emergencies or before major campaigns when large numbers of additional troops were required. In marked contrast, the late army relied mainly on <b>compulsion</b> for its recruitment of Roman citizens. Firstly, the sons of serving soldiers or veterans were {{required by law to}} enlist. Secondly, a regular annual levy was held based on the indictio (land tax assessment). Depending on the amount of land tax due on his estates, a landowner (or group of landowners) would be required to provide a commensurate number of recruits to the army. Naturally, landowners had a strong incentive to keep their best young men to work on their estates, sending the less fit or reliable for military service. There is also evidence that they tried to cheat the draft by offering the sons of soldiers (who were liable to serve anyway) and vagrants (vagi) to fulfil their quota.|$|E
40|$|Obsessive-compulsion diorder (ocd) is {{characterized}} by recurrent obsessions and/or <b>compulsions.</b> Obsessions are intrusive and unwanted thoughts, images or feelings which elicit considerable anxiety and discomfort. Commonly recurring themes in obsessions are aggression, blasphemy, death and (unacceptable) sexual urges. <b>Compulsions</b> are repetitive, ritualistic behaviours or mental acts that are performed to reduce or neutralise the anxiety that is elicited by the obsessions. The most frequently encountered <b>compulsions</b> are ordering, counting, checking and washing. When the patient resists carrying out the <b>compulsions,</b> anxiety usually increases. Patients generally recognize that the obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> are excessive and irrational. Nevertheless, the obsessions and com-pulsions cause marked distress, are timeconsuming and interfere signiicantly with the person’s social or occupational life. Many patients experience both obsessions and compulsions; only a minority presents with either obsessions or <b>compulsions</b> (Foa & Kozak). Ocd is classiied in dsm- 4 as an anxiety disorder, although not all clinicians agree on this categorization (Nelson & Chouinard) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> {{are the two}} core {{features}} of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Mild and infrequent obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> are common. Persistent and distressing obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> of the kind seen in OCD occur in far fewer people. As {{is the case with}} other psychiatric disorders, many people with OCD do not seek help. Clinical observation suggests that help-seeking delay in OCD is substantial, averaging eleven years. A proliferation of research studies of non-OCD patient participants has arisen from the observation that some people in community settings have clinically significant obsessions and <b>compulsions.</b> Conversely, there is little research that considers why people with obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> delay help-seeking and why this morbidity may be missed. Aims: This thesis examined attitudes to obsessive-compulsive (OC) problems, the existence of obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> in non-psychiatric groups, the profile of OC features in a clinical OCD group, and the help-seeking and treatment experiences of people with OCD. Its primary focus was to discover barriers to disclosing obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> in order to seek help. Findings: Dermatology and obstetric outpatients and students exhibited obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> comparable to those evidenced by people with OCD. The content of an OC problem influenced judgements of fear and shame about disclosing the problem. People with OCD delayed seeking help because of fear, shame and lack of knowledge. Concealment had occurred {{in the hope that the}} problem would go away, or from fear of the reaction of others. Feelings of embarrassment and shame were pervasive. Implications: Continued research on public attitudes to OC problems and on the help-seeking experiences of people with such problems is necessary. Raising public awareness of obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> and their treatment may reduce stigma and fear. Ultimately, concealment is problematic for the person with obsessions and <b>compulsions,</b> and for the conceptualisation of OCD...|$|R
25|$|People rely on <b>compulsions</b> as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use <b>compulsions</b> to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not <b>compulsions.</b> Whether or not behaviors are <b>compulsions</b> or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while <b>compulsions</b> tend to disrupt it.|$|R
5|$|There is no state-prescribed {{religion}} in the country. The religious groups in the urban centre of Bangui, {{in the order of}} their population representation, are the Christians which form the majority, Animists following ancient beliefs, and Muslims. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception under the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Bangui is located in Bangui, as is the Church of Fatima. The archdiocese was established as the Apostolic Prefecture of Oubangui Chari on 8 May 1909. Pope John Paul II visited Bangui in August 1985. The seat of the archbishop is Notre-Dame Cathedral in Bangui. Islam is the last in the order of religious beliefs with about 20,000 Muslims in Bangui. However, prior to sectarian violence in the country, more than 100,000 Muslims lived in the capital. The late president Bokassa converted to Islam as a political <b>compulsion</b> under the guidance of the then Libyan President Gaddafi. He also assumed the Muslim name of Sala Eddine Ahmed Bou Kassa, but it was short-lived as he wanted a cathedral to be built in Bangui. The Church of Fatima and Notre Dame D'Afrique are located in KM 5.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{from its}} outset, the Yalta {{decision}} favored the communists, who enjoyed {{the advantages of}} Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe securely {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union, as well as control over crucial government departments such as the security services (this activity was initially dominated by Lavrentiy Beria's Soviet NKVD). Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the populist program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's delegation was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its political-military organizations became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the PKWN Manifesto and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support. From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established workers' councils, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and <b>compulsion</b> were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.|$|E

Yet {{research shows that}} obsessions and <b>compulsions</b> are related to one another. Moreover, OCD symptoms occur along thematic dimensions (or subtypes) that include both obsessions and compulsive rituals. Thus, many measures do not provide clinicians and researchers with the proper conceptual framework for best understanding and treating OCD symptoms.|$|R

METHODS: We conducted regression analyses with binge eating, purging, and the interaction of binge eating with purging as individual predictors of scores for impulsivity, obsessions, and <b>compulsions</b> in two samples of women with AN (n[*]=[*] 1373). RESULTS: Purging, but not binge eating, was associated with higher scores on impulsivity, obsessions, and <b>compulsions.</b> Purging was also associated with worst eating rituals and with worst eating preoccupations. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that purging, compared with binge eating, may be a stronger correlate of impulsivity, obsessions, and <b>compulsions</b> in AN...|$|R

Many OCD measures are weighted toward {{assessing the}} most common (quintessential) types of obsession and <b>compulsions</b> (e.g., contamination obsessions, washing/cleaning <b>compulsions).</b> Thus, all things being equal, individuals with the more common types of OCD symptoms (e.g., washing and checking) will receive higher scores than patients with other (less common but equally severe) types of symptoms (e.g., religious obsessions/scrupulosity).|$|R

For people with primarily obsessional OCD, {{there are fewer}} observable <b>compulsions,</b> compared to those commonly seen with the typical form of OCD (checking, counting, hand-washing, etc.).

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether nonclinical obsessions and nonclinical <b>compulsions</b> relate differently to cognitive and mood {{factors such as}} responsibility, perfectionism, trait anxiety and depressed mood. Two hundred and three nonclinical undergraduate psychology students (70. 4 % females, 29. 6 % males, mean age = 18. 7, SD = 1. 1) completed questionnaires. After controlling {{for the relationship between}} obsessions and <b>compulsions,</b> obsessions were found to relate significantly more strongly to depressed mood, trait anxiety, socially prescribed perfectionism and responsibility than <b>compulsions.</b> Conversely, <b>compulsions</b> were found to relate more strongly to self-oriented perfectionism than obsessions. These results were interpreted as providing support for the notion that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is maintained by a conflicted mental representation of the self and the world. Obsessions were interpreted as reflecting an overdeveloped vigilance for threat, responsibility and need for social approval. <b>Compulsions</b> were interpreted as emanating from the belief that the self is self-sufficient and resourceful, and that the world is ordered and systematic.
