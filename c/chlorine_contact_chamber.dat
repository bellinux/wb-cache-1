40|$|Clearwells {{are large}} water {{reservoirs}} often {{used at the}} end of the water treatment process as <b>chlorine</b> <b>contact</b> <b>chambers.</b> <b>Contact</b> time required for microbe destruction is provided by residence time within the clearwell. The residence time distribution can be determined from tracer tests and is the one of the key factors in assessing the hydraulic behaviour and efficiency of these reservoirs. This work provides an evaluation of whether the two-dimensional, depth-averaged, finite element model, River 2 DMix can adequately simulate the flow pattern and residence time distribution in clearwells. One question in carrying out this modelling is whether or not the structural columns in the reservoir need to be included, as inclusion of the columns increases the computational effort required. In this project, the residence time distribution predicted by River 2 DMix was compared to results of tracer tests in a scale model of the Calgary Glenmore water treatment plant northeast clearwell. Results from tracer tests in this clearwell were available. The clearwell has a serpentine baffle system and 122 square structural columns distributed throughout the flow. A comparison of the flow patterns in the hydraulic and computational models was also made. The hydraulic model tests were carried out with and without columns in the clearwell. The 1 : 19 scale hydraulic model was developed on the basis of Froude number similarity and the maintenance of minimum Reynolds numbers in the flow through the serpentine system and the baffle wall at the entrance to the clearwell. Fluorescent tracer slug injection tests were used to measure the residence time distribution in the clearwell. Measurements of tracer concentration were taken at the clearwell outlet using a continuous flow-through fluorometer system. Flow visualization was also carried out using dye to identify and assess the dead zones in the flow. It was found that it was necessary to ensure the flow in the scale model was fully developed before starting the tracer tests, and determining the required flow development time to ensure steady state results from the tracer tests became an additional objective of the work. Tests were carried out at scale model flows of 0. 85, 2. 06, and 2. 87 L/s to reproduce the 115, 280, and 390 ML/day flows seen in the prototype tracer tests. Scale model results of the residence time distribution matched the prototype tracer test data well. However, approximately 10. 5 hours was required for flow development at the lowest flow rate tested (0. 85 L/s) before steady state conditions were reached and baffle factor results matched prototype values. At the intermediate flow, baffle factor results between the scale model and prototype matched well after only 1 h of flow development time, with improvements only in the Morril dispersion index towards prototype values with increased flow development time (at 5 h). Similar results were seen at the highest flow tested. For fully developed flow, there was little change in the baffle factor and dispersion index results in the scale model with varied flow rate. With the addition of columns to the scale model, there was no significant change in the baffle factor compared to the case compared to without the columns, but up to a 13. 9 % increase in dispersion index as compared to the tests in the scale model without columns for fully developed flow. Further, the residence time distribution results from the scale model tests without columns matched the entire residence time distribution found in the prototype tests. However, for the model with columns, the residence time distribution matched the prototype curve well at early times, but departed significantly from it at times later in the tests. It appears the major effect of the addition of columns within a model clearwell is to increase the dispersion index and increase the proportion of the clearwell which operates as a mixed reactor. The results also showed there was good agreement between the physical model tests and River 2 DMix simulations of the scale model tests for both the flow pattern and residence time distributions. This indicates that a two-dimensional depth-averaged computer model such as River 2 DMix can provide representative simulation results in the case where the inlet flow is expected to be quickly mixed throughout the depth of flow in the clearwell...|$|R

As no purposely built sampling locations after outfall system, a simulator study coupled with batch tests has been conducted with a pipe loop which provides a similar contact time and hydraulic regime as that existing in the field to provide valuable information to correlate the E. coli kill with the fmal TRC after the chlorine contact, and show the exact pattern of E. coli disinfection in saline sewage. Experimental results indicate the chlorine demand of CEPT effluent is mostly satisfied within the first 10 minutes of contact, any longer contact will only increase the demand by around 3. 5 % and not lead to any substantial increase in the E. coli kill. The remaining E. coli levels are mainly dependent upon the prevalent TRC levels while their contact times play only a relatively insignificant role.

Preliminary studies were conducted under ideal laboratory conditions. In nitrogen-free buffer at pH 6. 0, BrCl found to be {{two to three times}} as effective as chlorine in inactivating more than 5 logs of poliovirus. Furthermore, BrCl retained its disinfecting ability over a wide range of pH. The primary sit 8 of action of BrCl on poliovirus was the virus protein; and infectious RNA was recovered from poliovirus in which more than 3 logs of virus had been inactivated by 0. 3 mg/l of BrCl. Bromine chloride was less affected than chlorine by the presence of interfering compounds such as NH 4 Cl and glycine, added to the water. Under simulated field conditions in the laboratory, a 5 mg/l dose of BrCl inactivated more than 5 logs of poliovirus in sewage effluent whereas the equivalent dose of chlorine inactivated only 2 logs. Disinfection of wastewater by BrCl and chlorine was also studied under field operating conditions by using a model <b>chlorine</b> <b>contact</b> <b>chamber</b> at a sewage treatment plant to treat large volumes activated sludge sewage effluent. An 8 mg/l dose of BrCl was determined to be more effective than an equivalent dose of chlorine in inactivating more than 4 logs of several types of human enteric viruses added to the effluent as well as viruses naturally present in sewage. BrCl was shown to require a shorter contact time and resulted in unstable residuals as compared to chlorine. Bromine chloride was also shown to be equally effective in inactivating human enteric viruses and coliform bacteria. Chlorine was more effective in inactivating human enteric viruses and coliform bacteria. Chlorine was more effective in inactivating coliform bacteria than viruses. Preliminary experiments also indicate that BrCl is a more effective disinfectant than chlorine of giardia cysts in water. Additional studies demonstrated that residual BrCl was less toxic than residual chlorine for fish. It is concluded that BrCl was a more effective disinfectant than chlorine of human enteric viruses and indicator coliform bacteria in water and wastewater and is therefore strongly recommended as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine...|$|E

But they also {{have the potential to}} react with natural organic matter (NOM) and form disinfection by-products (DBPs) that could be both cytotoxic and genotoxic. Four species of Trihalomethanes (THM 4) and five species of haloacetic acids (HAA 5) are the only two halogenated organic DBP classes regulated by US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Chloramine is used more and more widely in drinking water utilities as a secondary disinfectant since it can significantly reduce the formation of regulated DBPs. However, chloramination could produce more unregulated DBPs formation than chlorination according to some previous studies. To make it worse, many unregulated DBPs, which generally occur at very low concentration levels in drinking water, are proven to be more toxic than regulated DBPs by many orders of magnitude. Therefore, the investigation of unregulated DBP formation in chloraminated water samples and the associated health risks are warranted. In this study, a liquid-liquid-extraction/gas chromatography-electron capture detector (LLE/GC-ECD) method for haloacetamides (HAMs) was revised and validated. The method showed good accuracy and precision for 7 HAM species, but not for monochloroacetamide and monobromoacetamide. Together with haloacetamides, a total of 49 DBPs were measured in three batches of chloraminated reverse osmosis concentrates with increasing <b>chlorine</b> <b>contact</b> times.

Le modèle de Collins et Selleck {{permet de}} rendre compte de façon satisfaisante de l'évolution de la vitesse d'élimination des germes au cours du temps. La faible valeur du paramètre t trouvée (0. 26 min. mg/l pour les coliformes totaux et 0. 58 min. mg/l pour les coliformes fécaux) semble cependant démontrer que la période de latence est relativement peut importante surtout lorsqu'on utilise des dose de chlore élevées. Il s'avère d'autre part que la demande en chlore de ce type d'eau est très importante. La concentration en chlore résiduel dans le réacteur décroît très rapidement pour atteindre environs 10 % de la dose de chlore injectée et cela quelle que soit la dose utilisée (de 1 à 10 mg/l). Le dimensionnement des réacteurs de désinfection fonctionnant en continu nécessite de prendre en compte le comportement hydrodynamique de l'eau dans le réacteur. Sachant qu'un abattement de 3 U-Log est nécessaire, dans le cas de la réutilisation de l'eau pour l'irrigation, un modèle intégrant l'expression de la cinétique de désinfection et l'hydrodynamique du contacteur a été proposé. Les résultats mettent en évidence l'intérêt de concevoir des réacteurs se rapprochant le plus possible de l'écoulement piston. Secondary wastewater is considered {{as an important}} additional resource of water in a country, which has a semiarid climate as Tunisia. On quality basis, the use of water for irrigation is governed by chemical parameters of the water that affect plant, soils conditions and the underlying groundwater. Treated urban wastewater is susceptible {{to be used in}} irrigation without major risks (see table 1). However, the use of such a water can represent a risk of contamination of edible crops, pasture lands, and feed crops by direct contact with disease agent carried in reclaimed water or aerosols from spray irrigation. These sanitary risks can be considerably reduced with the practice of an efficient disinfection. Chlorinating is one of the simplest and less expensive disinfection processes. The objectives of this work are the study of the disinfection kinetics and the rate of exertion of chlorine demand of water, when the sodium hypochlorite is used for treating a secondary wastewater. for this, a batch reactor tests have been done. After applying a dose of chlorine (between 1 and 10 mg/l), we have determined the evolution with time of chlorine residual concentration and rate of inactivation of the total and fecal coliform. Chlorine demandTo describe chlorine decay in the complex milieu of water, like wastewater, Haas and Karra (1984) have developed followed equation:C=C 0 [XE-k 1 t+(1 -X) e]-k 2 twhere:C : concentration of residual chlorine, mg/lC 0  : dose of chlorine, mg/lX : empirical constantt : contact time, mink 1 and k 2  : rate constants, min- 1 In the case of wastewater chlorinating, we can ascertain that the chlorine concentration in the batch reactor decrease rapidly, {{in the beginning of the}} reaction, and very moderately after satisfaction of the initial chlorine demand. This initial chlorine demand is very important. It represents near 90 % of the dose injected in the reactor. The chlorine concentration decay can be described by Haas and Karra equation with X= 0. 9, k 1 = 3 min- 1 and k 2 = 0. 001 min- 1. After some minutes of contact time, we can notes, see figure 2, that the chlorine concentration decay is susceptible to be approximate by a first order equation:t ≥ 2 min ⇒ C ≅ 0. 1 e- 0. 001 tThe concentration of residual chlorine becomes practically constant in the reactor, once initial chlorine demand has been satisfied, with C ≅ 0. 1 C 0. Disinfection kineticsUsing a pseudo first order Chick and Watson model reveals that the rate of inactivation of coliform bacteria is not uniform. We can employ this model to fit experimental data only when we subdivide the process in two stages characterised by different kinetics. for example, the logarithm of fecal coliform survival rate can be expressed by the relationships:for C ∙ t ≤ 2. 85 min ∙ mg/L Ln(N/N 0) = - 1. 65 C ∙ tfor C ∙ t ≥ 2. 85 min ∙ mg/L Ln(N/N 0) = - 3. 89 - 0. 29 C⋄tCollins and Selleck (1972) developed a general kinetic expression for the effect of combined chlorine residual on both total and fecal coliform. Combining the work of chick and Gard (Gard, 1957) they developed the following formula describing the survival of these bacteria:for C∙t τ (N/N 0) =(τ/C∙t) nwhere C : the combined <b>chlorine</b> residual, mg/lt : <b>contact</b> time, minutet : an environmental coefficient or induction timen : Constant In this formula, we have assumed that the concentration of chlorine remains constant. We can apply this model when we consider that C is the chlorine concentration after the immediate wastewater demand had been satisfied. Using Collins and Selleck disinfection model to plot the survival rate of total and fecal coliform in chlorinated secondary effluent, we have obtained the coefficients below: for total coliform : n= 1. 94 t= 0. 26 min∙mg/lfor fecal coliform : n= 3. 1 t= 0. 58 min∙mg/lThe constant τ represents the time required for the disinfectant to diffuse through the cell wall and begin its disinfectant activity. we can see that this initial lag time is very short. The disinfectant becomes rapidly efficacious to inactivate coliform bacteria. Design of disinfectant contact facilitiesSo as to estimate the influence of the hydraulic efficiency of <b>chlorine</b> <b>contact</b> <b>chambers</b> on disinfection process performance, we have compared efficiency of two ideals reactors: the completely stirred tank reactor and plug flow reactor. The kinetic equations presented above had been established in a batch reactor. To obtain the mean conversion in the entire contactor, one has to apply the segregated flow model. Using the concept of segregated flow system, the survival ratio will be the sum of the batch reactions of all small aggregates, or:           ∞(N/N 0) =∫(N/N 0) batchE(Ɵ) dƟ            0 Ɵ : normalized contact time (contact time/hydraulic residence time) E(Ɵ)  : normalized frequency distribution of agesIn completely mixed regime, fluid particles are exponentially distributed throughout a tank until the fluid properties exhibited by the effluent leaving the unit are identical to those within the unit. Using Collins and Selleck model, the survival ratio corresponding to hydraulic residence time Ts and to the residual chlorine concentration C is expressed by equation:           ∞                      (τ/C∙Ts)            ∞(N/N 0) =∫(N/N 0) batche-ƟdƟ = ∫ e-ƟdƟ + ∫ (τ/C∙t) me-ƟdƟ            0                              0          (τ/C∙Ts) The survival ratio for a hydraulic residence times between 5 min and 60 min and a residual chlorine concentration between 0. 2 mg/l and 1 mg/l are reported in table 3 and table 4. In a plug flow regime all particles entering in a basin have equal velocity values, travel on parallel flow paths, and remain in the unit for an identical period known as the hydraulic residence time. the performance of such a reactor is identical at the batch reactor performance. In table 5 and table 6 we have reported the survival ratio given by plug flow reactor with residence time until 60 min and residual chlorine concentration between 0. 2 mg/l and 1 mg/l. Knowing that the secondary wastewater reuse necessitates a 3 U-Log fecal coliform inactivation, we can see clearly the importance of reactor design on his performance. Indeed, to reach a 3 U-log inactivation, it is sufficient (see table 6) to use a dose of 2 mg/l of chlorine and a hydraulic residence time of 30 minutes, in plug flow reactor. Such dose and the same residence time given only a 1 U -Log inactivation (see table 4) when the reactor is completely mixed...|$|R

Models were developed using multiple linear regression. Three predictive models were chosen based on statistical analysis and were tested on four natural waters. All models predicted well for ambient water conditions. No single model predicted better overall. Variations in the "reactivity" of waters due to precursor source were not adequately predicted, nor were chlorine-limited conditions...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{optimising}} {{the design}} of water disinfection tanks through numerical model simulations, results are reported herein of refinements made to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, integrated with scaled hydraulics laboratory experiments, of the flow processes in baffled <b>chlorine</b> <b>contact</b> tanks (CCT). Such chemical reactors are typically used in most water treatment systems worldwide to provide the means for disinfecting water supply. New experimental results obtained for key flow features of a physical CCT model {{have been used to}} validate the corresponding CFD predictions. The CFD simulations were performed using an improved low Reynolds number k– model to account for relatively low turbulence levels, similar to those occurring in the CCT, and which can also be found in other chemical reactors—particularly at the laboratory model scale. Good agreement was obtained between the CFD predictions and the experimentally measured data, with the modified CFD code predicting the size of a typical mixing zone to within 90 % accuracy and giving good agreement with the measured turbulence distribution. The CFD modelling concepts validated herein have ideal potential for use in the simulation of mixing processes and the design of water disinfection tanks in the field and at the laboratory scale as well...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the impact}} of bromide and iodide on {{disinfected}} waters was examined and potential treatment technologies for their removal or mitigation were investigated. Distributed waters from two Western Australian drinking water sources were evaluated {{in terms of their}} bromide and iodide concentrations, disinfection by-product (DBP) formation, halogen-specific adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) formation and chlorinous odours after disinfection. In both systems, the brominated DBPs dominated the measured DBPs and, in both cases, the known DSPs accounted for only 30 % of total organohalogens. Chloramination with a sufficient free <b>chlorine</b> <b>contact</b> time followed by ammonia addition, rather than preformed monochloramine, may be a viable mitigation strategy for the minimisation of I-OBPs, since exposure to free chlorine should promote the conversion of iodide to iodate, a safe form of iodine. This study has shown that bromide {{plays an important role in}} this process, mainly by enhancing the preferred conversion' of iodide to iodate. Ozone pre-treatment selectively oxidised iodide to iodate and minimised the formation of I-OB Ps. Complete conversion of iodide to iodate, while minimising the bromate formation to below the guideline value of 10 µg L- 1 was achieved for a wide range of ozone concentrations in raw waters, including raw waters with high bromide concentrations...|$|R

50|$|Currently, a lot {{of waste}} ends up in {{incineration}} plants or is dumped to landfill. Depending on the region, waste collection systems have advanced to separate collections for recycling, which allows easier production of refuse-derived fuel. The technology consists {{of a number of}} different treatment stages, depending on the input waste streams. The waste streams are typically purified, with recyclables being collected and sorted out of the waste streams. The waste is dried if necessary. The material is shredded to the required size and turned into , with a diameter of approximately 8mm. Terms of calorific value, ash content, <b>chlorine</b> <b>contact</b> and moisture content are important to rate the quality of the pellets. The calorific value is comparable with (and sometimes higher than) a few types of coal. The percentage of biomass is fairly high as well; it is more than 50%. Because it is in pellets, Subcoal shows hydrophobic behaviour and does not dissolve when the moisture content is increased, which is important when considering external storage. Subcoal is mostly dosed as a ground (pulverized) fuel. Subcoal is commercially used via various grinding media (direct firing); via a hammer mill (12 tonnes per hour), air-rotor mill (6 tonnes per hour) and via a bowl mill (4 tonnes per hour). Cement manufacturers, lime producers and energy providers spray the Subcoal powder with coal powder into their kilns.|$|R

Moreover, no change in E. coli strains’ resistance to amoxicillin (AMX) (minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) > 256 mg L 1) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) (MIC > 1024 mg L 1) could be observed after UV treatment, while the treatment affected resistance of the lower resistance strain to ciprofloxacin (CPX) (MIC decreased by 33 % and 50 % after 60 and 120 min, respectively). Contrarily, chlorination process did not affect antibiotic resistance of the investigated E. coli strains. Finally, the effe ct of UV radiation on the mixture of three antibiotics was also investigated and photodegradation data fit quite well pseudo first order kinetic models with t 1 / 2 values of 14, 20 and 25 min for CPX, AMX and SMZ, respectively. According to these results, conventional disinfection processes may not be effective in the inactivation of ARB, and the simultaneous release of ARB and antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations into UWWTP effluent may promote the development of resistance among bacter ia in receiving water...|$|R

40|$|Chlorine is {{extensively}} used {{to disinfect}} drinking water supply. However, {{the design of}} <b>chlorine</b> <b>contact</b> tank is usually based on the volume displacement criterion, paying attention that detention time {{would be at least}} of half an hour. This criterion relies upon the assumption that plug-flow conditions hold along the tank. However, the existence and arrangement of baffles in the tank, and the tank inlet and outlet configurations can result in a much more complex flow pattern, where turbulent mixing, dead-zones and short-circuiting exist. This situation could result in an inefficient use of chlorine due to the formation of potentially carcinogenic compounds, which originate from residual chlorine in the tank. Further some bypassing allows some out-coming flow with less of the standard amount of <b>contact</b> with the <b>chlorine</b> dose. Therefore, understanding hydrodynamics and mass-transfer characteristics within a contact tank is very useful. The objective of the paper is to present the preliminary results of a numerical study undertaken to investigate hydrodynamics and turbulent transport and mixing inside a contact tank. Two-dimensional steady-state and time-variable numerical simulations were performed with Multiphysics 3. 2 a™ in a contact tank geometry, which is that experimentally studied by Shiono and Teixeira (Shiono and Teixeira, 2000). Tracer transport was analyzed {{in the case of a}} burst of concentration. Both velocity profiles and flow-through curves were generally in good agreement with experimental data. The model results pointed out the presence of recirculation areas near the baffles and the corners formed by the baffles and the tank walls. These areas introduced dead-zones in the tank deviating flow patterns from ideal plug-flow condition...|$|R
