In this work, we pursue a detailed study of the influence of the geometry of the ferromagnetic part on both trapped fields and crossed field effects.

This extends significantly the accessible measurement range of “off-the shelf” magnetometers (e. g. SQUID, VSM). Unlike Hall probe mapping, the measured signal is representative of the superconducting currents flowing across the entire height of the sample. Since the device is based on a flux extraction technique and does not include any Hall probe, another advantage is that no gap between a Hall probe and the sample needs {{to be taken into account}} to interpret the results. In the present work we first show how the dimensions of the sensing coils and integration bounds are chosen in such a way the magnetometer is sensitive to dipolar magnetic moment of the sample, while being insensitive to moments of higher order. Next we study the relaxation of the trapped magnetic moment under various magnetization processes. The sensitivity of the device allows small variations of m (e. g. ~ 2 % for 1 hour) to be recorded. We show experimentally that the relaxation of the magnetic moment of the whole sample is reduced strongly if the superconductor is not fully magnetized, either in field cooled (FC) or zero-field cooled (ZFC) conditions. The practical consequence is that an abnormally slow magnetic relaxation (large E-J power law exponent n) under a conventional magnetization procedure indicates that the bulk superconductor could be magnetized further. In a second set of experiments, we study the increase of magnetic moment of a bulk superconductor when it is attached to a soft ferromagnetic disk.
