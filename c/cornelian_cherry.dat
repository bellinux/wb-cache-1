Unpackaged <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherries</b> were used as a control. Samples were taken initially and at intervals of 7 -days during storage, when quality parameters were measured. Results showed that modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) allowed the stored fruits to retain their weight and visual quality throughout the experiment, regardless of the gas combinations used, while {{by the end of}} the storage period the unpackaged fruit lost over 30 % of their weight and consequently visual quality. Overall, packaging in 60 %O 2 + 20 %CO 2 polypropylene (PP) and Air low density polyethylene (LDPE) could retard soluble solid contents, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, anthocyanin index decrease and pH increase during the storage time. Additionally, such packaging could lead to better surface color preservation than that of fruits kept in open containers. Furthermore, packaging in air low density polyethylene and 60 %O 2 + 20 %CO 2 low density polyethylene could delay total phenolics accumulation and increase peroxidase activity to levels higher than those in the control.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the anthocyanins, ascorbic acid content and the antiradical activity in less common fruit species native in the territory of Slovakia (black mulberries, <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherries,</b> blackberries, blackthorn, rowanberries) and honeyberries (Lonicera kamtschatica) originated from Kamtschatka. Anthocyanins were evaluated after extraction from solid materials with acidified ethanol or after direct solution of liquid samples with HCl in ethanol solution by spectrophotometer measurement. To evaluate the antiradical activity, a spectrophotometer method based on the reaction of antioxidants with a stable radical 2, 2 - diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyle (DPPH•) in methanol solution was used. The reduction properties of ascorbic acid are used in the measurement. The highest value of anthocyanin pigments was found out in honeyberries (Lonicera kamtschatica) of all analyzed clones. Black mulberries of the genotype M 104 and <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherries</b> of the genotypes 55 a 44 are the most significant sources of ascorbic acid among analysed less common fruit species. It is an interesting fact that blackthorns (Prunus spinosa) contenting the lowest value of ascorbic acid (10. 31 ± 1. 016 mg. 100 g- 1) and medium value of anthocyanins (1. 71 ± 0. 08 g. kg- 1) shows the highest level of antiradical activity (461. 25 ± 3. 69 % ≈ EC 50 = 0. 1084 ± 0. 0101). A similar phenomenon was observed in honeysuckles, too. According to these results we can suppose that another flavonoids (flavonols, flavons and flavanols) can also significantly contributed to antiradical activity of the blackthorns and edible honeysuckles. In summary, analysed less known fruit species are important sources of nutritive compounds, particularly anthocyanins, ascorbic acid and show significant free radical scavenging ability...|$|R

He does however makes a point of using deep-rooted pioneer plants such as lupins, sweet clover, lucerne and broom. These crops are said to aerate the soil and make sure no water is left standing near the tree. No use is made of wire meshes as protection against voles, since he states they are not efficient in preventing damage from voles using this technique anyway. He makes no use of contemporary fruit tree cultivars, but only uses (very strong/hardy) old, local (heirloom) cultivars. In addition to (old cultivars of) regular fruit trees, he also plants much fruit tree species that are specific to use in phytotherapy or which can only function as animal feed (i.e. crab apple, wild pear, wild cherry, blackthorn, rowan, wild service, service tree, <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry,</b> snowy mespilus, ...). Similar to mainstream permaculture, he makes no use of chemical fertiliser or pesticides, at all. It should be noted that due to the altitude he's at, his trees bear fruit later, meaning he can sell it after most (sealevel) farmers sold their produce. Due to this (and the fact that he produces heirloom fruit varieties, and not regular varieties), he is often able to get a better price for it. In some cases, customers (like distilleries) are even willing to pick the fruit themselves, eliminating the labour expense for him.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Red colored fruits such as <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> (Cornus mas L) are {{recognized}} as being healthy. The color of these fruits is an important sensory property in assessment of product quality therefore, minimizing the loss {{of color in the}} process is very important. Materials and Methods: In this study, comparison of the color, turbidity, degradation rate of anthocyanin, and rate of evaporation in <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> (cornus mass L) juice produced from microwave and conventional heating at different operational pressures (12, 38. 5 and 100 K Pa) was investigated. Results: The final brix juice 42  was obtained in 137, 125, and 93 min by conventional heating at 100, 38. 5 and 12 K Pa, respectively. Applying microwave energy decreased the required times to 115, 90 and 75 min at 100, 38. 5 and 12 K Pa, respectively. In both methods, the heating temperature at pressures of 12, 38 and 100 K Pa was 50, 75 and 100 ° C, respectively. The results also showed that hunter lab values (L, a, and b) were decreased with increasing the time of process, turbidity, and degradation rate of anthocyanin. Conclusions: The heating method affects the color, degradation rate of anthocyanins and evaporation rate of <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> concentrate. Also the results indicated that temperature and time of process are higher in conventional heating than in microwave. Degradation of anthocyanins and color of <b>cornelian</b> <b>cherry</b> juice was more evident in rotary evaporation as compared to microwave heating method.
