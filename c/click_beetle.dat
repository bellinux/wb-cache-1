5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common <b>click</b> <b>beetle,</b> are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
5|$|Beetle larvae can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles {{along the sides of}} their bodies. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
40|$|Wireworms, {{the larvae}} of Agriotes spp., are an {{increasing}} problem on many organically managed farms with potato or vegetable production. The {{damage caused by}} wireworms is economically significant. With the use of pheromone traps {{it is possible to}} get more information about the habitat requirements of <b>click</b> <b>beetles.</b> In 2005 and 2006 <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> were monitored at different locations in northern Germany. Because of the warmer springtime in 2005, the first peak of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> was about two weeks earlier than in 2006. The second peak was found one month later. The presented data show the highest occurrence of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> in ryegrass-clover mixtures in both years. The catches in cereals were much lower than in ryegrass-clover. The reasons for the differences of the trapped <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> in the different cereal fields cannot been explained so far. In the majority of cases the trapped number of Agriotes lineatus was higher than for A. obscurus...|$|R

25|$|The blue {{nuthatch}} is very active, {{often seen}} running in pairs, in larger groups, or mingling in mixed-species foraging flocks. It feeds on invertebrates, of which {{some have been}} particularly identified as common in its diet, including species of Trachypholis Zopheridae beetles, typical <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> (of the Elateridae family), leaf beetles (in the subfamily Eumolpinae) and spiders and moth caterpillars. It typically forages for prey in {{the upper half of}} large trees, and occasionally in smaller trees. While prospecting on tree trunks, the bird protects its corneas from falling bark and other debris by contracting the bare skin around its eyes – an adaptation apparently unique to the species.|$|E
500|$|The actual [...] "gold-bug" [...] in {{the story}} is not a real insect. Instead, Poe {{combined}} characteristics of two insects found {{in the area where}} the story takes place. The Callichroma splendidum, though not technically a scarab but a species of longhorn beetle (Cerambycidae), has a gold head and slightly gold-tinted body. The black spots noted {{on the back of the}} fictional bug can be found on the Alaus oculatus, a <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> also native to Sullivan's Island.|$|E
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), common teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important European otter (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some [...] of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.|$|E
