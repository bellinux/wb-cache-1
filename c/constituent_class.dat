40|$|This essay investigates {{compounding}} in Namagowab and English, which {{belong to}} two widely divergent groups of languages, the Khoesan and Indo-European, respectively. The first motive is to investigate {{how and why}} new words are created from existing ones. The reading and data interpretation seeks an understanding of word formation and an overview of semantic compositionality, structure and productivity, within the broad context of cognitive, lexicalist and distributed morphology paradigms. This coupled with history reading about the languages and its people, is used to speculate about why compounds feature in lexical creation. Compounding is prevalent in both languages and their distance in terms of phylogenetic relationships should allow limited generalizing about these processes of formation. Word lists taken from dictionaries in both languages were analyzed by entering the words in Excel spreadsheets so that various attributes of these words, such as word type, compound class (Noun, Verb, Preposition, Adjective and Adverb) and <b>constituent</b> <b>class</b> could be counted, and described with formulae, and compound and constituent meaning analyzed. The conclusion was that socio historical factors such as language contact, and aspects of cognition such as memory and transparency, account for compounding in a language in addition to typology...|$|E

Eighty eight and two hundred thirty eight constituents identified accounted for 90. 6 and 86. 6 % {{of the total}} oils of G. hirsuta Waldst. & Kit. and G. hederacea L., respectively. In both oils the dominant <b>constituent</b> <b>class</b> was the terpenoid one, 75. 7 % in G. hirsuta and 47. 4 % in G. hederacea. 1, 8 -Cineole (42. 6 %) and spathulenol (7. 4 %) were the main constituents of G. hirsuta oil while palmitic (13. 3 %) and linoleic acids (9. 3 %) alongside with germacrene D (7. 3 %) were the major ones of G. hederacea oil. The relative percentage of the sesquiterpene fraction (19. 5 %) and fatty acid derived compounds (7. 6 %) distinguished nicely G. hirsuta from G. hederacea. Additionally, oxygenated sesquiterpenes (16. 9 %) dominated the oil of G. hirsuta, while the reversed situation was noted for G. hederacea oil (the hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes amounted to only 2. 6 %). The results obtained provide a rationale for the parallel ethnopharmacological usage of G. hirsuta and G. hederacea. This is the first report on the composition of G. hirsuta oil...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative image {{analysis}} often depends on accurate classification of pixels through a segmentation process. However, imaging artifacts {{such as the}} partial volume effect and sensor noise complicate the classification process. These effects increase the pixel intensity variance of each <b>constituent</b> <b>class,</b> causing intensities from one class to overlap with another. This increased variance makes threshold based segmentation methods insufficient due to ambiguous overlap regions in the pixel intensity distributions. The class ambiguity becomes even more complex for systems with more than two constituents, such as unsaturated moist granular media. In this paper, we propose an image processing workflow that improves segmentation accuracy for multiphase systems. First, the ambiguous transition regions between classes are identified and removed, which allows for global thresholding of single-class regions. Then the transition regions are classified using a distance function, and finally both segmentations are combined into one classified image. This workflow includes three methodologies for identifying transition pixels and we demonstrate {{on a variety of}} synthetic images that these approaches are able to accurately separate the ambiguous transition pixels from the single-class regions. For situations with typical amounts of image noise, misclassification errors and area differences calculated between each class of the synthetic images and the resultant segmented images range from 0. 69 - 1. 48 % and 0. 01 - 0. 74 %, respectively, showing the segmentation accuracy of this approach. We demonstrate that we are able to accurately segment x-ray microtomography images of moist granular media using these computationally efficient methodologies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis proposes {{the use of}} Machine Learning (ML) to {{two very}} distinct, yet compelling, {{applications}} – predicting cardiac arrhythmia episodes and predicting base station association in 5 G networks comprising of virtual cells. In the first scenario, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to classify features extracted from electrocardiogram (EKG) signals. The second problem requires a different formulation departing from traditional ML classification where {{the objective is to}} partition feature space into <b>constituent</b> <b>class</b> regions. Instead, the intention here is to identify temporal patterns in unequal-length sequences. Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), it is demonstrated that accurate predictions can be made as to the base station most likely to provide connectivity for a mobile device as it moves. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia affecting several million people in the United States. It is a condition in which the upper chambers of the heart are unable to contract effectively leading to inhibited blood flow to the ventricles. The stagnation of blood {{is one of the major}} risk factors for stroke. The Computers in Cardiology Challenge 2001 was organized to further research into the prediction of episodes of AF. This research revisits the problem with some modifications. Patient-specific classifiers are developed for AF prediction using a different dataset and employing shorter EKG signal epochs. SVM classification yielded an average accuracy of just above 95 % in identifying EKG epochs appearing just prior to fibrillatory rhythms. 5 G cellular networks were envisaged to provide enhanced data rates for mobile broadband, support low-latency communication, and enable the Internet of Things (IoT). Handovers contribute to latency as mobile devices are switched between base stations due to movements. Given that customers may not be willing to continuously share their exact locations due to privacy concerns and the establishment of a mobile network architecture with dynamically created virtual cells, this research presents a solution for proactive mobility management using RNNs. A RNN is trained to identify patterns in variable-length sequences of Received Signal Strength (RSS) values, where a mobile device is permitted to connect to more than a single base station at a time. A classification accuracy of over 98 % was achieved in a simulation model that was set up emulating an urban environment...|$|E

No presente trabalho, foram analisadas a composição e a morfologia das ceras foliares cuticulares de 13 espécies de Croton. Para a maioria das espécies, foram amostrados três indivíduos. A morfologia das ceras foi analisada por microscopia eletrônica de varredura. Diversos tipos de depósitos cerosos foram observados (amorfos, plaquetas, grânulos), principalmente na face adaxial e caracterizando grupos de espécies. A observação dos padrões de depósitos cerosos de várias espécies foi prejudicada na face abaxial, devido à alta densidade de tricomas. As ceras foram extraídas por três imersões consecutivas das folhas em diclorometano e a separação das classes dos constituintes foi feita por cromatografia em camada delgada preparativa. A análise da distribuição dos constituintes foi realizada por cromatografia a gás acoplada a espectrometria de massas. n-Alcanos e álcoois primários foram detectados em todos os indivíduos analisados. Triterpenos também são muito comuns, não tendo sido detectados em apenas uma espécie. Os esteroides são constituintes raros nas espécies analisadas. Os resultados da distribuição de n-alcanos, álcoois primários e triterpenos foram utilizados para o estabelecimento de afinidades químicas por meio de análises de agrupamento pelo método UPGMA, empregando-se distâncias euclidianas (n-alcanos e álcoois) e coeficiente de DICE (triterpenos), baseando-se na distribuição de cada classe de constituinte isoladamente e combinando-se as distribuições de n-alcanos e álcoois primários. Não se notou congruência entre as topologias dos dendrogramas de afinidades químicas e a filogenia {{molecular}} do gênero. Observou-se coerência entre algumas afinidades químicas e características morfológicas, como tipos de tricomas foliares e presença de glândulas peciolares. A distribuição de n-alcanos, álcoois primários e triterpenos mostraram-se úteis como caracteres da maioria das espécies analisadas. Entre os constituintes analisados, distribuição de álcoois primários revelou-se o melhor marcador para a caracterização de espécies. A variação intraespecífica, no entanto, impede que esses caracteres sejam úteis como marcadores taxonômicos de algumas espécies de CrotonCroton comprises nearly 1300 species {{distributed in}} tropical and subtropical areas {{of either the}} New or Old Worlds, making up the largest genus of Euphorbiaceae. In the present work, the chemical composition and the morphology of the foliar cuticular waxes of 13 species of Croton were analized. Three individuals were sampled for analyses of most species. 	The morphology of the waxes was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Several types of wax deposits were observed (amorph, platlets, granules), chiefly on the adaxial side, characterizing groups of species. The observation of wax deposits on the abaxial side was hampered in several species due to the high density of trichomes. 	The cuticular wax was extracted by three successive immersions of the leaves in dichloromethane, and {{the separation of the}} constituent classes was achieved by preparative thin layer chromatography. The analyses of the distribution of the constituents were performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. n-Alkanes and primary alcohols were detected in all analyzed individuals. Triterpenes were also very common, having not been detected in only one species. Steroids are rare constituents in the analyzed species. The results of the distribution of n-alkanes, primary alcohols and triterpenes were used for the establishment of chemical affinities using cluster analysis by the UPGMA method and Euclidean distances (n-alkanes and alcohols) and DICE coefficient, based on the distribution of each <b>constituent</b> <b>class</b> alone and combining the distribution of n-alkanes and primary alcohols. 	No congruence was noted between the topologies of the dendrograms of chemical affinity and the molecular phylogeny of the genus. Coherence was observed between chemical affinities and morphologic characteristics, such as types of foliar trichomes and petiolar glands. The distribution of n-alkanes, primary alcohols and triterpenes were shown to be useful as characters for most analyzed species. Among the constituents analyzed, the distribution of primary alcohols was the best marker for species characterization. Intraspecific variation, however, precludes the use of these characters as taxonomic markers of some Croton specie...|$|E

As such, accurate lipid extraction, quantification, and identification is critical to obtain comprehensive insight into a coral’s condition. However, discrepancies exist in sample preparation methodology globally, and it is currently unknown whether these techniques generate analogous results. This study compared the two most common sample preparation techniques for lipid analysis in corals: (1) tissue isolation by air-spraying and (2) crushing the coral in toto. Samples derived from each preparation technique were subsequently analysed to quantify lipids and their <b>constituent</b> <b>classes</b> and fatty acids in four common, scleractinian coral species representing three distinct morphotypes (Acropora millepora, Montipora crassotuberculata, Porites cylindrica, and Pocillopora damicornis). Results revealed substantial amounts of organic material, including lipids, retained in the skeletons of all species following air-spraying, causing a marked underestimation of total lipid concentration using this method. Moreover, lipid class and fatty acid compositions between the denuded skeleton and sprayed tissue were substantially different. In particular, the majority of the total triacylglycerol and total fatty acid concentrations were retained in the skeleton (55 – 69 % and 56 – 64 %, respectively). As such, the isolated, sprayed tissue cannot serve as a reliable proxy for lipid quantification or identification in the coral holobiont.

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{solvents}} (HCS) {{are complex}} mixtures of alkanes, branched alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics {{that are used}} in manufacturing a variety of household and commercial products such as aerosol coatings. These solvents contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which can react photochemically in the atmosphere to contribute to ground-level ozone formation. To determine the air-quality impact of HCS, a quantitative assessment of their ozone formation potential (i. e. reactivity) is needed. At present, except for a few HCS, no experimental data are available for determining their maximum impact on urban ozone formation (i. e. maximum incremental reactivity or MIR). Although a computational method exists for determining the MIR value, the detailed chemical speciation data needed for such a calculation may not be available for all HCS. In this work, we have developed an empirical estimation method for calculating the MIRs of HCS. This method assumes that the overall reactivity of a HCS can be separated into the contribution from its chemical <b>constituent</b> <b>classes</b> such as n-alkane, branched-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and substituted aromatics. A boiling point-MIR relationship was developed for each chemical class, and composition weighted n-alkane-branched alkane-cycloalkane-aromatics surrogate mixtures were used to calculate the reactivity of HCS with different boiling ranges. During its development, this estimation technique was tested against the hydrocarbon solvent data provided by the Chemical Manufacturing Association (CMA), and over 90 percent of the calculated and experimental MIR values of hydrocarbon solvents differed by no more than a factor of 1. 15. This result suggests that the technique developed can be used for calculating the MIR values of HCS with no experimental data available. This estimation method was then used to develop a HCS classification scheme for the reactivity-based VOC regulation for aerosol coatings...|$|R
40|$|Lipids {{extracted}} from Candida albicans and C. tropicalis, {{but not from}} the weakly adherent C. pseudotropicalis, significantly blocked in vitro adherence of the respective yeast cells to buccal epithelial cells. The percentage of reduction from control values ranged between 16. 4 and 42. 1 %, depending on the species, the strain, and the solvent used for lipid extraction. The <b>constituent</b> lipid <b>classes</b> of both the acetone and chloroform-methanol extracts of C. albicans ATCC 10231 were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The individual classes were isolated by preparative thin-layer chromatography and then tested for their effects on the adherence of this strain to buccal epithelial cells. Individual phospholipids, sterols, and steryl esters blocked adherence significantly (between 15. 5 and 55. 7 % reduction). Triacylglycerols and free fatty acids showed no effect whatsoever. The same results were obtained when standard lipid samples were investigated...|$|R
