40|$|This paper {{examines}} the incremental effect <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> {{as compared to}} simple compensation on post-complaint satisfaction. In overcompensation, consumers {{are entitled to a}} refund that is more than the purchase price, whereas in simple compensation, the refund given is equivalent to if not less than the purchase price. A meta-analysis of 17 experimental studies shows that overcompensation has a substantially lower incremental effect on post-complaint satisfaction than simple compensation. However, when distinguishing between transaction-specific satisfaction and cumulative satisfaction, the smaller effect size <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> mainly holds true for transaction-specific satisfaction. For cumulative satisfaction, the effect size <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> is only marginally smaller. While counter-intuitive, these results appear to have a basis in three established theoretical frameworks, namely the Weber-Fechner law, prospect theory, and the different phenomenologies of the two satisfaction constructs. Implications are discussed for marketing research as well as for complaint management. Areas for future research are also explored...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> financial <b>overcompensation</b> {{as a means}} to enhance customer loyalty after a product failure. Overcompensation implies that customers are entitled to a refund that is larger than the purchase price. It is, however, still unclear whether large overcompensations entail saturation effects, or alternatively, result in an actual drop in customer loyalty. We predicted that the overcompensation-loyalty relationship is generally characterized by an inverted U-shaped function. In line with this prediction, the results of four studies showed that mild overcompensations had, on average, a positive effect on customer loyalty beyond equal compensation, but only up to compensation levels of approximately 150 % of the purchase price of faulty products. Beyond this level, the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> diminished, eventually leading to a general drop in customer loyalty. Despite this overall pattern, two studies revealed robust individual differences in how customers react to increasing <b>overcompensation.</b> A majority <b>of</b> customers increased their loyalty when the overcompensation enlarged, but the curve flattened out in the high range. However, there was also a smaller portion of customers who reacted negatively to every form <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation.</b> A practical implication of these findings, therefore, is that companies should not offer compensations that are greater than 150 % of the initial price, as these do not contribute to greater loyalty in any category of customers...|$|R

40|$|In modern {{electrical}} networks thyristor-switched capacitors (TSC) {{are most}} used devices for VAR compensation. These devices don’t contain rotating parts and mechanical contacts, provide a stepwise <b>control</b> <b>of</b> reactive power and no generation of harmonics to the network. However, {{with the help}} of TSC it’s not possible to ensure smooth <b>control</b> <b>of</b> reactive power and capacitor banks (CB) are exposed to the negative impact of higher harmonic components of the network voltage. Hybrid VAR compensator don’t have such drawbacks. It consists of active filter (AF) and capacitor bank with discrete regulation. The main drawback of such systems is the necessity of accessing all six terminals of CB, while most of them are manufactured with three terminals, internally delta-connected. In the article, the topology and <b>control</b> system <b>of</b> hybrid VAR compensator free from beforementioned drawback, is proposed. The control system provides operating modes <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> or undercompensation reactive power. VAR distribution regulator performs redistribution of reactive power between active filter and capacitor banks with the condition to minimize active filter’s power.

Proposed approach allows to provide smooth <b>control</b> <b>of</b> reactive power, isolate the capacitor bank from harmonic currents and use a more effective low-voltage power component...|$|R

40|$|Some {{efforts to}} reduce {{invasive}} populations have paradoxically led to population increases. This phenomenon, referred to as overcompensation, occurs when reduced intraspecific pressures increase juvenile survival or maturation rates, leading to increased population size. Overcompensation in response to eradication efforts could derail management efforts, {{so it would be}} beneficial to evaluate the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> prior to removal. We conducted a series of experiments to examine the potential for <b>overcompensation</b> <b>of</b> a non-native population of the European green crab, Carcinus maenas, which was being removed in Bodega Harbor, California. First, we examined the impact of adults on juvenile survival by measuring adult cannibalism on juveniles in the presence and absence of alternative prey, and the survival of tethered juveniles at varying adult densities. Second, we examined how adult presence affected juvenile short-term foraging and growth rates. Although adult presence reduced juvenile short-term foraging, we detected only minimal cannibalism and found no evidence that adults greatly reduce juvenile growth or survivorship. These results suggest that overcompensation is not likely to occur in this population in response to removal. We assessed this prediction using pre- and post-removal surveys of juvenile recruitment in Bodega Harbor compared to nearby populations, testing for evidence <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation.</b> Relative juvenile abundance did not statistically increase in removal compared to reference populations, consistent with our conclusion from the experiments. This experimental approach which focuses on an organism’s population biology provides a tool to assess capacity for assessing the capacity for overcompensation in management strategies for invasive species...|$|R

Overcompensation occurs when limiting resources are better exploited by a genetically mixed than by a uniform population, and is often causally related to frequency-dependent selection. We have designed experiments to test whether overcompensation occurs in Drosophila melanogaster, using the Sod locus as a marker. Tests are made at each of two densities and two temperatures for cultures with desired genetic compositions. Both temperature and density have statistically significant effects on the per-female productivity of the cultures. More important, there are strong effects due to overcompensation. Cultures that are more polymorphic are also more productive than less polymorphic ones even when the level of individual heterozygosity is the same in all. There is also overdominance for the Sod locus: the heterozygotes are more productive than either homozygote at every temperature and density, and the differences are statistically significant in several cases. These results corroborate previous studies showing that overdominance may contribute to the maintenance of the Sod polymorphisms. Moreover, our results indicate that the significnace <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> as a mechanism to account for polymorphism in natural populations deserves further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{homeostasis}} theory (RHT) {{suggests that}} changes {{made to the}} intrinsic risk of environments are negated {{in one of three}} ways: behavioural adjustments within the environment, mode migration, and avoidance of the physical risk. To date, this three-way model of RHT has little empirical support, whilst research findings on RHT have at times been diametrically opposed. A reconciliation of apparently opposing findings might be possible by suggesting that extrinsic compensation fails to restore previously existing levels of actual risk in cases where behavioural adjustments within the environment are incapable of negating intrinsic risk changes. This paper reports a study in which behavioural adjustments within the physical risk-taking environment are capable of reconciling target with actual risk. The results provide positive support for RHT in the form <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> for the intrinsic risk change on specific driver behaviours. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Mean-field {{theory is}} used to model {{polyelectrolyte}} adsorption and the possibility <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> <b>of</b> charged surfaces. For charged surfaces that are also chemically attractive, the overcharging is large in high salt conditions, amounting to 20 - 40 % of the bare surface charge. However, full charge inversion is not obtained in thermodynamical equilibrium for physical values of the parameters. The overcharging increases with addition of salt, but {{does not have a}} simple scaling form with the bare surface charge. Our results indicate that more evolved explanation is needed in order to understand polyelectrolyte multilayer built-up. For strong polymer-repulsive surfaces, we derive simple scaling laws for the polyelectrolyte adsorption and overcharging. We show that the overcharging scales linearly with the bare surface charge, but its magnitude is very small in comparison to the surface charge. In contrast with the attractive surface, here the overcharging is found to decrease substantially with addition of salt. In the intermediate range of weak repulsive surfaces, the behavior with addition of salt crosses over from increasing overcharging (at low ionic strength) to decreasing one (at high ionic strength). Our results for all types of surfaces are supported by full numerical solutions of the mean-field equations. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, final version. to be published in PR...|$|R

One of the successful colonizers of this cave is the poeciliid fish Poecilia mexicana, which has received considerable attention as a model organism to examine evolutionary adaptations to extreme environmental conditions. Nonetheless, basic ecological data on the endemic cave molly population are still missing; here we aim to provide data on population densities, size class compositions and use of different microhabitats. We found high overall densities in the cave and highest densities at the middle part of the cave with more than 200 individuals per square meter. These sites have lower H 2 S concentrations compared to the inner parts where most large sulfide sources are located, but they are annually exposed to a religious harvesting ceremony of local Zoque people called La Pesca. We found a marked shift in size/age compositions towards an overabundance of smaller, juvenile fish at those sites. We discuss these findings in relation to several environmental gradients within the cave (i. e., differences in toxicity and lighting conditions), but we also tentatively argue that the annual fish harvest during a religious ceremony (La Pesca) locally diminishes competition (and possibly, cannibalism by large adults), which is followed by a phase <b>of</b> <b>overcompensation</b> <b>of</b> fish densities...|$|R
50|$|Alterations in {{resource}} allocation due to herbivory is studied heavily in agricultural systems (Trumble et al. 1993).

A previous correction of this feature selection bias suffers from a lack of generality in the method of ranking genes, from requiring many biological replicates, and from unnecessarily overcompensating for the bias. For any method of ranking genes on the basis of gene expression measured for as few as three biological replicates, a simple leave-one-out algorithm corrects, with less overcompensation, the bias in estimates of the level of differential gene expression. In a microarray data set, the bias correction reduces estimates of the probability of upregulation or downregulation from 100 % to as low as 60 %, even for genes with estimated local false discovery rates close to 0.
