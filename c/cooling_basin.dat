40|$|Geothermal plant {{operators}} {{are interested in}} investigating the ability of micro-organisms found in the cooling tower basin to metabolize and cycle sulfide to less toxic sulfur compounds. If the growth or activity of the organisms participating in sulfur-oxidation could be selectively enhanced, then hydrogen sulfide could be naturally abated in the <b>cooling</b> <b>basin,</b> substantially reducing {{the costs associated with}} the chemicals used for abatement. The use of respirometry has been proposed as a technique for monitoring the response of the microbial populations found in geothermal cooling towers to various conditions, including the addition of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Respiro-metry is a manometric measurement of dissolved gases that are in equilibrium in a con-fined sample volume. Since microbes expire varying amounts of carbon dioxide or oxygen as they metabolize nutrients, this technique can be used to evaluate their activities in process streams. This report describes a series of experiments designed to determine the suitability of respirometry for tracking microbial activity for evaluating and enhancing natural abatement processes in geothermal cooling basins...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} of complex research {{of heat and}} mass transfer in water media was used. This allows examining the interaction of some transfer processes in the natural <b>cooling</b> <b>basin</b> (lake Drūkšiai) : heat convection and conduction, direct and diffusive solar radiation, variable density {{of the water and}} heat transfer coefficient of the water-air interface. The combined effect of these natural and unnatural actions determines the heat amount that the basin is able to dissipate to the surrounding atmospheric media in thermal equilibrium (no change in the mean water temperature). This article presents a number of most widely used expressions for vertical and horizontal heat transfer coefficients. Suggestions are made that the mixing rate at the water surface is caused by natural space. There is analyzed case when there is no wind – calm.

40|$|Abstract — Experiments were {{conducted}} on a physical hydraulic model of a circulating water pump sump structure. The cooling water intake structure consisted of two circulating water pumps and two auxiliary water pumps withdrawing flow {{from one end of}} a <b>cooling</b> tower <b>basin.</b> The objective of the hydraulic model study was to evaluate the performance of the initial design of the pump sump and to develop modifications to eliminate flow problems such as severe vortexing, intense swirl, or uneven flow distribution at the pump bell. The initial design of the intake structure developed high levels of pre-swirl and strong vortices were observed entering the circulating pumps. Modifications were developed in the model to reduce the level of flow pre-swirl and vortex activity and to improve the flow conditions entering the circulating water pumps. Proposed modifications to the sump included the installation of sidewall fillets, back-wall fillets and center floor splitters. Modifications also included the installation of a curtain wall set at El. 1089. 95 om and 3. 71 om from the back-wall of the sump.

The model is also applied to sedimentary basins with decreasing geothermal gradient with time (i. e. <b>cooling</b> continental-margin <b>basins).</b> The vitrinite reflectance model is demon-strated to be consistent with observed reflectance data and tectonic informa-tion from the Sydney, Bowen-Surat and Gippsland basins in eastern Australia...|$|R

In this study, we present a numerical investigation of the effect of a small terrain feature (a 30 mhigh rim) on the mean and turbulent flows inside and downstream of an enclosed basin it surrounds. Results from high-resolution numerical simulations (10 m isotropic spatial resolution) indicate that small terrain features in the proximity of larger ones can induce relatively large modifications to the mean and turbulent flows. The 30 mhigh rim is found to {{have an effect on the}} mean wind speeds at least 600 m upstream from the basin. The main effect is a 10 % reduction in wind speed up to 120 m above ground level due to the upstream blocking effect of the rim. The presence of the rimcan also double the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) both inside and downstream of the basin compared to an otherwise identical basin without a rim. The slopes of the basin play an important role in first creating and then defining the wake, and in intermittent wind regimes most of the scalar transport from near the slope of the basin happens through slope roll vortices that define the edge of the downstream wake region of the basin. Inside the basin, the rim acts to limit momentum transfer in the lower half of the basin, which suggests a mechanical forcing effect induced by the rim on lower basin environments that could interact with thermal buoyancy effects in heated or <b>cooled</b> <b>basins.</b> Some of the wake features resemble wind-eroded surfaces in the wakes of Martian craters. Results also reveal a critical height level (43 m below the rim height) that acts as the most favored location for TKE production and destruction, which could be important for the top-to-bottomturbulence erosion of basin boundary layers.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Aquatic {{ecosystems}} are structured by environmental gradients, including temperature, depth, and water clarity. These gradients can mediate {{the strength of}} trophic interactions by influencing the distribution, physiology, and behavior of predators and prey. My dissertation addressed the following questions: 1) What factors determine the foraging success of pelagic piscivores during encounters with prey? and 2) How do temperature and depth mediate direct and indirect trophic interactions in lakes? First, I conducted feeding experiments to quantify the effects of turbidity and prey shoaling behavior on the foraging efficiency of Chinook salmon during encounters with Pacific herring. Chinook salmon successfully consumed herring during only 1 - 4 % of encounters, limited by the rates of attacks per encounter and capture success (prey consumed per attack). Capture success declined with increasing turbidity and prey shoaling. These results indicate post-encounter processes can strongly limit feeding rates of pelagic piscivores and they provide the necessary parameters to incorporate these processes into foraging models. Second, I conducted field sampling in Lake Chelan, Washington to quantify how the strengths of trophic interactions between zooplankton, mysid shrimp, kokanee, and lake trout changed along environmental gradients. Bioenergetics and population models revealed strong predation impacts of lake trout on kokanee, which were initially masked from detection by ecological time lags. Mysids influenced kokanee through two negative indirect interactions, which differed in strength between contrasting lake basins. Mysids competed for zooplankton prey more strongly in a deeper, <b>cooler</b> <b>basin</b> due to their low thermal optimum. However, mysids provided greater energetic support to lake trout diet in a shallower basin, where lake trout were greater in density and inflicted greater predation risk on kokanee. A diel vertical migration model predicted mysids were more vulnerable to lake trout predation at shallower sites within the lake, and this prediction was supported by stable isotope analysis of lake trout diets. These findings revealed a mechanism by which mysids could cause greater food-web impacts in shallower systems where they are more vulnerable to predation. In conclusion, my results show strong associations between the physical environment, the behaviors of individual predators and prey, and the dynamics of populations and food webs...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal along-valley {{wind systems}} {{are driven by}} {{horizontal}} pressure differences caused by an overheating of the valley atmosphere during daytime and an overcooling during nighttime compared to the atmosphere over the adjacent plain at the same height. Equal energy inputs or outputs through equal areas at {{the tops of the}} valley and plain atmospheric volumes produce larger temperature changes in the smaller valley air volume. This amplification of the temperature response in the valley is proportional to the ratio of the normalized volumes which is called the 2 ̆ 2 topographic amplification factor 2 ̆ 2 or TAF. This factor is considered to be the primary factor responsible for the development, strength and diurnal periodicity of valley wind systems. A detailed testing of the TAF concept with observations is problematical in valleys because the pressure gradient causes a thermally driven wind to form along the valley axis that acts to equilibrate any temperature differences that develop between the valley and plain. In this paper, we provide an observational test of the TAF concept by comparing nighttime cooling inside a rather idealized bowl-shaped basin (Meteor Crater, Arizona) with <b>cooling</b> outside the <b>basin</b> over the adjacent plain. With such a topographical configuration, no thermally driven wind can develop to equilibrate the two air masses.

40|$|Abstract: An {{evaporative}} cooling tower is a heat exchanger where transformation of heat takes place from circulating {{water to the}} atmosphere. The warm water from the condenser is taken as an inlet water to the cooling tower and it is allowed to flow through the nozzles. As it falls down across baffles or louvers, the water is broken into small droplets. Simultaneously air is drawn in through the air inlet louvers provided {{at the base of}} the tower and then this air travels upward through the tower in the opposite direction of water flow. In this process a small portion of water gets evaporated which removes the heat from the remaining water causing it to cool down. This water is collected in a basin and is reused in the cooling water system process. Because of evaporation, some quantity of water is lost and thus to make up the loss, the fresh water is constantly added to the <b>cooling</b> water <b>basin.</b> In a Natural Draft Cooling Tower, warm water is cooled by evaporation process. Here, water gets cooled when a boundary layer is formed between saturated water and saturated air. If the mass flow rate is ideal, then the performance of cooling tower as well as the power plant will be improved. In this study, it is showed that by minimizing the size of water droplet, the performance of Natural Draft Cooling Tower can be enhanced.

40|$|N 2 {{fixation}} and ammonia oxidation (AO) are the {{two most}} important processes in the nitrogen (N) cycle of biological soil crusts (BSCs). We studied the short-term response of acetylene reduction assay (ARA) rates, an indicator of potential N 2 fixation, and AO rates to temperature (T, - 5 °C to 35 °C) in BSC of different successional stages along the BSC ecological succession and geographic origin (hot Chihuahuan and <b>cooler</b> Great <b>Basin</b> deserts). ARA in all BSCs increased with T until saturation occurred between 15 and 20 °C, and declined at 30 - 35 °C. Culture studies using cyanobacteria isolated from these crusts indicated that the saturating effect was traceable to their inability to grow well diazotrophically within the high temperature range. Below saturation, temperature response was exponential, with Q 10 significantly different in the two areas (~ 5 for Great Basin BSCs; 2 - 3 for Chihuahuan BSCs), but similar between the two successional stages. However, in contrast to ARA, AO showed a steady increase to 30 - 35 °C in Great Basin, and Chihuhuan BSCs showed no inhibition at any tested temperature. The T response of AO also differed significantly between Great Basin (Q 10 of 4. 5 - 4. 8) and Chihuahuan (Q 10 of 2. 4 - 2. 6) BSCs, but not between successional stages. Response of ARA rates to T did not differ from that of AO in either desert. Thus, while both processes scaled to T in unison until 20 °C, they separated to an increasing degree at higher temperature. As future warming is likely to occur in the regions where BSCs are often the dominant living cover, this predicted decoupling is expected to result in higher proportion of nitrates in soil relative to ammonium. As nitrate is more easily lost as leachate or to be reduced to gaseous forms, this could mean a depletion of soil N over large landscapes globally...|$|R

A large isothermal basin of salt water has a layer of fresh water at the surface. Beside {{this is a small}} <b>basin,</b> <b>cooled</b> from above and connected to the large basin by horizontal tubes at the top, middle and bottom.

As a result, the ITCZ shifts into the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast to this basinwide response, little latitudinal asymmetry develops in the coupled model when the same land bulge is moved to the western continent, with the ITCZ staying on the equator. These model experiments demonstrate that the meridional structure of the oceanic ITCZ is largely determined by the continental geometry in the east, lending support to a westward control hypothesis based on simple linear wave dynamics. Under steady solar forcing, the model ITCZ displays substantial interannual variability in both intensity and latitude. A coherent interhemispheric SST pattern with opposing polarities is found to be associated with this ITCZ variability. Various oceanic–atmospheric feedback mechanisms involved in the formation and variability of the ITCZ are examined. 1...|$|R
40|$|Potentially {{important}} {{contributors to}} the topography and tectonics of multi-ring impact basins are the thermal contraction and thermal stress that accompany the loss of heat emplaced during basin forma-tion. Heat converted from impact kinetic energy and contributed from the uplift of isotherms during cavity collapse are important components in the energy budget of a newly-formed basin. That the subsequent cooling {{may have been an}} important factor in the tectonic evolution of the Orientale basin is suggested by the deep central depression and by a surrounding region of extensive fissuring. To test these concepts, we develop models for the anomalous temperature distribution immediately following basin formation, and we calculate the resulting elastic displacement and stress fields that then would accom-pany <b>cooling</b> of the <b>basin</b> region. All models predict subsidence of the basin floor and a near-surface stress field consistent with fissuring. In addition, the rates of cooling and of accumulation of thermal stress are in agreement with the inferred timing of fissure formation in Orientale. The sensitivity of the predicted displacements and stresses to the initial temperature field allows us to place bounds on the quantity and distribution of impact heat emplaced during basin formation. In order to be consistent with the observed topography and the distribution of fissures in the Orientale basin, the buried heat deposited during the basin-forming event was between 1032 and 1033 erg. It is likely that most of this heat was concentrated within a distance of 100 - 200 km from the point of impact...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of climatic {{processes}} such as {{cold air}} drainage flows are problematic over mountainous areas. Observation of cold air drainage is not available in the existing observation network and it requires a special methodology. The main objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the cold air drainage over regions with a slope. A high resolution infrared camera, a meteorological station and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were used. The specific objective was to derive nocturnal cold air drainage velocity over the slope. To address these objectives, a number of infrared measurement campaigns were conducted during calm and clear sky conditions over an agricultural zone (blackcurrant farm) in Canada. Using thermal infrared images, the nocturnal surface temperature gradient were computed in hourly basis. The largest gradient magnitudes were found between 17 h - 20 h. The <b>cooling</b> rates at <b>basin</b> area were two times higher in comparison to the magnitudes observed within slope area. The image analysis illustrated this considerable temperature gradient of the basin may be partly due to transport of cold air drainage into the basin from the slope. The results show that thermal imagery can be used to characterize and understand the microclimate related to the occurrence of radiation frost in the agricultural field. This study provided the opportunity to track the cold air drainage flow and pooling of cold air in low lying areas. The infrared analysis demonstrated that nocturnal drainage flow displayed continuous variation in terms of space and time in response to microscale slope heterogeneities. In addition, the analysis highlighted the periodic aspect for cold air drainage flow...|$|R
