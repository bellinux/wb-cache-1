5|$|The {{black stork}} mainly eats fish, {{including}} small <b>cyprinids,</b> pikes, roaches, eels, budds, perches, burbots, sicklebacks and muddy loaches (Misgurnus and Cobitis). It may feed on amphibians, small reptiles, crabs, mammals and birds, and invertebrates such as snails, molluscs, earthworms, and insects like water beetles and their larvae.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a higher}} fish {{richness}} {{in the southern part}} of the Western Ghats than in the northern, and the highest is in the Chalakudy River, which alone holds 98 species. Other rivers with high species numbers include the Periyar, Bharatapuzha, Pamba and Chaliyar, as well as upstream tributaries of the Kaveri, Pambar, Bhavani and Krishna rivers. The most species rich families are the <b>Cyprinids</b> (72 species), hillstream loaches (34 species; including stone loaches, now regarded a separate family), Bagrid catfishes (19 species) and Sisorid catfishes (12 species). The region is home to several brilliantly colored ornamental fishes like Denison's (or red line torpedo) barb, several species of Dawkinsia barbs, zebra loach, Horabagrus catfish, dwarf pufferfish and dwarf Malabar pufferfish. The rivers are also home to Osteobrama bakeri, and larger species such as the Malabar snakehead and Malabar mahseer. A few are adapted to an underground life, including some Monopterus swampeels, and the catfish Horaglanis and Kryptoglanis.|$|E
5|$|Pallid {{sturgeon}} {{are generally}} bottom feeders, skimming the sandy {{reaches of the}} various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though {{little is known about}} the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as <b>cyprinids</b> (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the parasitic infection status of <b>cyprinid</b> fish, Capoeta damascina in Gomban spring-stream, Kor River Basin, Fars Province, southwestern Iran. MethodsA total of 12 <b>cyprinid</b> fish (7 females and 5 males) {{were collected from}} Gomban spring-stream, Kor River Basin, Fars Province, southwestern Iran. The collected fish were dissected carefully and their internal organs such as liver, gonad, muscle, abdominal lobes, whole viscera and digestive tract were surveyed parasitologically. ResultsOne female <b>cyprinid</b> fish out of 12 fish was infected with three nematodes. Two nematodes (larvae) were identified as Contracaecum sp. which were attached firmly to the outer part of intestine and another adult helminth was recognized as Capillaria sp. which was recovered from digestive content. ConclusionsThis study is the first record indicating that <b>cyprinid</b> fish acts as a new host for recovered nematodes.

25|$|Habitat {{destruction}} and other causes {{have reduced the}} wild stocks of several <b>cyprinids</b> to dangerously low levels; some are already entirely extinct. In particular, the <b>cyprinids</b> of the subfamily Leuciscinae from southwestern North America have been hit hard by pollution and unsustainable water use {{in the early to}} mid-20th century; most globally extinct cypriniform species are in fact leuciscinid <b>cyprinids</b> from the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} cypriniform fossils {{are already}} assignable {{to the living}} family Catostomidae; from the Paleocene of Alberta, they are roughly 60 million years old. During the Eocene (55-35 mya), catostomids and <b>cyprinids</b> spread throughout Asia. In the Oligocene, around 30 mya, advanced <b>cyprinids</b> began to out-compete catostomids wherever they were sympatric, causing a decline of the suckers. <b>Cyprinids</b> reached North America and Europe by about the same time, and Africa in the early Miocene (some 23-20 mya). The cypriniforms spread to North America through the Bering land bridge, which formed and disappeared again {{several times during the}} many millions of years of cypriniform evolution.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>cyprinids,</b> such as {{the grass}} carp, are {{specialized}} herbivores; others, {{such as the}} common nase, eat algae and biofilms, while others, such as the black carp, specialize in snails, and some, such as the silver carp, are specialized filter feeders. For this reason, <b>cyprinids</b> are often introduced as a management tool to control various factors in the aquatic environment, such as aquatic vegetation and diseases transmitted by snails.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyprinids</b> {{are popular}} for angling {{especially}} for match fishing (due to their dominance in biomass and numbers) and fishing for common carp {{because of its}} size and strength.|$|E
25|$|Hearing is a {{well-developed}} {{sense in}} the <b>cyprinids</b> since they have the Weberian organ, three specialized vertebral processes that transfer motion of the gas bladder to the inner ear. The vertebral processes of the Weberian organ also permit a cyprinid to detect changes in motion of the gas bladder due to atmospheric conditions or depth changes. The <b>cyprinids</b> are considered physostomes because the pneumatic duct is retained in adult stages and the fish are able to gulp air to fill the gas bladder, or they can dispose excess gas to the gut.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, {{recreational}} and subsistence fishers took 4,300 tonnes, mostly perches and <b>cyprinids.</b> Later estimates are not available. The most significant recreational fishery by value is the Kola Peninsula Atlantic salmon fishery.|$|E
25|$|Goldfish, {{like all}} <b>cyprinids,</b> are egg-layers. Their eggs are {{adhesive}} and attach to aquatic vegetation, typically dense {{plants such as}} Cabomba or Elodea or a spawning mop. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most fish species, <b>cyprinids</b> {{generally}} {{increase in}} abundance in eutrophic lakes. Here, they contribute towards positive feedback {{as they are}} efficient at eating the zooplankton that would otherwise graze on the algae, reducing its abundance.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cyprinids</b> {{are highly}} {{important}} food fish; they are fished and farmed across Eurasia. In land-locked countries in particular, <b>cyprinids</b> {{are often the}} major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of biomass in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods, such as drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive frozen fish products made this less important {{now than it was}} in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places, they remain popular for food, as well as recreational fishing, and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.|$|E
25|$|Other popular {{aquarium}} <b>cyprinids</b> include danionins, rasborines, {{and true}} barbs. Larger species are bred {{by the thousands}} in outdoor ponds, particularly in Southeast Asia, and trade in these aquarium fishes is of considerable commercial importance. The small rasborines and danionines are perhaps only rivalled by characids and poecilid livebearers in their popularity for community aquaria.|$|E
25|$|The non-cichlid native fish include African tetras (Brycinus), <b>cyprinids</b> (Enteromius, Garra, Labeo, Labeobarbus, Rastrineobola and Xenobarbus), airbreathing catfish (Clariallabes, Clarias and Xenoclarias), bagrid catfish (Bagrus), loach catfish (Amphilius and Zaireichthys), silver butter catfish (Schilbe intermedius), Synodontis {{squeaker}} catfish, Nothobranchius killifish, poeciliids (Aplocheilichthys and Micropanchax), the spiny eel Mastacembelus frenatus, elephantfish (Gnathonemus, Hippopotamyrus, Marcusenius, Mormyrus, Petrocephalus, and Pollimyrus), {{the climbing}} gourami Ctenopoma muriei and marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus).|$|E

25|$|Some {{cichlids}} readily hybridize with related species, both in {{the wild}} and under artificial conditions. Other groups of fishes, such as European <b>cyprinids,</b> also hybridize. Unusually, cichlid hybrids have been put to extensive commercial use, in particular for aquaculture and aquaria. The hybrid red strain of tilapia, for example, is often preferred in aquaculture for its rapid growth. Tilapia hybridization can produce all-male populations to control stock density or prevent reproduction in ponds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyprinids</b> are stomachless {{fish with}} toothless jaws. Even so, food can be {{effectively}} chewed by the gill rakers of the specialized last gill bow. These pharyngeal teeth allow {{the fish to}} make chewing motions against a chewing plate formed by a bony process of the skull. The pharyngeal teeth are unique to each species and are used by scientists to identify species. Strong pharyngeal teeth allow fish such as the common carp and ide to eat hard baits such as snails and bivalves.|$|E
25|$|Several <b>cyprinids</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} to waters outside their natural ranges to provide food, sport, or biological control for some pest species. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) {{are the most important}} of these, for example in Florida. In some cases, such as the Asian carp in the Mississippi Basin, they have become invasive species that compete with native fishes or disrupt the environment. Carp in particular can stir up sediment, reducing the clarity of the water and making it difficult for plants to grow.|$|E
