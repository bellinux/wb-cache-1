40|$|Given a time-stamped {{transaction}} database, time-profiled associations represent those subsets {{of items}} whose support time sequence satisfies a given specification. Considering the specification {{to be the}} similarity with the El Niño index sequence, the decreased fish-catch in Peru {{is an example of}} time-profiled associations. Classical association mining uses simple numeric interest measures (e. g., support) and a sim-ple subset specification such that support is greater than a certain threshold. In contrast, time-profiled association mining uses a <b>composite</b> <b>interest</b> measure, i. e., a sequence of supports over a sequence of time slots and can use a richer subset specification, such as time series correlation and Eu-clidean distance. Mining time-profiled associations is com-putationally challenging due to the large size of datasets, <b>composite</b> <b>interest</b> measures, and richer subset specification. In this paper, we propose a monotonic lower bounding of Lp norm based similarity measure, and propose two novel algo-rithms to mine time-profiled associations. We show that the proposed algorithms are correct and complete in finding time-profiled associations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the naive approach. 1...|$|E
40|$|This article takes a {{fresh look}} at reswitching. When two {{production}} techniques are compared, reswitching occurs when one technique is more viable than the other at a high interest rate, switches to being less viable at a lower rate, and reswitches to being more viable again at even lower rates. For some, reswitching undermines the foundations of neoclassical economics because it belies the idea of a monotonic relationship between relative capital values and factor price. The reswitching equation is an nth degree polynomial having n roots, implying the existence of n interest rates. Conventional analysis uses one interest rate but ignores the others. We argue that the others should not be ignored because all rates are determined simultaneously, and when one rate shifts, all rates shift. We demonstrate that the Samuelson reswitching model possesses a ‘dual’ expression containing every interest rate, the rates being compressed into a composite, interest-rate variable, thereby establishing a role for interest rates previously thought lacking in use and meaning. The relationship between this <b>composite</b> <b>interest</b> rate and capital value does not exhibit reswitching. The notion of a <b>composite</b> <b>interest</b> rate has implications for economics beyond reswitching...|$|E

As {{the volume of}} spatial and spatio-temporal data continues to increase significantly due to both the growth of database archives and the increasing number and resolution of spatio-temporal sensors, automated and semi-automated pattern analysis becomes more essential. Spatial and spatio-temporal (ST) data analyses have emerged in recent decades to develop understanding of the spatial and spatio-temporal characteristics and patterns. However, in the last decade, the growth in variety and volume of observational data, notably spatial and spatio-temporal data, has out-paced the capabilities of analytical tools and techniques. Major limitations of existing classical data mining models and techniques include the following. First, these do not adequately model richer temporal semantics of data observations (e. g. co-occurrence patterns of moving objects, emerging and vanishing patterns, multi-scale cascade patterns, periodic patterns). Second, these do {{not take into account}} time dimension of the data observations. Third, these do not provide sufficient interest measures and computationally efficient algorithms to discover spatial and spatio-temporal co-occurrence patterns. These limitations represent critical barriers in several application domains that require to analyze huge datasets. In this dissertation, I proposed addressed these limitations by i) providing a framework to model the rich semantics of the ST patterns of data observations by developing a taxonomy of spatial and ST co-occurrence patterns, ii) designing new techniques that are taking into account the time dimension of the data, and iii) developing new monotonic <b>composite</b> <b>interest</b> measures and scalable algorithms. The proposed approaches reduced the manual effort by reducing the plausible set of hypotheses. Major focus would be on developing scalable algorithms to mine spatial and ST co-occurrence patterns...|$|E
