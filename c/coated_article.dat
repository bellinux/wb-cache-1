40|$|Summary: Many Proteobacteria use the chaperone/usher {{pathway to}} {{assemble}} proteinaceous filaments on the bacterial surface. These filaments can curl into fimbrial or nonfimbrial surface structures (e. g., a capsule or spore <b>coat).</b> This <b>article</b> reviews the phylogeny of operons {{belonging to the}} chaperone/usher assembly class to explore the utility of establishing a scheme for subdividing them into clades of phylogenetically related gene clusters. Based on usher amino acid sequence comparisons, our analysis shows that the chaperone/usher assembly class is subdivided into six major phylogenetic clades, which we have termed α-, β-, γ-, κ-, π-, and σ-fimbriae. Members of each clade share related operon structures and encode fimbrial subunits with similar protein domains. The proposed classification system offers a simple and convenient method for assigning newly discovered chaperone/usher systems {{to one of the}} six major phylogenetic groups...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Processes of {{electrolytic}} {{application of}} metals {{are used in}} order to obtain pure coatings, single – or multilayer. Appropriate selection and proper execution contribute to the improvement of product quality, which affects its proper and long functioning. Production costs are not necessarily high. They depend mainly on the proper selection of the <b>coating.</b> The <b>article</b> presents the results of the use of generalized objective function for selection of galvanic coating on metal parts. There were used following criteria in order to characterize the quality (usability) : corrosion resistance, mechanical properties, physical properties, gloss, roughness, and economical criteria. Presented method of determining the objective function can be used to choose the optimal coatings for specific service conditions or customer requirements. Presented method of determining the objective function in the design process of the surface layer makes it possible {{to assess the impact of}} various factors on the quality of the product and thus gives a chance to make the right choice...|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{to water}} is a key issue in the {{performance}} of multilayer coatings. It may take place in different forms, i. e. as rainfall, dew and humidity variation. Consequently, coatings will experience time-dependent water activity fluctuations. In industrial practice, coatings are subjected to artificial water activity fluctuations in weathering tests. Little is known about the connection between these tests and the reality experience by a <b>coating.</b> This <b>article</b> presents a theoretical investigation of the response of multilayer coatings to water activity fluctuations. This investigation is performed {{on the basis of a}} validated model for water transport in hydrophilic base coat/hydrophobic top coat systems. The study aims to understand how permeability and sorption properties determine the overall coating response to fluctuations. It is concluded that present accelerated weathering tests do not mimic natural weathering due to the response time of the considered systems, which are insensitive to rapid fluctuations. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract: Advances of {{nanotechnology}} {{have led}} to the development of nanomaterials with both potential diagnostic and therapeutic ap-plications. Among them, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles have received particular attention. Over the past decade, various SPIOs with unique physicochemical and biological properties have been designed by modifying the particle structure, size and <b>coating.</b> This <b>article</b> reviews the recent advances in preparing SPIOs with novel properties, the way these physicochemical properties of SPIOs influence their interaction with cells, and the development of SPIOs in liver and lymph nodes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast. Cellular uptake of SPIO can be exploited in a variety of potential clinical applications, including stem cell and inflammation cell tracking and intra-cellular drug delivery to cancerous cells which offers higher intra-cellular concentration. When SPIOs are used as car-rier vehicle, additional advantages can be achieved including magnetic targeting and hyperthermia options, as well as monitoring with MRI. Other potential applications of SPIO include magnetofection and gene delivery, targeted retention of labeled stem cells, sentinel lymph nodes mapping, and magnetic force targeting and cell orientation for tissue engineering...|$|R
