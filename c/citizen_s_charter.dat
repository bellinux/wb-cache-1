40|$|Every citizen within {{both the}} EU (European Union) and the South African Development Community (SADC) region is {{entitled}} to have their fundamental social rights protected and promoted. Therefore, both the EU and SADC established social protection instruments, of which the EU <b>s</b> <b>Charter</b> of Fundamental Rights (EU <b>Charter)</b> and SADC <b>s</b> <b>Charter</b> of Fundamental Social Rights (SADC Charter) form a part. Questions {{of whether or not}} these charters are achieving their goals led to the main objective of this mini-dissertation, which was to compare the status of the EU Charter to the status of the SADC Charter within each respective regional architecture, identify similarities and differences in terms of content of both charters, and compare how the EU and SADC go about implementing and complying with their respective charter. A comparative analysis was conducted by comparing relevant, accessible information in order to synthesize findings which revealed that the status of the EU Charter is more prominent than that of the SADC Charter, although both have legal status. The EU Charter aids the achievement of the EU s goals, and ensures social rights are visible and safeguarded for EU citizens through effective implementation. The SADC Charter does not create social rights visibility, as it lacks enforcement mechanisms. The content of both charters consolidates previous scattered rights within their regions into one comprehensive document. The EU Charter seems to be more comprehensive than the SADC Charter. Yet, regardless of the comprehensiveness of the charters, they have a similar goal, which is to protect <b>citizen</b> <b>s</b> fundamental rights. The EU Charter seems to be more successful than the SADC Charter, which, in its current status, can be viewed as only a paper tiger.

40|$|For over a decade, North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charter</b> {{schools and}} {{traditional}} {{public schools have}} been embroiled in litigation over access to local public funding. This litigation {{shows no sign of}} abatement. In fact, disputes between charter schools and traditional public schools over local funds are likely to continue until the North Carolina legislature revisits the state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charter</b> school funding statute and modifies the means by which local funds are transferred to charter schools. This Article deconstructs the state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charter</b> school funding statute, the decade-long series of appellate decisions interpreting it, and the administrative and legislative responses to each appellate decision. It contends that the source of disputes over local funding is found, at least in part, in the statutory method by which these funds are distributed to charter schools through the accounts of local boards of education. This Article ultimately proposes a fundamental revision to North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charter</b> school funding statute to allow charter schools to receive their statutory allocation of local public funds directly from the source of those funds, eliminating local boards 2 ̆ 7 responsibility to serve as intermediaries in the transfer of those funds to charter schools. This change facilitates charter schools 2 ̆ 7 ability to enjoy the independence envisioned by their authorizing legislation and eliminates comingling of charter school and traditional public school funding in local boards 2 ̆ 7 accounts. With greater independence and without comingled funds, disputesbetween the two types of public schools are less likely to arise, and educational resources {{are more likely to be}} applied directly toward education rather than toward litigation...|$|R

40|$|American {{public schools}} have been {{entrusted}} with the responsibility of inculcating citizens with democratic values. However, schools have come under attack {{for a variety of}} reasons. School choice provides parents with opportunities to select from options, both within and outside the public system of schooling, which will provide their children with the type of education they desire. Among these school choice options are charter and magnet schools. This article begins with a discussion of the basic similarities between magnet and charter schools, followed by a discussion of a legal research study which examined the extent to which U. <b>S.</b> <b>charter</b> school statutes foster equality of student access to charter schools. The data for the study were derived from the U. <b>S.</b> <b>charter</b> school statutes for 36 states, and the investigative framework was provided by seven research questions addressing student recruitment, admission and enrollment, student transportation, and information dissemination. Three areas affecting both magnet and charter schools are identified for which key research findings are presented.

40|$|An ethnographic, {{descriptive}} {{research methodology}} {{was used to}} explore the service delivery of three U. <b>S.</b> <b>charter</b> schools (one independent and two dependent secondary public charter schools) in Southern New England, United States {{as they relate to}} grade nine mildly disabled special needs students. Field research was also conducted in Costa Rica and Japan focusing on special education. The United States charter schools are public schools that operate under a contract (or 2 ̆ 2 charter 2 ̆ 2). Parents of students with disabilities are now seeking the charter school as a viable choice to the public school. By comparison, the current policy in Liberia, Africa by the Ministry of Education is aimed at promoting the integration of children with disabilities into the regular schools at all levels (2 ̆ 2 mainstreaming 2 ̆ 2 in the U. S.). ^ This holistic study includes multiple data-collection methods. Data are collected via field research, observations, and in-depth interviews. Interview participants were purposively sampled from each school to include (n= 20) parents, (n= 8) teachers and (n= 6) administrators. Primary sources of the data were persons working at the schools in the U. S., Costa Rica, and Japan. Secondary sources include original documents such as student IEP 2 ̆ 7 S, testing reports, and student journals. Content and document analysis was also performed on personal documents, official documents, school memos and records, newspaper articles, and photographs. ^ Findings from this research suggest that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>charter</b> school movement has gone through many transformations since its inception in 1991. Nevertheless, previous concerns echoed by charter school pundits regarding how mildly disabled students in U. <b>S.</b> <b>charter</b> school are serviced, still remain a central concern. These emerging research findings also suggest a shortage of special educators in charter school working mildly disabled students, uncertified core content educators in specialized areas (Math and English), and in some cases administrators lack of compliance of IDEA (2004) mandates. Transferring these U. S. findings together with field research conducted in Japan and Costa Rica; produce two targets for a potential application of the 2 ̆ 2 charter 2 ̆ 2 school model to Liberia, Africa: (1) basic literacy of 2 ̆ 2 mainstreamed 2 ̆ 2 children, and (2) women 2 ̆ 7 s access to education. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{pressure}} to both reform public education and provide educational choices for families {{has led to the}} creation of charter schools. Charter schools are based on the premise of operational autonomy in exchange for accountability for agreed upon results. Their appeal is widespread, with over 2, 000 charter schools opening in the United States since 1990. The purpose of this qualitative, descriptive study is to describe the process of initiating a charter school. Eight key informants representing five Oregon charter schools were included in the study. These key informants were directly involved in the formation of their schools. I also interviewed a charter school specialist at the Oregon Department of Education to provide context. Potential limitations included the size of the interview pool and the experiences of the author at an Oregon charter school. I collected interview and document data from the key informants. The interview data were transcribed and analyzed using NUD*IST 4 data analysis software. Study findings revealed that the key informants were motivated by (a) the desire for freedom, (b) the desire to meet perceived community needs, and (c) a desire to exercise school choice. The key informants accessed opportunities, including (a) the opportunity to access Oregon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> newly created <b>charter</b> school law, (b) the opportunity to work with individuals with whom founders had previous professional experience, and (c) the opportunity to form new working relationships. The key informants also accessed (a) grants, (b) professional services, and (c) community resources as means to initiate their schools. Additionally, I found that the experiences of the participants in creating their charter schools had strong connections to Berger and Luckman 2 ̆ 7 s (1966) concepts of social construction. The results of the study indicated that (a) Oregon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charter</b> school founders had a strong desire for freedom, (b) charter schools were a safety valve for school districts to respond to opposition, (c) Oregon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>charter</b> school laws handicapped charter founders, and (d) the future of Oregon charter schools is uncertain...|$|R
