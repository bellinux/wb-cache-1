40|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} of the empirical spadework and time consuming when confirming the proportions of the colored fibers in the colored spun yarns,with the help of the video microscopy and image processing technology,a novel method based on a clustering algorithm is proposed to classify the color fibers and inspect the proportions of different color fibers. Firstly,the colored spun yarns are untwisted into the fibers,the colored fibers are arranged on the slide under the mild tension, and the corresponding images are captured by the video microscopy. Secondly,the gray projection method is adopted to localize the colored fibers,and the average value of R,G,B of all pixels in the center line of each <b>colored</b> <b>fiber</b> is extracted as a feature vector to characterize the <b>colored</b> <b>fiber</b> respectively. Finally, the feature vectors in RGB model are converted to the L* a* b* color model,a clustering algorithm by searching density peaks is applied into classifying the colored fibers and the proportions of each color fibers are calculated. Experiments results demonstrate that the proposed method can inspect the colors and proportions of colored fibers in the colored spun yarns with a satisfactory accuracy...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel {{class of}} copolyesters {{containing}} the metallophthalocyanine ring [M-Pc, M = Fe(III), Co(II) ] {{in the chain}} was synthesized by polycondensation of (dicarboxyphthalocyaninato) metal [M-Dapc, M = Fe(III), Co(II) ] diacid chloride, terephthalic acid chloride and aliphatic diols. The structures of the copolyesters were characterized by infrared, electronic as well as ESR spectra, and viscosity measurement. The thermal stabilities of the polymers were evaluated by dynamic thermogravimetric analyses. The polymers obtained thus were easily soluble in chloroform, dichloromethane, etc. The green or blue <b>colored</b> <b>fiber</b> was formed by melt spinning of the copolyesters containing below 1 mol % M-Pc component.

40|$|Abstract: The {{cotton seeds}} {{deterioration}} process with different chemical composition, in distinct environments {{is essential to}} the definition of adequate methods for storage. The deterioration involves cellular, metabolic and chemical changes and the behavior of the seeds' antioxidant defense system has an important role to control the speed and intensity of this process. The <b>colored</b> <b>fiber</b> of cottonseeds cv. BRS Verde and white fiber cv. BRS 187 - 8 H were stored under controlled environment conditions (10 °C, 25 °C and 30 °C) for one year. The seeds were assessed for physiological quality, presence of microorganisms, chemical composition, oil and tocopherol contents by 90 day intervals. The cottonseed physiological potential began to decrease on day 90 particularly when the storage is carried out at 25 to 30 °C. Changes in lipid content and tocopherol are associated with the reduction of physiological quality. At temperatures above 25 °C the deterioration of cottonseeds is improved and decreases their physiological quality. Reduction in fat content and tocopherol and an increase in acidity and peroxide indicate loss of quality during storage...|$|E

The results of the color {{discrimination and}} desirable color combinations were discussed in the relation to color {{differences between the two}} colors in the ply yarns. It was necessary for desirable melange color effect of the two colored ply yarns to select medium hue contrast combination.

40|$|Backgroud: As {{a result}} of {{changing}} consumer preferences, cotton (Gossypium Hirsutum L.) from varieties with naturally colored fibers is becoming increasingly sought after in the textile industry. The molecular mechanisms leading to <b>colored</b> <b>fiber</b> development are still largely unknown, although {{it is expected that}} the color is derived from flavanoids. Experimental Design: Firstly, four key genes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in cotton (GhC 4 H, GhCHS, GhF 39 H, and GhF 3959 H) were cloned and studied their expression profiles during the development of brown- and white cotton fibers by QRT-PCR. And then, the concentrations of four components of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, naringenin, quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin in brown- and white fibers were analyzed at different developmental stages by HPLC. Result: The predicted proteins of the four flavonoid structural genes corresponding to these genes exhibit strong sequence similarity to their counterparts in various plant species. Transcript levels for all four genes were considerably higher in developing brown fibers than in white fibers from a near isogenic line (NIL). The contents of four flavonoids (naringenin, quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin) were significantly higher in brown than in white fibers and corresponding to the biosynthetic gene expression levels.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of the different pre-treatments (ethanol, ethylene de amine tetra acetic acid [EDTA] and EDTA + ethanol) on the bond strength of adhesively lutted tooth <b>colored</b> <b>fiber</b> post. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight human anterior teeth (incisor and canine) were selected in this experimental study. The species were endodontically treated, and the post-space was prepared. The species were randomly divided into four groups of 12 teeth in each and were treated as follows: (i) 0. 1 M EDTA, (ii) 99. 6 % ethanol, (iii) 0. 1 M EDTA followed by 99. 6 % ethanol and (iv) without any treatment (control). A push-out test was carried out after 24 h. Each tooth was cut into three 1 mm-thick sections. Fracture type was assessed using stereomicroscope. The data were analyzed by one way-ANOVA followed by Scheffe post-hoc test at P = 0. 05. Results: Almost, in EDTA and (EDTA + ethanol) every sample failed at the interface between post and lutting cement. Predominant failure mode in ethanol and control group was mixed failure. The surface treatment methods did not have any significant effect (P > 0. 05) on any group but EDTA group had the highest bond strength. Conclusion: Surface treatment with (ethanol, EDTA, and EDTA + ethanol) does not significantly appear to be effective in improving the bond strength of fiber posts into root dentine.

Os bioensaios foram conduzidos com duas {{cultivar}}es de algodão, a BRS Cedro (fibras brancas) e BRS Verde (fibras verdes), com e sem aplicação de silício. O silício foi aplicado como solução de ácido silícico a 1 %, na dosagem equivalente a 3 t/ha de SiO 2. Avaliaram-se os seguintes parâmetros biológicos: mortalidade larval, duração da fase larval e pupal, viabilidade de pupa, peso das pupas, razão sexual, longevidade dos adultos, machos e fêmeas e o número de ovos/fêmea. Verificou-se que a aplicação de silício aumentou apenas a mortalidade de lagartas alimentadas com folhas da BRS Cedro, não demonstrando nenhum efeito nas lagartas quando aplicado na BRS Verde. Além disso, na cultivar BRS Cedro, em comparação com a cultivar BRS Verde, houve menor peso de pupa e menor produção de ovos/fêmea. Biology of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E.

The following biological parameters were evaluated: larval mortality, duration of the larval and pupal phase, pupal viability, pupal weight, gender ratio, adult longevity of males and females and the number of eggs/female. It was verified that the silicon application only increased the mortality of caterpillars fed with BRS Cedro leaves, not demonstrating any effect on the caterpillars when applied on BRS Verde.
