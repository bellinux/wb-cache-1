These techniques can be classified as: 1) decreasing the amount of <b>compilation</b> performed, and 2) overlapping <b>compilation</b> with execution. We first present and evaluate Lazy <b>Compilation,</b> an approach used in most dynamic <b>compilation</b> systems in which individual methods are compiled on-demand upon their first invocation. This is in contrast to Eager <b>Compilation,</b> in which all methods in a class are compiled when a new class is loaded. In this work, we describe our experience with eager <b>compilation,</b> as well as the implementation and transition to lazy <b>compilation.</b> We empirically detail the effectiveness of this decision. Our experimental results using the SpecJVM Java benchmarks and the Jalape~no JVM show that, compared to eager <b>compilation,</b> lazy <b>compilation</b> results in 57 % fewer methods being compiled and reductions in total time of 14 % to 26 %. Total time in this context is <b>compilation</b> plus execution time. Next, we present profile-driven, background <b>compilation,</b> a technique that augments lazy <b>compilation</b> by using idle cycles in multiprocessor systems to overlap <b>compilation</b> with application execution.

JIT <b>compilation</b> is a form of dynamic <b>compilation,</b> and allows adaptive optimization such as dynamic recompilation - thus in theory JIT <b>compilation</b> can yield faster execution than static <b>compilation.</b> Interpretation and JIT <b>compilation</b> are particularly suited for dynamic programming languages, as the runtime system can handle late-bound data types and enforce security guarantees.|$|R

40|$|A managed runtime environment, {{such as the}} Java virtual machine, is non-trivial to benchmark. Java {{performance}} is affected in various complex ways by the application and its input, {{as well as by}} the virtual machine (JIT optimizer, garbage collector, thread scheduler, etc.). In addition, nondeterminism due to timer-based sampling for JIT optimization, thread scheduling, and various system effects further complicate the Java performance benchmarking process. Replay <b>compilation</b> is a recently introduced Java performance analysis methodology that aims at controlling nondeterminism to improve experimental repeatability. The key idea of replay <b>compilation</b> is to control the <b>compilation</b> load during experimentation by inducing a pre-recorded <b>compilation</b> plan at replay time. Replay <b>compilation</b> also enables teasing apart performance effects of the application versus the virtual machine. This paper argues that in contrast to current practice which uses a single <b>compilation</b> plan at replay time, multiple <b>compilation</b> plans add statistical rigor to the replay <b>compilation</b> methodology. By doing so, replay <b>compilation</b> better accounts for the variability observed in <b>compilation</b> load across <b>compilation</b> plans. In addition, we propose matchedpair comparison for statistical data analysis. Matched-pair comparison considers the performance measurements per <b>compilation</b> plan before and after an innovation of interest as a pair, which enables limiting the number of <b>compilation</b> plans needed for accurate performance analysis compared to statistical analysis assuming unpaired measurements...|$|R
