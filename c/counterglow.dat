40|$|An {{example of}} {{photometric}} variability of a <b>counterglow</b> {{region in the}} antisolar direction is discussed. A speculative interpretation of its significance leads to {{the suggestion that the}} weakened radiance of the <b>counterglow</b> may in this case be due to a dust cloud of scattering material in the general region of the earth-moon system...|$|E
40|$|Photometric {{observations}} of {{the region of the}} <b>counterglow</b> (Gegenschein) made from OSO- 6 are examined. The observations were made during the September to October 1970 period when the <b>counterglow</b> was between the Milky Way arms at a relatively high (negative) galactic latitude. The lines of sight included a slice across the antisun region at an inclination of 48 degrees to the ecliptic. A comparison is made between the photometric gradients as measured from the spacecraft and similar gradients deduced from ground-based observations...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{research}} {{studies on the}} OSO- 6 zodiacal light experiment, conducted {{during the period from}} May 1976 to October 1977 are described. A discussion is included of the instrument performance and the empirical calibrations developed. Main areas of the research performed, i. e., (1) zodiacal light variation analysis; (2) integrated starlight and diffuse galactic light; and (3) earth/moon libration region <b>counterglow,</b> are covered. Considerable data processing was performed during these studies and it is summarized. Recommendations for future research to complete the interim results are given...|$|E
40|$|Results {{from the}} OSO- 6 Rutgers Zodiacal Light Analyzer {{experiment}} show photometric perturbations above the {{background in the}} antisun line of sight. Sixteen successive lunations were examined, and the accumulated perturbations show a maximum value {{in the direction of}} the L 4 and L 5 earth-moon libration points. This is interpreted as a <b>counterglow</b> from a cloud of particles at the libration points. The average brightness of these libration clouds is 20 S 10 Vis. The average angular size of the libration clouds is approximately 6 degrees. Their position varies from one lunation to the next, within an ellipsoidal zone centered on the libration-point direction, with its semimajor axis, of approximately 6 degrees, nominally in the ecliptic and its semiminor axis, of approximately 2 degrees perpendicular to the ecliptic. The position of these clouds with respect to the Lagrangian L 4 and L 5 points is towards the moon in the northern summer and away from the moon in the northern winter...|$|E
