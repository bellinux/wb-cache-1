40|$|Through {{separating}} coal pyrolysis and char combustion {{and letting}} the pyrolysis gas burn in its passing through the combusting char bed, the so-called decoupling combustion has been proven to be effective for lowering NOx emission of coal and biomass combustion. The original design of the decoupling combustion was based on coal pyrolysis incurring with the heat transferring from the char combustion zone, thus causing the difficulty of scale-up in matching the reactions of slow coal pyrolysis and quick char combustion. An idea of using partial gasification to replace such a pyrolysis was proposed to allow the combination of reburning part of the <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> over the combusting char layer and the decoupling combustion of the left <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> by letting it pass through the char bed. This article compared first the effectiveness of reducing NOx emission by a few different combustion methods including reburning of <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> and the decoupling combustion based on coal pyrolysis in a laboratory scale dual-stage reactor for five different kinds of coal. It was shown that both the decoupling combustion and reburning of <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> represented the most effective low-NOx combustion methods, which can reduce the NOx emission by 30 - 40 % {{in comparison with the}} traditional combustion without air-staging and reburning. The fuel ratio of fixed carbon to volatile matters of the coal also affected the effectiveness of NOx reduction, the lower the fuel ratio, the higher the NOx reduction effect was. The actual running test of a 1. 4 MW industrial boiler based on combining the decoupling combustion and reburning part of the partial <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> reduced the NOx emission by 33 % in comparison with the traditional industrial boiler. The result showed a successful scale-up of the technology and verified the idea of reducing NOx emission by combining the decoupling combustion and the reburning of coal <b>gasification</b> <b>gas.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Via {{isolating}} {{the fuel}} pyrolysis and char gasification, the so-called dual bed pyrolysis gasification (DBPG) was proposed {{to realize the}} co-production of pyrolysis products and <b>gasification</b> <b>gas.</b> The process simulation with Aspen Plus shows that the DBPG process can run autothermally using air as the gasification reagent, but the complete conversion of char in the gasifier requires relatively high O/C ratio due {{to the absence of}} steam in the reactor. This would make the higher heating value (HHV) of the produced <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> below 1000 kcal/Nm(3). Adding steam to the char gasifier can realize full char conversion at lower O/C ratio to improve the <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> quality. The effect of air preheating on the gasification performance was further analyzed to optimize the operating conditions of DBPG. A pilot scale plant (100 kg-coal/h) of DBPG was established and tested by using air as the gasification reagent plant to verify the technology feasibility. At the steady operating temperatures of 600 degrees C for pyrolyzer and 850 degrees C for gasifier, the produced pyrolysis gas was rich in hydrocarbons and the tar yield reached 8. 4 wt% and was rich in phenols and its derivatives, but the HHV of the <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> was only 510 kcal/Nm(3), much lower than the simulated value. A laboratory test on char-air gasification in a fluidized bed reactor further showed that the short residence time of char inside the gasifier and thus the low carbon conversion and the burning of the produced gas in the reactor was the cause for this lower heating value of the <b>gasification</b> <b>gas.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Sewage sludge can be {{disposed}} of by fermentation, incineration or gasification. Conversion of the resulting biogas, combustion heat or <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> into electricity is often employed. Since sewage sludge cannot be fermented completely and due to the significant heat requirements for drying it in the incineration plant or before the gasifier, the electrical output in all cases is very low. Consequently, this work seeks to investigate a combination of fermentation and gasification in which dried fermentation waste is converted in a gasifier. With the aim of combining these two biomass conversion processes with power generation in an efficient manner, a hybrid system consisting of a SOFC and a gas turbine is investigated. This combination of a biogas plant and a gasifier has the advantage that waste heat {{can be used as}} a heat source in drying the fermentation waste. Another advantage is the combined conversion of biogas and <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> in the SOFC.

At 900 degreesC and at a filtration velocity of 2. 5 cm/s, the developed catalyst formulation shows a benzene conversion of 93 % (50 ppm H 2 S), 78 % (100 ppm H 2 S) and 57 % (200 ppm H 2 S). However, benzene is not a problematic compound concerning the utilization of biomass gasification. More important is the removal capacity of this catalytic filter disc for the problematic heavy tars like naphthalene. Subsequent deactivation tests with naphthalene and with a mixture of benzene and naphthalene as tar model compounds showed that for simulated <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> containing up to 100 ppm H 2 S and for a filtration velocity of 2. 5 cm/s (typical value in real gas) the naphthalene conversion is 98 % in both cases. As a result, the target tar conversion (> 95 %) was achieved in typical hot gas filtration conditions. The significant improvement over a pure nickel based catalyst by adding the appropriate amount of CaO is encouraging towards the further improvement of the sulphur tolerance of this catalyst.

40|$|Synthesis gas (CO+H 2) can be {{produced}} via various pathways such as steam reforming, partial oxidation as well as autothermal reforming. Steam reforming is strongly endothermic and partial oxidation is weakly exothermic. By combing of the steam reforming and partial oxidation process can be operated at autothermal conditions (autothermal reforming). However, using the pure oxygen as oxidant is quite expensive and using the air would have the nitrogen content in the downstream processes. Oxygen permeable membrane enables the oxygen ions to be selectively transported through the membrane by blocking the nitrogen and other gases outside. In the literature part of the study, the mechanism and applications of the perovskite membranes {{as well as the}} preparation methods were introduced. There were 12 membranes (A-H) tested in this thesis for toluene decomposition on the perovskite membrane under different temperatures, air flow rates, toluene amounts, bottom flow rate of toluene and nitrogen. Furthermore, the effect of the steam and <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> at atmospheric pressure were investigated. The results showed that the oxygen flux increased with the increased temperature and air flow rate. Higher bottom flow rate (2 l/min) of toluene and nitrogen results in lower oxygen flux value and the toluene amount has less effects on the oxygen permeability. Moreover, the oxygen flux reached to 3. 03 ml/min*cm 2 at 900 oC, air flow rate of 0. 45 l/min and total bottom flow of 0. 5 l/min by adding the <b>gasification</b> <b>gas,</b> of which oxygen flux value of 1. 8 ml/min*cm 2 for a normal run under the same condition.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{utilization}} of some novel metal oxide bed materials in dual-fluidized bed gasification systems has been investigated. For this purpose, metal oxide based bed materials can be 1) directly utilized in the dual fluidized bed gasifier (DFB) or in the Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) process {{in order to achieve}} higher gasification rates, or 2) employed in downstream hot gas conditioning processes, e. g. Chemical Looping Reforming (CLR), in order to reform hydrocarbons in the raw <b>gasification</b> <b>gas.</b> When utilizing such bed materials directly in the primary loop of a DFB gasifier or a CLC fuel reactor, it was shown in this work that the char gasification rate can be increased by different mechanisms. First, the gasification rate can be increased by reducing hydrogen inhibition of the steam gasification reaction. This decrease is caused by the rapid reaction of the metal oxide bed materials with hydrogen produced by the steam gasification. Thus, hydrogen is effectively removed from the vicinity of the gasifying char particle. Second, the gasification rate can be enhanced by the introduction of a potent catalyst for the gasification reaction via the bed material, which is then transferred onto the gasifying char and catalyzes the steam-carbon gasification reaction. This sequence of events has been demonstrated with a Manganese ore that contained Potassium as an effective catalyst for char gasification. Low-temperature gasification processes such as the DFB process commonly produce a raw <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> that is heterogeneous in its composition and that contains, among other contaminants, significant quantities of condensable and non-condensable hydrocarbons. Active metal oxide bed materials can therefore be employed in a hot gas conditioning process such as the CLR process for the purpose of conditioning the raw <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> by reforming tars and lighter hydrocarbons. In this work, a large number of transition metal oxides were screened as potential bed materials. Based on the screening results, two promising groups of bed materials for this application were developed. The first group, Cu-impregnated alumina materials, exhibited high degrees of ethylene conversion, but did not reform monoaromatic compounds. The second group, Fe,Sr-doped lanthanum zirconates, achieved high degrees of ethylene and benzene reforming while retaining methane in the gas. The benzene and ethylene conversion could be further improved by co-feeding O 2 with the <b>gasification</b> <b>gas.</b> A benzene conversion of up to 80 % and an ethylene conversion of about 95 % could be achieved at a temperature of 850 °C and at a rather high Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) of 6800 h- 1.

The energetic performances, efficiency and net power of the IGCC* and IGCCM plants were, thus, compared, assuming as standard a traditional IGCC plant without carbon dioxide capture. The economical aspects of the three plants were compared through an economical analysis. Since the IGCC* and IGCCM plants have additional costs related to the capture and disposal of the carbon dioxide, a Carbon Tax (adopted in some countries like Sweden) proportional to the number of kilograms of carbon dioxide released in the environment was assumed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the amounts of various pyrolysis products (gases, water, tar and charcoal) from three biomasses (wood, coconut shell and straw) and to suggest a kinetic equation for the thermal cracking of tar at temperatures varying from 400 to 900 Â°C. From the results, a comparative analysis is done for the biomasses, and a kinetic model of thermal cracking of tar is proposed for a residence time ranging from zero to 4 s. This can be applied to the purification of <b>gasification</b> <b>gases</b> used as a feed gas to a combustion engine, and so contributes to the design of gasifiers. ...|$|R
40|$|ZrO 2 {{catalysts}} can be efficiently {{applied to}} convert tars into less harmful compounds in biomass <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> clean-up, {{also in the}} presence of H 2 S. In fact, H 2 S has even been observed to enhance naphthalene (a model compound for tar) oxidation activity on ZrO 2. Sulfur binding and its effect on the reactivity of surface oxygen species, including OH groups as well surface lattice oxygen, on ZrO 2 was studied using temperature-programmed methods. At 30 °C approx. half of the adsorbed H 2 S was physisorbed and the other part dissociated titrating terminal OH groups. This dissociated H 2 S was strongly adsorbed. Moreover, it was found that after treatment with H 2 S until 400 °C half of the adsorbed species were irreversibly adsorbed. H 2 S adsorbed inducing desorption of water at two distinct temperatures (∼ 170 and 280 °C) during temperature ramp. Thus, H 2 S adsorption at elevated temperatures produced surface sulfur by replacement of surface lattice oxygen at two types of minority sites (max. 5 % of a monolayer). Therefore we suggest that multicoordinated OH groups and surface lattice oxygen at defective sites are involved. CO-TPR revealed increased reactivity of surface lattice oxygen on ZrO 2 with increasing amount of sulfur on the surface. In addition, strong adsorption of carbonates was suppressed by the presence of sulfur. The observed H 2 S-induced enhancement of naphthalene oxidation in <b>gasification</b> <b>gas</b> clean-up is suggested to be caused by the increased reactivity of surface oxygen species in the vicinity of sulfur species on the surface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the spent fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) catalyst is regenerated via coke gasification instead of combustion in a micro fluidized bed reactor to investigate its reaction characteristics and kinetic parameters. The reaction rate first increased with carbon conversion ratio and then slowly decreased when reaching the peak. H 2 and CO {{was found to be}} over 70 vol. % in the <b>gasification</b> <b>gas.</b> Two reaction models, homogenous model (HM) and shrinking core model (SCM) were used to calculate the kinetic parameters of catalyst regeneration, finding that HM had better fitting relevance for the data than SCM. The activation energy from these two models was close to each other, that is, about 150 kJ. mol- 1 for the coke gasification over FCC catalyst...|$|R
40|$|Gasification {{technologies}} {{are among the}} most promising electrical power generation options both from an environmental and efficiency point of view, as they allow efficient, environmentally-friendly use of national coal, as well as other carbonaceous materials mixed with coal, including high sulphur by-products. During gasification, sulphur is converted mainly into H 2 S and secondly into COS, and control of these has been researched using several H 2 S adsorbents. The aim of this paper was advanced removal of these compounds. Dolomite, which reacts with H 2 S to yield calcium sulphide, was chosen from among several earth-alkaline compounds for research due to its properties and low cost in reducing the presence of H 2 S in coal gasification. Tests were carried out using dolomite from Granada, Spain, with this sorbent used without blending and with amounts of 100 g and 150 g in each test. The dolomite was sulphurized using a mixture of gases that simulates the <b>gasification</b> <b>gas.</b> The influence of sulphurisation conditions such as gas velocity, bed length, grain size, gas temperature, and gas composition were investigated. The solid products obtained were characterised by X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis. The behaviour of COS that normally accompanies H 2 S in <b>gasification</b> <b>gases</b> was investigated and found to follow a breakthrough curve similar to H 2 S, with equilibrium existing between the COS destroyed due to reaction with hydrogen and by hydrolysis and the COS formed by reaction of CO 2 with H 2 S. Hence, its content in outlet gases {{is a function of the}} composition of this gas, especially in terms of CO 2, H 2 S and H 2 O. The accelerating effect of sulphurised dolomite on the rate of the reverse water-shift reaction was demonstrated...|$|R

In order to achieve high hydrogen yield and <b>complete</b> <b>gasification,</b> the operating parameters were investigated and the solid residual was analyzed to study the reaction bottleneck by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results showed that most organic functional groups in corn cob were consumed by super-critical water above 500 °C, however, the aromatic substance and cyclic ketone were remained.
