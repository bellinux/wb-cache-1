40|$|I {{suggest that}} the {{representation}} of cities in Indian cinema – the effects and affects of modernities {{as well as of}} ambiguous, multiplicitous sexualities – mark significant change in engagement with modernity ever since independence in 1947. The city in the Indian imaginary has occupied an ambivalent, confrontational as well as contemplative space that signifies ‘modernity ’ and its <b>concurrent</b> <b>promise</b> as well as ills. Non-normative sexualities have always occupied a liminal space in socio-political configurations, a site both of empowerment through transgression and containment through regulation. The urban space – newly freed up and as yet un-proscribed – assumes the metonymic equivalence of available sexual freedom (particularly for women), its powers and its dangers. The cinema as a text is especially well-suited to play with the dynamics of this fraught space: often, a film’s contexts and narratives identify the film text itself as a signifier of the liminal spaces that it proposes to explore, enacting both their limitations and their possibilities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use of feature-based {{design and}} <b>Concurrent</b> Engineering <b>promises</b> {{substantial}} benefits but their successful implementation is {{hampered by the}} lack of a suitable formalism, particularly where, as is often the case, participants are geographically separated. This overall research area can be termed feature-based distributed Concurrent Engineering (FBDCE). The work presented in this paper is focused on how to represent FBDCE in a situation where the participants may be geographically separated, and how to implement it in a formal and systematic way. A representation formalism is proposed for that purpose. This paper first overviews the FBDCE process and identifies the knowledge gaps in existing FBDCE support. A formalism for remote FBDCE is then presented. This formalism uses an object-oriented approach, called Design with Objects (DwO), where features are represented as lower level objects. An Internet network-based implementation of this formalism is described that uses the Internet to support FBDCE. An example is used to illustrate the implementation. The use of DwO for FBDCE offer...|$|R
40|$|Promises are {{synchronization}} constructs that {{hide the}} complexity of process synchronisation from the developer by providing a placeholder for {{the result of a}} potentially incomplete computation performed in a <b>concurrent</b> process. <b>Promises</b> evaluated by remote processes pose challenges for debugging when the remote computation raises an exception. Current debuggers are either unaware {{that there is a problem}} in the remote computation or give developers access only to the context of the remote process. This does not allow developers to interact at the same time with the process that launched the promise and the remote process that executed the promise's computation. To improve debugging of remote promises, in this paper we propose a debugger interface that presents a unified view of both the original and the remote process, by merging the call chains of the two processes at the point where the promise was created. We exemplify our approach, discuss challenges for making it practical, and illustrate through an initial prototype that it can improve debugging of exceptions in remote promises...|$|R
40|$|Background: The optimal {{treatment}} for limited-disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC) in patients aged 75 {{years or older}} remains unknown. Methods: Elderly patients with LD-SCLC who were treated with chemoradiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate their demographic characteristics and the treatment delivery, drug toxicities and antitumor efficacy. Results: Of the 94 LD-SCLC patients treated with chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy at the National Cancer Center Hospital between 1998 and 2003, seven (7. 4 %) were 75 {{years of age or}} older. All of the seven patients were in good general condition, with a performance status of 0 or 1. Five and two patients were treated with early and late concurrent chemora-diotherapy, respectively. While the four cycles of chemotherapy could be completed in only four patients, the full dose of radiotherapy was completed in all of the patients. Grade 4 neu-tropenia and thrombocytopenia were noted in seven and three patients, respectively. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support was used in five patients, red blood cell transfu-sion was administered in two patients and platelet transfusion was administered in one patient. Grade 3 or more severe esophagitis, pneumonitis and neutropenic fever developed in one, two and three patients, respectively, and one patient died of radiation pneumonitis. Complete response was achieved in six patients and partial response in one patient. The median survival time was 24. 7 months, with three disease-free survivors for more than 5 years. Conclusion: <b>Concurrent</b> chemoradiotherapy <b>promises</b> to provide long-term benefit with acceptable toxicity for selected patients of LD-SCLC aged 75 years or older. Key words: elderly – small cell lung cancer – chemotherapy – radiotherap...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Two novel, abiotic {{challenges}} that affect primary productivity, and the biodiversity dependent upon it, are urbanization and climate change. Increased levels of urbanization cause an inversely proportional decrease in primary productivity, while climate change <b>promises</b> <b>concurrent</b> changes in temperature and precipitation. Although {{the effects of}} climate change are difficult to predict, the effects of El Niño years in the Pacific Northwest are similar to the changes currently predicted with climate change and may provide an insights into the long-term changes. To this end, I utilized a 250 m resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index product from the MODIS satellite as an estimate of primary productivity and the Oceanic Niño Index as a way to estimate the strength of the El Niño -Southern Oscillation. Both variables were correlated with ten years of bird richness and relative abundance data to understand how the influence of primary productivity and weather changes with the stage of urbanization. Primary productivity was found to exert a strong influence on bird populations in landscapes undergoing active development, and much less in areas of established housing development or forested reserves. Relative to primary productivity, weather was much less influential on bird populations at actively changing sites, and more influential than productivity in forest reserves. Birds in established developments are the least influenced by weather, perhaps because anthropogenic subsidies are provided and harsh weather is buffered. This indicates that once the landscaping becomes mature, housing developments are not strongly influenced by primary productivity or weather; thus, developers should be encouraged to minimize the loss of vegetation during development and home owners should attempt to quickly achieve mature landscaping that preferably provides food and shelter for wildlife...|$|R
