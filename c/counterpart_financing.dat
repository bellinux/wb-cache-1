This new option pricing theory, as opposed to its standard conventional <b>counterpart</b> in <b>finance,</b> incorporates both the uncertainty about the future net benefits of a land conversion decision and the irreversibility of this action taken. We demonstrate that parsimonious empirical hedonic models of the errors-in-variables type, when corrected for heteroskedasticity, can provide adequate representations of farmland option premiums. Data for a random sample of cash rented Ohio farmland parcels are used, and the impacts of urban development on farmland option premiums are estimated. Results provide evidence that (a) both land-use conversion probability and urban influences have been important factors affecting the option value of the state's farmland, and (b) these option premiums associated with irreversible and uncertain land development are capitalized into farmland values.

5000|$|In {{a social}} context, {{treating}} came {{about with the}} birth of leisure time in the late nineteenth century. Young working class women took pride in going out and enjoying the city’s “cheap amusements”. [...] Some notable cheap amusements included public dances, amusement parks, and nickelodeon movie theatres. Although young working class women liked to go out, this often proved difficult, as their wages were very low. Young women dealt with this issue in numerous ways. Some refrained from going out or limited going out to special occasions, while others depended on their male <b>counterparts</b> to <b>finance</b> their pleasures. The latter solution is referred to as “treating”. Historian Kathy Peiss has popularized this term in many of her scholarly works such as Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York (1986) and “Charity Girls and City Pleasures” (2004). The act of treating was an exchange {{between a man and a}} woman. A man would agree to pay for a woman’s outing in exchange for her company. Treating ranged from the more innocent to the more scandalous. Treating was seen as harmless when it was conducted between a “steady” couple and more risqué when it was performed on a casual basis. [...] The women who engaged with this more risqué form of treating often reciprocated by performing sexual favors. These favors could be dancing, hugging, and kissing to intercourse. The women who engaged with the more intense sexual acts were referred to as “charity girls”. These women did not see themselves as prostitutes but often walked a fine line between being treated and being paid for their sexual services.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe five Universal Exhibitions held in Paris between 1855 and 1900 {{share the}} particularity of having been, unlike their British <b>counterparts,</b> <b>financed</b> first wholly, then in part, by the Government. Public {{financing}} led to public finance principles (budgetary and public accounting) being {{applied to the}} organisation of the Exhibitions. Along with these, the organisation in charge of running these events imported a set of well-formatted techniques. However, these techniques (budgeting and accounting technique) {{were part of a}} highly specific type of organisation that bore all the hallmarks of a project:  an Exhibition is characterised by strong notions of vision, intentionality and voluntarist action: it seeks to achieve objectives (of presentation/democratisation and dissemination) which require a certain number of specific activities to be set up, the results of which, subject to uncertainty or exogenous variables, must be measured both as preparations advance, and then again retrospectively, after the event.  an Exhibition is an event limited in time and space (it opens on a given date and for a length of time decided by the law (or decree) and its organisation is traditionally divided into four well-defined phases: preparation, realisation, exploitation and liquidation. The principles of public finance must therefore be adapted to a specific organisational environment and in particular, to the managerial constraints of the event. The system of accounting information is very much part of a process of organisational perception, governance and strategic mobilisation. The Universal Exhibitions provide an original field of investigation for examining the roles attributed to accounting {{within the framework of the}} organisation of such events. The originality here derives as much from the context (a project to be managed over a period of time and where no tool or project management model existed (Michaïlesco, 2007)) as from the public nature of the accounting technique used. Indeed, since knowledge of public accounting practice is incomplete, the study of organisation by the state would seem extremely interesting for the history of public finance (Thuillier, 1999). From this point of view, the Universal Exhibitions organised in Paris during the second half of the 19 th century were organised under two different political regimes and within two distinct public finance frameworks. Changes in the regulations governing public finances had an impact on the powers bestowed on the organisations in charge putting on the Exhibitions. The accounting systems which were set up therefore had to be adapted to fit within the time limit. Moreover, public accounting was designed with the aim of controlling the collection of taxes and their use (Lemarchand, 1999), which is different from running an Exhibition, in particular if the event is seen in terms of project management. This change of objective modified the use of accounting systems and led to the emergence of specific roles that had to evolve as a result of both the accumulation of knowledge and the political context. The aim of this article is therefore to analyse the role of public accounting within the framework of the five Universal Exhibitions organised in Paris during the second half of the 19 th century. The analysis was carried out using Burchell & al. 's classification system (1980). The latter distinguishes between four types of role assumed by accounting systems with reference to the characteristics of decision-making within an organisation. Indeed, decision-making is affected by adhesion to an objective and the uncertainty surrounding the consequences of the action taken. Depending on the degree of adhesion and uncertainty, decision-taking is described as ‘decision by computation', ‘decision by judgement', ‘decision by compromise', or ‘decision by inspiration'. The roles of accounting ascribed to these are as follows: ‘answer machines', ‘learning machines', ‘ammunition machines' and ‘rationalization machines'. Two groups of Universal Exhibitions have been identified: those held under the Second Empire (the 1855 and 1867 Exhibitions) and those held under the 3 rd Republic (the 1878, 1889 and 1900 Exhibitions). This division into two main periods allows us to take two important factors into account: on the one hand, the change of political regime that influenced the rules of public finance and on the other, the constitution of fairly general principles for the running of these events. The comparative study of these two groups of Exhibitions reveals that two distinct roles can be allotted to the accounting systems: a learning role during the Exhibitions of the first period, then a rationalization role in the case of the Exhibitions held during the second period. Under the Second Empire, the Universal Exhibitions financed exclusively by the Government were supported by strong political, economic and social aims. The importance given to holding such an event dispensed these projects from control by Parliament, whose influence had already been weakened considerably under Napoleon III. Although the decision to organise an Exhibition was unanimous, lack of knowledge on how to run such a project meant there was great uncertainty as to the consequences of decisions since the concept was new. Experience of running such a wide-ranging project therefore had to be acquired. An accounting system based on the rules and principles of public accounting and adapted to the events in question therefore met these needs. Within the framework of the Universal Exhibitions organised under the Second Empire, accounting may therefore be analysed as a learning instrument and aid to decision-making (learning machine). The arrival of the 3 rd Republic and with it the return of strict parliamentary control, saw great controversy emerge as to the economic usefulness of Universal Exhibitions and the financial implication of the Government in their organisation. The difficulty in obtaining a consensus on how they should be run led to a process of retrospective justification in which accounting acquired considerable importance. Despite the financial disengagement of the Government, the principles of public finance were still applicable but had evolved as a result of changes in the political and economic environment. Experience acquired in the organisation of the preceding Exhibitions reduced the uncertainty inherent in evaluating the consequences of decisions taken. However, the need then arose to rationalize the existence of these events and the use of the private finances obtained. Budgetary procedures were strengthened and there was an overproduction of information in the shape of financial reporting and statistics. In this context, the accounting system, which had been adapted many times after the first Exhibitions as a result of changes in the environment, was then used to rationalize the action taken (rationalization machine). The documents used to carry out this study are of two different kinds. On the one hand, there are the various documents generated by the organization of the Exhibitions (correspondence, plans of the exhibition palaces, photographs, administrative and accounting documents etc.) that were presented to the national archives by the Ministry for Commerce between 1877 and 1910 (de Maurepas, 1998). In addition to these documents there are the official reports written by the general commissioners of the successive Exhibitions assessing the organisation of the events and the results (these reports are available in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France and the Bibliothèque des Arts Décoratifs) ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This thesis aims to be {{the first}} paper to study {{comprehensively}} the full implications of financial distress and its indirect costs. Specifically, I investigate whether financially distressed companies operationally underperform their more conservatively <b>financed</b> <b>counterparts</b> and whether the distressed companies engage in inefficient asset sales. This is the first paper to study the effects of financial distress as the earlier literature concentrates purely on the effects of leverage. I combine the leading financial distress indicators to create my own distress score. Unlike past papers I control for differing business strategies when analyzing the operational performance of distressed companies. DATA This study targets all common shares that are traded in NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ during the period between 1994 and 2009. This is the first thesis to include the current financial crisis to the literature of financial distress. The market data is obtained from Datastream and the accounting data from Compustat, Datastream and Thomson databases. The sample consists of 9 405 unique stocks. RESULTS My thesis documents significant indirect costs of financial distress by showing that financial distress leads to poor operational performance, abnormally low stock returns and lower transaction multiples in M&A. Financial distress is shown to be even more detrimental to operational performance during economic downturns when the distressed companies suffer additional market share and profitability losses. It’s observed that the distressed firms first significantly outperform their peers in the stock market two years before the distress measurement date but start to give back these gains a year before the actual distress. The underperformance then also continues one year after the measurement point for distress. When looking at distressed firms as acquisition targets, the thesis finds that they generally sell at lower valuations compared to financially healthy peers. It’s shown that the sale is driven by the tight liquidity situation of the target firm or its parent. The low purchase price is recognized by the stock market as the share prices of the acquirers significantly outperform the general market post acquisition. On the other hand, financially distressed firms also acquire companies at lower prices than their peers...|$|R
40|$|Small {{businesses}} and venture capital are a natural pair. While many {{small businesses are}} born of technical expertise and innovation, few are well financed. One {{of the reasons for}} this lack of financing is that small concerns are often viewed as risky investments. Small businesses are rarely led by experienced business people and, as many statistics demonstrate, are more likely than not to fail. Unlike their under <b>financed</b> <b>counterparts,</b> venture capital companies (“VCCs”) are well financed and what they lack in technical capability, they make up for in business acumen and financial wherewithal. Moreover, risky investments with large upsides are exactly the type of opportunities that can produce significant returns for venture capital fundsIn the commercial marketplace, many small businesses receive venture capital infusions to transform their ideas and research into viable products. This same principle should apply to federal procurement, where Government procurement policies favor small business contracting, but early stage research and development funding is difficult to come by. VCC investment would be utilized to fill the gap between Government policy and economic reality. This type of investment would increase the pool of potential small businesses for federal procurement and help to diversify the government’s contractor portfolio. Overall, this would {{have a positive impact on}} competition, a fundamental tenet of government procurement. There are also technological benefits: with the assistance of venture capital investments, small companies would have the freedom to develop cutting-edge technologies that larger, more established corporations are either unwilling or unable to develop. The mutually beneficial relationship between small business contractors and VCCs has been frustrated due to a complicated web of government regulations that, while well intended, have the effect of holding back promising small businesses in the federal marketplace. In this harsh economic climate, venture capital is crucial to small, innovative businesses. Although VCCs have felt the impact of the recession, they remain well equipped to aid small concerns and their assistance is imperative. As a result, now is the time to advance a compromise position that protects small business programs while encouraging venture capital investment in federal contractors...|$|R

This paper reviews and evaluates the process of budget system reform during the transition period extending from the time they emerged from the collapse of the SFRY in 1989 until the end of 2002. For at least a decade of this period, the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF has been providing technical assistance (TA) to these countries to facilitate such reforms. Based on the material generated by this effort, the authors offer a review of the progress made and an assessment of the reform elements still to be completed. Given that the former Yugoslav republics all commenced the reform process with the same institutions, this paper offers a unique opportunity to analyze the critical elements in successful budget system reform.

Factors such as transaction costs, agency problem, and asymmetric information have created such a hierarchy. Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) argue that asymmetric information between firms and potential suppliers of external finance creates adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the credit market in developed market economies. This problem of a higher cost of external finance is commonly thought to be more serious for small firms {{because they are more}} disadvantaged than their larger counterparts in accessing external finance due to several factors: (1) Public information on small firms is generally not available and leads to the even greater problem of asymmetric information, i. e., more severe adverse selection and moral hazard problems. These information problems have excluded small firms from bond and share markets. (2) Due to the lack of available means of external finance, small firms rely more heavily on bank loans than their larger counterparts. In addition, as small firms are more interested in cultivating stable relationships with a few banks in order to secure a stable supply of credit, these banks become virtual monopolies by lending to small businesses and exercise their market power in lending to small firms. Most of existing research considers only small firms in market economies; little research has been done to understand the relationship between firm size and investment financing in any economy in transition. This paper makes a contribution to the literature by studying the relationship between firm size and liquidity constraints by using a firm level data of manufacturing enterprises in Shanghai during the period of 1989 – 1992. We consider whether small manufacturing firms in Shanghai are constrained by the availability of liquidity compared with their larger counterparts when they are financing their fixed investment. In a transforming economy such as China (or other similar transition economies), external finance relies heavily on loans from banks that are fully owned by the state. Due to historical reasons, allocations of credit are always biased in favor of state-owned enterprises. Such a `lending bias 2 ̆ 7 imposes an extra cost on small Chinese enterprises in financing investment as the majority of them are not state-owned. In such an environment, our empirical results show that small manufacturing firms in Shanghai are actually less liquidity-constrained than their larger <b>counterparts</b> in <b>financing</b> their fixed investment. This surprising result is rather different from what people normally predict based on the experience in market economies. We suggest three possible explanations for this peculiar finding: (1) The composition of various firm size classes {{plays an important role in}} explaining the result: Non-state enterprises which are fast growing and efficient dominate the small firm classes. Their successes in the markets helps them to generate enough internal funds to smooth their investment over time. (2) The presence of heavy indebtedness of large state-owned enterprises may deprive them of sufficient cash available for investment decision. Given that state-owned enterprises have been making heavy losses, the central and regional governments have a liquidity problem in satisfying their huge liquidity demands. (3) Small enterprises in non-state sectors can rely on the informal credit market to obtain funds for investment although they are excluded from the state banking system. However, the further trade liberalization in terms of eliminating tariffs and quotas caused by China 2 ̆ 7 s bid of joining the WTO will erode the profits of these small enterprises as imported goods will be supplied at lower prices. In addition, further reforms in financial sectors may also affect the supply of external finance to small enterprises in nonstate sectors. The consequence may lead to a tight liquidity constraint for small enterprises in China...|$|R
40|$|Business sense {{needed from}} growers and {{government}} Cue: If farming {{is to be}} a profitable business, and not just a subsistence activity, there are two issues that farmers will need to think about very carefully: how to maximise their yields, and how to get the best price possible for their crop. With a cash crop such as cotton, there may be some help available for them to do both things. In Zambia, for example, {{there are a number of}} cotton promoting companies that depend on farmers to supply high quality cotton for their textile plants. Dunavant, Clark Cotton and Mulungushi are three such companies operating in the country, that are helping farmers both to grow and sell cotton. Despite this, however, the Zambian textile industry is struggling, not least because of a tax system which favours imported cotton, and makes Zambian cotton too expensive for the local industry to buy. Joseph Nkole is the Executive Secretary of the Cotton Producers Association of Zambia. He believes strongly that the government should be supporting its domestic cotton producers through a better tax system. He also believes that Zambia should be exploiting the Africa Growth Opportunity Act, known as AGOA, in order to export more cotton products to the United States. Under AGOA, a range of commodities, including finished clothes, can be exported without duty to the American market. Mr Nkole spoke recently, to Chris Kakunta, about how he believes the Zambian cotton industry can be resuscitated, or brought back to life. Chris began by asking how the cotton promoting companies were helping farmers in Zambia to increase their cotton production. IN:		?These organise the small-scale ? OUT:		? getting Bt into this country. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Joseph Nkole of the Cotton Producers Association of Zambia was talking to Chris Kakunta. Transcript Nkole	These organise the small-scale farmers into schemes that are provided with inputs for production. They go into providing extension services to the farmers and then they provide the market for the farmers. But what we are seeing as a base is to have now these farmers to be trained in the various skills. To have best practices where they are dealing with a particular promoter, not leapfrogging from one promoter to another and avoiding to pay back loans. We want the farmers to have good ethics, appreciate the sanctity of contracts, so that they can now start to do business on a business footing, so that they can grow into bigger entities and run business on their own. Kakunta	How best can a small-scale farmer look after his or her cotton crop so that it gives maximum yield? Nkole	Well principally the farmer must plant his cotton early, on time. He must weed his crop, he must control the pests and he must have the correct plant population. For me these are the four non-negotiables in cotton production and if a farmer handles those with optimum efficiency they are bound to get very good yields from a hectare of cotton. Kakunta	Why do you think the yields are still low per hectare? Nkole	I think some farmers want to grow cotton as a by the way crop after they have planted maize or they have grown other crops. Now we are trying to get the farmers to appreciate that cotton is a main crop that they must engage in, plant on time, manage properly and they will see the good yields coming through. It has been done in many places and we are just hoping that we can now spread this to all the parts of the country where cotton is being grown. Kakunta	Zambia is part of the global village and obviously we have seen some cotton being imported into the country. Does that imported cotton affect the price of the local production and what are you doing to help the farmers have the better price? Nkole	There are two issues here. One is the issue of second-hand clothing. Two is the issue of tax on raw cotton. Imported cotton is costing less to the textile industry than Zambian cotton because of the tax regime. And we have identified this with the ginners, and the Zambia National Farmers Union and we are trying to talk to the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry and their <b>counterparts</b> in <b>finance</b> to see how best we can give the Zambian cotton a price good enough for export so that it competes with cottons coming from outside. Yes cotton from outside is cheaper and the only reason is truly due to the tax regime. If government decides to tackle the issue of internal taxation again the service-providing companies will pass the benefit to the farmers by increasing the price. On the other hand, we would also work as an association to lobby the promoting companies, to pay the farmers a price that is good enough. But for Zambia, really for the price to improve we must get our textile industry to process the cotton produced in this country into finished products. Then you can start to benefit even from AGOA and the price to the farmer will obviously be increased. And so we are saying let us get quickly to look at what is Mulungushi doing? What is Mukuba doing? What is Mulungushi-China doing? Let us get them to have to produce garments; then we can break into the AGOA. There is a lot of benefit in there. Our counterparts and colleagues in West Africa are benefiting from it and I think it is a question of time. Very soon we will have these meetings to discuss how the government can come in to help us resuscitate the textile industry and then see our lint being processed internally. Kakunta	What about coming to Bt cotton? Do you think if a law was passed in Zambia to allow such cotton to be grown, as an association you would embrace it? And if you are going to embrace it, why? Nkole	We would definitely want to work within the ambits of the law. What we are seeing is the benefit to the small cotton farmer, like the other colleagues in the region are getting. So if we were to say ?Yes?, we would say it would be a welcome idea because we stand to benefit as a nation by increased volumes. We are, in the meantime, collecting a lot of data and evidence to show that this has got advantage for us. And as I said, we will not fight the law. If the law of the land determines that we have no Bt cotton, we shall go by that. But as an association we would want to have further investigation and compare the advantages and disadvantages. And at the moment we are currently thinking that it would be worth our while to increase productivity, to increase profitability and enhance the standards of living of our smallholder cotton farmers by getting Bt cotton into this country.
