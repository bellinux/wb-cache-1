5|$|A month later, Samus awakens {{aboard a}} Galactic Federation starship, where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based attacks have <b>corrupted</b> her. The Federation equips her {{suit with a}} Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is {{informed}} that her fellow bounty hunters, also <b>corrupted</b> with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine {{what happened to her}} missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being <b>corrupted</b> by the Leviathan Seeds; and that she must destroy the seeds to reverse this.|$|E

5|$|Multiple promotional {{elements}} were created: a five-part online comic was {{written and illustrated}} by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik under their Penny Arcade Presents series, and television commercials featuring actor and comedian Robin Williams and his daughter Zelda were made, playing on the actor's stated love for the series. Skyward Sword released in all regions in November 2011: it released in Europe on November 18, North America on November 20, Japan on November 23, and Australia on November 24. The game was released as both a standard edition and a limited deluxe edition that included a gold Wii Remote Plus. An anniversary CD was included with both editions containing orchestrated versions of various iconic musical pieces from the series. Following its release, a game-breaking bug that <b>corrupted</b> save files if three late-game events were taken in a certain order was discovered. Once revealed, Nintendo issued instructions on avoiding it and set up a special channel on their Wii site in Japan to gain feedback, along with offering to manually repair <b>corrupted</b> save files.|$|E
5|$|Public {{interest}} in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as <b>corrupted</b> and exploited {{by members of the}} upper class.

5|$|Samus {{encounters}} heavy {{resistance from}} the Space Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and her fellow bounty hunters who have been <b>corrupted</b> by Dark Samus. Throughout her mission, which eventually takes her to the Space Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault {{with the assistance of}} the Galactic Federation navy. As they gain control of a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet create a wormhole and warp to Phaaze—the source of all Phazon in the galaxy. Samus travels to its core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the <b>corrupted</b> Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Eventually, Samus appears in her gunship, and reports that the mission is accomplished. Samus then takes off for Elysia, where she reflects on her deceased fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Samus is seen flying into hyperspace, with Sylux's spaceship following her.|$|E

5|$|Following a raid in 710, a predominately Berber army {{under the}} command of Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed from North Africa in April 711 and landed somewhere in the {{vicinity}} of Gibraltar (though most likely not in the bay or at the Rock itself). Although Tariq's expedition was an outstanding success and led to the Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula, he ended his career in disgrace after falling out with the Arab general Musa bin Nusayr. His conquest nonetheless left a long-lasting legacy for Gibraltar: Mons Calpe was renamed Jebel Tariq, the Mount of Tariq, subsequently <b>corrupted</b> into Gibraltar.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} experimentally {{the effects}} of <b>corrupt</b> experts on information aggregation in committees. We find that nonexperts are {{significantly less likely to}} delegate through ab-stention when there is a probability that experts are <b>corrupt.</b> Such decreased abstention, when the probability of <b>corrupt</b> experts is low, actually increases information efficiency in committee decision-making. However, if the probability of <b>corrupt</b> experts is large, the effect is not sufficient to offset the mechanical effect of decreased information efficiency due to <b>corrupt</b> experts. Our results demonstrate that the norm of “letting the expert decide” in committee voting is influenced by the probability of <b>corrupt</b> experts, and that influence can have, to a limited extent, a positive effect on information efficiency. ...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the PlayStation 2, Sony {{reported}} that the new system had compatibility issues with the Final Fantasy V half of Final Fantasy Anthology.

5|$|For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is {{generally}} considered among scholars as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is {{equal to that of}} Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is the most reliable witness of the text. In the Book of Revelation, however, its text is <b>corrupted</b> and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, Papyrus 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E

To prevent the now-dubbed X Parasites from spreading beyond SR388 and the space station orbiting above it, Samus sets the station to crash into the planet, during which she contends with the SA-X, an X Parasite that was born from her infected Power Suit pieces and possesses all of her abilities.|$|E

40|$|Corruption in {{developing}} states reduces {{the effectiveness of}} foreign aid that is allo-cated to them, because government officials in <b>corrupt</b> countries use this money for private rather than public purposes.

How-ever, most of these studies have not taken account of variation among donor states. This is an important omission, because donor states behave differently. This article argues that the responsiveness of donor states to corruption in recipient states depends on their own level of corruption: less <b>corrupt</b> donor states allocate more aid to less <b>corrupt</b> recipient states than to <b>corrupt</b> recipients, whereas <b>corrupt</b> donor states do not make such a clear distinction. This proposition is tested by both pooled ordinary least squares and fixed effects estimations.
