In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in {{his support of}} President Bill Clinton, after Moran, {{who had been a}} vocal supporter of the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following the Monica Lewinsky scandal.|$|E
5|$|In November 1997, Robin Raphel was {{appointed}} as United States Ambassador to Tunisia. Tunisia {{was a frequent}} partner for Mediterranean military exercises with U.S. naval squadrons and marine battalions, allowing more exercises in its waters {{than any other country}} in North Africa. When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with Tunisia. The Eizenstat Initiative, as it came to be known informally, implemented lower tariffs on industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable Tunisia to become a supplier for goods throughout Arab and African states. President Zine El Abidine visited the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

Hart both embraced and moved away from aspects of his past affiliation with McGovern, while Clinton, and the Democratic Leadership Council movement {{of which he was}} a part, explicitly rejected McGovern's ideology. But there was still a legacy in terms of staffing, as the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> would be full of former [...] "McGovernites".|$|E

500|$|On February 4, 1993, the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> made {{it known}} via {{deliberate}} background statements to several major newspapers that 49-year-old United States federal judge Kimba Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York {{would be his}} new choice for Attorney General. [...] However, no official announcement or nomination was being made, pending the completion of background checks and to gauge reaction to the pick. [...] White House officials indicated that First Lady Hillary Clinton had insisted that the position still be filled by a woman. [...] Wood, who was prominent in New York social circles, was married to Time magazine writer Michael Kramer and the couple had a six-year-old son.|$|E
500|$|In his own estimation, the Arizona {{senator is}} {{straightforward}} and direct, but impatient. Other traits include {{a penchant for}} lucky charms, a fondness for hiking, {{and a sense of}} humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: [...] "Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly?– Because Janet Reno is her father." [...] McCain subsequently apologized profusely, and the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> accepted his apology. McCain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings, and apologizing for them. He is known for sometimes being prickly and hot-tempered with Senate colleagues, but his relations with his own Senate staff have been more cordial, and have inspired loyalty towards him. [...] He formed a strong bond with two senators, Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham, over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel, and they became dubbed the [...] "Three Amigos".|$|E
500|$|On August 13, 2000, Gore {{announced}} that he had selected Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became [...] "the first person of the Jewish faith to run for the nation's second-highest office." [...] Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as further distancing him from the scandals of the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Gore's daughter, Karenna, together with her father's former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones, officially nominated Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. Gore accepted his party's nomination and spoke about the major themes of his campaign, stating in particular his plan to extend Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and to work for a sensible universal health-care system. Soon after the convention, Gore hit the campaign trail with running mate Joe Lieberman. Gore and Bush were deadlocked in the polls. They participated in three televised debates. While both sides claimed victory after each, Gore was critiqued as either too stiff, too reticent, or too aggressive in contrast to Bush.|$|E

Rather than face the penalty, they emigrated to the then-British colony of Hong Kong, where Cai gave birth to Daniel Fu (...) [...] The National Association of Evangelicals successfully lobbied the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> to get Fu political asylum in the United States, where he immigrated in 1997, settling in Philadelphia and attending nearby Westminster Theological Seminary. In July 1998, Fu and Cai moved to neighboring Glenside, Pennsylvania to live with another Chinese family in a house purchased by an anonymous donor.

2500|$|Sessions {{also served}} as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee during the {{nomination}} process for Elena Kagan, President Obama's nominee to succeed retired Justice John Paul Stevens.

Sessions pointed out that Kagan [...] "has a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago".|$|E

2500|$|William Gould's term as NLRB chair {{ended on}} August 27, 1998. Two days later, the <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> asked Truesdale {{to return to}} the NLRB as chair. [...] "I was very {{conflicted}} about it," [...] Truesdale later said. [...] "But I worked for the NLRB for almost 50 years. How can you say no?" [...] The administration's rationale for picking Truesdale was his acceptability to employers, conservative groups, and Republicans in Congress as well as a desire to avoid the contentious relationship Gould had with these groups during his tenure as chair. Administration officials also hoped Truesdale would smooth relationships among NLRB members themselves, who often had an unhappy relationship with Gould.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{press office}} issued a {{response}} to McCaughey's [...] "No Exit" [...] article by arguing that it contained [...] "numerous factual inaccuracies and misleading statements."

2500|$|The First Lady's role in {{the secret}} {{proceedings}} of the Health Care Task Force also sparked litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit {{in relation to the}} Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires openness in government. The <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> argued that the [...] in Article II of the US Constitution would make it unconstitutional to apply the procedural requirements of FACA to her participation in the meetings of the Task Force. Some constitutional experts argued to the court that such a legal theory was not supported by the text, the history, or the structure of the Constitution. Ultimately, Hillary Clinton won the litigation in June 1993, when the D.C. Circuit ruled narrowly that the First Lady could be deemed a government official (and not a mere private citizen) for the purpose of not having to comply with the procedural requirements of FACA.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 Newsweek {{profiled}} Sirota as a [...] "political operative" [...] {{skilled at}} [...] "hacking out a daily barrage of anti-Bush media clips, commentary, and snappy quotes" [...] who made [...] "guerrilla {{attacks on the}} Bush administration" [...] and who was [...] "well schooled {{in the art of}} Washington warfare." [...] According to the article, Sirota's main weapons were computer emails. Sirota was described as the [...] "Internet child of the Clinton War Room generation." [...] Former <b>Clinton</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> chief of staff John Podesta said of Sirota: [...] "I just saw he had an eye for critique and the instinct for the jugular." [...] For example, Sirota unearthed a two-year-old comment which Colin Powell had made to the effect that [...] "Iraq posed no threat to its neighbors, and possessed no 'significant capability' in weapons of mass destruction." [...] Sirota made Powell's statements more widely known. Reporters pounced, and it became a public relations blow to the Bush administration. Sirota was credited with having revealed that $87 billion for Iraq could have been used to erase huge state deficits at home, a fact that was repeated by Democrats nationwide.|$|E
