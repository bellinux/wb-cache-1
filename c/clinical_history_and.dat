5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
25|$|Acute kidney {{injury is}} {{diagnosed}} {{on the basis}} of <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is a rapid reduction in kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine, or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed oliguria (less than 400 mLs of urine per 24 hours).|$|E

In some cases the classic signs of fever, chills, painful joint, and a draining sinus may be present, and diagnostic studies are simply done to confirm the diagnosis. In reality though, most patients do not present with those clinical signs, {{and in fact the}} clinical presentation may overlap with other complications such as aseptic loosening and pain. In those cases diagnostic tests can be useful in confirming or excluding infection.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} {{renal biopsy}} is to {{diagnose}} renal disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means (clinical history, past medical history, medication history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies). In general, a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate the morphologic findings with the <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> laboratory data, ultimately arriving at a pathological diagnosis. A renal pathologist is a physician who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially training {{in the interpretation of}} renal biopsy specimens.|$|E
25|$|Many {{modern style}} guides in the U.S. {{recommend}} against using homosexual as a noun, instead using gay man or lesbian.

Gay and lesbian {{are the most common}} alternatives.

50|$|Many renal {{diseases}} are diagnosed {{on the basis}} of a detailed <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> performs a physical examination. In addition to medical history and presenting symptoms, a physician will ask about medication history, family history recent infections, toxic/chemical exposures and other factors that may be related to disease. Some diseases are suggested by <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> time course alone. For example, in a formerly healthy child with a recent upper respiratory tract infection and facial/lower limb swelling, findings of proteinuria on urinalysis, a diagnosis of minimal change disease is highly suggested. Similarly, a patient with a history of diabetes who presents with decreased urine output is most likely to be suffering from diabetic nephropathy. Often, such cases do not require extensive workup (such as with renal biopsy). A presumptive diagnosis can be made {{on the basis of}} history, physical exam and supportive laboratory studies.|$|E

40|$|I {{studied the}} histologic findings, liver {{function}} tests <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>histories</b> of 52 cases of precirrhosis and 51 of chronic hepatitis, and obtained the following results. i) I defined a word 2 ̆ 2 precirrhosis 2 ̆ 2 as follows. That is, precirrhosis is the progressed form of chronic hepatitis and of having pseudolobule in part and not diffusely. The cases of precirrhosis {{differed from the}} cases of chronic hepatitis not only histologically but also functionally. Therefore, I felt that precirrhosis occupied {{an important part of}} chronic hepatitis both clinically and pathologically. ii) I divided cases of precirrhosis into two groups by their <b>clinical</b> <b>histories,</b> <b>and</b> studied the difference between them. A-group consisted of cases of drunkard and cases with metabolic disease. V-group consisted of all cases other than A-group, for instance, cases with viral hepatitis on their <b>clinical</b> <b>histories</b> <b>and</b> cases with no special histories. Histologically, V-group showed many times predominant cellular infiltration in the portal triads and in peripheral zones of the lobule, therefore, the border between stroma and parenchyma was not distinct. Collagenisation of the connective tissue fibers was poor in inflammatory portions in the portal triads. Kupffer cell proliferation was often found. On the other hand, in A-group cellular infiltration in the portal triads was relatively poor, and the border between stroma and parenchyma was generally distinct. Collagenisation of the connective tissue fibers was rich in almost cases. Kupffer cell proliferation was poor. On liver function tests, B. S. P. test, serum transaminase value and icterus index were more higher in V-group than in A-group. According to the results above mentioned, I was convinced of that there were differences between histologic findings of the hepatic lesions caused by alcohol and viral hepatitis, the two main pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis...|$|R
50|$|Conventionally, a {{definitive}} diagnosis requires {{a demonstration of}} depleted body iron stores obtained by bone marrow aspiration, with the marrow stained for iron. Because this is invasive and painful, while a clinical trial of iron supplementation is inexpensive and not traumatic, patients are often treated based on <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> serum ferritin levels without a bone marrow biopsy.
