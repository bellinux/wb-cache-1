5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single <b>computer</b> <b>file.</b> For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E

25|$|Musical {{notation}} is {{the written}} or symbolized representation of music. This {{is most often}} achieved {{by the use of}} commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.In the 2000s, <b>computer</b> <b>file</b> formats have become important as well. Spoken language and hand signs are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1970s, all of {{the major}} {{typeface}} technologies and all their fonts were in use: letterpress; continuous casting machines; phototypositors; computer-controlled phototypesetters; and the earliest digital typesetters – bulky machines with primitive processors and CRT outputs. From the mid-1980s, as digital typography has grown, users have almost universally adopted the American spelling font, which has come to primarily refer to a <b>computer</b> <b>file</b> containing scalable outline letterforms (digital font), in one of several common formats. Some typefaces, such as Verdana, are designed primarily for use on computer screens.|$|E

25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup process, printing {{directly from a}} <b>computer</b> <b>file,</b> and enabled inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a latent image on the Photo Imaging Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an electrostatic charge. This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket to substrate, a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|E
500|$|According to Philip Wang, Wong Fu Productions was unofficially {{established}} in 2001 during {{his high school}} junior year at Northgate High School (Walnut Creek, California). Wang mainly utilised his family's digital camcorder to film school projects in collaboration with classmates. The name Wong Fu is a nickname that Philip was given {{when he was in}} the seventh grade. In his first year as an undeclared freshman at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Wang and his friends released a music video of Justin Timberlake's song [...] "Señorita". It was the first music video produced by Wang and, although he did not actively promote it, the video was quickly circulated among other fellow college students. The video was circulated in its original <b>computer</b> <b>file</b> format because it was released prior to the advent of the video sharing website YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|A {{text file}} (sometimes spelled [...] "textfile"; an old {{alternative}} name is [...] "flatfile") {{is a kind}} of <b>computer</b> <b>file</b> that is structured as a sequence of lines of electronic text. [...] A text file exists stored as data within a <b>computer</b> <b>file</b> system. [...] The end of a text file is often denoted by placing one or more special characters, known as an end-of-file marker, after the last line in a text file. Such markers were required under the CP/M and MS-DOS operating systems. On modern operating systems such as Windows and Unix-like systems, text files do not contain any special EOF character.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1980s, however, chiptune music began {{declining in}} popularity.

Some of the earliest examples of record label releases of pure chip music {{can be found in}} the late 1990s. Chiptune music began gaining popularity again towards the end of the 1990s.

2500|$|File sharing is {{an example}} of {{transferring}} large amounts of data across the Internet. A <b>computer</b> <b>file</b> can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a [...] "shared location" [...] or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of [...] "mirror" [...] servers or peer-to-peer networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed– usually fully encrypted– across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a <b>computer</b> <b>file</b> for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.|$|E

In April 2002, the group assumed the name Qa'idat al-Jihad ( [...] ), which means [...] "the base of Jihad".
