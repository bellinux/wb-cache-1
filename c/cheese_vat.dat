50|$|To make cheese the cheesemaker brings milk (possibly pasteurised) in the <b>cheese</b> <b>vat</b> to a {{temperature}} required {{to promote the}} growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, {{as is the case with}} unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required. For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').|$|E

40|$|From Cache Valley Dairy Association in Smithfield, Utah, {{milk from}} two to three <b>cheese</b> <b>vats</b> plus the {{corresponding}} Swiss cheese trimmings, salted cheese, and whey were sampled each week from October 1981 to October 1982. The weights of the Swiss Cheese were recorded. Milk samples were analyzed for fat and protein; cheese samples were analyzed for fat, protein, and moisture; whey samples were analyzed for fat. By using Gauss-Newton nonlinear Least Squares method of iteration, the data was analyzed. Two formulas for predicting Swiss cheese yield were derived. A good relationship was found to exist between Swiss cheese yield and fat and protein.

50|$|In making Cheddar (or {{many other}} hard cheeses) the curd is {{cut into small}} cubes and the {{temperature}} is raised to approximately.39 C to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the <b>cheese</b> <b>vat</b> to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in {{a process known as}} 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases and when the cheesemaker is satisfied it has reached the required level, around 0.65%, the curd is milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.|$|E

A three-factor (renneting temperature, calcium chloride, cutting time), central composite design {{was carried out in}} triplicate. Spectra (300 – 1, 100 nm) of the product in the <b>cheese</b> <b>vat</b> were captured during syneresis using a prototype light backscatter sensor. Stirring followed upon cutting the gel, and samples of curd and whey were removed at 10 min intervals and analyzed for curd moisture and whey fat content. Spectral data were used to develop models for predicting curd moisture and whey fat contents using partial least squares regression. Subjecting the spectral data set to Jack-knifing improved the accuracy of the models. The whey fat models (R = 0. 91, 0. 95) and curd moisture model (R = 0. 86, 0. 89) provided good and approximate predictions, respectively.

50|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, Aultsville had added three more general stores, three cheese factories, another garage, four service stations, and a bank to its list of businesses. A grist mill in Aultsville was built around 1929. The mill {{contained}} metal grinding plates which ran on an electric motor; the mill mostly ground the local farmers personal grain supplies. In later years, the grist mill was used as an egg grading office.The first cheese factory was known as Croil’s and McCullough’s factory, and was located near the train station; cheese made here was shipped as far away as Montreal. Later this cheese factory became the Edward’s Cheese Factory, and two more factories opened in the village both of which were also operated by the Edward family. These cheese factories were powered by steam, using coal-fired boilers to heat <b>cheese</b> <b>vats.</b> The cream for these factories was cooled and kept cool using a primitive cold-storage method; ice was cut during the winter months from the St. Lawrence River and insulated with sawdust.|$|R

40|$|Cheese {{making is}} {{a process in which}} enzymatic {{coagulation}} of milk is followed by protein separation, carbohydrate removal, and an extended bacterial fermentation. The number of variables in this complex process that influence cheese quality is so large that the developments of new manufacturing protocols are cumbersome. To reduce screening costs, several models have been developed to miniaturize the cheese manufacturing process. However, these models are not able to accommodate the throughputs required for systematic screening programs. Here, we describe a protocol that allows the parallel manufacturing of approximately 600 cheeses in individual <b>cheese</b> <b>vats</b> each with individual process specifications. Protocols for the production of miniaturized Gouda- and Cheddar-type cheeses have been developed. Starting with as little as 1. 7 mL of milk, miniature cheeses of about 170 mg can be produced and they closely resemble conventionally produced cheese in terms of acidification profiles, moisture and salt contents, proteolysis, flavor profiles, and microstructure. Flavor profiling of miniature cheeses manufactured with and without mixed-strain adjunct starter cultures allowed the distinguishing of the different cheeses. Moreover, single-strain adjunct starter cultures engineered to overexpress important flavor-related enzymes revealed effects similar to those described in industrial cheese. Benchmarking against industrial cheese produced from the same raw materials established a good correlation between their proteolytic degradation products and their flavor profiles. These miniature cheeses, referred to as microcheeses, open new possibilities to study many aspects of cheese production, which will not only accelerate product development but also allow a more systematic approach to investigate the complex biochemistry and microbiology of cheese makin...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{characteristics}} of stirred curd were simultaneously monitored during syneresis in a 10 -L <b>cheese</b> <b>vat</b> using computer vision and colorimetric measurements. Curd syneresis kinetic conditions were varied using 2 levels of milk pH (6. 0 and 6. 5) and 2 agitation speeds (12. 1 and 27. 2 rpm). Measured optical parameters {{were compared with}} gravimetric measurements of syneresis, taken simultaneously. The results showed that computer vision and colorimeter measurements have potential for monitoring syneresis. The 2 different phases, curd and whey, were distinguished by means of color differences. As syneresis progressed, the backscattered light became increasingly yellow in hue for circa 20 min for the higher stirring speed and circa 30 min for the lower stirring speed. Syneresis-related gravimetric measurements of importance to cheese making (e. g., curd moisture content, total solids in whey, and yield of whey) correlated significantly with computer vision and colorimetric measurements. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of caper berries {{addition}} on some physicochemical and functional properties of White Cheese were investigated.

40|$|The {{potential}} of a fibre optic sensor, detecting light backscatter in a <b>cheese</b> <b>vat</b> during coagulation and syneresis, to predict curd moisture, fat loses and curd yield was examined. Temperature, cutting time and calcium levels were varied to assess {{the strength of the}} predictions over a range of processing conditions. Equations were developed using a combination of independent variables, milk compositional and light backscatter parameters. Fat losses, curd yield and curd moisture content were predicted with a standard error of prediction (SEP) of +/- 2. 65 g 100 g(- 1) (R- 2 = 0. 93), +/- 0. 95 % (R- 2 = 0. 90) and +/- 1. 43 % (R- 2 = 0. 94), respectively. These results were used to develop a model for predicting curd moisture as a function of time during syneresis (SEP = +/- 1. 72 %; R- 2 = 0. 95). By monitoring coagulation and syneresis, this sensor technology could be employed to control curd moisture content, thereby improving process control during cheese manufacture. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Vendors {{specializing in}} cheese {{processing}} equipment, both new and used, {{were identified and}} contacted. They were asked to supply {{as much information as}} they could on equipment requirements and costs associated with a “complete” cheese plant in very small (4, 000 pounds raw milk/day), small (16, 000 pounds raw milk/day), and medium-small (32, 000 pounds raw milk/day) plant sizes. It was anticipated that these vendors would be better able to recommend equipment and provide costs for complete cheese making systems (plants) that could function efficiently to produce specialty cheese products. This is opposed to a more “piece meal” approach of putting together equipment components from various vendors (even though this can be done by combining vendor information). Vendor contact information is given in Table 1. Because of the unknown frame before any equipment would be purchased and installed, and because of unknown specifications on type and volume of cheese (or cheeses) to be produced, most vendors were reluctant, or found it difficult, to provide detailed equipment requirements or costs information. It was emphasized to them that we were seeking “ballpark” or budget-type cost information for consideration by those interested in an on-farm specialty cheese plant. Despite this, some very good (and detailed) used equipment requirements and costs were obtained. Most vendors included reconditioned equipment when available to minimize costs. Also for this same reason, vendors were not willing to supply comments or suggestions on plant size or plant/equipment layout requirements. Approximate plant size requirements (which are required because building construction is a major factor in project cost budget estimation) were determined from various sources. Table 1 contains the Vendor Contact information. Table 2 contains a Equipment Requirements and Costs Information Received from Vendors Specializing in Dairy Equipment Supply and Sales. It is broken down into principal required equipment categories for the three plant sizes requested. It is difficult to compare quotes from individual vendors directly due to the varying specifications of the item specified. For instance, the Kusel Equipment Co. make-vat quotes include all required accessories including curd cutters, hoops and presses. Most make-vats quoted are self-contained for curd separation and preparation and are sized to hold one day’s worth starting raw milk quantity. The Sprinkman quote features smaller round end <b>cheese</b> <b>vats</b> (which are then refilled for additional processing batches as required) and equally expensive curd drain tables to which the curdled milk is transferred for whey draining and curd processing. Most make-vat quotes include a U. S. legal pasteurization controls package that is required in most states and adds significantly to the equipment cost (at least $ 5000 per vat). Vendors indicated that there is no clear plant size where a continuous HTST (High Temperature Short Time) make-vat system would be recommended. However, for the very small plants the less complex, self-contained pasteurizing vat would be more desirable and less costly to install...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the least}} {{controlled}} defects in Swiss cheese is development of splits that appear during refrigerated storage after cheese {{is removed from the}} warm room. Such fissures, or cracks, {{in the body of the}} cheese can be as short as 1 cm, or long enough to span a 90 -kg block. A 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experiment was used to determine the effect of different Lactobacillus helveticus/Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii starter culture combinations on the occurrence of split defect in Swiss <b>cheese.</b> Eights <b>vats</b> of <b>cheese</b> were made in summer and eight in winter. Each 90 -kg block of cheese was cut into twenty-four 4 -kg blocks and graded based on the presence of splits. Only small variations were found in the composition of cheeses made during the same season. There were no correlations between moisture, pH, fat, protein, calcium, lactose contents, D/L lactate ratio, or protein degradation that could be used to predict splits after 90 d of storage. However, cheese made in the summer had 2 % higher moisture content and a greater prevalence of splits. There was a sixfold increase in amount of downgraded cheese between the best and worst culture combinations used during cheese manufacture. After 90 -d storage, 14 to 90 % of cheese had splits in the summer, and 1 to 6 % in the winter.

Many studies have attempted to prevent this defect by physical treatment, the use of additives, {{and the use of}} bacteriocins. In this paper, we look at the effect of jenny milk as an inhibitor of blowing caused by clostridia and coliforms in ewe cheese making. Bulk ewe and jenny milk samples were collected in the morning by mechanical milking and were refrigerated at 4 °C. On the collected samples, the count of somatic cells, coliforms, Clostridium butyricum, and Escherichia coli were determined. The bulk raw milk was divided in two 45 -L vats: vat 1 was used as a control, whereas 0. 5 L of jenny milk was added to vat 2. Four semihard cheeses, weighing about 2 kg each, were made from each <b>vat.</b> <b>Cheese</b> making was replicated twice. After a ripening period of 60 d, the count of coliforms and of C. butyricum was determined. In the treated group, a significant inhibition of coliform bacteria was observed.

40|$|An NIR {{reflectance}} sensor, {{with a large}} {{field of}} view and a fibre-optic connection to a spectrometer for measuring light backscatter at 980 nm, was used to monitor the syneresis process online during cheese-making {{with the goal of}} predicting syneresis indices (curd moisture content, yield of whey and fat losses to whey) over a range of curd cutting programmes and stirring speeds. A series of trials were carried out in an 11 L <b>cheese</b> <b>vat</b> using recombined whole milk. A factorial experimental design consisting of three curd stirring speeds and three cutting programmes, was undertaken. Milk was coagulated under constant conditions and the casein gel was cut when the elastic modulus reached 35 Pa. Among the syneresis indices investigated, the most accurate and most parsimonious multivariate model developed was for predicting yield of whey involving three terms, namely light backscatter, milk fat content and cutting intensity (R 2 = 0. 83, SEy = 6. 13 g/ 100 g), while the best simple model also predicted this syneresis index using the light backscatter alone (R 2 = 0. 80, SEy = 6. 53 g/ 100 g). In this model the main predictor was the light backscatter response from the NIR light back scatter sensor. The sensor also predicted curd moisture with a similar accuracy. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the first known}} attempt to model the dairy business from a multiscale modelling perspective. The multiscale nature of the dairy industry is examined with emphasis on those key decision making and process scales involved in production. Decision making scales identified range from the investor level to the plant operator level, and encompass business, production, plant, and operational levels. The model considers scales from the production manager to the unit operation scale. The cheese making process is used to demonstrate scale identification {{in the context of}} the important phenomena and other natural levels of scrutiny of interest to decision makers. This work was a first step in the establishment of a multiscale system model capable of delivering information for process troubleshooting, scheduling, process and business optimization, and process control decision-making for the dairy industry. Here, only material transfer throughout a process, use of raw materials, and production of manufactured product is modelled. However, an implementation pathway for adding other models (such as the precipitation of milk protein which forms curd) to the system model is proposed. The software implementation of the dairy industry multiscale model presented here tests the validity of the proposed: • object model (object and collection classes) used to model unit operations and integrate them into a process, • mechanisms for modelling material and energy streams, • method to create simulations over variable time horizons. The model was implemented using object oriented programming (OOP) methods in conjunction with technologies such as Visual Basic. NET and CAPE-OPEN. An OOP object model is presented which successfully enabled the construction of a multiscale model of the cheese making process. Material content, unit operation, and raw milk supply models were integrated into the multiscale model. The model is capable of performing simulations over variable time horizons, from 1 second, to multiple years. Mechanisms for modelling material streams, connecting unit operations, and controlling unit operation behaviour were implemented. Simple unit operations such as pumps and storage silos along with more complex unit operations, such as a <b>cheese</b> <b>vat</b> batch, were modelled. Despite some simplifications to the model of the cheese making process, the simulations successfully reproduced the major features expected from the process and its constituent unit operations. Decision making information for process operators, plant managers, production managers, and the dairy business manager can be produced from the data generated. The multiscale model can be made more sophisticated by extending the functionality of existing objects, and incorporating other scale partial models. However, increasing the number of reported variables by even a small number can quickly increase the data processing and storage demands of the model. A unit operation’s operational state of existence at any point of time was proposed as a mechanism for integrating and recalculating lower scale partial models. This mechanism was successfully tested using a unit operation’s material content model and is presented here as a new concept in multiscale modelling. The proposed modelling structure can be extended to include any number of partial models and any number of scales...|$|E

A control cheese was made using a non-exopolysaccharide-producing starter culture consisting of S. thermophilus TA 061 and Lactobacillus helveticusLH 100. Cheeses were analyzed for moisture, melt, fat, and protein. Cheeses made with the addition of the mesophilic exopolysaccharide-producing adjunct culture showed significant differences in moisture, but not in melting properties when compared to cheeses made without adjunct culture. Cheeses made with both the exopolysaccharide-producing starter and exopolysaccharide-producing adjunct cultures showed a 4 % increase in moisture, but the use of the exopolysaccharide-producing starter cultures alone produced a 3 % increase in moisture over the control cheese. Melt also increased in these cheeses as moisture increased. The same cultures were used to determine the effects on moisture when the cheesemaking procedure was scaled up from 10 -kg vats to using 454 -kg horizontal blade double-O vats, and hand stretching was replaced by an Alfa Laval cooker stretcher machine.

Microbiological and scanning electron microscopy analyses showed differences in terms of microbial levels and composition of the neoformed biofilms. The levels of the microbial groups investigated during cheese production showed significant differences between the control trials and between the control and experimental trials, but the differences were not particularly marked between the TA 2 and TZ 2 productions, which showed the largest numbers of mesophilic lactic acid bacterium (LAB) cocci. LAB populations were characterized phenotypically and genotypically, and 44 dominant strains belonging to 10 species were identified. Direct comparison of the polymorphic profiles of the LAB collected during cheese making showed that the addition of the NWSC reduced their biodiversity.

In order to minimize production variability, several LAB were isolated from Vastedda PDO cheeses, characterized for their technological potential (Gaglio et al., 2014 a) and selected to obtain the best strain combination for the production (Gaglio et al., 2014 b). In this study, the multiple strain culture composed of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris PON 36, PON 153 and PON 203 was applied during production carried out at large scale level in a dairy factory with bulk milk from different farms using new chestnut wooden vats [commercial production (CMP) ].
