5|$|In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas {{visited the}} same site as Lehmann and found a red lead mineral that had useful {{properties}} as a pigment in paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment then developed rapidly. A bright yellow pigment made from <b>crocoite</b> also became popular.|$|E
5|$|Chromium {{minerals}} as pigments came to {{the attention}} of the west in the 18th century. On 26 July 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural Mountains which he named Siberian red lead. Though misidentified as a lead compound with selenium and iron components, the mineral was in fact <b>crocoite</b> (lead chromate) with a formula of PbCrO4.|$|E
5|$|Chromium was {{discovered}} {{as an element}} after {{it came to the}} attention of the Western world in the red crystalline mineral <b>crocoite</b> (lead(II) chromate), discovered in 1761 and initially used as a pigment. Nearly all chromium is commercially extracted from the single commercially viable ore chromite, which is iron chromium oxide (FeCr2O4). Chromite is now the principal source of chromium for pigments.|$|E
5|$|During the 1800s, {{chromium}} {{was primarily}} {{used as a}} component of paints and in tanning salts. At first, <b>crocoite</b> from Russia was the main source, but in 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near Baltimore, United States. This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products till 1848 when large deposits of chromite were found near Bursa, Turkey.|$|E
5|$|The mineral <b>crocoite</b> (lead {{chromate}} PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E
50|$|As one {{approaches}} the lode the granodiorite becomes mylonitized and is traversed by veinlets covered in pyromorphite. The lode {{itself is not}} wider than 60 centimeters and shows an asymmetric arrangement. The 25 centimeter wide contact zone on the south flank is composed of massive, nonmineralized quartz. Only some joints are covered in pyromorphite and <b>crocoite.</b> To the north follows a 10 centimeter wide band of white, powdery mylonite very rich in pyromorphite and <b>crocoite.</b> Next comes a 5 centimeter wide quartz band in boxwork facies, that is also very rich in the secondary minerals pyromorphite and <b>crocoite.</b> The <b>crocoite</b> appears skeletal and the pyromorphite acicular. The lode terminates on its north side with a 20 centimeter wide quartz band strongly mineralized in galena and sphalerite. Cross-joints show beautiful pyromorphite and <b>crocoite,</b> occasionally also cerussite.|$|E
50|$|Dundasite is an {{uncommon}} secondary mineral {{occurring in the}} oxidized zone of lead ore deposits. It commonly overgrows <b>crocoite.</b> It may also be overgrown by yellow cerussite.

50|$|The {{relative}} {{rarity of}} <b>crocoite</b> {{is connected with}} the specific conditions required for its formation: an oxidation zone of lead ore bed and presence of ultramafic rocks serving {{as the source of}} chromium (in chromite). Oxidation of Cr3+ into CrO42− (from chromite) and decomposition of galena (or other primary lead minerals) are required for <b>crocoite</b> formation. These conditions are relatively unusual.|$|E
50|$|As <b>crocoite</b> is {{composed}} of lead(II) chromate, it is toxic, containing both lead and hexavalent chromium.|$|E

50|$|<b>Crocoite</b> is {{commonly}} found as large, well-developed prismatic adamatine crystals, although {{in many cases}} are poorly terminated. Crystals are of a bright hyacinth-red color, translucent, and have an adamantine to vitreous lustre. On exposure to UV light some of the translucency and brilliancy is lost. The streak is orange-yellow; Mohs hardness is 2.5-3; and the specific gravity is 6.0.It was discovered at the Berezovskoe Au Deposit (Berezovsk Mines) near Ekaterinburg in the Urals in 1766; and named crocoise by F. S. Beudant in 1832, from the Greek κρόκος (krokos), saffron, in allusion to its color, a name first altered to crocoisite and afterwards to <b>crocoite.</b> In the type locality the crystals are found in gold-bearing quartz-veins traversing granite or gneiss and associated with <b>crocoite</b> are quartz, embreyite, phoenicochroite and vauquelinite. Phoenicochroite is a basic lead chromate, Pb2CrO5 with dark red crystals, and vauquelinite a lead and copper phosphate-chromate, Pb2CuCrO4PO4OH, with brown or green monoclinic crystals. Vauquelinite was named after L. N. Vauquelin, who in 1797 discovered (simultaneously with and independently of M. H. Klaproth) the element chromium in <b>crocoite.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} minerals {{were discovered}} at the deposit: aikinite (1789), vauquelinite (1819), cassedanneite (1988), <b>crocoite</b> (1766), pyrophyllite (1829), phenicochroite (1839), embreyite (1972).|$|E

50|$|Lead(II) {{chromate}} {{may also}} be known as chrome yellow, chromic acid lead(II) salt, canary chrome yellow 40-2250, chrome green, chrome green UC61, chrome green UC74, chrome green UC76, chrome lemon, <b>crocoite,</b> dianichi chrome yellow G, lemon yellow, king's yellow, Leipzig yellow, lemon yellow, Paris yellow, pigment green 15, plumbous chromate, pure lemon chrome L3GS, and various other names. The mineral <b>crocoite,</b> occurring as orange-yellow prismatic crystals, is a moderately rare mineral known from the oxidation zones of such Pb ore beds, that were affected by chromate-bearing solutions, coming from the oxidation of primary Cr minerals (chromite) of the nearby (ultra)mafic rocks.|$|E
50|$|Abundant masses with {{exceptional}} {{examples of}} <b>crocoite</b> crystals {{have been found}} in the Extended Mine at Mount Dundas as well as the Adelaide, Red Lead, West Comet, Platt and a few other Mines at Dundas, Tasmania; they are usually found in long slender prisms, usually about 10-20 mm but rarely up to 100 mm (4 inches) in length, with a brilliant lustre and color. <b>Crocoite</b> is also the official Tasmanian mineral emblem. Other localities which have yielded good crystallized specimens are Congonhas do Campo near Ouro Preto in Brazil, Luzon in the Philippines, Mutare in Mashonaland, near Menzies in Western Australia, plus Brazil, Germany and South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Chrome Yellow (lead chromate, [...] ), {{derived from}} the mineral <b>crocoite,</b> was used by artists in the earlier part of the 19th century, but has been largely {{replaced}} by other yellow pigments because of the toxicity of lead.|$|E

From Mount Lyell there are rare minerals: mawsonite, betechtinite, florenceite, hessite, jalpaite, magnesiofoitite, svanbergite-woodhousite, stannoidite, stromeyerite, and zunyite.|$|E
50|$|Tsumcorite is yellow-brown, red-brown {{or orange}} in color, {{and it is}} one of the few {{minerals}} that have a yellow streak (orpiment and <b>crocoite</b> are two others).

50|$|The lode clearly {{consists}} of a magmatic lead-zinc-association (more precisely a sphalerite-pyrite-galena-chalcopyrite association) enriched in silver.

Amongst these galena-derived lead minerals we find chromates (<b>crocoite,</b> embreyite and vauquelinite), arsenates (mimetesite) and molybdates (wulfenite). Vauquelinite indicates the presence of copper.|$|E
