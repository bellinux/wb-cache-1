2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the <b>caliper</b> <b>body</b> with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally {{opposing}} {{piston brake}} calipers {{are made in}} two halves which are then bolted together. The advantages of this method are ease and the speed of which the pieces can be made. The disadvantage {{is that they are}} less resistant to flex under load. Calipers machined from a single piece of metal are stronger, but much more expensive to make so some manufacturers such as Sumitomo cast the <b>caliper</b> <b>body</b> as one piece and then machine the piston bores externally with the holes created plugged after assembly.

40|$|Background: Anthropometry {{plays an}} {{important}} role in industrial design, clothing design, ergonomics and architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body dimensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes in lifestyles, nutrition, and ethnic composition of populations lead to changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e. g. the obesity epidemic), and require regular updating of anthropometric data collections. Aim and Objectives: This study analyzed the variation in anthropometric dimensions and body composition parameters of working women employees of different geographical zones. Material and Methods: The study was undertaken on nine hundred forty (940) women employees of Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) working in seventeen different laboratories and belonged to different states of India. The age range of studied women was between 20 - 60 years. Fourteen body dimensions namely stature, popliteal height, knee height, buttock to popliteal length, hip breadth, waist breadth, shoulder breadth, forearm length, arm length, eye height (sitting), sitting shoulder height, hand length, hand breadth and elbow width were measured in cm using Martin anthropometers and Martin's sliding <b>caliper.</b> <b>Body</b> composition parameters like weight, percentage body fat, fat mass and fat free mass were recorded. Results: All anthropometric parameters were found significantly different (p< 0. 001).

40|$|High-speed {{testing of}} a brake system using two {{different}} calipers and two different discs {{on a special}} test rig with a swinging caliper head mounting shows similar results with regard to hot judder. Holographic interferometry is used {{in an attempt to}} observe the disc mode shape during judder and although the classical fringe pattern was not obtained for the disc some useful and complementary information was forthcoming. Disc run-out measurements show that the disc takes up a permanent and increasing deformation with a two-diameter mode formation. This deformation is seen to give a brake pressure fluctuation that results in judder - the pressure being detected using a pressure transducer fitted at the caliper and the mechanical judder with an accelerometer mounted on the <b>caliper</b> <b>body.</b> The two signals allow the degree of phase shift to be estimated. A ""strobing" effect, resulting from the combination of speed and video recording frequency, shows two hot-spots moving with the disc. Subsequent holographic results confirm the positions with the appearance of thermal fringes ""just off" the disc surface. The images also show a classical two-diameter mode order of vibration on the disc center. The holographic recordings also indicate pressure waves being emitted from the trailing end of the pads with the mode shape of the pads confirming high amplitude bending; the existence of the pressure waves inferring the pads lose contact with the disc surface. Other observations include hot spotting on the disc surface and a surface scan of the disc face indicates a depression at these positions. A metallurgical analysis of the blue spot is currently being carried out to determine if a material phase change has occurred within the disc body and this will be included in the paper.

Purpose: To {{determine}} the most applicable tool to assess obesity in children. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on the following tools: Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), Underwater Weighing (UW), Skinfold <b>Calipers</b> (SF), <b>Body</b> Mass Index (BMI), Air Displacement Plethysmography (ADP), Waist Circumference (WC), Weight-Height Growth Velocity, Height and Weight Centiles, Photonic Imaging, Near-Infrared Interactance, Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), and Waist and Neck Circumference. Databases: EBSCO, PubMed, Medline, CINNAHL, Science Direct. Results: A variety of assessment tools to determine overweight and obesity in children were researched. Testing environment and the number of participants involved directly impact the most effective assessment tool. In a non-clinical setting with the need for quick results, e. g., a school system or field test, certain tools are more appropriate. Skin fold analysis predicts body composition whereas BMI is an indicator of obesity risk. Both tools are easy to use in a large group study. The tools found to be the most reliable and valid were DEXA and UW. The use of DEXA and UW for assessment of body composition are most effective in clinical studies. Conclusion: Assessment tools to predict overweight and obesity in children is dependent on the assessment environment. The tools with the highest reliability and validity are not feasible with large population study. BMI is an indicator of overweight and obesity and easy to use in a large population study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{nutrition}} and physical fitness levels of vegetarian and non-vegetarian college students at a mid-sized university, using males and females between the ages of 18 and 25. Seventy students at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, participated in this study. Each subject completed an initial health history questionnaire, a three-day food diet record, and underwent a comprehensive fitness assessment. The fitness assessment consisted of the following tests: hand grip dynamometer for muscular strength, one minute bent knee sit ups for muscular endurance, sit and reach for flexibility, the use of skin fold <b>calipers</b> for <b>body</b> composition, and a sub maximal cycle ergo meter test for cardio respiratory endurance. All data collected from the three-day food diet records and fitness assessment were analyzed for both group and sex significance using a two-way ANOVA test. The significance level for these tests was set at p< 0. 05. Vegetarians were found to have a significantly higher level of cardio respiratory endurance, lower level of muscular endurance, and an increased incidence of smoking than non-vegetarians. They also consumed significantly less amounts of protein, and greater amounts of polyunsaturated fat, insoluble fiber, alpha tocopherol, and vitamin E, than non-vegetarians. The primary investigator feels that these results are indicative of areas needing to be addressed for this age group, and that both vegetarians and non-vegetarians can benefit from nutrition and fitness counseling. As a result of present health practices of these individuals leading to future health habits, it is imperative that proper diet and health behaviors be taught and implemented, which could possibly deter the development of future incidence of chronic disease among this group. Recommendations for future repetition of this study include testing a larger sample size, taking more variables (i. e. lifestyle behaviors, demographic factors, family history, and social environment) into consideration, using a maximal cardio respiratory endurance protocol to measure absolute V 02 max., and taking a sample of fasting blood to analyze the bioavailability of nutrients.

However, {{there are still many}} challenging problems in usability and reliability of application of these kits in real-world settings. Objectives: To identify the usability and accuracy issues with a conventional anthropometric caliper, and to propose measurable design features to enhance the functionality of the caliper. Methods: The measurement process using a conventional anthropometric caliper was systematically analyzed through detailed hierarchical task analyses. Also, six qualified anthropometry specialists performed heuristic evaluations to gain valuable insights into major usability issues in relation to the existing body measurement devices. Based on the resulting concepts, a mock-up was developed and evaluated against the desired specifications. Results: Incorrect positioning angle of the caliper, as well as applying various amounts of force by different investigators to push the <b>caliper</b> branches against <b>body</b> parts, appeared to be the main factors introducing inaccuracy to anthropometric data. Installing a spirit level on caliper, and also a pre-programmed microprocessor for real-time saving of the obtained data, facilitated the measurement process for both investigators and subjects. Conclusion: Accuracy, followed by usability is the primary concern in designing anthropometric instruments. However, expectations would vary from one specialist to another. Therefore, trade-offs should be made when incorporating innovative features in novel designed body measurement kits. </p...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of resistance training and detraining on muscle mass in elderly women. Methods: Twenty post-menopausal women aged ≥ 50 years old were enrolled. Matching for age, they were randomly assigned into control and resistance training group (RT). The intervention consisted of three sets of 10 repetitions for 10 movements with Thera-Band tubing (based on 80 - 100 % 10 -RM), three times a week, for 12 weeks and thereafter, four weeks detraining. Skinfold thickness was determined by <b>caliper.</b> Percentage of <b>body</b> fat was estimated from skinfold thickness (triceps and subscapular) by McArdle method. Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were calculated. Range of motion for trunk flexion and extension was determined. Results: During 12 weeks of intervention, significant increases were observed in 1 -RM of biceps curl, FFM, trunk flexion and extension and significant decreases during four weeks detraining in RT group. The RT group demonstrated significant decreases during resistance training and increases during detraining in skinfold thickness. FFM, trunk flexion, and extension decreased and skinfold thickness, %FM, and weight of body fat increased in the control group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Resistance training with Thera-Band enhanced strength and muscle endurance in elderly women and a 4 -week detraining period had an adverse effect on muscle power. This suggests that a strength training program is an effective intervention to prevent functional reductions, and can contribute to improve neuromuscular function in older adults...|$|R

The calculated minimum and maximum form factor (a 3. 0) was 0. 0062 for A. punctata and 0. 0158 for B. lohachata, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first reference on KF, WR and a 3. 0 factors for these threatened species in Bangladesh. The results would be useful for sustainable management and conservation of the limited stocks in the Brahmaputra River ecosyste...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} biometrics of the Rhinomugil corsula (Hamilton, 1822) (R. corsula), including length-weight relationships (LWRs), condition factors (Allometric, KA; Fulton’s, KF; Relative, KR; Relative weight, WR), and {{sex ratio}} and length-frequency distributions in the Ganges (Padma River), Northwestern Bangladesh. Methods: Monthly sampling was conducted using traditional fishing gears during June to August 2012. Total length was measured {{to the nearest}} 0. 01 cm using digital slide <b>calipers,</b> and total <b>body</b> weight was measured using an electronic balance with 0. 01 g accuracy. The LWR was calculated using the expression: W= a×Lb, where the W is the body weight, L is the total length, a and b are {{the parameters of the}} regression. Results: A total of 350 specimens ranging from 8. 59 - 15. 71 cm in total length and 9. 57 - 32. 59 g in body weight were analyzed during this study. The overall sex ratio was not significantly different from the expected value of 1 : 1 (χ 2 = 2. 57, P> 0. 05), but there was significant difference in the length-frequency distributions between the sexes (P= 0. 03). The allometric coefficient b for the LWR indicated negative allometric growth (b≈ 3. 00) in males, female and combined sexes. Results further indicated that KF was not significantly different between the sexes (P= 0. 57). However, the mean WR of R. corsula showed significant differences from 100 for males (P= 0. 03) and females (P< 0. 001) in this study, indicating the imbalance habitat with food availability relative to the presence of predators. Conclusions: This study reported the first description of biometric relationships for R. corsula, which would be useful for the sustainable conservation of this rear fishery in Bangladesh and also neighboring countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} reports the first {{complete}} and inclusive description of some biological parameters including length-frequency distribution (LFD), sex ratio (SR), length-weight relationship (LWR), condition factors (allometric, KA; Fulton’s, KF; relative, KR and relative weight, WR) and form factor (a 3. 0) of Labeo boga in the Ganges River, northwestern Bangladesh. Sampling was conducted using traditional fishing gears during April 2011 to March 2012. For each specimen, total length (TL) was measured {{to the nearest}} 0. 01 cm using digital slide <b>calipers</b> and total <b>body</b> weight (BW) was measured using an electronic balance with 0. 01 g accuracy. The LWR was calculated using the expression: W= a Lb, where W is the BW and L is the TL. A total of 211 specimens ranging from 9. 78 - 27. 50 cm TL and 10. 00 to 276. 10 g BW were studied. BW of females {{was significantly higher than}} that of males (Mann-Whitney U-test, p> 0. 001). However the overall sex ratio did not differ significantly from the expected value of 1 : 1 (χ 2 = 0. 12, p< 0. 05). The calculated b for the LWR indicated isometric growth (» 3. 00) in males, females and combined gender and there were significant differences in the intercepts but not in the slopes between the sexes of L. boga in the Ganges River. KF of females was significantly higher than that for males (p< 0. 001). In addition, the Wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the WR did not differ from 100 for males and females in this study indicating good condition of habitat for L. boga. The results of this study would be an effective tool for fishery specialists to initiate early management strategies and regulations for the sustainable management of the remaining stocks of this species within the Padma River and surrounding ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{threatened}} Reba carp, Cirrhinus reba is a {{freshwater fish}} species found in ponds, rivers, canals and tanks of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan. The present study describes the first complete and inclusive description of life-history traits including sex ratio, length-frequency distributions (LFD), length-weight relationships (LWR), condition factors (Allometric, KA; Fulton’s, KF; Relative condition, KR; Relative weight, WR), form factor (a 3. 0) and size at first sexual maturity of C. reba in the Ganges River, NW Bangladesh. Sampling was done using traditional fishing gears including cast net, square lift net and conical trap from April 2011 to March 2012. The total length (TL), fork length (FL) and standard length (SL) were measured {{to the nearest}} 0. 01 cm using digital slide <b>calipers</b> and total <b>body</b> weight (BW) was measured using an electronic balance with 0. 01 g accuracy. The LWR was calculated using the expression: W= a Lb, where W is the BW, L the TL. The size at first sexual maturity of C. reba was estimated using the empirical equation by Binohlan and Froese (2009) for male and female, separately. A total of 250 specimens ranging from 8. 00 cm – 23. 40 cm TL and 4. 30 g – 200 g BW were analyzed in this study. The overall sex ratio {{did not differ significantly}} from the expected value of 1 : 1 (χ 2 = 3. 38, p 3. 00) in male and female and there was significant differences in the intercepts (ancova, p< 0. 001) and in the slopes (ancova, p< 0. 001) between the sexes. In addition, the Mann-Whitney U-test showed significant differences in the Fulton’s condition factor between male and female (p< 0. 001). The one sample t-test showed that the mean WR (actual mean = 99. 50) did not differ from 100 for male (p= 0. 523) and female (p= 0. 197) in this study, indicating the habitat was still in good condition for C. reba. Moreover, the size at sexual maturity of male and female C. reba were estimated as 11. 50 cm TL and 13. 50 cm TL, respectively. The results of this study would be useful for the sustainable conservation of this threatened carp fishery in Bangladesh and also neighboring countries...|$|R
