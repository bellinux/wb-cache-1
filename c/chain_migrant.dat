40|$|Abstract: The paper {{focuses on}} the {{structural}} analysis of migration flows. The assumption that migrants are a homogenous entity {{is replaced by a}} distinction between single <b>migrants</b> and <b>chain</b> <b>migrants.</b> The theoretical analysis is based on the solution of a differential equation describing the dynamic process of migration. The results of several simulations are depicted graphically. The results are crucially depending on the labor demand elasticity in the destination country, the intensity of thepush and the pull factors and the different levels of the subsistence minimum for single and <b>chain</b> <b>migrants.</b> The results may be useful for policy makers for predicting and steering the migration flows between countries. ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{friends and}} close {{relatives}} of the Cornelius settlers of 1837 arrived as <b>chain</b> <b>migrants</b> in the community beginning in 1840 (e.g., Briggs, Swan, Craigs, Moffitt), but the numbers were not large. They primarily came from Northumberland and the Borders with very few arriving from elsewhere in Great Britain. These later arrivals primarily settled on lots in the outer tiers of Harvey settlement.|$|R
40|$|It {{was only}} after World War II that the Netherlands became an {{immigrant}} country. The first groups came from (former) Dutch colonies, and were followed by labour migrants from Southern Europe, Turkey and Northern Africa. The next wave consisted of <b>chain</b> <b>migrants,</b> and recent influxes contain many refugees and asylum seekers. At the moment about 17 % of the inhabitants in the Netherlands were born {{in a foreign country}} or have at least one parent who is born there. As in most other immigrant countries the majority of these immigrants settle in the larger cities, especially in districts with a high proportion of non-Dutch inhabitants. An exception must be made for the relatively small group of Moluccans (from the former Dutch Indonesia) and for the recently arrived asylum seekers who hav...|$|R

40|$|How large {{should an}} {{immigrant}} community be {{to shed light}} effectively on the wider immigrant experience? This is a subject of frequent debate. Here is an excellent study of immigration to the American Midwest based on a single person, a Dutch farmer, Ulbe Eringa. And {{for the better part}} of the book, Eringa himself speaks through memoir and letter, translated from the Dutch by a daughter. The narration and reproduced texts recreate Eringa 2 ̆ 7 s life story. It begins with his birth in 1866 to a dairy farming family in western Friesland and continues through his early formative years in Calvinist schools and his pitiful teenaged years as an orphaned servant. In 1892, at twenty-six, he migrated to the United States, joining the Dutch farm community of Sioux County, Iowa. Within a year he moved on to better fortune in Bon Homme County, Dakota. Here in 1899 he and his wife, Maaike Rypstra, a fellow lower-class Frisian, became land owners. They also became central players in the community, assisting Frisian <b>chain</b> <b>migrants</b> and supporting the local Dutch Reformed church. Over the next thirty years the Eringas raised six children, increased their land holdings to 640 acres, secured a college education for several of their daughters, and passed the farm on to their only son, Pier. In 1926 the Eringas returned to Iowa to settle in a town, and here in 1949 Ulbe wrote his last known letter. He died a year later...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{research}} agenda for future studies of local forms of caregiving. It does this by exploring practices of care giving and receipt through the prism of childcare. Focusing on Nairobi, it investigates one critical form of care work in the city: the labour of women who work as ‘nannies’ in private homes, a form of labour that has received little systematic study or scholarly attention. Every day, women in Nairobi construct complex and far-ranging care chains that ensure that the socially necessary labour of childcare takes place. The phenomenon of ‘diverted mothering’ that has been associated with the globalisation of care can also be understood as a local phenomenon. Whereas global care <b>chains</b> involving <b>migrant</b> domestic workers have been the focus of detailed investigation, hitherto the workings of more widespread and highly fragile local care chains in the cities of the third world have been neglected. We argue that it is critical to understand practices of intimate and emotional labour in the context not just of global migration but in situations of severe intersecting inequalities (economic, social and racial) within the global south...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{migrants}} {{choose to}} leave rural communities {{out of the}} desire to pursue greater economic opportunity in urban areas. Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the Harris-Todaro Model, migration to urban areas will continue as long as [...] "expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product" [...] (127). [...] However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level. This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as overurbanization. Since the industrialization of agriculture, mechanization has {{reduced the number of}} jobs present in rural communities. Some scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor. At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates. The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as <b>chain</b> migration, <b>migrant</b> networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.|$|R
40|$|CARIM-East: Creating an Observatory of Migration East of EuropeThis paper summarises the {{findings}} of country studies on the main economic and demographic effects of labour migration in the EU Eastern partners and Russia. The major positive effect of labour migration in the sending countries is that it provides temporary relief on domestic labour markets and helps reduce unemployment, particularly in economically-deprived areas. An inflow of labour migrants from other countries helps address existing skill shortages and finance pay-as-you-go pension schemes that are coming under considerable pressure because of population ageing. But the boost to pensions is small because of the widespread informal employment of migrants. Demographers of the sending countries worry that large-scale outflows of native workers which significantly exceed inflows of workers from other countries depletes population and changes its age structure. This, of course, is particularly dangerous for ageing societies. Findings on the economic effects of migration through the return of skilled workers are mixed and remain largely conjectural. Overall, labour migration contributes to the economic development of countries {{at both ends of}} the migration spectrum to a lesser extent than it should. This may be attributed to the fact that there are still no enabling conditions for effective brain circulation, productive investments and supply <b>chain</b> relations among <b>migrants</b> in the observed countries. CARIM-East is co-financed by the European University Institute and the European Union...|$|R
40|$|In the European Union asylum and {{migration}} policy, the expressions “exclusion” and “externalization” are often used and encountered because the EU transfers the responsibility of migration control to non-EU states through readmission agreements. The EU {{does not have the}} capacity to receive all migrants, refugees and asylum seekers that seek protection in Europe, hence the agreements are constituted between the EU and other countries outside the EU on the basis of returning nationals and third country nationals who have been denied asylum. The purpose of this thesis is to explore how and to what extent are human rights embedded in the readmission agreements and in the materials that constitute the basis for the decision to enter into readmission agreements. This thesis also tends to analyze if and on what basis the readmission agreements pose potential consequences for asylum seekers, refugees and migrants. In order to answer the posed research questions, I have used a qualitative research method of case study and text analysis. I have used a theoretical framework of externalization and studied the cases of the EU-Ukraine agreement and the EU-Pakistan agreement. Today, the EU cannot guarantee the safety individuals that are being returned to either Ukraine or Pakistan, because both Ukraine and Pakistan lack functional human rights institutions and cannot practice what human rights instruments ordain because they lack the capacity to do so. The EU’s failing of safe returns for asylum seekers, refugees and migrants has consequently created situations of orbit and <b>chain</b> refoulment where <b>migrants,</b> refugees and asylum seekers risks being returned to their country of origin or passed around between countries...|$|R
40|$|Here is an {{important}} study that joins {{the growing number of}} histories of rural American women. Its strengths are many. First, it uncovers the complex and multi-layered worlds of German-speaking immigrants; Linda Schelbitzki Pickle, a professor of German and Foreign Languages, uses her linguistic dexterity to unveil a rich cache of German-language diaries, letters, and memoirs, delivering it to North American readers in finely-crafted English narrative. The work is also remarkably sensitive to German immigrant diversity; although the immigrant groups hail from five Midwest states-Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska-they represent both Dreisziger Germans and 2 ̆ 2 Germans from Russia, 2 ̆ 2 religious and communist groups, liturgical and sectarian church members, individualistic and communitarian settlers, and <b>chain</b> and group <b>migrants.</b> An even more important aspect of the book is its detailed and empathetic biographical reconstruction of dozens of believable flesh and blood German-language women. Pickle 2 ̆ 7 s locating them in the hidden worlds of family and household, the informal social networks of the ethnic community, and the limited public roles as medical Braeucher and marriage Fuersprecher brings fresh detail to the study of immigrant women. The book, however, is more than simple narrative; it pursues the controversial argument that these women were 2 ̆ 2 contented among strangers. 2 ̆ 2 This contentedness was a mental state not rooted in equality. Indeed, the author is insistent that overarching the culturally diverse 2 ̆ 2 Germans 2 ̆ 2 was a conservative, self-denying patriarchal household that provided women with little opportunity in the public sphere and, as dozens of proverbial sayings indicate, dubious cultural status. However discriminatory this might be, the author argues, women found the arrangement to their advantage. They were like the author 2 ̆ 7 s own grandparents who are introduced early in the book as exhibiting both 2 ̆ 2 the separation of [gendered] spheres 2 ̆ 2 and an 2 ̆ 2 essentially harmonious life together. 2 ̆ 2 Women worked in 2 ̆ 2 private worlds 2 ̆ 2 where they performed important direct and indirect economic roles and made crucial 2 ̆ 2 contributions 2 ̆ 2 to frontier life. Then, too, because the domestic sphere was 2 ̆ 2 shielded 2 ̆ 2 from assimilative pressures and became the 2 ̆ 2 core 2 ̆ 2 of German self-identification, these women assumed central roles as the custodians of German ethnicity; they preserved the language, maintained German food ways, and told the stories of Pelznickel and, no doubt, the gentle terror of the Polterabend. In the end, the conservative nature of both household and community prevented 2 ̆ 2 cultural alienation, 2 ̆ 2 the bane of frontier experience. This approach is sure to raise debate. Most problematic will be the appearance of the author 2 ̆ 7 s having privileged ethnic persistence over gender equality. Some readers will wonder whether Pickle 2 ̆ 7 s clear intention of demonstrating a German presence in the Midwest and drawing 2 ̆ 2 common patterns 2 ̆ 2 of German experience has overshadowed the book 2 ̆ 7 s approach to gender. Some will be disappointed that quantitative data are used to mark ethnic and linguistic patterns rather than document fertility, marriage, and life-cycle events that could have served to bolster the author 2 ̆ 7 s thesis. Then, too, the very theme of 2 ̆ 2 contentedness 2 ̆ 2 will be controversial: where most recent scholars have dwelt on themes of gender construction and symbols of resistance, Pickle has set out on the difficult path of documenting 2 ̆ 2 how a woman felt about her life in America 2 ̆ 2 : women in this text are happy, resilient, contented, uncomplaining, and cheerful, or striving to be. The idea that 2 ̆ 2 contentedness 2 ̆ 2 was worth the 2 ̆ 2 cultural conservatism in gender relations 2 ̆ 2 may not sit well with feminist historians. This should not detract from the book 2 ̆ 7 s importance. The complex and diverse life worlds of German-speaking women as presented here will add to the growing knowledge of immigrant women 2 ̆ 7 s experience. The documentation of the domestic side of frontier life will be a welcome addition to the growing works within the category of the 2 ̆ 2 New Western History. 2 ̆...|$|R
