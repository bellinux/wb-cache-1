40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} semi-batch operation of tray tunnels for food deep chilling is presented and analyzed. Design aspects are discussed involving both single tunnels and systems of parallel tunnels. In both cases, optimum flowsheet configuration and operating conditions are sought and verified by appropriate formulation of design and optimization strategies. The optimization objective is the total annual cost of the plant, subject to constraints imposed by {{the operation of the}} <b>chilling</b> <b>tunnel,</b> thermodynamics and construction. The decision variables were the number of trucks, the operating temperature and flowrate of the cooling air stream, the refrigeration cycle heat exchanger temperature, as well as the total number of sections involved. The Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) nature of the design problem required mathematical programming techniques for its solution. The optimization was carried out {{for a wide range of}} production capacities, and the optimal points, where a new truck or a new section is introduced, were evaluated. The analysis focused on the design of tray tunnels for the most popular food product treated by deep chilling meat slabs. A characteristic case study is presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Strawberry (Fragaria ananasa) is a {{berry fruit}} {{belonging}} to the family Rosaceae and requires certain amount of cold temperature to initiate flowering. Present {{study was conducted with}} the objective to study flowering and fruiting responses of strawberry to growth hormone and <b>chilling</b> under <b>tunnel</b> conditions. The study comprised of six different treatments as; control, GA 3 (gibberellic acid) 200 ppm, GA 3 400 ppm, chilling at 4 째C, chilling at 4 째C + GA 3 200 ppm and chilling at 4 째C + GA 3 400 ppm. Treatments were applied at vegetative stage before flowering. It was inferred from the study that strawberry plants responded much better to application of GA 3 at 400 ppm for their growth, flower stimulation, their number, quality features while chilling at 4 째C proved better for maximum fruit production and better quality under tunnel condition...|$|R
