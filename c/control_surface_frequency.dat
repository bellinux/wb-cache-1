40|$|A {{miniature}} hydraulic {{actuation system}} capable of converting linear actuator motion to <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> rotary motion {{has been designed}} for application to active controls on dynamic wind tunnel models. Due to space constraints and the torque requirements of an oscillating <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> at <b>frequencies</b> up to 50 Hertz, a new actuation system {{was developed to meet}} research objectives. This new actuation system was designed and developed to overcome the output torque limitations and fluid loss/sealing difficulties associated with an existing vane type actuator. Static <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> deflections and dynamic <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> oscillations through a given angle are provided by the actuation system. The actuator design has been incorporated into a transonic flutter model with an active trailing edge flap and two active spoilers. The model is scheduled for testing in the LaRC 16 Foot Transonic Dynamics Tunnel during Summer 1993. This paper will discuss the actuation system, its design, development difficulties, test results, and application to aerospace vehicles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to reduce the drag of a {{simplified}} car geometry using surface dielectric barrier discharge actuators. Experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel for a low Reynolds number (6. 7. 105) with the Ahmed body reference (rear slant angle of 25 °, zero yaw angle). The effect of steady and unsteady actuation on the flow topology was investigated carrying out 2 C-PIV and 1 D hot wire measurements. The efficiency of the actuators was characterised by stationary balance measurements. Drag reductions up to 8 % were obtained by suppressing the separation bubble above the rear window. The results suggest that plasma actuators are simple to implement on a model and can provide useful information for automotive aerodynamics through parametric studies with parameters relevant for flow <b>control</b> (position, <b>surface,</b> <b>frequency</b> and duty cycle of the pulsed actuation) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{experimental}} {{techniques and}} empirical {{data to support}} the notion that morphologically complex words are represented in terms of their individual morphemes in lexical memory. Two experiments are conducted to investigate this. The first experiment uses a semantic priming technique to investigate how semantic associations attached to specific derivational suffixes could indicate a meaning-based organisation of bound morphemes in memory. Whilst the results from Experiment One do imply a meaning based organisation for bound morphemes, there is also a possibility that this could be influenced by the <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> of transparent suffixed words. The second experiment therefore <b>controls</b> for <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> looking at semantically transparent words only. This rules out the possibility of participants either consciously or unconsciously using <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> as a means of identifying the word. Findings from Experiment Two show that high frequency stems elicit a faster response time than low frequency stems in suffixed words. This supports the notion of morphological decomposition. Overall, both experiments {{support the notion that}} bound morphemes are stored separately to whole words in memory, prior to lexical access. The implications of the two experiments are discussed in Section 6. 1 with regards to what they mean for the bigger picture of morphological decomposition and the internal representation of affixes...|$|R

The data was acquired during the ASE wind-tunnel {{test of the}} HiLDA (High Lift-to-Drag Active) Wing model, tested in the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) in late 2004. Two time-domain system identification techniques are applied {{to the development of}} the ASE analytical models: impulse response (IR) method and the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) method. Using measured <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inputs (<b>frequency</b> sweeps) and associated sensor responses, the IR method is used to extract corresponding input/output impulse response pairs. These impulse responses are then transformed into state-space models for use in ASE analyses. Similarly, the GPC method transforms measured random <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inputs and associated sensor responses into an AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (ARX) model. The ARX model is then used to develop the gust load alleviation (GLA) control law. For the IR method, comparison of measured with simulated responses are presented to investigate the accuracy of the ASE analytical models developed. For the GPC method, comparison of simulated open-loop and closed-loop (GLA) time histories are presented...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{tested the}} {{predictions}} of models of word reading development as {{to the effects of}} repeated exposure on reading of derived words. Aim: Our goal was to examine the impacts of variables that quantify different aspects of this exposure: base frequency, family frequency, and family size. Methods and Samples: In Experiment 1, we asked 75 children in Grades 3 and 5 to read derived words with low <b>surface</b> <b>frequencies</b> (e. g., questionable) that varied in base frequency, family frequency, and family size. In Experiment 2, we asked 41 adults to read the same set of words. Results: In Experiment 1, only base frequency made a contribution to word reading accuracy that was independent of the other two variables of interest (family size and family frequency) and the <b>control</b> variables (<b>surface</b> <b>frequency,</b> semantic relatedness, and neighborhood size). In Experiment 2, a similar pattern of results emerged, this time on reading speed. Conclusion: Together, results of these two studies suggest that base frequency has a special role in both children’s and adults’ reading of derived words. These findings suggest that it plays a specific role in development and maintenance of sensitivity to morphological structure in reading...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} three experiments which {{examine the}} effect of lexical <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> on sentence processing and the interaction between <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> and syntactic prediction. The first two experiments make use of the self-paced reading paradigm to show that processing time differences due to <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> (e. g., the frequency of cats not including occurrences of cat), which have previously been demonstrated in isolated word tasks like lexical decision, also give rise to reaction time differences in sentence processing tasks, in this case for singular and plural English nouns. The second experiment investigates whether a prediction for the number morpheme triggered by the number-marked determiners this and these might counter the <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> effect; however, the small size of the <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> effect and baseline differences in reaction times to this and these made the results unclear. Results from a third experiment using lexical decision suggest that the difference {{in the size of the}} <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> effects between the lexical decision experiments and the selfpaced-reading experiments are likely due to differences in task demands. Our results have methodological implications for psycholinguistic experiments that manipulate morphology as a means of examining other questions of interest...|$|R

2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> than the center of pressure of the <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The position of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on its axis will change until the torque from the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R

The wind tunnel test provided an opportunity to study aeroelastic system behavior under combined <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> deflections, testing for <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> interaction effects. <b>Control</b> <b>surface</b> interactions were observed in both static <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> actuation testing and dynamic <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> oscillation testing.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step. The methodology is applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle elevator <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> model which includes aerother-moelastic effects and is attached to a single degree of freedom oscillator representing the fuselage. Results show that <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial effects lead to a departure of the in-stantaneous <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> lift force by up to a factor of eight with respect to the static value.

40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the word {{recognition}} process for low-frequency morphologically complex words. One goal {{of the study was}} to replicate and expand upon findings suggesting facilitative effects of morphological relatives of a target word. A second goal was to demonstrate the need for a reinterpretation of root and <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> effects, which traditionally have been taken as indicators of parsing-based and memory-driven processing, respectively. In a first study, we used the same stimuli across auditory and visual lexical decision and naming. Mixed-effects statistical modeling revealed that <b>surface</b> <b>frequency</b> was a robust predictor of RTs even in the very low end of the distribution, but root frequency was not. Also, the nature of the similarity between a target and its lexical competitors is crucial. Measures gauging the influence of morphological relatives of the target were facilitative, while measures gauging the influence of words related only in form were inhibitory. A second study analysing data from the English Lexicon Project, for a large sample of words from across the full frequency range, supports these conclusions.
