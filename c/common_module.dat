40|$|Modern {{accelerator}} control systems adopt {{a wide variety}} of intelligent controllers to interface front-end computers with active components of the accelerator. Recently, some of the intelligent controllers come equipped with an Ethernet interface, giving an opportunity to use a network as a kind of field busses. However, developing device drivers for the use of such controllers is a complex and time-consuming process in most cases. It is essential to have the drivers share as much of their codes as possible while leaving flexibility to adapt to various proprietary communication protocols. We developed a set of device/driver support modules for the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) to support several network-based intelligent controllers, such as Program-able Logic Controllers (PLCs) and Device Interface Modules (DIMs). The software consists of a <b>common</b> driver <b>module,</b> a <b>common</b> device support <b>module,</b> and a device-specific module for each of the devices to be supported. The <b>common</b> driver <b>module</b> encapsulates the details of the programming for communication over the network. The <b>common</b> device support <b>module</b> encapsulates the details of the framework of EPICS for asynchronous I/O transactions. We decided to implement the <b>common</b> <b>modules</b> in such a manner that the device specific modules can be implemented by using only standard UNIX libraries. As a result, {{it turned out that the}} developed device-specific modules were compliant with both EPICS 3. 13 on VxWorks and 3. 14 on Linux...|$|R

50|$|Charles Thomas Elliott (known as Tom Elliott), FRS, CBE, is {{a leading}} {{scientist}} {{in the fields of}} narrow gap semiconductor and infrared detector research. Hailing from county Durham, after gaining his Ph.D., he worked at the University of Manchester before joining RRE in Malvern, Worcestershire in the late 1960s. In the 1970s he invented the SPRITE detector (Signal PRocessing In The Element) which was also known as the TED (Tom Elliott's Detector). This was a photoconductor device in which the infrared scene was scanned across the detector (made from HgCdTe) {{at the same rate as}} the carriers drifted under an applied controlled constant bias current. This device decame part of TICM - the standard UK thermal imaging <b>common</b> <b>module</b> used since the 1980s by UK armed forces. Tom Elliott received a Rank Prize in 1982 for this work and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1988.|$|E

40|$|FIR {{filters are}} vastly used in {{multi-mode}} systems where {{the behavior of}} the system changes based on user inputs or changes in the operational environment. FIR filters used for each mode of operation have different sets of parameters (coefficient sets). Partially reconfigurable FPGA platforms are shown to be viable choices to implement multi-mode filters. Joint optimization of the filters generates filters with <b>common</b> <b>modules</b> to reduce reconfiguration overhead. At physical design level, these <b>common</b> <b>modules</b> should be mapped to physical locations on the chip called Partially Reconfigurable Regions (PRRs). Furthermore depending on the availability of DSP blocks, we can implement some of these modules using DSP blocks. In this work we study the problem of reconfigurable module mapping to minimize the reconfigurable area of the filter while fully exploiting module reuse and available DSP blocks. We show that the decision problem is NPcomplete and propose an ILP formulation and a heuristic to reduce the area. Our experiments show that the quality of the results of our heuristic is within 1 % of the optimal result. Furthermore the results show the importance of area minimization to reduce the overall reconfiguration overhead. i...|$|R
