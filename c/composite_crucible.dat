40|$|For a rapid {{preparation}} of solutions intended for analysis by {{inductively coupled plasma}} emission spectrometry or atomic absorption spectrometry, an automatic device called Plasmasol was developed. This apparatus used the property of nonwettability of glassy C to fuse the sample in an appropriate flux. The sample-flux mixture is placed in a <b>composite</b> <b>crucible,</b> then heated at high temperature, swirled until full dissolution is achieved, and then poured into a water-filled beaker. After acid addition, dissolution of the melt, and filling to the mark, the solution is ready for analysis. The analytical results obtained, either for oxide samples or for prereduced iron ores show that the solutions prepared with this device are undistinguished from those obtained by manual dissolutions done by acid digestion or by high temperature fusion. Preparation reproducibility and analytical tests illustrate the performance of Plasmasol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cordierite–mullite <b>composite</b> <b>crucibles</b> were {{prepared}} via high-temperature solid-state process by using burn talc, datong soil, knar clay, bentonite, quartz, feldspar and alumina as raw materials, waste porcelain powder as skeletal material. The main influencing {{factors such as}} the raw materials radio and calcination temperature were discussed. The microstructure of the sintered sample was analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the optimal prescription was sample II (13. 34 wt % of burn talc, 10. 496 wt % datong soil, 40. 65 % knar clay, 15. 00 wt % waste porcelain powder, 10. 34 wt % bentonite, 2. 17 wt % feldspar, 1. 61 wt % quartz, and 6. 394 wt % of alumina). The optimal sintered temperature was 1380 ℃ and the holding time was 3 hours...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Carbon-bonded silicon carbide and clay-bonded graphite crucibles are used in non-ferrous induction melting furnaces. Silicon carbide crucibles especially have encountered premature failure when used at high power densities and operating frequencies. This {{is thought to be}} related to their non-uniform properties. To gain a more thorough understanding of the problem, an equivalent circuit analysis has been applied to the <b>composite</b> load of <b>crucible</b> and metal charge. [Continues. ...|$|R
40|$|Bath {{smelting}} {{has recently}} {{been the focus of}} several large research and development programs investigating alternative ironmaking processes. Fundamental studies have contributed to the understanding of smeltingreduction processes however these have not been entirely applicable to the smelting of composite pellets. Recently, bath smelting has also been evaluated for its potential for processing metallurgical wastes, the driving force being to develop suitable alternatives to traditional disposal methods such as dumping in landfills; one such technology is the EnvlRONment process. In general, many pyrometallurgical waste processes have been developed but few have been commercialised successfully. It is evident many processes have suffered economically because of poor understanding and control of process fundamentals. Although the EnvlRONment process, which smelts composite organic and ferrous waste pellets in a single vessel reactor, had been developed to the pilot plant stage, the mechanisms of smelting-reduction were not fully understood. Pilot plant trials highlighted critical aspects of the process but did not provide sufficient information to quantify process fundamentals, clearly further investigation was warranted. Smelting, Xray, and thermogravimetric experiments provided foundation for an in-depth study of reaction kinetics and mechanisms, while also allowing other relevant issues of waste processing, using bath smelting technology, to be addressed. Supporting the experimental investigations an extensive heat transfer model was developed which was used to predict temperature profiles and smelting times. The bath smelting reactor was modelled in 2 distinct stages, a falling gas region and an in-slag smelting region, heating was determined to be controlled by internal resistance. The general smelting behaviour of composite pellets was observed during pilot plant and laboratory trials. Smelting of composite pellets, as performed in the EnvlRONment process, was simulated in the laboratory by smelting <b>composite</b> pellets in <b>crucibles</b> containing slag at 1500 °C; to allow for accurate experimental interpretation, and to increase the degree of experimental control, process pellets were replicated by surrogate laboratory pellets with a simplified number of components. Cellulose was trialled as a surrogate component for organic waste. Further experiments were performed using Xray fluoroscopy and radiography techniques to observe the progress of the smelting-reduction reactions in slag at 1500 °C. Examination of the smelting reaction with the Xray techniques also allowed observation of the effect of composite smelting on slag foaming. The kinetics and mechanisms of reduction of composite pellets was investigated using non-isothermal thermogravimetric techniques to 1200 °C. Thermal analysis via this route was selected because the experimental techniques are the most suited means to investigate temperature dependant phenomena of self-reducing systems. Smelting experiments provided significant fundamental information relevant to an understanding of smelting reactions in composite smelting. Analysis and interpretation of the experiments corroborated with the heat transfer model predictions, which was used together with the thermogravimetric results to clearly identify reaction mechanisms and explain other process phenomena. Key process reactions in composite smelting were identified as: - thermal decomposition of volatiles - direct reduction and carburisation of iron - pellet ablation through melting and dissolution - reduction of dissolved oxides in slag. Predicted temperature profiles within the composite pellets suggest that much of the volatile matter is lost during the falling gas region by thermal decomposition. For the surrogate pellets containing cellulose upto 7 8 % of the volatile matter is lost during the falling gas region. The heat transfer model predicted sensible melting times, for a 1. 5 cm diameter pellet a melting time of 92 s was predicted, similar times were observed in smelting trials. An important finding of the heat transfer work was that although the in-slag smelting stage was based on a fully submerged object experimental observations show that an immersion crust does not form on the pellet during its initial contact with the slag bath, and that the composite pellet is not submerged during smelting. Thermogravimetry revealed the complexity of internal reduction in iron oxidecarbon systems when high and low volatility carbon sources contribute towards reduction. The contribution to reduction from the high volatility carbon being influenced by heating rate and the presence of secondary non-volatile material, measured charring levels for cellulose varied between 13 and 2 2 %. The main steps in the thermogravimetric reaction profiles were attributed to thermal decomposition of cellulose between 280 and 320 °C and stepwise reduction of hematite above 550 °C. The dominant reduction mechanism in composite bath smelting was identified as internal reduction within the pellet. Approximately 9 0 % of the total reduction occurs within the pellet, the extent of which is sufficient that much of the iron is also carburised before pellet ablation is complete. The other significant finding of the study was that slag foaming was shown not to be a critical issue for process control of composite smelting...|$|R
