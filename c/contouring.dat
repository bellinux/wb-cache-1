5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, <b>contouring</b> areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area {{from the perspective of}} a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's stealth <b>contouring</b> and radar absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's claim of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|An abdominoplasty can be {{combined}} with liposuction to make a Lipotuck, which performs body <b>contouring</b> around the hips, thighs, and buttocks.|$|E
25|$|In the 70's, geomodelling mainly {{consisted}} of automatic 2D cartographic {{techniques such as}} <b>contouring,</b> implemented as FORTRAN routines communicating directly with plotting hardware. The advent of workstations with 3D graphics capabilities during the 80's {{gave birth to a}} new generation of geomodelling software with graphical user interface which became mature during the 90's.|$|E
25|$|Body <b>contouring</b> is {{a general}} term that refers to various plastic {{surgeries}} performed to {{different parts of the}} body with the aim of improving the shape and tone of the underlying tissue that supports fat. It is a common procedure performed for people who have undergone major weight loss. It may be performed in both men and women.|$|E
25|$|Zaishō’s career {{spanned the}} late Edo (1603-1867) and early Meiji (1868-1912) periods, {{a time of}} great change within Japan {{as a result of its}} 1854 opening to the West. The Hara School was aligned with the Maruyama School of painters, a {{movement}} founded in the late 18th century associated with western-influenced tendencies such as objective realism, unified perspective, shading and <b>contouring.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Wythop Mill is nearby to the north. From here the road can be {{followed}} {{up the narrow}} wooded valley between Ling and Sale Fell. Half a mile up, a good path breaks right onto the slopes of Ling Fell. After taking a <b>contouring</b> course around the northern flanks of the fell a direct line {{can be taken to}} the summit.|$|E
25|$|Great Dodd {{may also}} be {{included}} in a circular walk around Deepdale known as The Dodds. Or it may {{be included in a}} ridge walk, along the main Helvellyn ridge. The ridge path in either direction is broad and clear, with a shortcut <b>contouring</b> to the west of Great Dodd's summit which suggests that many ridge walkers bypass the summit.|$|E
25|$|An {{extended}} abdominoplasty is {{a complete}} abdominoplasty plus a lateral thigh lift. The resulting scar runs from the posterior axillary line (when placing your open hands on your hips, the thumbs lie along the posterior axillary line.) The operation does all of the abdominal <b>contouring</b> of a complete abdominoplasty and allows further improvement of the flank (waist), as well as smoothing the contour of the upper lateral thigh.|$|E
25|$|Stone Arthur can be climbed {{directly}} up {{the steep}} ridge from the village, although the depth of bracken combined with the gradient do not make the prospect particularly alluring. The summit can also be reached from {{either side of the}} ridge. Beginning at Mill Bridge, Tongue Gill can be followed until the footbridge, before making a pathless ascent on grass. From Grasmere, Greenhead Gill also provides access, climbing until a <b>contouring</b> traverse to the summit can be made.|$|E
25|$|Middle Dodd {{is rarely}} climbed {{for its own}} sake, being merely {{a stop on the}} road to Red Screes. The nose of the fell {{provides}} the obvious route, starting from either Kirkstonefoot or Cow Bridge. This is unremittingly steep, but even harsher gradients can be found by making a pathless ascent from Red Pit on the Kirkstone road. A direct route <b>contouring</b> from Scandale Pass is also possible, but most would proceed via Red Screes from this point.|$|E
25|$|Citation Longitude (Model 700) - The {{project was}} {{announced}} in May 2012. It was perceived as the follow-on development to the now-canceled Citation Columbus. Its fuselage cross-section (83.25 inch circular section) is from the Citation Latitude. Cessna projected that first delivery would occur in late 2017. The aircraft will have a T-tail empennage, area-rule fuselage <b>contouring,</b> and 28.6° wing sweep. Powered by two Honeywell HTF7700L turbofan engines, rated at 7,550 lb (33.58 kN) thrust. The wings will incorporate moderate winglets. Construction will be aluminum for both wing and fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} liposuction {{technology}} facilitated medical {{applications of the}} liposuction-harvested fat tissue as autologous filler for injection to correct bodily defects, and for breast augmentation. Melvin Bircoll introduced the practice of <b>contouring</b> the breast and for correcting bodily defects with autologous fat grafts harvested by liposuction; and he presented the fat-injection method used for emplacing the fat grafts. In 1987 the Venezuelan plastic surgeon Eduardo Krulig emplaced fat grafts with a syringe and blunt needle (lipo-injection), and later used a disposable fat trap to facilitate the collection and to ensure the sterility of the harvested adipocyte tissue.|$|E
25|$|These orientations {{of lines}} and planes at various scales can be plotted using {{the methods of}} the Visualization of lines and planes section above. As in crystallography, planes are {{typically}} plotted by their poles. Unlike crystallography, the southern hemisphere is used instead of the northern one (because the geological features in question lie below the Earth's surface). In this context the stereographic projection {{is often referred to}} as the equal-angle lower-hemisphere projection. The equal-area lower-hemisphere projection defined by the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection is also used, especially when the plot is to be subjected to subsequent statistical analysis such as density <b>contouring.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} common types of {{contoured}} main deck ULDs, that are contoured (curved {{to fit in}} the plane's body) to provide as much cargo volume as possible. Initially ULD <b>contouring</b> was simply a triangle removed from one or two corners of {{the profile of the}} ULD, such as the common LD3 and LD6. Main deck ULDs use curves for the contoured shape to truly maximize cargo volume. Upper deck ULDs are just like lower deck ULDs that are either the full width of the plane with two corners of the profile removed (lower deck LD6 lower), or that container is cut in half, down the center line of the plane, (lower deck LD3 and upper deck AAX).|$|E
25|$|Early {{completely}} artificial canals, across fairly flat countryside, {{would get}} round {{a small hill}} or depression by simply detouring (<b>contouring)</b> around it. As engineers became more ambitious {{in the types of}} country they felt they could overcome, locks became essential to effect the necessary changes in water level without detours that would be completely uneconomic both in building costs and journey time. Later still, as construction techniques improved, engineers became more willing to cut directly through and across obstacles by constructing long tunnels, cuttings, aqueducts or embankments, or to construct even more technical devices such as inclined planes or boat lifts. However, locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions, and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways.|$|E
25|$|The {{breasts were}} {{contoured}} by layering the fat grafts into different levels within the breast, until achieving the desired breast form. The fat-graft injection technique allows the plastic surgeon precise control in accurately <b>contouring</b> the breastfrom the chest {{wall to the}} breast-skin envelopewith subcutaneous fat grafts to the superficial planes of the breast. This greater degree of breast sculpting is unlike the global augmentation realised with a breast implant emplaced below the breast or below the pectoralis major muscle, respectively expanding the retromammary space and the retropectoral space. The greatest proportion of the grafted fat usually is infiltrated to the pectoralis major muscle, then to the retropectoral space, and to the prepectoral space, (before and behind the pectoralis major muscle). Moreover, although fat grafting to the breast parenchyma usually is minimal, it is performed to increase the degree of projection of the bust.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{aforementioned}} descriptions {{are of the}} incisions used to address the breast skin envelope, the surgical management of the breast tissue (parenchyma) is a separate consideration, including maintenance of the neurovascular integrity of the nipple-areola complex. The degree of hemispheric elevation of the nipple-areola complex determines the type of pedicle (superior, inferior, medial) that will provide the best venous and arterial vascular supply to the nipple-areola complex. Therefore, {{the application of the}} superior pedicle approach affords the surgeon greater procedural flexibility in determining the incision site for emplacing the breast implant, but it limits the possible degree of elevation of the nipple. Application of the inferior pedicle approach affords a greater degree of nipple-areola complex elevation, but makes difficult emplacing the breast implant, and the subsequent <b>contouring</b> of the breast. Application of the medial pedicle approach preserves breast sensation with a reliable venous and arterial vascular supply, and avoids the technical and procedural limitations of the superior pedicle and the inferior pedicle approaches.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} room (OR) {{time required to}} harvest, refine, and emplace fat to the breasts {{is greater than the}} usual 2-hour OR time; the usual infiltration time was approximately 2-hours for the first 100cm3 volume, and approximately 45 minutes for injecting each additional 100cm3 volume of breast-filler fat. The technique for injecting fat grafts for breast augmentation allows the plastic surgeon great control in sculpting the breasts to the required contour, especially in the correction of tuberous breast deformity. In which case, no fat-graft is emplaced beneath the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the skin envelope of the breast is selectively expanded (contoured) with subcutaneously emplaced body-fat, immediately beneath the skin. Such controlled <b>contouring</b> selectively increased the proportional volume of the breast in relation {{to the size of the}} nipple-areola complex, and thus created a breast of natural form and appearance; greater verisimilitude than is achieved solely with breast implants. The fat-corrected, breast-implant deformities, were inadequate soft-tissue coverage of the implant(s) and capsular contracture, achieved with subcutaneous fat-grafts that hid the implant-device edges and wrinkles, and decreased the palpability of the underlying breast implant. Furthermore, grafting autologous fat around the breast implant can result in softening the breast capsule.|$|E
25|$|Beinn a’ Chroin is {{surrounded}} by four other Munros which lie round the head waters of the River Falloch, {{to the north and}} east lies Cruach Ardrain and Beinn Tulaichean which can be reached by an arduous journey <b>contouring</b> round Coire Earb and climbing the subsidiary top of Stob Glas. The other two Munros, An Caisteal and Beinn Chabhair can be attained by following the west ridge down to the Beallach Buidhe from here the continuation to An Caisteal is up steep slopes to the north west. To reach Beinn Chabhair there is further descending to the west to reach an unnamed col (609 metres) before ascending to the summit. The impressive Coire Earb stands {{on the north side of}} the mountain, this corrie gives fine examples of boulder fields and moraine as a result of glacial action from the last Ice age. The smaller Coire a’ Chroin lies on the upper southern slopes and contains the small Lochan a’ Chroin. Drainage from the mountain reaches both coasts of Scotland with the River Falloch going west from Coire Earb to the Firth of Clyde while all other rainfall goes east to the Firth of Forth.|$|E
500|$|Engineers Country Club {{was founded}} in 1917 {{by a group of}} {{engineers}} from Manhattan. [...] The club features a bold course with titanic undulating green complexes and wide hole corridors built on terrain that at times slashes upward or cascades sharply downward to greens protected by dramatic bunkers. [...] Within those features are subtle touches that only those familiar with the course recognize: the well-placed roll in the fairway or the slight green <b>contouring</b> that sends putts in directions that seemingly defy the law of gravity.|$|E
500|$|The County Museum {{contains}} many Roman artefacts. The Romans built an aqueduct {{to supply the}} town with water. It was rediscovered in 1900 as {{the remains of a}} channel cut into the chalk and <b>contouring</b> round the hills. The source {{is believed to be the}} River Frome at Notton, about [...] upstream from Dorchester. Near the town centre is Maumbury Rings, an ancient British henge earthwork converted by the Romans for use as an amphitheatre, and to the north west is Poundbury Hill, another pre-Roman fortification.|$|E

2500|$|Imbabura is most {{frequently}} climbed {{from the town}} of La Esperanza or where the road ends about 4km above it in the village of Chirihuasi. From Chirihuasi, the altitude gain is approximately [...] The route follows a ridge and reaches the false northern summit before <b>contouring</b> around the crater to the true summit.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can also}} be {{combined}} with liposuction <b>contouring,</b> breast reduction, breast lift, or occasionally hysterectomy, depending on {{the reason for the}} hysterectomy. A popular name for breast enhancement procedures performed in conjunction with an abdominoplasty is a [...] "mommy makeover". Recent literature in MEDLINE also has noted implementation of barbed suture in these procedures.|$|E
2500|$|There may be {{cases where}} padding is not desirable. [...] For example, in chairs that are {{intended}} primarily for outdoor use. [...] Where padding is not desirable, <b>contouring</b> {{may be used}} instead. [...] A contoured seat pan attempts to distribute weight without padding. [...] By matching {{the shape of the}} occupant's buttocks, weight is distributed and maximum pressure is reduced.|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the routes}} are those used for Great Gable, in {{particular}} {{those from the}} north. From Seathwaite a path runs up beside Sour Milk Gill into Gillercomb. From here it continues up the flank of the Blackmoor Pols ridge and onto the summit. From {{the top of the}} Honister Pass road a <b>contouring</b> path runs around Grey Knotts and Brandreth, before ascending Green Gable via Gillercomb Head. This path {{can also be used to}} access Moses Trod, a high level route from Honister to Wasdale. [...] "Moses" [...] was a possibly apocryphal figure in local stories, a quarryman from Honister who doubled as a trader-cum-whisky smuggler between the Lakeland valleys.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lower part}} of the GT-1's nose was {{constructed}} from a drop tank, with the upper part fabricated from fiberglass that was laid up using the drop tank as a mold. The landing gear is a retractable monowheel. The aircraft was initially fitted with a bubble canopy. Later the fuselage was modified to allow a more reclined pilot seating position and the canopy replaced with a more streamlined one. The modifications added [...] to the glider's empty weight and the gross weight was raised [...] in partial compensation. The GT-1's [...] span wing employs a NACA 43012A airfoil. The initial glide ratio was 29:1, but extensive work gap-filling and <b>contouring</b> the aircraft raised this to 33:1.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as <b>contouring</b> with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E
2500|$|In many ways, USA Today {{is set up}} {{to break}} the typical {{newspaper}} layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers (front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside; the lead reefer is the cover page feature [...] "Newsline," [...] which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, USA Today cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps for the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world (temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as [...] "t" [...] for thunderstorms, referencing the expected weather conditions); the colorized forecast map, originally created by staff designer George Rorick (who left USA Today for a similar position at The Detroit News in 1986), was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome <b>contouring</b> or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges. National precipitation maps {{for the next three}} days (previously five days until the 2012 redesign), and four-day forecasts and Air Quality Indexes for 36 major U.S. cities (originally 16 cities prior to 1999) – with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map – are also featured. Weather data is provided by AccuWeather, which has served as the forecast provider for USA Today for most of the paper's existence (with an exception from January 2002 to September 2012, when The Weather Channel provided data through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett).
