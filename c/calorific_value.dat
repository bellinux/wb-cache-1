5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E
25|$|A {{cement plant}} consumes 3 to 6 GJ of fuel per tonne of clinker produced, {{depending}} on the raw materials and the process used. Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels, {{and to a lesser}} extent natural gas and fuel oil. Selected waste and by-products with recoverable <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> can be used as fuels in a cement kiln (referred to as co-processing), replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels, like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium, silica, alumina, and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln, replacing raw materials such as clay, shale, and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable <b>calorific</b> <b>value,</b> the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example, sewage sludge has a low but significant <b>calorific</b> <b>value,</b> and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix.|$|E

Larger fish tended to have higher <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> than small ones, {{particularly}} when considered in terms of wet weight, but there was considerable temporal variation. The <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and body weights of sandeels larger than 10 cm showed marked seasonal trends and in consequence the total energy content of a sandeel of given length in summer is approximately double the spring <b>value.</b> The <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> of herring and sprat also varied from month to month but seasonal cycles were less obvious. Whiting varied least. Both <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and total energy content of individual sprat were very variable in summer (the spawning season of this species). Because {{there is so much}} intraspecific variation, care must be taken when assessing the relative merits (in terms of energy) of different species as prey. The practical difficulties of obtaining reliable data on wet <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> are discussed and the use of dry <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and dry weight/length relationships is recommended. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} and combine various thermochemical parameters derived from lab scale, analytical scale fire tests and field data (i. e., <b>calorific</b> <b>values,</b> flame spread rate at different inclinations, flame intensity values, meteorological data and elementary composition) for determining risk indices to quantify particle flammability components of Mediterranean forest species. Two indices were calculated: (a) Bioclimatic Flammability Index (BFI), based on meteorological data and <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and (b) Flammability Inclination Index (FII), based on flame spread rate values at different inclinations. Elemental analysis data have only a minor contribution to the overall flammability index and they can be neglected. The resulting indices can be very useful to estimate fire hazard and fight forest fires effectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|R

Variations in biodiesel energy density is {{more dependent on}} the feedstock used than the production process. Still, these variations are less than for petrodiesel. It has been claimed biodiesel gives better lubricity and more complete combustion thus increasing the engine energy output and partially compensating for the higher energy density of petrodiesel.|$|E
25|$|Charcoal, or Makala, is inefficient {{to produce}} {{but is a}} {{preferred}} source {{of energy in the}} DRC. While it is virtually free to use fuelwood as a source of energy, charcoal increases in popularity as an energy source due to several advantages over fuelwood. Charcoal has higher <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> per unit weight (31.8 MJ per kg) compared to fuelwood (16 MJ per kg); and charcoal is smaller and easier to store.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{technological}} methane production methods. Methane created from biomass in industrial plants via biological route is called biogas. A more synthetic method to produce methane is hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the Sabatier process.

Example of large-scale coal-to-methane gasification is the Great Plains Synfuels plant, started in 1984 in Beulah, North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low-grade lignite, a resource that is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight, ash content, low <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport.|$|E

25|$|To improve {{environmental}} emissions, Longannet {{was fitted}} with 'Low-NOx' burners {{to limit the}} formation of oxides of nitrogen and a 'gas reburn system' that used natural gas to convert NOx into nitrogen and water vapour. Longannet used to burn up to 65,000 tonnes of treated and dried sewage sludge per year, which has a similar <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> to low-quality brown coal. In 2005, a judge ruled the burning of sludge as illegal, but the SEPA continued to allow Scottish Power to burn the sludge illegally {{as part of an}} agreement which originally required Scottish Power to construct, and have in operation, a biomass plant in 2010. All burning of biomass at Longannet - including waste-derived fuel and sawdust pellets - ceased in April 2012.|$|E

500|$|Resources of graptolitic {{argillite}} in Estonia {{have been}} estimated at 60–70billion tonnes. Although resources of graptolitic argillite exceed that of kukersite, attempts {{to use it}} as an energy source have been unsuccessful due to its low <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> and high sulfur content. [...] Its organic content ranges from 10 to 20% and its sulfur content from 2 to 4%. Correspondingly, its <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> is only 5–8megajoules per kilogram (MJ/kg; 1,200–1,900kcal/kg) and its Fischer Assay oil yield is 3–5%. [...] However, the graptolitic argillite resource in Estonia contains a potential 2.1billion tonnes of oil. In addition, it contains 5.67million tonnes of uranium– {{making it one of the}} main potential sources of uranium in Europe– 16.53million tonnes of zinc, and 12.76million tonnes of molybdenum.

500|$|Storm petrels are monogamous {{and form}} {{long-term}} pair bonds that last {{a number of}} years. Studies of paternity using DNA fingerprinting have shown that, unlike many other monogamous birds, infidelity (extra-pair mating) is very rare. As with the other Procellariiformes, a single egg is laid by a pair in a breeding season; if the egg fails, then usually no attempt is made to re-lay (although it happens rarely). Both sexes incubate in shifts of up to six days. The egg hatches after 40 or 50 days; the young is brooded continuously for another 7 days or so before being left alone in the nest {{during the day and}} fed by regurgitation at night. Meals fed to the chick weigh around 10–20% of the parent's body weight, and consist of both prey items and stomach oil. Stomach oil is an energy rich (its <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> is around 9600 calories per gram) oil created by partly digested prey {{in a part of the}} foregut known as the proventriculus. By partly converting prey items into stomach oil storm petrels can maximise the amount of energy chicks receive during feed, an advantage for small seabirds that can only make a single visit to the chick during a 24-hour period (at night). The average age at which chicks fledge depends on the species, taking between 50 or 70 days. The time taken to hatch and raise the young is long for the bird's size but is typical of seabirds, which in general are K-selected, living much longer, delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into fewer young. The young leave there burrow at about 62 days. They are independent almost at once and quickly disperse into the ocean. They return to their original colony after 2 [...] or 3 years, but will not breed until at least 4 years old. Storm petrels have been recorded living as long as 30 years.|$|E

40|$|Kenya {{depends on}} fuel-wood for cooking and heating in most {{households}}. Over 80 % of both {{rural and urban}} households in the country use fuel wood for cooking. These Prosopis plant species provide excellent fuel wood. These plants were introduced in the arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya in the early 1970 s {{as a source of}} woodfuel and also for the rehabilitation of degraded lands. Prosopis is a prolific seeder and has invasiveness behaviour that results in a number of social, ecological and economic concerns to the local communities, and challenges to development partners. Now with the Kenyan Forest Policy 2005 which proposes strategies and actions to enhance sustainable and efficient production of wood-fuel, Prosopis species is a suitable candidate. The Kenya Forest Service is now issuing permits allowing charcoal burning of Prosopis species in an effort to manage and curb uncontrolled spread. There is a national ban on charcoal making from unsustainable wood sources which include the woodlands and natural forest reserves. The aim of this project was to determine the energy values from Prosopis fuel-wood. The moisture content, volatile matter, ash content, carbon content and <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> were determined from Prosopis fuel-wood plants.

The influence of diet upon the neoplastic diseases occurring in the colonies of Alderley Park strain 1 rats and strain 1 mice has been studied in a series of experiments in which animals were subjected to various dietary regimes for the majority of their lifespan. A twenty percent reduction of food intake produced a marked reduction in total tumor incidence; liver tumors in mice, and pituitary and mammary tumors of rats were most affected; brain tumors in rats and thymic tumors in mice were not affected by dietary manipulations indicating that they have a different aetiology. Commercial diets (Oxoid and Purina) produced a different pattern of mortality when fed ad libitum; this appeared to be related to <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> of the diets not food intake. <b>Calorific</b> <b>values,</b> rather than protein levels, appeared more important in tumor development in the rat. A lifespan food restriction in mice eliminated the development of some tumors, and retarded the onset of all types except thymic tumors.
