It is backed up by a new color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 bits per pixel, multiple color channels (more than 3), alternative color spaces and high dynamic range coloring, using a technology named Kyuanos developed by Canon. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own gamut mapping algorithm into the pipeline to customize the <b>color</b> <b>response</b> of the device. The new pipeline also uses floating point calculations to minimize round-off losses, which are inherent in integer processing.

40|$|Since the 1940 s, less {{frequent}} human movement and <b>color</b> <b>responses</b> on the Rorschachs {{of older adults}} have been acknowledged although their meaning has remained unclear. Within the last decade, however, concern about an older adult stereotype has created doubt about these findings. In addition, the normative sample of the Rorschach system commonly used has only 3 % of participants over 65. A more recent question is whether responses fewer than 14 [...] a frequent finding among older adults [...] {{is the cause of}} both unreliability and {{less frequent}} human movement and <b>color</b> <b>responses.</b> Participants in this study were nonpatients, 12 under age 60, and 33 age 60 and over. Participants were retested and encouraged to give more responses when fewer than 14 were given spontaneously. Cognitive processing style or EB, a central Rorschach variable consisting of the ratio of human movement to <b>color</b> <b>responses,</b> is described as the most reliable means to investigate the two less frequent variables empirically. Two behavioral tasks were given to validate EB and provide empirical data on human movement and <b>color</b> <b>responses.</b> Results showed no improvement in reliability due to encouragement to give more than 13 responses. Contrary to claims, this study showed little evidence of retest reliability in younger or older adult participants. There was also no behavioral evidence of cognitive processing style. The predicted evidence of less frequent human movement and <b>color</b> <b>responses</b> was observed in older adults. Although this study was not intended to be a sufficient test of reliability, it indicates that retest reliability studies by researchers other than test developers are needed to substantiate Rorschach empirical reliability. The presence of less frequent human movement and <b>color</b> <b>responses</b> on Rorschachs of these high-functioning older adults shows less need for concern about this finding than recent literature suggests. Due to the unexpected negative findings with cognitive processing style and retest reliability, this study was not able to provide information about the meaning of less frequent human movement and <b>color</b> <b>responses</b> among older adults. The wide variability among older adults in this study clearly shows the lack of an older adult stereotype on the Rorschach test...|$|R

Non-color words were used as baseline to firmly establish the effects of semantic relatedness induced by color word distractors.

Consistent with previous findings that have demonstrated that pupil size increases as task demands rise, the present results indicate that pupillometry is a robust measure of Stroop interference, and it represents a valuable addition to the cognitive scientist’s toolbox...|$|R

40|$|The primary <b>color</b> <b>response</b> {{of scale}} melanophores from the adult rose (or rosy) bitterling, Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus was investigated. The {{intensity}} of light used for illumination was about 2, 000 lux. Melanophores remained {{in a state of}} melanosome dispersion in physiological saline in the presence of light. However, the majority of melanophores did not maintain the fully dispersed state under dark conditions, showing various degrees of melanosome dispersion. In many cases when the melanophores were exposed to intermittent light and dark in physiological saline they responded by melanosome dispersion to light and by melanosome aggregation to dark. In M/ 7. 5 KC 1 solution, melanophores underwent melanosome aggregation to various degrees. Under dark conditions, melanophores aggregated and maintained the aggregated state thereafter in M/ 7. 5 KC 1 solution. Melanophores first aggregated in M/ 7. 5 KC 1 solution displayed a tendency for melanosome dispersion with the lapse of time when exposed to light. From these results, it is concluded that scale melanophores of the rose bitterling have the ability for a primary <b>color</b> <b>response...</b>|$|E

The dependence of speed on test contrast was the same for all test colors measured, differing only by a sensitivity factor.
