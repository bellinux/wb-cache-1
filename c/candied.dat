5|$|Guepinia helvelloides is an edible, but bland, fungus. Older {{specimens}} {{are usually}} tough and indigestible. It {{can be used}} raw in salads, for pickling in vinegar and also for preserving in sugar like <b>candied</b> fruit. One source reports using it to prepare a wine by fermenting with wine yeast.|$|E
5|$|Granulated sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in <b>candied</b> fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, cubeb {{was one of}} the {{valuable}} spices during the Middle Ages. It was ground as a seasoning for meat or used in sauces. A medieval recipe includes cubeb in making sauce sarcenes, which consists of almond milk and several spices. As an aromatic confectionery, cubeb was often <b>candied</b> and eaten whole. Ocet Kubebowy, a vinegar infused with cubeb, cumin and garlic, was used for meat marinades in Poland during the 14th century. Cubeb can still be used to enhance the flavor of savory soups.|$|E
5|$|Many {{trees have}} flowers rich in nectar which are {{attractive}} to bees. The production of forest honey {{is an important}} industry in rural areas {{of the developing world}} where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods. The flowers of the elder (Sambucus) are used to make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (Prunus spp.) can be <b>candied.</b> Sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark from the roots of the white sassafras tree (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} its various {{artificial}} imitations {{are widely used}} as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America. They {{can also be used}} to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, and sausages. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, <b>candied</b> sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine (mead).|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be <b>candied</b> prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, in a similar manner to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Clementine cake is a cake {{prepared}} with clementine fruit {{as a primary}} ingredient and other typical cake ingredients. Additional ingredients can be used, and some preparation variations exist. It can be prepared using whole or peeled clementines that have been manually-seeded, or seedless fruit may be used. It may provide significant amounts of Vitamin D. It can be topped with a sweet glaze or sauce, powdered sugar, honey and clementines or <b>candied</b> clementines. Its origin may be roughly based upon an orange cake developed by the Sephardi Jews. In popular culture, the cake played a minor part in {{the plot of the}} 2013 film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.|$|E
5|$|The cake can be {{prepared}} with clementines and/or clementine zest mixed in the batter, with them atop the cake, such as in slices, and in both ways. The seeds and membrane of the clementine can be removed {{as part of the}} preparation process, or seedless clementines can be used. Whole, sliced clementines including the peel, or peeled clementines can be used, and the clementines can be cooked before being used in the cake batter. The fruit can be chopped or blended using a food processor. <b>Candied</b> clementines can be used atop the cake or as a garnish. The almonds used can be toasted or blanched.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the elder Joseph Terry's death in 1850, Terry's was {{becoming}} a household name due to its previous trade successes across the country. The younger Joseph, along with his two brothers, Robert and John, are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse, in 1862. Its location was particularly advantageous, as the 22-year-old Terry had drawn inspiration from the manipulation of the railways initiated by his father, and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats. Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory, while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week. The Clementhorpe factory also improved the logistics of the company, providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to store stock. Two years later, there were 400 separate items in the firm's price list, with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient; others included various <b>candied</b> peels, cakes, biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls.|$|E

25|$|While citron {{trees are}} still found on Corfu, and in Naxos, the citron {{is no longer}} {{exported}} from Greece for the ritual purpose. The Crete citron growers sell it for the <b>candied</b> peel, which is called succade, and in Naxos it is distilled into a special aromatic liqueur called kitron.|$|E
25|$|Xalapa is {{the place}} of origin of the famous Jalapeño peppers. Dishes made with maize: gorditas, tostadas, pasties, enfrijoladas, and chicken are common.

(Scents of honey {{can also be}} assimilated).|$|E
25|$|After the holiday, eating {{from the}} etrog or etrog jam is {{considered}} a segula (efficacious remedy) {{for a woman to}} have an easy childbirth. A common Ashkenazi custom is to save the etrog until Tu Bishvat and eat it in <b>candied</b> form or as succade, accompanied by prayers that the worshiper will merit a beautiful etrog next Sukkot. Some families make jam or liqueur out of it, or stick cloves in the skin for use as besamim at the havdalah ceremony after Shabbat.|$|E
25|$|The liquid used in Snap-dragon was {{typically}} brandy, although similar flammable liquors {{could also be}} used. Traditionally, raisins were the treat to be snatched; William Sandys specifies Málaga raisins. Other treats, however, could also be used. Of these, almonds were the most common alternative or addition, but currants, <b>candied</b> fruit, figs, grapes, and plums also featured. Salt could also be sprinkled in the bowl. The low bowl {{was typically}} placed {{in the middle of}} a table to prevent damage from the inevitable splashes of burning brandy. In one variation a Christmas pudding is placed in the centre of the bowl with raisins around it.|$|E
25|$|STS-126 {{included}} the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) on its fifth spaceflight. Leonardo held over 14,000 pounds of supplies and equipment. Among the items {{packed into the}} MPLM were two new crew quarters racks, a second galley (kitchen) for the Destiny laboratory, a second Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) rack (lavatory), the advanced Resistive Exercise Device (aRED), two water reclamation racks, spare hardware, and new experiments.

25|$|Thirty-six {{chapters}} on treatments, consisting mainly of recipes both pharmacological and magical, and arranged by convention anatomically a capite ad calcem (“from head to toe,” in the equivalent English expression) as were Marcellus’s sources Scribonius Largus and the Medicina Plinii. The treatment chapters run to 255 pages in Niedermann’s edition. Meyer lists 262 different plant names in Marcellus; allowing for synonyms, {{of which there}} are many, the number of plants mentioned would be around 131. About 25 of the botanicals most frequently prescribed are “exotica”’ such as galbanum, sagapenum, and ginger; these may have been available in Gaul as imports, but only to elite consumers. Other ingredients likely to have been rare for Marcellus’s intended audience include cinnamon, cloves, <b>candied</b> tragacanth, Alexandrian niter, and African snails, perhaps the Giant African land snail, which are prescribed live for pulping into a mélange. Availability is possibly a lesser criterion of selection for Marcellus than completeness and variety of interest.|$|E

The woolen shawls from Kashmir region find written mention between 3rd century BCE and the 11th century CE. Crystallized sugar was discovered {{by the time of the}} Gupta dynasty, and the earliest reference to <b>candied</b> sugar comes from India. Jute was also cultivated in India. Muslin was named after the city where Europeans first encountered it, Mosul, in what is now Iraq, but the fabric actually originated from Dhaka in what is now Bangladesh. In the 9th century, an Arab merchant named Sulaiman makes note of the material's origin in Bengal (known as Ruhml in Arabic).|$|E

They are sometimes referred to as [...] "dead fly pies".|$|E
500|$|The {{etymology}} {{reflects the}} spread of the commodity. The English word [...] "sugar" [...] ultimately originates from the Sanskrit [...] (śarkarā), via Arabic [...] (sukkar) as granular or <b>candied</b> sugar, which is cognate with the Greek word, kroke, or [...] "pebble".
