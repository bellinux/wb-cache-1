40|$|Antibiotic-resistant infections {{caused by}} gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{are a major}} healthcare concern. Repurposing drugs circumvents {{the time and money}} limitations associated with developing new antimicrobial agents needed to combat these antibiotic-resistant infections. Here we identified the off-patent antifungal agent, <b>ciclopirox,</b> as a candidate to repurpose for antibiotic use. To test the efficacy of <b>ciclopirox</b> against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, we used a curated collection of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates that are representative of known antibiotic resistance phenotypes. We found that <b>ciclopirox,</b> at 5 - 15 µg/ml concentrations, inhibited bacterial growth regardless of the antibiotic resistance status. At these same concentrations, <b>ciclopirox</b> reduced growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, but some of these pathogens required higher <b>ciclopirox</b> concentrations to completely block growth. To determine how <b>ciclopirox</b> inhibits bacterial growth, we performed an overexpression screen in E. coli. This screen revealed that galE, which encodes UDP-glucose 4 -epimerase, rescued bacterial growth at otherwise restrictive <b>ciclopirox</b> concentrations. We found that <b>ciclopirox</b> does not inhibit epimerization of UDP-galactose by purified E. coli GalE; however, ΔgalU, ΔgalE, ΔrfaI, or ΔrfaB mutant strains all have lower <b>ciclopirox</b> minimum inhibitory concentrations than the parent strain. The galU, galE, rfaI, and rfaB genes all encode enzymes that use UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose for galactose metabolism and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. Indeed, we found that <b>ciclopirox</b> altered LPS composition of an E. coli clinical isolate. Taken together, our data demonstrate that <b>ciclopirox</b> affects galactose metabolism and LPS biosynthesis, two pathways important for bacterial growth and virulence. The lack of any reported fungal resistance to <b>ciclopirox</b> in over twenty years of use in the clinic, its excellent safety profiles, novel target(s), and efficacy, make <b>ciclopirox</b> a promising potential antimicrobial agent to use against multidrug-resistant problematic gram-negative pathogens...|$|E

40|$|The hydroxypyridone <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine {{belongs to}} the {{antimycotic}} drugs used {{for the treatment of}} superficial mycoses. In contrast to the azoles and other antimycotic drugs, its specific mode of action is only poorly understood. To investigate the mode of action of <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine on fungal viability, pathogenicity, and drug resistance, we examined the expression patterns of 47 Candida albicans genes in cells grown {{in the presence of a}} subinhibitory concentration (0. 6 μg/ml) of <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine by reverse transcription-PCR. In addition, we used suppression-subtractive hybridization to further identify genes that are up-regulated in the presence of <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine. The expression of essential genes such as ACT 1 was not significantly modified in cells exposed to <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine. Most putative and known virulence genes such as genes encoding secreted proteinases or lipases had no or only moderately reduced expression levels. In contrast, exposure of cells to <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine led to a distinct up- or down-regulation of genes encoding iron permeases or transporters (FTR 1, FTR 2, FTH 1), a copper permease (CCC 2), an iron reductase (CFL 1), and a siderophore transporter (SIT 1); these effects resembled those found under iron-limited conditions. Addition of FeCl 3 to <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine-treated cells reversed the effect of the drug. Addition of the iron chelator bipyridine to the growth medium induced similar patterns of expression of distinct iron-regulated genes (FTR 1, FTR 2). While serum-induced yeast-to-hyphal phase transition of C. albicans was not affected in <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine-treated cells in the presence of subinhibitory conditions, a dramatic increase in sensitivity to oxidative stress was noted, which may indicate the reduced activities of iron-containing gene products responsible for detoxification. Although the Candida drug resistance genes CDR 1 and CDR 2 were up-regulated, no change in resistance or increased tolerance could be observed even after an incubation period of 6 months. This was in contrast to control experiments with fluconazole, in which the MICs for cells incubated with this drug had noticeably increased after 2 months. These data support the view that the antifungal activity of <b>ciclopirox</b> olamine may at least be partially caused by iron limitation. Furthermore, neither the expression of certain multiple-drug resistance genes nor other resistance mechanisms caused C. albicans resistance to this drug even after long-term exposure...|$|E
40|$|HIV- 1 blocks apoptosis, {{programmed}} cell death, {{an innate}} defense of cells against viral invasion. However, apoptosis can be selectively reactivated in HIV-infected cells by chemical agents {{that interfere with}} HIV- 1 gene expression. We studied two globally used medicines, the topical antifungal <b>ciclopirox</b> and the iron chelator deferiprone, for their effect on apoptosis in HIV-infected H 9 cells and in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} infected with clinical HIV- 1 isolates. Both medicines activated apoptosis preferentially in HIV-infected cells, suggesting that the drugs mediate escape from the viral suppression of defensive apoptosis. In infected H 9 cells, <b>ciclopirox</b> and deferiprone enhanced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, initiating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis to execution, as evidenced by caspase- 3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteolysis, DNA degradation, and apoptotic cell morphology. In isolate-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, <b>ciclopirox</b> collapsed HIV- 1 production to the limit of viral protein and RNA detection. Despite prolonged monotherapy, <b>ciclopirox</b> did not elicit breakthrough. No viral re-emergence was observed even 12 weeks after drug cessation, suggesting elimination of the proviral reservoir. Tests in mice predictive for cytotoxicity to human epithelia did not detect tissue damage or activation of apoptosis at a <b>ciclopirox</b> concentration that exceeded by orders of magnitude the concentration causing death of infected cells. We infer that <b>ciclopirox</b> and deferiprone act via therapeutic reclamation of apoptotic proficiency (TRAP) in HIV-infected cells and trigger their preferential elimination. Perturbations in viral protein expression suggest that the antiretroviral activity of both drugs stems from their ability to inhibit hydroxylation of cellular proteins essential for apoptosis and for viral infection, exemplified by eIF 5 A. Our findings identify <b>ciclopirox</b> and deferiprone as prototypes of selectively cytocidal antivirals that eliminate viral infection by destroying infected cells. A drug-based drug discovery program, based on these compounds, is warranted to determine the potential of such agents in clinical trials of HIV-infected patients...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ciclopirox</b> is {{a topical}} {{antimycotic}} agent {{belonging to the}} chemical class of hydroxypyridones and not related to azoles or any other class of antifungal agents. Its antimicrobial profile includes {{nearly all of the}} clinically relevant dermatophytes, yeasts and moulds, and is therefore broader than that of most other antimycotics. It is also active against certain frequently azole-resistant Candida species and against some bacteria. The mechanism of action of <b>ciclopirox</b> is different from that of other topical antifungal drugs, which generally act through ergosterol inhibition. The high affinity of <b>ciclopirox</b> for trivalent metal cations, resulting in inhibition of the metal-dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell, appears to be the major determinant of its antimicrobial activity. This unique and multilevel mechanism of action provides a very low potential for the development of resistance in pathogenic fungi, with cases of resistance rarely reported. <b>Ciclopirox</b> also displays mild anti-inflammatory effects in biochemical and pharmacological models; effects also shown in small clinical studies. Scavenging of reactive oxygen species released from inflammatory cells is a likely contributor to these anti-inflammatory effects. <b>Ciclopirox,</b> and its olamine salt, is available in multiple topical formulations, suitable for administration onto the skin and nails and into the vagina.

40|$|Use of oral antifungals in the {{treatment}} of onychomycosis is commonplace; but their use can be limited by safety and patient concerns. Due to their broader safety margins, topical antifungals (efinaconazole, tavaborole, and <b>ciclopirox)</b> are a useful option in {{the treatment}} of mild-to-moderate onychomycosis in the USA, but their antifungal activity has yet to be directly compared. This study aims to identify important factors contributing to in vivo efficacies of the three topical antifungals. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M 38 -A 2 broth microdilution. The MIC 90 values of efinaconazole, tavaborole, and <b>ciclopirox</b> for T. rubrum were 0. 0078, 8. 0, and 0. 50 μg/mL, respectively. The MIC 90 values for T. mentagrophytes were 0. 016, 8. 0, and 0. 50 μg/mL, respectively. Efinaconazole showed potent fungicidal activity in keratin-containing medium, whereas tavaborole was fungistatic, and <b>ciclopirox</b> not active. In the guinea pig model of onychomycosis, the therapeutic efficacy of efinaconazole was superior to those of tavaborole and <b>ciclopirox.</b> This study suggests that not only fungistatic activity (MIC), but also fungicidal activity in the presence of keratin, is an important factor contributing to the in vivo efficacy of topical antifungal drugs against onychomycosis...|$|E

Hypusine {{is a rare}} amino acid, formed posttranslationally in one cellular protein, eIF 5 A, and is essential for cell proliferation. Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase, the metalloenzyme catalyzing the final step in hypusine biosynthesis, and prolyl 4 -hydroxylase, a non-heme iron enzyme critical for collagen processing, can be inhibited by small chelating molecules that target their essential metal atom. We {{examined the effects of}} 5 compounds (<b>ciclopirox,</b> deferiprone, deferoxamine, mimosine and 2, 2 '-dipyridyl) on these protein hydroxylases in HUVECs, on cell proliferation and on angiogenesis using 2 model assays: tube-like vessel formation on Matrigel and the chick aortic arch sprouting assay. These compounds inhibited cellular deoxyhypusine hydroxylase in a concentration-dependent manner, but their efficacy varied widely in the following order: <b>ciclopirox</b> [...] > deferoxamine [...] > 2, 2 '-dipyridyl [...] >deferiprone [...] >mimosine (IC(50) 5 - 200 microM). Inhibition of DNA synthesis, following the same order (IC(50) 10 - 450 microM), correlated with G(1) arrest of the cell cycle. These compounds also inhibited proline hydroxylation and maturation of collagen in HUVECs and caused inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro. Of the compounds tested, <b>ciclopirox</b> was by far the most effective inhibitor of HUVEC proliferation and angiogenesis.

40|$|Onychomycosis is {{a common}} fungal nail disease that is {{difficult}} to treat topically due to the deep location of the infection under the densely keratinized nail plate. Keratin affinity of topical drugs is an important physicochemical property impacting thera-peutic efficacy. To be effective, topical drugs must penetrate the nail bed and retain their antifungal activity within the nail ma-trix, both of which are adversely affected by keratin binding. We investigated these properties for efinaconazole, a new topical antifungal for onychomycosis, compared with those of the existing topical drugs <b>ciclopirox</b> and amorolfine. The efinaconazole free-drug concentration in keratin suspensions was 14. 3 %, significantly higher than the concentrations of <b>ciclopirox</b> and amo-rolfine, which were 0. 7 % and 1. 9 %, respectively (P< 0. 001). Efinaconazole was released from keratin at a higher proportion than in the reference drugs, with about half of the remaining keratin-bound efinaconazole removed after washing. In single-dose in vitro studies, efinaconazole penetrated full-thickness human nails into the receptor phase and also inhibited the growth of Trichophyton rubrum under the nail. In the presence of keratin, efinaconazole exhibited fungicidal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes comparable to that of amorolfine and superior to that of <b>ciclopirox.</b> In a guinea pig onychomycosis model with T. mentagrophytes infection, an efinaconazole solution significantly decreased nail fungal burden compared to that of <b>ciclopirox</b> and amorolfine lacquers (P< 0. 01). These results suggest that the high nail permeability of efinaconazole and its potent fungi-cidal activity in the presence of keratin are related to its low keratin affinity, which may contribute to its efficacy in onychomycosis...|$|E

At early times after drug exposure, both drugs inhibited substrate binding to DOHH and prevented the formation of mature eIF 5 A. Viral gene expression from HIV- 1 molecular clones was suppressed at the RNA level independently of all viral genes. The inhibition was specific for the viral promoter and occurred at the level of HIV- 1 transcriptio...|$|E
