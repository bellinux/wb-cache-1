5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the <b>catenary</b> <b>arch.</b> He had studied {{geometry}} thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
5|$|The Cooperativa Obrera Mataronense (Mataró Workers' Cooperative) was Gaudí's {{first big}} project, {{on which he}} worked from 1878 to 1882, for Salvador Pagès i Anglada. The project, for the cooperative's head office in Mataró, {{comprised}} a factory, a worker's housing estate, a social centre and a services building, though only the factory and the services building were completed. In the factory roof Gaudí used the <b>catenary</b> <b>arch</b> {{for the first time}}, with a bolt assembly system devised by Philibert de l'Orme. He also used ceramic tile decoration {{for the first time in}} the services building. Gaudí laid out the site taking account of solar orientation, another signature of his works, and included landscaped areas. He even designed the Cooperative's banner, with the figure of a bee, symbol of industriousness.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example was}} the Teresian College (Col·legi de les Teresianes) (1888–1889), in Barcelona's Carrer Ganduxer, {{commissioned}} by San Enrique de Ossó. Gaudí fulfilled the wish {{of the order}} that the building should be austere, in keeping with their vows of poverty. He designed a simple building, using bricks for the exterior and some brick elements for the interior. Wrought ironwork, one of Gaudí's favourite materials, appeared on the facades. The building is crowned by a row of merlons which suggest a castle, a possible reference to Saint Teresa's Interior Castle. The corners have brick pinnacles topped by helicoidal columns and culminate in a four-armed cross, typical of Gaudí's works, and with ceramic shields bearing various symbols of the order. The interior includes a corridor which is famous for the series of catenary arches that it contains. These elegant arches are decorative and support the ceiling and the floor above. For Gaudí, the <b>catenary</b> <b>arch</b> was an ideal constructional element, capable of supporting great loads with slender masonry.|$|E

2500|$|This {{hyperbolic}} cosine function describes {{the shape of}} a catenary. A chain that supports only its own weight forms a catenary; the chain is purely in tension. Likewise, an inverted <b>catenary</b> <b>arch</b> that supports only its own weight is purely in compression, with no shear. The <b>catenary</b> <b>arch</b> is the stablest of all arches since [...] "the thrust passes down through the legs and is absorbed in the foundations, whereas in other arches, the pressure tends to force the legs apart." [...] The Gateway Arch itself is not a common catenary, but a more general curve of the form y=Acosh (Bx). This makes it an inverted weighted catenary. Saarinen chose a weighted catenary over a normal catenary curve because it looked less pointed and less steep. In 1959, he caused some confusion about the actual shape of the arch when he wrote, [...] "This arch is not a true parabola, as is often stated. Instead it is a catenary curve—the curve of a hanging chain—a curve in which the forces of thrust are continuously kept within the center of the legs of the arch." [...] William V. Thayer, a professor of mathematics at St. Louis Community College, later wrote to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch calling {{attention to the fact that}} the structure was a weighted catenary.|$|E

50|$|The loft is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most unusual spaces. It was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas. It is known for its simplicity of shapes and its Mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls. It contains a series of sixty <b>catenary</b> <b>arches</b> that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal. Some people believe that the “ribcage” design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon’s spine that is represented in the roof.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{example of}} an early Gothic arch in Europe is in Sicily in the Greek fortifications of Gela.The semicircular arch was {{followed}} in Europe by the pointed Gothic arch or ogive, whose centreline more closely follows the forces of compression and which is therefore stronger. The semicircular arch can be flattened to make an elliptical arch, as in the Ponte Santa Trinita. Both the parabolic and <b>catenary</b> <b>arches</b> are now known to be the theoretically strongest forms. Parabolic arches were introduced in construction by the Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí, who admired the structural system of the Gothic style, but for the buttresses, which he termed [...] "architectural crutches". The <b>catenary</b> and parabolic <b>arches</b> carry all horizontal thrust to the foundation and so do not need additional elements. The first examples of the pointed arch in the European architecture are in Sicily and {{date back to the}} Arab-Norman period.|$|R

50|$|In Renaissance architecture, {{symmetry}} and proportion were deliberately {{emphasized by}} architects such as Leon Battista Alberti, Sebastiano Serlio and Andrea Palladio, influenced by Vitruvius's De architectura from Ancient Rome and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece.At {{the end of}} the nineteenth century, Vladimir Shukhov in Russia and Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona pioneered the use of hyperboloid structures; in the Sagrada Família, Gaudí also incorporated hyperbolic paraboloids, tessellations, <b>catenary</b> <b>arches,</b> catenoids, helicoids, and ruled surfaces. In the twentieth century, styles such as modern architecture and Deconstructivism explored different geometries to achieve desired effects. Minimal surfaces have been exploited in tent-like roof coverings as at Denver International Airport, while Richard Buckminster Fuller pioneered the use of the strong thin-shell structures known as geodesic domes.|$|R
