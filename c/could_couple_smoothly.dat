40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{chemiluminescence}} detection was integrated with capillary electrophoresis microchip. The microchip was designed {{on the principle}} of flow-injection chemiluminescence system and capillary electrophoresis. It has three main channels, five reservoirs and a detection cell. As model samples, dopamine and catechol were separated and detected using a permanganate chemiluminescent system on the prepared microchip. The samples were electrokinetically injected into the double-T cross section, separated in the separation channel, and then oxidized by chemiluminescent reagent delivered by a home-made micropump to produce light in the detection cell. The electroosmotic flow <b>could</b> be <b>smoothly</b> <b>coupled</b> with the micropump flow. The detection limits for dopamine and catechol were 20. 0 and 10. 0 muM, respectively. Successful separation and detection of dopamine and catechol demonstrated the distinct advantages of integration of chemiluminescent detection on a microchip for rapid and sensitive analysis.

By three different methods (oxidation to phosphates, electrospray mass spectrometry with deuterium labelled samples, and NMR spectroscopic analysis of borane adducts) it was shown that on use of racemic materials a degree, less than absolute, of self-recognition {{is involved in the}} formation of the diphosphite obtained with catechol. No self-recognition is involved in the assembly of the product with resorcinol. Determination of the degree of self-recognition was made difficult by the identity of the NMR spectra of the meso and racemic forms of the diphosphites obtained from catechol.

40|$|A facile switch of the {{reaction}} pathways of aerobic oxidative coupling of alcohols and amines from amidation to imination was realized {{for the first time}} by tuning the Au/Pd ratios in ion-exchange resin supported Au-Pd alloy catalysts (Au-Pd/resin).

Various alcohols and amines underwent oxidative <b>coupling</b> <b>smoothly</b> in water to afford the desired products with good to excellent yields. Further investigation on {{the reaction}} mechanism suggested the synergistic effect between Au and Pd determined the adsorption strength of the aldehyde intermediate, which in turn dictated the reaction pathways. That is, on Au-rich alloys (e. g., Au 6 Pd) absorbed aldehyde species was formed, followed by further oxidation to yield amides, while on Pd-rich alloys (e. g., Au Pd- 4), free aldehyde was generated, which then underwent condensation with amines to produce imines.

40|$|A facile and {{convenient}} synthesis of new heterocyclic compounds containing a sulfamoyl moiety {{suitable for use}} as antimicrobial agents was reported. The precursor 3 -oxo- 3 -phenyl-N-(4 -sulfamoylphenyl) propionamide was <b>coupled</b> <b>smoothly</b> with arenediazonium salt producing hydrazones which reacted with malononitrile or triethylorthoformate affording pyridazine and triazine derivatives, respectively. Also, the reactivity of the same precursor with DMF-DMA was followed by aminotriazole; aromatic aldehydes was followed by hydrazine hydrate, triethylorthoformate, or thiourea affording triazolo[1, 5 -a]pyrimidine, pyrazole, acrylamide, and dihydropyrimidine derivatives, respectively. On the other hand, treatment of the precursor propionamide with phenyl isothiocyanate and KOH in DMF afforded the intermediate salt which was treated with dilute HCl followed by 2 -bromo- 1 -phenylethanone affording carboxamide derivative.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} simultaneously and efficiently coupling an external subsonic potential flow and an interior viscous flow {{such that the}} two flows match at an interfacing boundary is discussed. Both a panel method and a simple point compressible vortex model are used for the outer potential field. The interior flow solvers which were used are the Navier-Stokes and Euler codes of T. J. Coakley and the Euler code of A. Verhoff. In order to test compatibility, the panel method is coupled to the less expensive Euler codes since the coupling procedure is identical with the Navier-Stokes code. The results show significant efficiency improvements can be obtained over the uncoupled approach. Results also indicate the outer potential flow is best represented by the simple point compressible vortex model. The panel method <b>couples</b> <b>smoothly</b> to Coakley's implicit code but is numerically incompatible as coupled with the explicit Euler code. An improved Navier-Stokes code is under initial development which extends the Euler code to include the necessary viscous terms.

In the latter reaction, LCoH could be trapped by reaction with NCC 6 H 4 - 4 -Cl to give LCoN=CHC 6 H 4 - 4 -Cl. LCo(N 2) reacts with many alkyl and aryl halides RX, including aryl chlorides, to give a mixture of LCoR and LCoX in a halogen atom abstraction mechanism. Intermediacy of free alkyl and aryl radicals is confirmed by the ring-opening of cyclopropylmethyl to crotyl, and the rearrangement of 2, 4, 6 -tBu 3 C 6 H 2 to 3, 5 -tBu 2 C 6 H 3 CMe 2 CH 2, before binding to Co. The organocobalt species generated in this way react further with activated halides R′X (alkyl iodides; allyl and benzyl halides) to give cross-coupling products RR′ in what is most likely again a halogen abstraction mechanism. DFT studies support the proposed radical pathways for both steps. MeI <b>couples</b> <b>smoothly</b> with LCoCH 2 SiMe 3 to give LCoI and CH 3 CH 2 SiMe 3, but the analogous reaction of tBuI leads in part to radical attack at the 3 and 4 positions of the pyridine ring to form (tBu 2 -L) CoI and (tBu 2 -L) CoI 2...|$|R

40|$|The unusual {{adhesion}} G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) contain large extracellular N-terminal domains, which resemble cell-adhesion receptors, and C-terminal heptahelical domains, {{which may}} couple to G-proteins. These receptors are cleaved post-translationally between these domains into two fragments (NTF and CTF). Using the aGPCR latrophilin 1, we previously {{demonstrated that the}} fragments behave as independent cell-surface proteins. Upon binding the agonist, α-latrotoxin (LTX), latrophilin fragments reassemble and induce intracellular signaling. Our observations raised important questions: is the aGPCR signaling mediated by reassembled fragments or by any non-cleaved receptors? Also, can the fragments originating from distinct aGPCRs form hybrid complexes? To answer these questions, we created two types of chimerical constructs. One contained the CTF of latrophilin joined to the NTF of another aGPCR, EMR 2; the resulting protein did not bind LTX but, similar to latrophilin, <b>could</b> <b>couple</b> to G-proteins. In another construct, the NTF of latrophilin was fused with the C terminus of neurexin; this chimera bound LTX but could not signal via G-proteins. Both constructs were efficiently cleaved in cells. When the two constructs were co-expressed, their fragments could cross-interact, as shown by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, LTXN 4 C induced intracellular Ca 2 + signaling only in cells expressing both constructs but not each individual construct. Finally, we demonstrated that fragments of unrelated aGPCRs can be cross-immunoprecipitated from live tissues. Thus, (i) aGPCR fragments behave as independent proteins, (ii) the complementary fragments from distinct aGPCRs can cross-interact, and (iii) these cross-complexes are functionally active.
