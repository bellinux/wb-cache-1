These diblock polymers self-assemble in oil to form expansive platelike aggregates consisting of a PE core cloaked behind the amorphous PEP brush layer. The PE core thus promotes nucleation of solubilized long chain alkanes. Additional candidate structures for wax crystal nucleators include linear and star copolyolefins where the composition variation signals the alteration between crystalline and amorphous segments.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to extract and {{fractionate}} waxes from abundant and low-cost under-utilised renewable resources using a green alternative technology. Through {{a review of the}} literature, the waxes covering agricultural by-products such as straw were identified as a potential source of high value chemicals {{for a wide range of}} applications. Wheat straw waxes were extracted using organic solvents to demonstrate that straw contained high value wax compounds including free fatty acids, fatty alcohols, alkanes, wax esters, sterols, aldehydes and β-diketones. The solvent properties did not affect the composition of the extracts but changed the relative abundance of the different compounds. Linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) was used to model the extraction selectivity relating to total extraction yield and the various wax compounds. Lipophilic and aqueous fractions were separated and LSER results identified that the solvent properties affect only on the quantity of aqueous fraction recovered indicating the selectivity of the solvent. Extraction of wheat straw wax was carried out using a more environmentally friendly supercritical CO 2 extraction. The compositional profiles can be tuned by the manipulation of temperature and pressure and compared with the organic solvent extractions. Optimisation of temperature and pressure was carried out and the total crude yields and wax chemical group yields were modelled using the Chrastil equation to gain a better understanding of conditions required to achieve optimum extraction. The optimisation was used as part of the industrial collaboration scale up with Sundown Products Limited and Evonik Industries where a total of three tonnes of wheat, barley and oat straws were extracted using supercritical CO 2 which yielded approximately 60 kg of wax. The three cereal straws were selected based on yield and composition as raw materials for the scale up from the biomass screen of seven different straws using hexane and ethanol extractions. Economical assessment was carried out based on the scale up trial and it was concluded that currently the cereal straw wax would cost £ 12 per kg which is about 2 – 3 times higher than commercial waxes. The straw waxes were characterised and physical properties such as melting point were determined and found to be similar to commercial waxes such as beeswax. Fractionation by scCO 2, GPC and saponification were used to further separate the wax products for formulation trials and product tests with the project sponsor, Croda.

40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties have been determined on 60 samples of crude beeswax, obtained for the most part from beekeepers in California and other Western States, and these properties have been compared with those of freshly secreted scale wax and also with the properties of many of the same crude waxes after they had been decolorized by various processes. For freshly secreted beeswax the properties are nearly constant, but with changes in the quantity and kind of contaminating impurities some or all of these properties change. The {{physical and}} chemical properties of the impurities, and not of the waxes as a whole, must therefore be used as the basis for classifying crude beeswaxes. The impurities in crude beeswax consist of honey, suspended particles, or dissolved substances, and {{may or may not be}} colored. The soluble colored materials are attributable to substances extracted from pollens, to propolis, and to substances produced by contact of the wax with metals. Darkening of <b>crude</b> <b>wax</b> by contact with iron or oxides of iron is very common. The crude waxes that were highly contaminated with propolis showed higher densities, indices of refraction, acid numbers, and iodine numbers than those containing little propolis but appreciable quantities of other soluble contaminants. Samples high in propolis could not be decolorized by sun bleaching or adsorption, and they were decolorized chemically only with difficulty. When melted crude waxes were treated with certain dilute acids, brown waxes became yellow, but the yellow color was not removed. In tests of the complete removal or destruction of colored impurities by action of sunlight, adsorbent solids, and chemicals, the individual waxes differed greatly depending on the nature of the colored impurity. This fact indicates the necessity for establishing the chemical structure of these colored constituents and also their specific {{physical and chemical}} properties. The effect of the method of decolorization on the composition of the wax is reflected to the greatest extent in the differences between the chemical properties of crude waxes and the corresponding refined waxes. The ash content was lowest in the waxes refined by sun bleaching. This process, however, was not so widely applicable to all waxes as the chemical method, which in every case produced a nearly white product with a relatively high ash content. Wax bloom has been shown to be a mixture of organic compounds of low final melting point and narrow melting range. Preliminary experiments on the absorption spectra of extracts of crude beeswaxes and of a pollen suggest the possibility of determining that the same colored substances may be common to some crude beeswaxes and pollens...|$|E
40|$|Leaf {{oils and}} waxes of 29 native Tasmanian Eucalyptus species were studied from {{primarily}} a taxonomic aspect {{and their effects}} on insect-plant selection were evaluated. E. nitens, an important introduced pulpwood species that is not indigenous to Tasmania was also investigated in detail. The chemical compositions of leaf oils and waxes of both juvenile and adult leaf samples of each species were examined by GC-MS. Results indicated that the distribution of both oil and wax components within Tasmanian eucalypts and their relative proportions between subgenera and species have taxonomic importance. A chemotaxonomic classification based on these data was constructed and this classification more functionally describes insect-host-tree relationships {{as opposed to the}} classification based on morphological differences. The results of this study indicated that differences in leaf oils of eucalypt species are correlated to genetic divergence in the biosynthesis of terpenoid compounds and that biochemically related terpenoid compounds provide sensitive taxonomic characteristics for the identification of eucalypt species. A study, using material from species/provenance trials, indicated that seasonal variation in leaf oil chemicals was influenced by time, ontogenetic and physiological aging effects. The variation pattern of leaf oils between different species was found to be under strong genetic control and environmental factors tended to affect leaf oils quantitatively but not qualitatively. For the first time the chemical composition of eucalypt leaf waxes of trees from a large number of species localities has been determined by the direct analysis of <b>crude</b> <b>wax.</b> In a representative number of species localities, wax morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two general wax categories, amorphous and structured were found, the latter including three types. The results indicated that wax structure was correlated with chemical composition and that the distribution and variation,- in both wax chemicals and wax types has relevance {{at all levels of the}} taxonomic hierarchy. The chemical composition of leaf oils and waxes among most provenances and localities of E. nitens were examined. The differences in leaf oil characteristics of two forms of E. nitens has supported the separation of the two morphological forms into separate species, E. nitens and E. denticulata. Results indicated that the chemical composition of leaf oils and waxes of E. nitens was similar to most Symphyomyrtus species but that oil yields from all E. nitens populations were significantly lower. Commercially important eucalypt species are attacked by two paropsine defoliating beetles: Chrysophtharta bimaculata and C. agricola (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae, Paropsini). The feeding and oviposition preferences of these beetles and the feeding response of their larvae to eucalypt leaves were examined in laboratory bioassay in which the effects of leaf oils and waxes were evaluated. The results indicated that leaf acceptance or rejection by C. bimaculata and C. agricola was correlated to differences in leaf oils and waxes which were chemotaxonomically correlated among Tasmanian eucalypt species. The toxic effects of 1, 8 -cineole and related chemicals on C. bimuculata beetles were confirmed by leaf extract and chemical bioassay. It was found that the leaves of E. nitens were successfully attacked by C. bimuculata through the lack of chemical defence, notably low levels of 1, 8 -cineole. The wax bloom on juvenile foliage acts also as a physical defence against adult C. bimaculata beetles. Results also indicated that leaf preference of C. agricola was related more to variation in the triterpenoid class of wax chemicals. The inheritance of leaf oils and waxes in interspecific F 1 hybrids of Eucalyptus was analysed. Results indicated that both oil and wax chemicals were strongly inherited in F 1 hybrids and were valuable for identification of tree hybrids. Bioassay results indicated that feeding resistance was related to the inheritance of leaf oils in interspecific F 1 hybrids. Hybrids between high and low cineole species had intermediate cineole levels and were therefore more resistant to C. bimaculata attack than the low cineole parent...|$|E

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and cross polar microscopy (CPM) techniques were used to study the wax appearance temperature (WAT) for these <b>crude</b> oils. <b>Waxes</b> were characterized using gas chromatography (GC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The carbon number distribution was determined by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Extensive information about the structural composition of these waxes was performed using 13 C NMR, and information for the crystalline structure of these waxes was obtained using XRD. This study shows that the five Libyan crude oils studied have wax contents between 8 and 24 wt % with WAT in the range of 22. 5 - 68. 17 °C. The isolated waxes are shown to be paraffinic (macrocrystalline wax) with an orthorhombic structure...|$|R

In this respect, maleic anhydride ester-co-vinyl acetate copolymers with varied monomers feed ratios and different alkyl ester lengths, namely, dodecyl, stearyl, and behenyl alkyl chains, were prepared. These polymeric materials were characterized by FTIR, 1 HNMR, and GPC. The performance of these additives as pour point depressants and flow improver for Egyptian waxy crude oil was evaluated through measurements of pour point and rheological parameters (viscosity and yield stress). It was observed that stearyl maleate-vinyl acetate copolymer with 1 [*]:[*] 2 feed ratio shows the best efficiency as pour point depressant even at low concentration while octadecyl maleate-vinyl acetate copolymers with 2 [*]:[*] 1 feed ratio are effective as flow improver...|$|R

To restart a pipeline filled with the waxy crude oil, a sufficient pressure must be applied to break the gel and restart the flow. This research was conducted on GNPOC crude oil which represents the main crude in Sudanese oil export. It has essentially aimed at studying the effects of thermal and chemical treatments on the process of pipeline restarting with emphasis on two major factors: the yield stress and the pour point. The experimental work was completed in five stages; two for the thermal treatment and three for the chemical treatment followed by analysis of the results obtained. The study succeeded in determining a temperature range for the thermal treatment and a temperature range at which PPD should be added for chemical treatment...|$|R
30|$|Waxes and {{asphaltenes}} are {{the most}} important constituents of crude oils because they have a great influence on <b>crude</b> oil properties. <b>Waxes</b> are a complex mixture of solid (at ambient temperature) hydrocarbons which consist mainly of paraffin hydrocarbons {{with a small amount of}} naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as polar compounds. There are two general classes of petroleum waxes. Waxes that are composed primarily of normal alkanes (n-alkanes) with a chain length of C 18 –C 30 and crystallize in large flat plates (macrocrystalline structures) with a melting point of 40 – 60  °C are referred to as paraffin waxes (Jowett 1984). Waxes, which consist primarily of the higher molecular weight n-alkanes within C 30 –C 60, with a high share of iso-paraffins and naphthenes, and have much higher melting point ranges (above 60 – 90  °C), are referred to as microcrystalline waxes. According to Musser and Kilpatrick (1998), paraffinic and microcrystalline waxes have molecular weight ranges of 350 – 600 and 300 – 2500, respectively.|$|R

The project is being financed by a joint venture between Waste Management, NRG Energy, Ventech and Velocys. The feedstock for this plant will be a combination of landfill gas and pipeline natural gas.|$|R
50|$|Plant remains (including {{those that}} passed through an animal gut and were {{excreted}} as faeces) contain organic compounds: sugars, starches, proteins, carbohydrates, lignins, waxes, resins, and organic acids. The process {{of organic matter}} decay in the soil begins with the decomposition of sugars and starches from carbohydrates, which break down easily as detritivores initially invade the dead plant organs, while the remaining cellulose and lignin break down more slowly. Simple proteins, organic acids, starches and sugars break down rapidly, while <b>crude</b> proteins, fats, <b>waxes</b> and resins remain relatively unchanged {{for longer periods of}} time. Lignin, which is quickly transformed by white-rot fungi, {{is one of the main}} precursors of humus, together with by-products of microbial and animal activity. The end-product of this process, the humus, is thus a mixture of compounds and complex life chemicals of plant, animal, or microbial origin that has many functions and benefits in the soil. Earthworm humus (vermicompost) is considered by some to be the best organic manure there is.|$|R

Pipelines are widely used to transport <b>crude</b> oil. <b>Wax</b> deposition in a pipeline {{was caused by the}} high viscosity of the heavy crude oil, particularly if it is left untreated, may have severe consequences on the operational efficiency of a pipeline system. In order to overcome the wax deposition of the heavy crude oil, the crude oil is suggested to mix with water and emulsifier at certain conditions so that it will formed oil in water (O/W) emulsion. In this study, both chemical and physical properties of O/W emulsion that preparedby using three types of emulsifiers,Coca Amide DEA (non-ionic and biodegradable surfactant that synthesis from coconut oil plus diethanolamine), Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate(anionic and biodegradable surfactant that synthesis from coconut oil only) with one type of conventional chemical emulsifier (Span 80) were examined. O/Wemulsions with two different ratios (50 - 50 % and 70 - 30 %) were prepared at 1500 rpm mixing speed with the concentrations (0. 3 wt%, 0. 5 wt%, 1. 0 wt % and 1. 5 wt%) for each emulsifier to test the stability conditions. Instead of stability; shear rate, shear stress and viscosity were determined by Brookfield Viscometer. On the other hand, the droplet size was carried out by using Digital Carl Zeiss Microscope. Result shows that Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate at 1. 5 wt % mixed with 70 - 30 % O/W obtained the most stable emulsion for transportation compared to the other two. Then, properties of heavy crude oil were tested via Fourier Transfor...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 <b>Wax</b> {{deposition}} during <b>crude</b> {{oil production}} {{is a major}} problem that has plagued the oil industry for decades especially in cold environments such as Alaska North Slope (ANS) fields, with adverse consequences in huge mitigation cost and lost production. It is therefore imperative to adequately and accurately identify the conditions for wax precipitation and deposition in order to optimize operation of the production systems of ANS. In order to assess ANS <b>crude's</b> potential for <b>wax</b> precipitation, Viscometry and Cross Polarization Microscopy (CPM) are used to determine the temperature at which paraffins begin to precipitate from ANS dead oils. Wax dissolution temperatures (WDT) are also determined by CPM. Results show that wax precipitation is possible at temperatures as high as 41 °C (106 °F) while it takes up to 50 °C (122 °F) to get all waxes back into solution. The CPM technique was more sensitive while Viscometry results did not provide a high level of certainty in some samples and therefore appear over-estimated relative to CPM results. Previous thermal history was observed to influence test results. Pour point, viscosity, density and specific gravity have also been measured. Pour point results indicate that oil could form gel in the temperature range 12 °C (53. 6 °C) to less than - 31 °C (- 23. 8 °F) ...|$|R
40|$|The lipid {{fractions}} {{extracted from}} mixed (white and non-containing tannin red) and white grain sorghum (GS) whole kernel (WK) {{have been shown}} to possess cholesterol-lowering properties. As other varieties of GS-WK differ in their lipid composition, three studies were conducted {{to examine the effects of}} <b>crude</b> lipid (CL), <b>wax,</b> and oil fractions extracted from red GS-WK containing tannins on cholesterol metabolism by using a hamster model. In each study, hamsters were randomly divided into five groups (n= 11) each fed either a low fat AIN- 93 M diet (control), a AIN- 93 M diet with 10 percent fat and 0. 2 percent cholesterol (atherogenic) or an atherogenic diet supplemented with 1. 0, 3. 0, or 5. 0 percent (w/w) red GS-WK lipid fractions for four weeks. The addition of CL, wax and oil into atherogenic diets significantly lowered plasma non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL) and triacylglycerols. Hepatic cholesterol levels were also significantly reduced in response to CL and oil supplemented diets, but were not altered by the wax fraction. Analysis of fecal samples revealed a significant increase in cholesterol excretion in response to all the lipid-supplemented diets, suggesting that these fractions lower non-HDL cholesterol, in part, by preventing cholesterol absorption. However, analysis of several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism indicated that each fraction could also affect other pathways. The CL and oil fraction significantly upregulated the gene expression of hepatic bile acid synthesis, but the CL was also able to upregulate LDL receptors, whereas endogenous cholesterol synthesis was inhibited in the animals fed the wax-based diets. These results indicate that the all the lipid fractions extracted from red GS-WK not only reduced cholesterol absorption, but also regulated different pathways involved in cholesterol metabolism. Although phytosterols present in CL and oil have been purported to be the primary dietary lipids responsible for lowering cholesterol absorption, our results demonstrated that the policosanols present in the wax fraction induced a similar mechanism of action. Policosanols present in wax fraction are most likely to be suppressing cholesterol synthesis. However, other compounds, namely tannins, present in red GS-WK lipid fractions are probably acting additively/synergistically to remediate cholesterol markers induced by an atherogenic diet. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>crude</b> {{rice bran}} <b>wax</b> was {{obtained}} from M/S Bajaj rice mills, Gondia (MS) which was dark brown in color & contains nonwaxy impurities & fixed oil. After purification around 38 gm wax obtained which was almost white, light in weight and non-sticky. No instances of skin irritation or sensitization symptoms such as edema / rending of the skin were observed on the skin of Albino rabbits even after 24 hrs. Therefore wax was nontoxic & safe to use in pharmaceutical preparations. In the present study the melting range of rice bran wax {{was found to be}} 78 – 840 which is higher, may reduce the diffusion of drug across the layers of skin. Therefore, in the present study efforts will be made later on to reduce the melting range by addition of low melting point fats like mango kernel fat (M. P. 34. 7 oC). Solubility studies reveal that the wax is soluble in organic solvents like chloroform & petroleum ether showing typical solubility properties of waxes. Refractive index of a compound gives an idea of purity of the compound & the refractive index of the test sample was found to be 1. 44 at 70 oc. Sap value of rice bran wax is 68 – 72. The acid value of rice bran wax is 12 – 14. The iodine value of rice bran wax is 9 – 11. From the above data the physicochemical properties of rice bran wax was found to be within the range of other waxes used in topical preparations. Therefore rice bran wax may be utilized as a base in topical preparations. Different topical formulations such as ointments (oleaginous, modified hydrophilic ointment and modified bellers ointment base) were formulated with purified rice bran wax and compared with simple ointment (control) and marketed formulation. All these formulations contain 2 % diclofenac sodium. All the formulations were evaluated for p H rheological studies like apparent viscosity, spread ability and diclofenac sodium content. P H of all formulations was found to be 5. 98 – 7. 30, thus indicating the suitability for application on the skin. Diclofenac sodium content of all the formulations was found to be above 95 % indicating the suitability of the method adopted for preparing the formulations. Shelf life and release of diclofenac sodium content in vivo study will be made further...|$|R
