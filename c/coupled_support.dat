It {{must be noted that}} even though the GR refers to environmental concerns, the value of this payment in Italy depends on the value of the BPS (due to the application of the tunnel model of internal convergence, i.e., partial convergence of entitlement values). Therefore, since this aid varies based on the value of the entitlements associated with the land, its redistributive effect on farm income must be properly considered. Lastly, the redistributive payment and payment for areas with natural constraints were not activated. Other decisions are reported in Table  1.|$|E

40|$|When {{public goods}} are joint outputs of {{agricultural}} production, {{there is a}} trade-off between agricultural and non-agricultural provision of the public good. The principle of minimal price distortion in the reform of agricultural policies {{has led to a}} theoretical recommendation that public goods, if under-provided at agricultural free market level, should be promoted through non agricultural policies instead of agricultural policies. We show that the economies of scope between the agricultural production and the joint public good {{play a key role in}} determining the optimal way of providing this latter. If the policy designed is a non-agricultural policy, the production cost of the public good is higher than with an agricultural policy. If the policy designed is an agricultural policy, the production cost is lower but generates market effects. Under the assumption of strictly positive economies of scope, we show that the optimal policy is a mix of agricultural and non-agricultural policy. We confirm this result in the two-country case, demonstrating the optimal level of agricultural support for public good provision is strictly positive and lower than in the case of one country. multifunctionality, jointness, <b>coupled</b> <b>support,</b> protectionism, public good, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

Unfortunately, current system still can be quite fragile to unespected event, and unpredictable changes can be very disorienting at enterprise level.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a two-paper {{investigation of}} observed naturalistic marital support {{behavior in a}} sample of 30 dual-earner middle-class couples with school-aged children who were videotaped in their homes over 4 days (two weekdays, two weekend days). Couples also self-reported on marital satisfaction, job stress, and emotional distress, as well as provided salivary cortisol samples that permitted analysis of diurnal cortisol slopes. Study 1 entails the conceptualization, development, and implementation of a novel observational coding system for naturalistic marital support behavior that provides a comprehensive descriptive analysis of <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> interactions as they unfold in everyday contexts. Analyses indicate that support interactions were relatively rare, predominantly brief (< 30 seconds long), more often solicited than offered, mostly instrumental compared to emotional in content, and overwhelmingly positive versus negative in emotional quality. In addition, patterns were examined among the different support variables; in particular, findings counter the Support Gap Hypothesis and suggest that wives receive more support than husbands, due specifically to wives soliciting more support. Study 2 examines the predictors and outcomes of <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> behavior using the self-reported individual variables and diurnal cortisol slopes. Findings support the notion that emotional distress and job stress predict the support behavior of both spouses. Interesting sex differences emerged, whereby wives' depressive symptoms, wives' job stress, and husbands' neuroticism appeared to have the strongest influence on supportive behavior. However, analyses indicate little evidence for <b>couple</b> <b>support</b> behavior as a predictor of marital satisfaction and diurnal cortisol slopes.

40|$|International audienceAbstractSustainable {{development}} of agriculture {{is at the}} core of agricultural policy debates in Europe. There is a consensus that diversification of cropping would support sustainable development. However, a reduction in legume cultivation has been observed in the EU during the last decades. This decline has induced, in turn, a deficit of proteins and a reduction of ecosystem services provided by legumes. Therefore, we analysed the mechanisms that shape agricultural systems to identify leverage points for reviving European legume production. Specifically, we reviewed the factors that affect the market and non-market value of legumes and the relevant agricultural policies. We characterized the decline in legume cropping as an outcome of the dominance of economic forces that favour specialization of production systems over diversification. We found that the value of market outputs of legumes per unit area is relatively low and volatile, with a 25 – 78  % variation in pea gross margins, which reduces market competitiveness. We observed that the value of system-internal outputs of legumes such as the nitrogen fixed, of 130 to 153  kg N ha− 1; crop protection services that reduce agrochemical costs, by 20 – 25  % in cereals; and yield enhancements of subsequent crops, of 0. 2 to 1. 6  t ha− 1 in cereals, are often underestimated.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} {{by a team}} of academic experts from Western Balkan (WB) countries coordinated by the Regional Rural Development Standing Working Group (SWG) in South-East Europe. The study targets EU candidate and potential candidate countries from the Western Balkan region (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo*). The main objectives of the study is the monitoring and evaluation of agricultural policies in the period 2012 - 2014 and assessment of the related key EU integration issues of the region. The study also outlines policy recommendation relevant in the wider regional context of the agricultural sector development as well as with respect to the region's EU integration process. The study results reveal that no major shifts in production and farm structure took place in the region in the study period, however, some expansion of WB agricultural trade, which are mainly a result of stronger exports, are reported. All study countries have prepared and most have also adopted a new strategic framework for the future of agricultural policies with more elaborated focus on EU harmonisation process. However, there were not observed pronounced changes in the actual structure and the volume of budgetary transfers related to agricultural policies in the region in the study period 2013 - 2015. Compared with the support granted under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in EU, the total budgetary support in WBs is still relatively low. Direct payments linked to specific production sectors (<b>coupled</b> <b>support)</b> are the main type of agricultural support implemented in WB countries. The type of direct payments and supported sectors are under constant adjustment. However, the policy instruments' alignment of WB countries to CAP-like policy is limited. As a general rule, agricultural budgets are not development-oriented. The institutional limitations in the implementation of the IPARD pre-accession support, the lack of clear action plans for policy reforms and the absence of the evidence based policy approach to policy-making are a few areas constraining a better design and implementation of agricultural policies in WB and for which policy recommendations and future tasks are outlined in this studyJRC.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the {{measures}} provided for under new EU regulations in an attempt to address the problems arising for the agricultural producers by the CAP reforms of 2003 and 2013; with these reforms the Community radically modified the framework of its agricultural policy, substantially eliminating the (already reduced) forms of market management and making further substantial cuts in the amount of <b>coupled</b> <b>support</b> in favour of an almost sudden (and improvised) switch to a system of direct payments to farmers, largely decoupled from production, as a means of supporting the income of agricultural producers. As a result, the latter suddenly found themselves exposed and forced to operate not on a European scale but rather in a global market, and what is more without any forms of protection. These “new” factors have therefore aggravated the fragility of the agricultural sector, especially in the trade relations with counterparty buyers. The economic and cultural leap that the newly defined CAP implied for farmers was enormous and above all took place with a minimal transition period, {{as well as in the}} absence, for the most part, of adequate education and information about the new rules. The dismantling of the basic framework of the CMO (including price support and export refunds) has thus necessarily entailed introducing new instruments to protect agricultural producers: in the absence of any protection measure, they would be unable to survive in a particularly competitive world context in which European agriculture is at a disadvantage. The paper examines the provisions of EU Regulation No. 1308 / 2013 concerning agricultural and interbranch associations; the rules concerning the possible formalisation of contracts concluded with first purchasers of agricultural products; and the legislation concerning the power of POs to engage in contractual negotiations. The protection of agricultural producers is thus no longer – or not only – provided by instruments of public law, though these are present and take on a central role in the system. It progressively also involves reliance on contractual arrangements of a different nature and raison d'être, but which in any case are designed to furnish support to farmers, objectively the weakest party within the agricultural market. The paper ends with some brief considerations concerning the relationship between the rules governing supply contracts and agricultural associations and EU competition law, in particular as regards the specific antitrust provisions applicable to the agricultural sector following the reform of 2013...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the latest CAP review in the EU New Member States (NMS) represents not only {{a change in the}} form of payments (from fully coupled to partially decoupled payments) but also an increase in the level of payments received by farmers. It is expected that farm restructuring in the NMS will be accelerated as greater payments, given with no obligation to produce, might allow those farmers who are willing to exit the farming sector to get the required funds to do so. If so, this might also give those farmers willing to increase the size of their farm more opportunities to expand. However, the transition to a market economy in these countries being still quite recent, the conditions under which the policy is implemented present some specificity as markets are likely to be less than perfect. The objective of the paper is to understand what impact the change in policy will have in one of the NMS, namely Slovakia, taking into account the impact of some potential market imperfections. This question is considered by assessing commercial individual farmers’ willingness to increase their scale of farming. The investigation focuses on land only, and will be based on the intention of Slovak farmers to alter the land area they intend to farm in the future, in the context of continuing pre-accession policy (fully <b>coupled</b> <b>support)</b> and the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS, partially decoupled support). The determinants of the willingness to expand are estimated under different policy scenarios, as well as the determinants of a change in willingness to expand across scenarios. The analysis reveals that the determinants of the willingness to expand differ under coupled and decoupled policy as in particular the level of human capital does not seem to matter under SAPS. However, the introduction of SAPS might not greatly influence farm restructuring in Slovakia. Due to a less than perfect land market, farmers will have increased incentives to expand their farm and increased incentives to remain in farming. This means that farmers, despite their willingness to grow, {{might not be able to}} do so as land supplied by exiting individual farmers is unlikely to increase. However, the future supply of land also depends on the dynamism of other types of farms such as corporate farms...|$|E
40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the association between agricultural subsidies and farm technical efficiency (TE). We also investigate if any such association changes under different subsidy regimes, over time, and across countries. We focus on farms specializing on dairy over a period of 18 years (1990 to 2007) within 11 European Union (EU) countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK). The data are unbalanced panels from the European Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). We employ a stochastic input distance frontier (IDF) with endogenous subsidies following Kumbhakar and Lien (2010). EU farms have been highly subsidized since the inception of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Initial reliance on <b>coupled</b> <b>support</b> has shifted progressively toward decoupled mechanisms. Despite various CAP reforms, support to EU farmers remains relatively high. The Producer Support Estimates (PSE) hovered around 30 % in the mid 1980 s falling to 23. 5 % in 2009. This high level of farm support has prompted researchers to investigate the influence of the CAP along several dimensions with recent focus on the impact of CAP subsidies on farm efficiency and productivity. The theoretical literature linking farm subsidies and efficiency or productivity is thin. Martin and Page (1983) argued that subsidies reduce managerial effort and therefore negatively impact efficiency. More recently, Serra et al. (2008) suggest that support policies affect farmers’ risk-aversion and thus decisions regarding input allocation. The empirical literature is quite consistent in reporting that subsidies are generally negatively associated with farm TE (e. g., Latruffe, 2010). In this paper we choose a stochastic IDF with technical inefficiency effects. The model incorporates two outputs (milk and the revenues from all other products) and four traditional inputs (land, labor, cows and other input expenses). Following Kumbhakar and Lien (2010), subsidies are modeled as endogenous using a two step procedure (Cavatassi et al., 2011). We include subsidies in both the frontier and the inefficiency effects part of the IDF. The subsidy variable is total subsidies received by the farm over the total value of output, which represents subsidy dependency. The results show that the coefficients estimated for the (predicted) subsidy variable included in the IDF are non significant for France, Italy, Luxemburg and the UK. They are significant and negative for Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Spain. However, the coefficients are significant and positive for Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal. By contrast, the coefficients estimated for the subsidy variable included in the inefficiency effects are significant and positive for all countries. These results suggest that farms that are relatively more dependent on subsidies exhibit lower levels of TE and this is the case uniformly for all eleven countries...|$|E
