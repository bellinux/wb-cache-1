5000|$|The iBook {{had three}} {{different}} designs during its lifetime. The first, {{known as the}} [...] "Clamshell," [...] {{was inspired by the}} design of Apple's popular iMac line at the time. It was a significant departure from previous portable computer designs due to its shape, bright colors, incorporation of a handle into the casing, lack of a display <b>closing</b> <b>latch,</b> lack of a hinged cover over the external ports and built-in wireless networking. Two years later, the second generation abandoned the original form factor in favor of a more conventional, rectangular design. In October 2003, a third iteration was released that added a PowerPC G4 chip and a slot-loading drive.|$|E

5000|$|There are no {{reasonable}} {{means by}} which the door locking and latching mechanisms could open mechanically in flight from a properly closed and locked position. If the lock sectors were in proper condition, and were properly situated over the <b>closed</b> <b>latch</b> cams, the lock sectors had sufficient strength to prevent the cams from vibrating to the open position during ground operation and flight. However, there are two possible {{means by which}} the cargo door could open while in flight. Either, the latching mechanisms were forced open electrically through the lock sectors after the door was secured, or the door was not properly latched and locked before departure. Then the door opened when the pressurization loads reached a point that the latches could not hold.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the sequential {{ordering of}} multi-modal discussions in real-time online classes in postgraduate education contexts. The paper explores {{the ways that}} text and verbal talk are organised by the participants as inter-connecting modes of interaction. Focussing on Initiation, Response and Feedback sequences {{as an example of}} a form of exchange, the paper shows that the interaction was comparatively disorderly where conducted across talk and text modes. For instance, written responses to questions or to encouragement turns often overlapped with verbal answers from other students or with encouragement turns from the tutor. However, through the withholding of speech turns, the <b>close</b> <b>latching</b> of speech to written talk, and the ceasing of written turns at points where the topics or speakers changed, the participants showed a concern with re-establishing sequential order across the modalities...|$|R

40|$|A {{design of}} a micro {{latching}} fastener [...] a micro "mouse trap" [...] is presented, which has self-closing compliant latches that clamp a free planar part inserted between them. The selfclosing of the latches is induced by the insertion of the part which releases the potential energy stored in the "cocked" state of the device, {{in the manner of}} a mouse trap. The <b>closed</b> <b>latch</b> can re-open by cocking the micro mouse trap. The selfclosing action of the micro mouse trap allows the inaccurate insertion of the free part and leads to very accurate final positioning, with the insertion force required to induce the selfclosing being very small. The micro mouse trap is also reusable since the release of the clamped part is done non-destructively. The micro mouse trap can be used, for instance, for assembly and temporal clamping/positioning of micro-scale parts, and electromechanical/opto-mechanical connectors. 1 Introduction Surface etching technologies have been widely used in micro fabrication, and [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The {{most modern}} method of loading and {{unloading}} a revolver is {{by means of the}} swing out cylinder. The cylinder is mounted on a pivot that is parallel to the chambers, and the cylinder swings out and down (to the left in most cases). An extractor is fitted, operated by a rod projecting {{from the front of the}} cylinder assembly. When pressed, it will push all fired rounds free simultaneously (as in top break models, the travel is designed to not completely extract longer, unfired rounds).

40|$|To {{develop a}} recoverable, noninvasive medium to {{long-term}} tag attachment platform which would enable detailed data sets {{to be collected}} over {{extended periods of time}} (multiple days to multiple months) and would aid in understanding natural whale behaviors and assessing anthropogenic impacts on vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVES • To develop a peduncle style tag and tag deployment system as a means of attaching medium to long-term tags to free swimming whales. Two different systems are currently under development: 1) a pole deployed peduncle saddle pack tag for mid-sized whales 2) a net gun deployed towed telemetry buoy for large whales • To demonstrate the potential of the peduncle style tag as a benign medium to long-term, noninvasive tag attachment platform either through field trials or in a captive animal setting. APPROACH Peduncle saddle pack tag A padded harness will fit around the tail stock of the whale at the narrowest portion of the peduncle just before the fluke insertion point. To deploy the belt, a cantilevered pole mounted on the bow of a small inflatable will drop a spring loaded armature on the caudal terminus of the whale (Figure 1). Once triggered, the armature’s sickle shaped arms will <b>close,</b> <b>latching</b> a buckle under the whale’s belly. As the arms lift away, the elasticized belt is cinched to snugly secure the semi-rigid saddle housing the tag electronics to the dorsal ridge of the peduncle.

50|$|Crew {{preparations}} for the launch day began at 05:00 EDT following an eight-hour overnight sleep. An hour later they completed their final medical check ups. Crew suiting began around 10:00 EDT and the astronauts departed for the launch pad at 10:30 EDT. At around 11:00 EDT, first Commander Ham ingressed the shuttle first and strapped into his seat, followed by pilot Antonelli, Mission Specialists Bowen, Sellers, Reisman and Good in order. Inside the orbiter, all six astronauts performed checks with ground controllers to verify that communications links work properly. With all astronauts on board, Atlantis hatch was <b>closed</b> and <b>latched</b> for the flight. Inside the White Room, the closeout crew finished their job by pressurizing the crew cabin and checking for leaks before leaving the pad.|$|R
5000|$|Retry (shortcut key R): Attempts the {{operation}} again. [...] "Retry" [...] made sense if the user could rectify the problem. For example, if the user simply forgot to <b>close</b> the drive <b>latch,</b> they could <b>close</b> it, retry, {{and the system}} would continue where it left off. On early hardware, retrying a disk read error would sometimes be successful, but as disk drives improved, this became far less likely, although the message itself appeared less often.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} {{strike is}} an access control device used for doors. It replaces the fixed strike faceplate often {{used with a}} latchbar (also known as a keeper). Like a fixed strike, it normally presents a ramped surface to the locking latch allowing the door to <b>close</b> and <b>latch</b> just like a fixed strike would. However, an electric strike's ramped surface can, upon command, pivot {{out of the way}} when the lock on the door is in the locked position and the door is opened, allowing a user to open the door without operating the mechanical lock or using a mechanical key. After the door is opened past the keeper, the keeper returns to its standard position and re-locks when power is removed or applied, depending upon the strike's configuration.|$|R
50|$|When those {{tasks were}} completed, the two astronauts {{along with their}} colleagues inside the shuttle and station and flight {{controllers}} in Houston completed the final retraction of the starboard P6 truss element.

The successful folding paved the way to relocate the P6 truss to its permanent location during STS-120. All tasks were completed successfully on during the 7 hours, 58-minute EVA activities.|$|R
40|$|Switching-in of {{short-circuit}} current leads to pre-arcing in the switching device. Pre-arcing affects {{the ability of}} switchgear to <b>close</b> and <b>latch.</b> In three-phase systems, making is associated with transient voltage phenomena that may {{have a significant impact}} on the duration of the pre-arcing period. An analysis is presented of these transients. It was found that pre-arcing times in three-phase systems can be considerably prolonged with respect to a single phase situation. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the three-phase interaction has a moderating influence on the peak value of asymmetrical current. A test-circuit is described, able to perform three-phase synthetic make tests up to 245 kV at current up to 63 kA, representing all transient phenomena. Specific tests are described requiring the maximum available laboratory power: one with a circuit breaker subjected to direct test and one with a high-speed grounding switch subjected to synthetic tests...|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} week Southampton travelled to White Hart Lane to face European hopefuls Tottenham Hotspur. With kick-off delayed by {{half an hour}} due to an issue on the local motorway, the travelling side took the early initiative with Rickie Lambert coming <b>close</b> after <b>latching</b> onto a lofted ball by Nathaniel Clyne; Lambert came close again minutes later, as he saw a close-range free kick pushed by Hugo Lloris onto the post, and Steven Davis could not convert the follow-up. After the break the Saints continued to enjoy the majority of scoring opportunities, with a notable chance for Adam Lallana going astray, followed by a period of dominance for the hosts in which Clint Dempsey and Tom Huddlestone came close. In the final five minutes though, recently named PFA Players' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year and former Southampton player Gareth Bale scored his second in two against his old club when he broke away from Luke Shaw and fired a shot into the top corner of Southampton's net, subjecting them to a second defeat in a row.|$|R
