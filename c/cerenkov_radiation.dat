25|$|The first {{proposal}} {{concerning the}} effect of space radiation on the CNS was made by Cornelius Tobias in his 1952 description of light flash phenomenon caused by single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina. Light flashes, such as those described by Tobias, were observed by the astronauts during the early Apollo missions {{as well as in}} dedicated experiments that were subsequently performed on Apollo and Skylab missions. More recently, studies of light flashes were made on the Russian Mir space station and the ISS. A 1973 report by the NAS considered these effects in detail. This phenomenon, which is known as a Phosphene, is the visual perception of flickering light. It is considered a subjective sensation of light since it can be caused by simply applying pressure on the eyeball. The traversal of a single, highly charged particle through the occipital cortex or the retina was estimated to be able to cause a light flash. Possible mechanisms for HZE-induced light flashes include direction ionization and <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> within the retina.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that charged tachyons of extremely large mass M could not only contribute to the dark matter needed to fit astrophysical observations, but could also provide an explanation for gamma-ray bursts and ultra high energy cosmic rays. The present paper defines a quantum field theory of tachyons, of particles similar to ordinary leptons, but with momenta larger than energy. The theory is invariant under the full CPT transformation, but separately violates P and T invariance. Micro-causality is broken for space-time intervals smaller than M − 1, but is effectively preserved for larger separations. Charged fermionic, rather than charged scalar tachyons are considered {{in order to minimize}} the probability of <b>Cerenkov</b> like <b>radiation</b> by the tachyon, thereby permitting a high-energy tachyon to retain its energy over galactic distances.

The RICH detector used the <b>Cerenkov</b> <b>radiation</b> of charged particles to measure their velocity. Combined with the momentum measurement from the tracking detectors, the mass of the particle, and therefore its identity, could be determined. Charged particles produced Cerenkov light as they pass through a LiF window. Fourteen rings of thirty LiF crystals comprised the radiator of the RICH, and the four centermost rings had a sawtooth pattern to prevent total internal reflection of the Cerenkov photons.

40|$|Internal line {{shifts in}} quasars spectra {{have played a}} more {{prominent}} role {{in our understanding of}} quasar structure and dynamics. The observed different redshift among broad hydrogen lines is still an amazing puzzle in the study of quasars. We have argued that the broad hydrogen lines, as well as the low-ionization lines in quasars, are significantly contributed by the Cerenkov quasi-line emission of the fast electrons in the dense clouds/filaments/sheets (N_ H≥ 10 ^ 14 cm^- 3); whereas this line-like radiation mechanism is invalid for producing the high ionization lines. In order to account for redshift difference, the <b>Cerenkov</b> line-like <b>radiation</b> mechanism could provide a plausible resolution: it is the `Cerenkov line redshift', which is different from line to line, causes the peculiar redshift-differences among Lyα, Hα and Hβ lines. The different redshifts among different broad hydrogen lines could stand for an evidence to quantitatively support that the observed broad hydrogen lines should be blended by both the real line emission and the Cerenkov quasi-line emission. The good fitting to the observed redshifts of quasars confirms the existence of Cerenkov component in the broad hydrogen lines, which indicates that, in the blended Lyα line, the line-intensity of the Cerenkov component approximately equals that of the accompanying `normal line' (an approximate equipartition of intensity between the two components in the broad Lyα line). This result illustrates the importance of the Cerenkov component in the broad lines of quasars, which can be further confirmed by future observations. Comment: 18 pages, 1 figure, Submitte...|$|R

A temporal correlation with heavy nuclei or protons has been documented in space and comparable phosphenes were observed by volunteers whose eyes were exposed to accelerated heavy ions at intensities below the threshold for <b>Cerenkov</b> visible <b>radiation.</b> An interaction between heavy ions and the retina was suggested. However, the biophysics of heavy ions or protons action remains undefined, the effects on photoreceptors and neuroretina have not been differentiated, and some direct action on the visual cortex never ruled out. Phosphenes are common in migraine and are known to occur also in response to the electrical stimulation of ganglion cells (in retinas without photoreceptors), optic pathways or visual cortex, with mechanisms that bypass the chemically gated channels. Intrinsic photosensitive ganglion cells exist in the retina of teleost fish and mammals. In the hypothesis of a peculiar sensitivity to subatomic particles of the visual system, phosphenes due to the activation of processes by-passing the photoreceptors would raise questions about human safety in space. The issue is particularly relevant with experiments of increasing duration being now operative in the International Space Station (ISS) and with plans of space travel outside the geomagnetic shield.

This meant that Individual neutrino-electron interaction candidate events could be studied on an event-by-event basis, starkly different from the month-to-month observation required in radiochemical experiments. Third, in the neutrino-electron scattering interaction the electron recoils in roughly the direction that the neutrino was travelling (similar to the motion of billiard balls), so the electrons [...] "point back" [...] to the sun.

The linear polarization analysis of the (111) reflex of Si at an observation angle #THETA# #approx# 21 shows good agreement of the measured averaged polarization directions and the effective degree of polarization with expectations within the kinematical theory of CPR. In particular, the polarization direction follows the hyperbolic pattern predicted for CPR emitted into the forward hemisphere. The experimental results are in contradiction with the <b>Cerenkov</b> model of <b>radiation</b> for which the pattern of polarization directions {{is expected to be}} radial. The nature of CPR is the coherent polarization bremsstrahlung induced by relativistic charged particles in a crystal.

This requirement rules out many diagnostics, such as wire scanners, thin foils which produce <b>Cerenkov</b> or transition <b>radiation,</b> and even some rf cavity diagnostics. Particularly difficult to diagnose are tightly-focused (r{sub b} << 1 mm), short-duration (psec) beams, such as those in state-of-the-art or next-generation particle colliders. In this paper we describe an ion probe that is capable of penetrating the space-charge field of densely bunched CPBs without perturbation, thereby enabling the measurement of the microstructure of the bunch. This diagnostic probe uses a finely-focused stream of ions to interact with the CPB. Related techniques have been discussed in the literature. In fact, the present work evolved from an electron deflection diagnostic for CPBs that we previously described. A similar electron probe was tested even earlier at TRIUMF and in the Former Soviet Union. Electron probes have also been used to measure plasma sheaths and potentials and the neutralization of heavy ion beams. Also, Mendel has used an ion beam (22 keV He{sup +}) to probe rapidly varying fields in plasmas. The probe ions are injected across the beam tube and into the path of the high-energy CPB. The ions are deflected by the CPB, and the direction and magnitude of the deflection are directly related to the spatial and temporal charge distribution of the CPB.
