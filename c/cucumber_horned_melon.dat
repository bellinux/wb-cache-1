50|$|Despite its aridity, the Kalahari {{supports}} {{a variety of}} flora. The native flora includes acacia trees and many other herbs and grasses. The kiwano fruit, {{also known as the}} <b>horned</b> <b>melon,</b> melano, African <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber,</b> jelly <b>melon,</b> or hedged gourd, is endemic to a region in the Kalahari Desert (specific region unknown).|$|R
5000|$|Cucumis metuliferus, <b>horned</b> <b>melon</b> or kiwano, also African <b>horned</b> <b>{{cucumber}}</b> or <b>melon,</b> jelly melon, hedged gourd, melano, is {{an annual}} vine in the cucumber and melon family, Cucurbitaceae. Its fruit has horn-like spines, {{hence the name}} [...] "horned melon". Ripe fruit has orange skin and lime green, jelly-like flesh with a refreshingly fruity taste, and texture similar to a passionfruit or pomegranate. C. metuliferus is native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It is now grown in the United States, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Chile, Australia, and New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Cucumis is a genus of twining, tendril-bearing {{plants in}} the Cucurbitaceae family which {{includes}} the cucumber (Cucumis sativus), muskmelons (Cucumis melo, including cantaloupe and honeydew), the <b>horned</b> <b>melon</b> (Cucumis metuliferus), and the West Indian gherkin (Cucumis anguria).|$|R

This ritual {{consisted}} of mothers killing the tsetse flies and sprinkling them on <b>horned</b> <b>melon.</b> They would feed their children this delicacy. This ritual is still practiced today in some sub-Saharan tribes.|$|R

Zinc, calcium and magnesium are three of the most important minerals essential for good health and just happen to be found in kiwano <b>horned</b> <b>melons.</b> Magnesium aids in the absorption of calcium by the body while zinc actively supports the body’s immune system.' ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} natural mass losses of shortly stored fresh fruits and berries and to evaluate the influence of temperature and carbon dioxide concentration on the natural mass losses when storing apples of various cultivars. There were investigated natural mass losses of apricots, pineapples, oranges, avocados, bananas, persimmons, lemons, figs, pomegranates, grapefruits, carambolas, <b>horned</b> <b>melons,</b> kiwi, pears, sweet kinkanus, lychee, mandarins, mangoes, nectarines, apples, papajas, peaches, plums, sweet cherries, cherries, grapes, red and black currants, when storing for short period in wholesale enterprises and modeling var-ious storage conditions at the Lithuanian Institute of Horticulture. The investigations were carried out in 1997 – 2007...|$|R
5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as <b>horned</b> <b>melon,</b> gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Microorganisms {{associated}} with the production of volatile organic compound in spoilt African <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber</b> have been isolated by standard plate count (SPC) and identified. The mean aerobic colony count observed for bacteria ranged from 3. 3 to 8. 3 x 10 7 CFU/g while those of fungi ranged from 4. 0 x 10 3 to 1. 1 x 10 4 CFU/g. The organisms isolated and identified included three species of bacteria (Bacillus lentus, Bacillus firmus and Paenibacillus alveii) while three of fungi (Rhizopus stolonifer, Mucor circinelloides, and Monascus ruber). GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 11 volatile organic compounds in the healthy ripe African <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber</b> and 21 volatile organic compounds in spoilt African <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber.</b> Six volatile organic compounds were common to spoilt and healthy African <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber</b> while 1, 2, 3, trimethyl benzene, Decane 1, 4 -Dimethyl- 2 -ethyl benzene, tetralin, 6 - methyl tetralin, phenyl benzene (Lemonene), 2, 3 -dimethylnaphthale (Guajen), (1 -Ethyl- 2 -methyl- 1 -propenyl) benzene, Diphenyl methane (Ditan), Hexadecane, Heptadecane, 6 -octadecanoic acid (Z) and 1 -Nondecanol were unique to spoilt African <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber</b> fruits. This study suggests that these unique volatile organic compounds could provide baseline knowledge for curbing postharvest losses and the volatile organic compound could {{form the basis for}} constructing a metabolomics database for Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} the greenhouse. In one experiment, cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber</b> (C. metuliferus) cultigens were evaluated for resistance to four root-knot nematode species (Meloidogyne arenaria, M. hapla, M. incognita, and M. javanica), and, in a second experiment, a standard (12 -week) test was compared with a rapid (6 -week) test. In the first experiment, <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber</b> cultigens varied {{in response to the}} Meloidogyne species. 'Sumter' cucumber was more susceptible than the <b>horned</b> <b>cucumber</b> to Meloidogyne incognita, M. javanica, and M. arenaria. All cultigens were more resistant to M. hapla than to the other root-knot nematode species. In the second experiment, best results were obtained when the test was run for 12 weeks rather than 6 weeks after planting (or 10 and 4 weeks after inoculation, respectively). All cultigens were more resistant to M. arenaria than to either M. incognita or M. javanica...|$|R
