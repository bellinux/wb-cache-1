40|$|With the {{expansion}} of the fleet of electric and hybrid electric vehicles worldwide, it is of interest to consider recycling aspects of the parts that are introduced in these new vehicles. This paper focuses on the design of an electrical machine, a <b>claw-pole</b> <b>motor,</b> considering recycling of its components. The suggested design has segmented core parts of soft magnetic composites which yield a design very suitable for recycling as the core material is brittle and it thus simplifies the access of the copper winding. The windings are pre-formed ring-coils with a high fill-factor and with no end-windings. Through the use of direct water cooling, employing space between the claws, the current density can be high, and the machine can be compact. The results of finite element simulations of the electromagnetic properties (previously validated against measurements) show that a high performance recyclable motor with ratings above 10 kW can be made. In comparison with a commercial motor, the <b>claw-pole</b> <b>motor</b> has similar performance, a higher core and magnet weight and a lower copper weight. It also has an expected advantage regarding manufacturing cost and cost of recycling and it has lower copper loss...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} static and dynamic characteristics of a two-phase <b>claw-pole</b> <b>motor.</b> The static characteristics are calculated and measured respectively for a single phase-core assembled into the motor and for a complete motor. The dynamic characteristics of the motor are evaluated on the basis of non-linear static characteristics. Later, the control system that is designed in simulation environment is implemented in Real Time dSpace control environment. Some design issues are studied in order to improve the existing motor desig...|$|E
40|$|The main {{advantage}} of claw-pole machines lies {{in their ability}} to yield higher torque density values than is obtainable from a conventional machine. However, the high torque density has its price; leakage flux is often high resulting in low power factor and efficiency. This thesis is mainly concerned with the design of a <b>claw-pole</b> <b>motor</b> that meets application requirements of reasonably high torque density and a power factor comparable to conventional topologies. After critically reviewing previously proposed designs of Transverse-flux and Claw-pole machines, the thesis focuses on a special type of claw pole motor having claws in both the stator and the rotor. The claws are made of Soft Magnetic Composites (SMC); consisting of iron powder particles that are individually insulated and can be readily pressed into complex geometries. Detailed explanation of the operation of such a design is then provided. Internal design of the <b>claw-pole</b> <b>motor</b> is investigated with the aid of three-dimensional finite-element field computation. In particular, the effect of the following parameters on the motor's performance has been investigated: number of poles, main dimensions, magnet material and dimensions, pole-face profile and claw angle. This theoretical work was verified, to some extent, against measurements obtained from an experimental machine especially constructed for this purpose. Details of this experimental motor are also presented. The investigation of the internal design of the claw-pole motors presented in this thesis provides a physical insight into their operation and, therefore, can be utilised for their general design. Indeed, this work enabled realisation of a claw-pole servomotor that is capable of achieving a torque density of about 1. 5 Nm/Kg at a power factor of 0. 9. The decisions made in arriving at the servomotor design are presented and clearly related to the conclusions of the internal design investigation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{total core}} loss in a claw-pole {{structure}} has been calculated {{on the basis}} of the variation of the magnetic loading over the magnetization cycle in different parts of the machine. This variation has been estimated from a lumped parameter permeance network and 3 D finite element simulations, studying the flux density waveform and loci in their elements. The results from the simulations are compared with the loss measurements in a single-phase <b>claw-pole</b> <b>motor</b> equipped with an outer permanent-magnet rotor. Results show that the static and dynamic losses are underestimated by 35 % and up to 60 % at 100 Hz respectively. Finally, the results from an optimization process are presented, where the torque performance is evaluated as a function of the pole number and dimensions of the machine.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} {{presented}} in this thesis is to evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of using powder technology {{in the design of}} the iron core of small claw-pole electric motors. The use of soft magnetic composites (SMC) and compaction technology allows the creation of complex 3 D iron cores. The additional dimension opens for new solutions of the electromechanical energy conversion. A <b>claw-pole</b> <b>motor</b> among the transversal flux machines that has particularly high specific torque is in the focus of research interest. Generally, as the iron core can be more complicated, the winding is chosen to be simpler in the powder core motors. The thesis focuses on the machine design of a single-phase and a two-phase low-power <b>claw-pole</b> <b>motor.</b> The predicted results compare well with measurements of the prototype motors. The motor design process in this thesis uses a magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model of the outer-rotor claw-pole motors that is accurate enough to describe the physics of the electromagnetic conversion. Additional equivalent circuits are made to evaluate the mechanic and thermal loading of the machines. The outcome of the equivalent circuit models is enough to estimate roughly the optimal size of the motor and the motor output according to the materials selected. After the rough design process, which is based on equivalent circuits, is finished, a series of FE magnetostatic analyses are made in order to evaluate the static characteristics of the motors, to specify the magnetization losses and to carry out a sensitivity study for the proposed size of the motors. Finally, the magnetic, mechanic and thermal design is analyzed dynamically and statically by the use of coupled multiphysics. The task of the coupled multiphysics is to find out the cooling capability and the thermal limit of the motor as well as the mechanic stress in the motor parts due to magneto-mechanic loading. It is discussed how the discrepancy between the calculated and measured cogging torque depends on the fineness of the 3 D FE air gap mesh. Iron loss estimation based on the results of the FE-analysis is made taking the local rotation, and not only pulsation, of the magnetic flux into consideration. It is shown that the loss coefficients in the material model must be adapted to account for flux rotation. A part from the output of the machine as an electromechanical energy converter is their controllability in the electric drive system. Based on the static characteristics, which are calculated in the FE-analysis and verified in prototype measurements, a tailor made control method is developed for the machines designed. Results are presented of extensive simulations and experimental verifications of the proposed control strategy and power electronic circuitry. The high-speed four-pole single-phase motor shows satisfactory results. The other motor, which has 20 poles and two phases, has a main weakness in its complex assembling and a large cogging torque...|$|E
