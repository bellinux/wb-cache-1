5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined {{about any of the}} other homicides, and only became interested in this one {{when it became clear that}} one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> at the age of 11. That's one thing.|$|E
5|$|Little Bee {{explains}} that although Nkiruka was gang raped, murdered, and cannibalised by the soldiers, she {{was allowed to}} escape, and stowed away in the cargo hold of a ship bound for England. Sarah allows Little Bee to stay with her, intent on helping her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little Bee in to the police. When he informs Little Bee that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, Little Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, Little Bee and Charlie take a trip to the park. Charlie goes missing, and Little Bee calls the police while Sarah searches for him. Although he is quickly found, the police become suspicious of Little Bee, and discover that she is in the <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b>|$|E

50|$|Bhutan {{has a low}} crime rate. Incidents of petty crime are {{occasionally}} {{reported in}} the country. Violent crime is very uncommon. Some cases of drug abuse are reported; alcohol abuse is a problem. But in general, drug trafficking is low. The most serious threat to Bhutan's security is terrorism by different terrorist groups from neighboring <b>countries</b> <b>illegally</b> camped in the nation.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{after the}} death of King Charles IX in 1611, some legal {{suspensions}} were offered for ambassadors from Catholic countries and their relatives for them to live their faith, as for a few merchants and mercenaries. Now, immigrants from Catholic <b>countries</b> <b>illegally</b> partaked in the liturgies at the embassies. However, with the Riksdag of 1617 , the rules were further restricted.|$|R
50|$|Triads {{are also}} active {{in other regions}} with {{significant}} overseas Chinese populations: Macau, Taiwan, Hong Kong Triads and countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Brazil, Peru and Argentina. They are often involved in helping immigrants enter <b>countries</b> <b>illegally.</b> Shanty & Mishra (2007) estimate that annual profits from narcotics is $200 billion; revenues from human trafficking into Europe and the United States are believed to amount to $3.5 billion per year.|$|R

50|$|The Myanmar-China {{border is}} {{notoriously}} porous and blurred. Although {{the more than}} ten million people travel across the official border Checkpoint is in Ruili each year, there is no wall or guard legitimizing political boundaries anywhere along the border. Because of this, the majority of migrants are thought to enter and exit the <b>countries</b> <b>illegally.</b> For most Kachins, this is a daily routine in order to sell there goods or find work in the vastly more developed nation of China.|$|R
50|$|Some {{originally}} went as humanitarian workers, {{while some}} of them were considered criminals in their home <b>countries</b> for <b>illegally</b> travelling to Bosnia and becoming soldiers.

30|$|Labour {{immigration}} {{is vital to}} many countries. Countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA are built on migration, on ‘good immigrants’. Refugees however are often perceived as ‘bad migrants”, as people who enter <b>countries</b> <b>illegally,</b> misuse social security and welfare provisions of these countries and threaten the well-being and even physical security of the law-abiding citizens of these countries. Often the public does not realise (or admit) that these people face prosecution, are displaced and depend on support from outside. It seems that the legal protection of refugees adds rigour to the attempt of countries to keep their borders tight and to prevent that such people even reach the territory of countries to seek the status of refugee. If they do so then there usually is a long process waiting for asylum seeker, which often deprive them of basic rights.|$|R
25|$|In 1986, Turkish {{soldiers}} and Greek soldiers sufferd casualties at the Evros River incident, due to fire exchange. Turkish and Greek soldiers have exchanged {{fire in the}} past, as Greeks have tried to stop Iranian refugees from entering the <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> from Turkey, but this incident {{was the first in}} which there have been casualties. During this period, Greek soldiers along the border with Turkey were on alert after receiving reports that Turkey planned to help thousands of refugees slip into Greece illegally.|$|E

On February 22, 1888, Shibell along with U.S. Deputy Marshal William K. Meade and deputies pursued men suspected of robbing a Southern Pacific train deep into Mexico. When they finally notified Mexican authorities of their purpose in Mexico, they were arrested for entering the <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b>|$|E

5000|$|While {{there are}} a {{multitude}} of factors that limit the ability of NGOs to respond to trafficking, such as lack of funding, extensive mandates, and lack of government support, NGOs play a critical supporting role for victims. [...] Most NGOs, which emerged during the 1990s, initially struggled to hold their ground against increasingly predatory traffickers. [...] While their success varies from country to country, NGOs are often credited with stepping in and taking initiative where governments have failed. Victims are often more likely to trust NGOs because [...] "many trafficked persons fear and distrust state-based organizations as they frequently enter destination <b>countries</b> <b>illegally,</b> or have had their documentation removed on arrival." [...] Fear of deportation, being forced to testify, or retaliation by their traffickers also contribute to their reluctance to approach statutory agencies for support. NGOs have risen to fill this gap and provide services to victims. Services they offer include: ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} results of a 2016 study {{examining}} high-resolution open-source satellite data from 2002 – 2013 for sites across Egypt that mapped looting and site encroachment. The author features a looted tripartite coffin (now returned to Egypt) to suggest how satellite imagery might narrow down or provide the general provenience of looted objects and their possible site origins. Mapping where looting has occurred, the intensity of the looting, and emerging future threats to sites are important, but there is no established method at present to work backwards from unprovenanced looted items. Through an assessment of when objects enter <b>countries</b> <b>illegally,</b> the time-period of the looted objects, and an analysis of satellite imagery looting data concerning their country of origin, it is possible to suggest a potential provenance for looted objects. This approach shows how satellite data can be integrated into traditional provenance research. This study presents a workflow for how other projects might utilize a similar approach in other countries...|$|R
25|$|The {{ineffectiveness}} {{of current}} employer sanctions for illegal hiring. This allows immigrants {{who are in}} the <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> to easily find jobs. There are three reasons for this ineffectiveness—the absence of reliable mechanisms for verifying employment eligibility, inadequate funding of interior immigration enforcement, and the absence of political will due to labor needs to the United States economy. For example, it is unlawful to knowingly hire an illegal immigrant, but according to Judith Gans, there are no reliable mechanisms in place for employers to verify that the immigrants' papers are authentic.|$|E
25|$|In January 2016, Mos Def {{was ordered}} to leave South Africa and not return for five years, having stayed in the <b>country</b> <b>{{illegally}}</b> on an expired tourist visa granted in May 2013. Also that month, {{he was charged with}} using an unrecognized World Passport and having lived illegally in South Africa since 2014. Mos Def had reportedly recruited Kanye West to help defend him, and posted a message on West's website announcing his retirement from show business. There is an ongoing court case in relation to immigration offences involving the artist and his family.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2005, Arpaio {{regularly}} conducted saturation patrols {{and immigration}} sweeps, targeting Latino neighborhoods and day laborers. Arpaio also ran many operations targeting businesses employing Latinos, and arresting employees who were unauthorized immigrants for identity theft. According to Arpaio, 100% {{of the persons}} arrested for using stolen IDs in 57 raids conducted up until March 2012 were in the <b>country</b> <b>illegally.</b> Until 2011, when a Federal District Court injunction halted the practice, Arpaio maintained an immigrant smuggling squad which illegally stopped cars with Latino drivers or passengers to check their immigration status.|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. People {{have been moving}} {{throughout}} history. These movements may be either obligatory due to natural disasters, wars and famines or voluntary such as the movements to find more fertile lands or new jobs. The movements {{of people have been}} limited by the immigration policies of receiving countries. Although developed countries are willing to accept migrant workers in economic boom years, they do their best to limit their entrance in stagnation periods. As a last resort, people use the deficiencies in legal and physical measures to enter the destination <b>countries</b> <b>illegally.</b> These people are mostly employed in the jobs shunned by the natives and therefore they are still welcomed implicitly. Receiving states try to prevent illegal immigration waves as they are seen {{as a threat to the}} sovereignty, and more recently, the security of the states. This thesis analyzes the measures to be taken in prevention of illegal migration and tries to bring new solutions to the problem. İşaşır, EmirM. S...|$|R
40|$|The article {{addresses}} the government's inability to control international migration. According to the author, {{the reality is}} that borders are beyond control and little can be done to really cut down on immigration. The author suggests that there must be a seismic shift in the way migration is addressed: governments must reorient their policies from attempting to curtail migration to coping and managing it to seek benefits for all. According to the author, this requires isolating key migration questions from the many other issues that attend the flows of humanity across national borders. The most compelling problems result from emigration from less developed to more developed countries. They arise in three areas: (1) skilled workers are legally emigrating, temporarily or permanently, to rich countries, (2) largely unskilled migrants are entering developed <b>countries</b> <b>illegally</b> and looking for work, and (3) there is the "involuntary" movement of people, whether skilled or unskilled, across borders to seek asylum. All three problems raise issues that derive {{from the fact that the}} flows cannot be effectively constrained and must instead be creatively accommodated...|$|R
50|$|A joint UK-Indonesian {{study of}} the timber {{industry}} in Indonesia as a whole in 1998 suggested that about 40% of the throughput of timber was illegal, with a value in excess of $365 million. More recent estimates, comparing legal harvesting against known domestic consumption plus exports, suggest that 88% of logging {{in the country is}} illegal in some way. Malaysia is the key transit <b>country</b> for <b>illegally</b> logged wood products from Indonesia.|$|R
25|$|Ironically, as Corey's {{politics}} {{turned against}} his Stalinist beliefs, he ran {{afoul of the}} Federal prosecutors. In December 1950, Corey was served with a deportation warrant from the US Department of Justice charging {{that he had been}} in the <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> almost his entire life and for being a Communist. His father had come to the United States without obtaining naturalization papers and young Louis had decided against filing later due to his 1917 conviction as a conscientious objector. The case was tied up for years, and his application for a Certificate of Lawful Entry was denied under the McCarren Act.|$|E
25|$|Anjelica's mother, believing her {{likely in}} Mexico with the father, and also unable to {{communicate}} in English, never reported her missing. Margarita did claim {{that she and her}} family had searched for her daughter but were unable to locate her, for which she became the subject of much criticism and anger when Anjelica was identified in 2013. Other reports reveal that her family also neglected to report her missing, as some of the family members, including Margarita, were apparently illegal immigrants. They feared that if it was discovered that some were in the <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> during the course of an investigation, they would be deported.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{phenomenon}} {{in recent times}} has been the increase of foreign residents in Kuala Lumpur, which rose from 1% of the city's population in 1980 to about 8% in the 2000 census, and 9.4% in the 2010 census. [...] These figures also do not include {{a significant number of}} illegal immigrants. Kuala Lumpur's rapid development has triggered a huge influx of low-skilled foreign workers from Indonesia, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Philippines, and Vietnam into Malaysia, many of whom enter the <b>country</b> <b>illegally</b> or without proper permits.|$|E
