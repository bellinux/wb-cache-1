5000|$|When The World of Suzie Wong {{began to}} tour, Kwan was {{assigned}} {{the part of}} a bargirl. In addition to her small supporting character role, Kwan became an understudy for the production's female lead, France Nuyen. Though Stark and the male lead William Holden preferred Kwan, despite her somewhat apprehensive demeanor during the screen test, she did not get the role. Paramount favored the eminent France Nuyen, who had been widely praised for her performance in the film South Pacific (1958). Stark acquiesced to Paramount's wishes. Nuyen received the role and Kwan later took the place of Nuyen on Broadway. In a September 1960 interview with Associated Press journalist Bob Thomas, she said, [...] "I was bitterly disappointed, and I almost quit and went home when I didn't get the picture." [...] Kwan did not receive the lead role because Stark believed she was too inexperienced at the time. Nuyen won the title role in the upcoming movie because of her powerful portrayal of Suzie Wong during the tour. She moved to England to film the movie, leaving an opening for Kwan to ascend to the lead female role in the touring production. In 1959, one month after Nuyen was selected for the film role and while Kwan was touring in Toronto, Stark told her to screen test again for the film. Kwan responded to his phone call from London, asking, [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>come?</b> I'm <b>in</b> this show." [...] To provide a pretext for Kwan's sudden hiatus from the touring production, Stark sent a cablegram to her superiors saying her father had become ill and had been hospitalized. Kwan later recalled in an interview about three years later, [...] "So I went to the manager and told him a lie. It was not very nice, but what could I do?" [...] After Kwan accepted the role, the Broadway play producer sued her for leaving with little notice.|$|R
5000|$|The Fingal Independent {{labelled}} him a [...] "big name signing" [...] who was [...] "regarded as {{a consummate}} professional by commentators in the game". The club's commitment to supporting players wanting {{to further their}} education allowed him to continue his studies alongside his football: [...] "I'm in DCU, doing a degree in business, which I'm halfway through. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and train, {{then go on to}} college and catch up on any lectures I've missed and stay as late as I want in the library." [...] In that season's FAI Cup, Kirby scored twice in the quarter-final against Shamrock Rovers, and in the semifinal, against Bray Wanderers, he set up his club's first goal, was involved in the second, and scored the third, before leaving the field through injury. Fingal finished third in the First Division, and beat Shelbourne and Bray Wanderers in the playoffs to earn promotion to the Premier Division after only two years in the League. Kirby was a late substitute in the second leg of the final, having missed the earlier matches with a foot injury, and won his third FAI Cup-winners' medal as an unused substitute, as Sporting Fingal beat Sligo Rovers with two late goals.|$|R
