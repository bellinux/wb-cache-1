30|$|DEA is a {{non-parametric}} {{mathematical programming}} method {{for measuring the}} relative efficiency of DMUs with multiple inputs and outputs that does not require any assumptions about a priori information {{on the importance of}} inputs and outputs. The advantage of non-parametric approaches is that they do not assume functional forms of the frontier. The definition of a DMU is generic and flexible and includes different <b>consumable</b> <b>or</b> non-consumable inputs and outputs. A set of weights are determined and the outputs and inputs are aggregated separately with regard to these weights to form a ratio as efficiency (Cooper et al. 2007).|$|R

Each agent is a potential producer and consumer of a service (<b>or</b> <b>perishable</b> good) but has stochastic preferences that determines his taste for the good in each period in time. Money serves as a medium of exchange as well as a store of value. We prove existence of stationary fix-price equilibria with exogenously given quantity of money in which transactions can take place at non-Walrasian prices. Precautionary savings, under- and oversupply, dynamics on money holdings, and the e#ects of changes in the quantity of money are discussed. JEL-Classification: D 51, E 41, E 52.

If the newspaper vendor stocks too much, these newspaper may end up worthless {{by the end of the}} day as they are no longer up-to-date. However, if the newspaper vendor stocks too little, he misses the opportunity too make more profit and suffer loss of goodwill.|$|R

The new church was first mentioned in a document dating to AD 967. The first mention of a castle on the hill is an indirect reference to the church of St. Mary of Castrum Felix ("Fortunate Castle" [...] in Latin). Archaeologists have not identified any remains of this early castle, suggesting that it may have been just a tower <b>or</b> <b>perishable</b> fortification, <b>or</b> that it stood on the highest part of the hill, located within the present-day castle courtyard, the bedrock of which was levelled during the 16th century.|$|R

40|$|In {{processing}} industries, {{plant location}} decisions are costly and have consequences for firm profitability. When raw materials are heavy <b>or</b> <b>perishable,</b> transportation costs limit shipping distances and processors must compete locally for raw material inputs. To determine the likely profitability {{of a new}} plant, a processor must forecast the effect entry will have on local post-entry raw material price. This requires anticipating how entry will affect market structure and intensify competition for raw materials. Using an econometric representation of game-theoretic Nash equilibria relating input prices to processor competition in local procurement areas, an empirical model is developed to ex ante forecast the likely impact of entry on input price. The methods developed are applicable {{to a wide variety}} of industries where historic data are available. input price, entry, Agribusiness, Industrial Organization, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the formulation and {{solution of the}} Combinatorial Multi-Mode Resource Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem. The focus of the proposed method is not on finding a single optimal solution, instead on presenting multiple feasible solutions, with cost and duration information to the project manager.

The proposed approach empowers the project manager to determine what is optimal, on a given day, under the current constraints, such as, change of priorities, lack of skilled worker. The proposed method utilizes a simulation approach to determine feasible solutions, under the current constraints. Resources can be non-consumable, <b>consumable,</b> <b>or</b> doubly constrained.
