40|$|Abstract: - Solid biomass {{continues}} to be the primary energy source for a significant proportion of Sub-Saharan African society. It is estimated that 80 % of energy for heating and cooking in this subcontinent is derived from round wood biomass resulting in estimated annual rate of deforestation of 0. 7 %. This is unsustainable. This is despite the existence of a substantial resource of loose biomass (forest and agricultural residues) that is produced and disposed of annually. However, one major challenge in harnessing loose biomass as a source of energy is low energy density and poor <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Biomass briquetting technologies can be deployed to improve energy density and <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviour</b> of loose biomass. This requires understanding of the energy content in locally available loose biomass sources. This paper investigates the calorific values (energy content) and <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviour</b> of loose biomass collected from a region in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The aim of the investigation is to understand the energy value and hence viability of using such loose biomass with the overall goal of developing recipes for biomass briquetting in the region. Calorific values were measured for 12 samples of loose biomass and their <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviour</b> analysed. Certain loose biomass sources are then identified as potential briquetting candidates...|$|E

A {{wide range of}} qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative testing techniques are currently available, both at the laboratory scale and for commercial purposes, for evaluating the decomposition and <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviours</b> of polymeric materials. They include, {{but are not limited}} to, techniques such as: thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), oxygen bomb calorimetry, limiting oxygen index measurements (LOI), Underwriters Laboratory 94 (UL- 94) tests, cone calorimetry, etc. However, none of the above mentioned techniques are capable of quantitatively deciphering the underpinning physiochemical processes leading to the melt flow behaviour of thermoplastics. Melt-flow of polymeric materials can constitute a serious secondary hazard in fire scenarios, for example, if they are present as component parts of a ceiling in an enclosure. In recent years, more quantitative attempts to measure the mass loss and melt-drip behaviour of some commercially important chain- and step-growth polymers have been accomplished.

40|$|<b>Combustion</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{of single}} {{particles}} (125 – 150  μm) of eucalyptus, pine and olive residue were investigated {{by means of}} a transparent visual drop-tube furnace, electrically heated to 1073  K, and a high-speed camera coupling with a long distance microscope. All three types of biomass samples were found to have two evident combustion phases, i. e., volatile combustion in an envelope flame and subsequent char combustion with high luminance. Yet, due to differences in chemical compositions and properties, their <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviours</b> were also seen somewhat discrepant. The volatile flame of the olive residue was fainter than that of pine and eucalyptus due to its high ash mass fraction. During the char combustion phase, fragmentation took place for most pine particles but only for a few particles of olive residue and eucalyptus. For all three types of biomass samples, the flame size and the average luminous intensity profiles were deduced from the captured combustion video images whilst the combustion burnout times of the volatile matter and char were also calculated and estimated. There were two peak values clearly shown on the profiles of both the flame size and the average luminous intensity during the volatile combustion process of pine and eucalyptus particles, which, according to literature, could not be observed by optical pyrometry. The observed peaks correspond to the devolatilisation of hemicellulose and cellulose. The ratio between the estimated char burnout time and volatile combustion time increases quadratically with the fixed carbon to volatile matter mass ratio, confirming char combustion is much slower than volatile combustion...|$|R

By employing high-speed Schlieren and OH visualization, together with surface-mounted pressure transducers, links between the flow and the combustion features could be drawn.

A three-dimensional numerical model is developed to simulate the flow and combustion of a binary coal blend, and validated using measurements from a pilot-scale combustion test rig for three cases. Rather than treating the blend as a single coal with weighted-average properties of its components, in this model, the two component coals in the blend, with individual properties, are tracked separately and undergo individual chemical reactions using individual kinetics. As a result, this model is capable of providing individual information of component coals. In addition, this model includes coaxial lance and three gas streams.

40|$|Direct {{observation}} of pulsed-laser ignition and combustion of pulverized coals {{with a high}} speed video has been made. A dilute stream of particles was dropped into a laminar, upward-flow wind tunnel with a quartz test section. The gas stream was not preheated.

The ignition and <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviours</b> of amorphous carbon spheres and an anthracite were as expected for heterogeneous ignition and reaction. Surprisingly, the reaction of a high volatile bituminous and a subbituminous coal exhibited two broad emissions, as detected with a photomultiplier tube. For these coals, high speed videos revealed that two successive clouds of volatiles surrounded the particles, and each cloud was associated {{with one of the}} broad emissions. It is hypothesized that the first cloud was due to the evolution and reaction of tar, and the second resulted from low molecular weight, combustible gases.

Gas composition is sensitive to oxygen enrichment and use of oxygen as cooling gas. The results are then compared to the previous studies. The underlying mechanisms are explored.

The willow sample was pretreated to remove salts and metals by hydrochloric acid, and this demineralised sample was impregnated with each individual metal at the same mol g biomass (2. 4 × 10 mol g demineralised willow). Characterisation was performed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential thermal analysis (DTA) for combustion. In pyrolysis, volatile fingerprints were measured by means of pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (PY-GC-MS).

Most notably, both potassium and phosphorous strongly catalysed the pyrolysis, modifying both the yield and distribution of reaction products. Temperature programmed combustion TGA indicates that combustion of biomass char is catalysed by all the metals, while phosphorus strongly inhibits the char combustion.

40|$|Catalytic {{combustion}} is {{a promising}} combustion technique in gas turbines, {{which results in}} ultra low levels of NOx, CO and unburned hydrocarbons. Due to the low combustion temperature achieved in catalytic combustion almost no thermal NOx is formed. The focus in this thesis {{will be on the}} first stage in a catalytic combustion chamber, i. e. the ignition catalyst. The catalyst used for this application is often a supported palladium-based catalyst due to its excellent activity for methane combustion. However, this type of catalyst has a serious drawback; the methane conversion decreases with time during operation. The unstable activity will result in increasing difficulties to ignite the fuel. The objective of the work presented in this thesis has been to improve the catalytic performance of supported palladium catalysts, with focus on stabilizing the methane conversion. The first part gives a general background to gas turbines and catalytic combustion.

40|$|Torrefaction is a {{promising}} method {{for improving the}} quality of pulverised solid fuel, as it increases the flame stability, radiative heat transfer and energy density of the fuel. Raw sewage sludge contains less fixed carbon and more ash compounds than other biomasses; consequently, it has poor energy quality with a long ignition delay and forms a relatively low, sooty flame. In this study, we directly investigate the <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviours</b> of particles with varying degrees of torrefaction by burning them at 1340 K. The torrefied particles were prepared at different temperatures (473 K or 573 K) for different residence times (10 min or 30 min). The experimental parameters examined were the size range of the particles (150 – 215 μm and 255 – 300 μm) and the O 2 percentage (10 – 40 %). The particles were entrained from a cold carrier gas into a hot gas stream, igniting a volatile flame that was extinguished a few milliseconds later. These temporal variations in the burning particles were detected by in-situ high-speed photography (7000 frames/s). The torrefaction degree affected the flame structure and varied the ignition delay, due to the mismatched reactivity and soot formation at rapid heating rates. The most torrefied sludge particles exhibited a relatively luminous volatile cloud and a large flame, while preserving the duration of volatile combustion. These observations confirm the improved pulverised combustion of the torrefied sludge particles. We also obtained valuable flame parameters (radius, intensity and combustion time) of the differently torrefied sludge particles...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{monitoring}} and diagnosis of combustion stability in combustion {{systems such as}} fossil-fuel fired boilers, gas turbines and combustion engines are crucial to maintain the system safety, combustion efficiency and low emissions, particularly under variable operation conditions. Considerable efforts have thus been made in developing techniques for online {{monitoring and}} diagnosis of the stability of a combustion process. Among those, flame imaging conjoined with image processing and soft computing techniques has been paid much attention for both laboratorial and industrial applications. Some imaging and soft computing techniques have been proposed for combustion state monitoring, {{but most of them}} can only detect a single-mode condition. However, modern combustion systems often operate under variable conditions (i. e., multi-mode process). Due to the dynamic nature of the combustion process, single-mode monitoring methods often mistakenly determine some normal <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviours</b> as abnormal ones. The recent trend of using a variety of fuels, including low quality coals, coal blends, and co-firing biomass and coal, has further deteriorated this issue. 	In this study, a method based on flame imaging and soft-computing techniques for multi-mode combustion process monitoring is proposed. Flame images are acquired using a flame imaging system. Mean intensity values of RGB image components and texture descriptors are extracted and computed from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix. Such features are then used as inputs to a combined PCA-KSVM (principle component analysis-kernel support vector machine) model for multi-mode process monitoring. In this method, the PCA serves for eliminating the impact of noise and instabilities on the mode recognition. The KSVM identifies the combustion mode by using the scores of the features in the principle component subspace. Finally, two multivariate statistic indices, T 2 and SPE, are computed and used to assess the stabilities of the combustion process. The proposed approach has been examined by using flame images obtained on the UKCCSRC PACT 250 kW PF (pulverised fuel) test rig under different operation conditions (e. g., variations in the primary air and secondary-territory air split). Test results have shown that the computed image features represent well the dynamic behaviours of the flame, and that the PCA-KSVM model has outperformed conventional methods in monitoring the multi-mode combustion process...|$|R
40|$|Pulverized coal {{injection}} (PCI) {{technology is}} widely used in ironmaking blast furnaces due to its various benefits. Therefore it is natural to seek further improvements to maximise its benefits. An extensive study has discovered that PCI technology can be further improved by co-firing coal with coal blends, charcoal and other injectants. Effects of these injectants have been experimentally studied to reveal the complex in-furnace physicochemical phenomenon. However these studies are insufficient in describing the key governing phenomena. Hence numerical studies is preferred to overcome the limitations. In {{the first half of}} this thesis, the <b>combustion</b> <b>behaviours</b> of coal blends and charcoal are investigated in a pilot-scale test-rig using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3 D CFD) model. The results show that the combustion efficiency of ternary blends is higher than binary blends by 4 - 8 % for the same fraction of highest volatile coal due to the higher synergistic effect. The combustion efficiency of charcoal is found to be higher than coal by 10 % for the same volatile matter content and sizing due to the faster char combustion. A raceway is a cavity formed from the injection of a high speed jet into the packed coke bed. Blast furnace operation is heavily dependent on the supply of heat and gas from the raceway to the surrounding coke bed for the smelting purpose. Therefore when the PCI is used, the combustion of coal inside the raceway is important for determining the heat and gas distributions. The majority of past studies have focused on the effect of PCI technology on the raceway formations. Therefore in the latter half of this thesis, the effects of raceway shape and size on the PCI performances are investigated. The PCI in the raceway is simulated in a full-scale 3 D CFD model. The results indicate that the combustion efficiency of coal can be improved with an enlarged recirculation zone and/or shortened jet and their extension. Increasing the raceway size is also found to improve the combustion efficiency as the particle travelling time is extended. The findings in this thesis are helpful to understand and optimize PCI operations in practice...|$|R
