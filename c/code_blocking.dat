In this scheme, the code tree is divided into groups whose capacity is fixed and numbers of members (codes) are variable.

In an OVSF-CDMA-based system, each mobile station is assigned a single OVSF code. Variable data rates are supported by changing the spreading factor (SF). An alternative CDMA scheme known as multicode CDMA (MC-CDMA) [5] assigns multiple codes of the same spreading factor to a mobile station in order to achieve variable data rates. MC-CDMA requires multiple transceivers to support variable data rates.

Algorithm 1 aims to assign each flow a code whose affinity-mate codes can be easily assigned later to the flow in case of stringent delay requirements or poor channel conditions.
