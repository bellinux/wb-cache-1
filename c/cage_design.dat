2500|$|<b>Cage</b> <b>design</b> is {{important}} in preventing escape of juveniles and entry of predators and also shading of algal and seaweed on rocks. Recommended designs include cages with 8x8mm plastic mesh and an aluminium frame. Steel reef, plastic reef and plastic floating cages have proven ineffective as steel reef cages allowed high mortality from predator entry and plastic cages induced shading of the rocks algae and seaweed are attached to which results in low productivity. Suitable locations for reef cages are sand and rubble bottom reef bases exposed to less wave action [...] or fore-flat zones which are 10m behind the reef crest with water depths of 0 to 2.5m during spring-tides. Shifting sand and sediment deposition areas may smother foraging surfaces {{and need to be}} avoided when allocating cages;. Wind-ward sections of the reef flat are considered suitable sites. Floating cages require frequent cleaning to remove fouling species and allow high water flow and/ or nutrient flux for high algal biomass and quality. [...] Other environmental factors such as water temperature and salinity can have seasonal and episodic effects on the growth of the juveniles.|$|E

5000|$|The {{growth of}} the cultured {{individuals}} can depend on the density of juveniles in the cages and the likely causes are competition for food and space. An initial density of 100 trochus m-2 achieves a basal diameter of 10-20mm which can then be reduced to 50 trochus m-2 to yield basal diameters 25-40mm. Beyond this range a density of less than 10 trochus m-2 is recommended. Seaweed and algae are the main food and these grow on the dead corals and rocks which may occur naturally at the cultured sites or collected from adjacent areas and placed {{at the bottom of}} the cages. It is recommended that for cages with juveniles sized >30mm, these seaweed-covered rocks should be replaced 2 to 3 times a month and cover over 50% of the area. <b>Cage</b> <b>design</b> is important in preventing escape of juveniles and entry of predators and also shading of algal and seaweed on rocks.

40|$|Defining the {{physical}} suitability {{of an area}} for marine cage fish farming is of great importance, as each cage type has its own engineering tolerance levels and is designed {{to cope with a}} certain range of environmental conditions. Currently, there are no definitive, objective methods used to evaluate the suitability of coastal and offshore sites with respect to {{the physical}} limits of the location and the engineering design of a specific cage type. This study developed models which incorporate physical environmental parameters and <b>cage</b> engineering <b>design</b> within a GIS (graphical information system) environment, providing a valuable decision support tool for farmers, regulators and policy makers. The Western Isles of Scotland, UK, were selected as a study area due to the wide range of coastal and offshore environments. In addition, we selected 4 <b>cage</b> types <b>designed</b> for different wave exposure conditions (sheltered, moderately exposed, exposed and offshore). The models have been developed for worst-case scenarios, such as maximum significant wave height, conditions which are often difficult to predict. As shown in this study, the models can be used to assess the risk of using the selected cage type in a certain area and to highlight specific locations for development. The results indicate there is scope for further expansion of the aquaculture industry in the Western Isles using <b>cages</b> <b>designed</b> for exposed and offshore conditions, whereas there is limited potential for new developments using <b>cages</b> <b>designed</b> for moderately exposed environments.

ESTL has carried out a study of the influence of <b>cage</b> <b>design</b> on the behaviour of solid-lubricated bearings.

40|$|Abstract: During {{experimental}} Eimeria {{infections in}} chickens, facilities are often contaminated by fecal oocysts {{known to be}} highly resistant to both chemical and enzymatic treatments. Thus, studies using experimental Eimeria infections have been limited due {{to the difficulty of}} complete elimination of residual oocysts from both cages and facilities. To overcome this limitation, simple, inexpensive, and disposable cages were constructed from cardboard boxes and tested during experimental Eimeria maxima infections. The cages were used in animal rooms with only a 1. 7 % evidence of coccidia contamination between adjacent cages. No significant differences in fecal oocyst output and body weight gain were noted between animals housed in disposable cages and animals housed in wire control cages. This <b>cage</b> <b>design</b> is a useful means for preventing oocyst contamination during experimental conditions, suggesting that this disposable <b>cage</b> <b>design</b> could be used for other avian infectious disease studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Metal oxide surge arresters protect {{electric}} power systems from overvoltages. The conventional design of high voltage metal oxide surge arresters includes {{a stack of}} metal oxide non-linear resistors and a housing, either a porcelain hollow core insulator or a polymer hollow compound insulator (tube design). However, the technological progress in the polymer industry makes designs possible which are simpler and more cost effective. As {{an alternative to the}} above mentioned tube design, the active part of the arrester may be directly covered by silicone rubber. The <b>cage</b> <b>design</b> introduced here consists of a stack of metal oxide elements which are kept in between the aluminium end fittings under high mechanical pressure by pre-stressed fibre reinforced plastic rods. The silicone rubber sheds are then directly moulded onto the construction.

40|$|Experimental {{research}} on the orientation of migratory songbirds is traditionally conducted using orientation funnels or automatic registration cages that record the directional activity of individual birds on paper or a computer. Most traditionally used funnel and <b>cage</b> <b>designs</b> do not permit investigators to observe detailed behavior of the birds and, therefore, we have gained little insight into the actual behavior of birds while they are exhibiting migratory restlessness and making directional choices. Such behavior can only be studied by direct observation or by video filming.
