40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{quantitative assessment of}} the importance of adaptation to the learning environment as a component of the learning curve in performance data from a computer-based tutor. In Experiment 1, verbal protocols are used to investigate the nature of changes in low-level interactions that take place during learning with a <b>computerized</b> <b>tutor</b> called Stat Lady (Shute & Gluck, 1994). The data show consistent behavioral changes in the distribution of attention, which account for {{a substantial portion of the}} learning curve, independent of error rates. These changes primarily are decreases in the verbalization of on-screen text, although the elimination of interface confusion also contributes to the efficiency gain. Experiment 2 tests the generalizability of the results in a larger population of learners. It is shown that adaptation to the learning environmen...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulated}} {{student is}} a machine learning agent that learns {{a set of}} cognitive skills by observing solutions demonstrated by human experts. The learned cognitive skills are converted into a cognitive model for a Cognitive Tutor that is a <b>computerized</b> <b>tutor</b> that teaches human students the cognitive skills. In this paper, we analyze {{the characteristics of the}} effective demonstrations that lead to quicker and more accurate learning. Results from empirical studies show that expressive demonstrations (as opposed to abbreviated demonstrations that involve implicit mental operations) are better for both speed and accuracy of learning. We also found that providing multiple demonstrations of the same cognitive skill with differing surface features accelerates learning. These findings imply that the ordering of training sequence as well as the level of detail in demonstration determines the efficiency with which a simulated student generates a cognitive model. ...|$|E

50|$|In {{mathematical}} psychology, {{a knowledge}} space is a combinatorial structure describing the possible states {{of knowledge of}} a human learner.To form a knowledge space, one models a domain of knowledge {{as a set of}} concepts, and a feasible state of knowledge as a subset of that set containing the concepts known or knowable by some individual. Typically, not all subsets are feasible, due to prerequisite relations among the concepts. The knowledge space is the family of all the feasible subsets. Knowledge spaces were introduced in 1985 by Jean-Paul Doignon and Jean-Claude Falmagne and have since been studied by many other researchers. They also form the basis for two <b>computerized</b> <b>tutoring</b> systems, RATH and ALEKS.|$|R
40|$|In <b>computerized</b> <b>tutoring,</b> {{the pace}} of {{instruction}} {{is related to the}} student's mastery levels of the learning objectives. The observable student's behavior {{that can be used to}} measure his knowledge is usually his responses to test items. Unobservable variables that are related to learner's motivation can affect learning but are difficult to quantify. In comparison with other decision-theoretic tutoring systems, the novelties of this research are: (1) the efficiency-centric approach to develop the Bayesian networks; (2) the formulation of utility values for different tutoring outcomes that are independent of past actions and to satisfy the separability condition; (3) the development of a common measure for student's mastery levels and item difficulties; and (4) the generation of optimal policies in polynomial time. A prototype web-based tutoring system, known as iTutor, incorporating the novelties has been developed for engineering mechanics. Formative evaluations of iTutor have shown encouraging results.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{looked at}} factors {{influencing}} teachers ’ perception and usage of Project LISTEN’s Reading Tutor, a <b>computerized</b> <b>tutor</b> used with elementary students in 9 classroom-based, 10 computer lab-based, and 3 specialist-room school settings. Thirteen interviews and 22 survey responses (of a possible 28 teachers) examined teachers’ {{perception of the}} Reading Tutor and suggested that teachers ’ belief in the Tutor influenced their usage of it (r =. 46, p <. 03). Three factors seemed to influence teacher belief: 1) perceived ease of use (r =. 52, p <. 01), 2) teachers ’ reported experience with computers (r =. 41, p <. 04) and instructional technology (r =. 48, p <. 03), and 3) perceived technical problems such as frequency of technical problems (r =-. 44, p <. 04) and speed with which problems were fixed (r =. 49, p <. 02). Analysis of these factors suggested four themes that cut-across factors and seem to influence the way teachers evaluate and use the Reading Tutor – the technology’s degree of convenience, competition from other educational priorities and practices, teacher experience and/or interest with technology, and data available to teachers and the way teachers prioritize that data. These results suggest that improving convenience of the Reading Tutor, instituting specialized training programs...|$|E
30|$|The work of Yerushalmy (2006) {{focuses on}} a tool based on graphs to help {{students}} solve algebra contextual problems. The tool is mainly used to plot graphics, to give more visual context to the equations, and to approximate values. The author states {{that it would be}} useful for the tools to become a bridge between the contextual problems and the algebraic symbols. While targeting contextual understanding, an approach using graphics would be too complex for young children. In the study by Koedinger and Anderson (1998), which also considered algebraic problems, a cognitive tutor attempted to model students and provide specific tasks for each of them. The study analyzed the problem-solving strategy variants of a <b>computerized</b> <b>tutor</b> and explored the differences between the strategies. The cognitive tutor focused more on guiding students in the various steps of problem-solving instead of focusing on understanding the problem itself. The work of Hamadneh et al. (2016) had elemental school students with disabilities interact with math content through PowerPoint. Users would revise the content and solve problems while receiving feedback through the system. The score of system users was significantly higher than the control group. The test used for evaluation included addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. While the content of the system has not been detailed, it is implied that students mostly solved word problems and received feedback on the correctness of their answer. The system used relies on reading and might not have a step focused on contextual understanding.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} methods for <b>computerized</b> <b>tutoring</b> support that is adapted to the individual student. In particular, we are concerned with providing such assistance to students solving exercises in domains where a complete or accurate problem-solving model is infeasible. We propose to do this by using concept maps {{as a means for}} students to model their own knowledge. Combined with results from earlier exercises, the concept map can form a student model {{that can be used in}} exercise selection, conceptualization support, and exercise solving support. The thesis presents a framework for comparing exercise-oriented intelligent tutoring systems, and uses this framework to describe and analyze earlier systems, as well as our own system, CREEK-ILE. The CREEK-ILE system includes a formalization of a knowledge representation designed to support reasoning with concept maps, and methods for using case-based reasoning with concept maps as student models. A partial implementation of CREEK-ILE designed to support learning of basic Java computer programming is presented. This implementatio...|$|R

40|$|IWT project SPACE (sbo/ 040102) In this paper, an {{automatic}} {{system for the}} assessment of reading in children is described and evaluated. The assessment is based on a reading test with 40 words, presented one by one to the child by means of a <b>computerized</b> reading <b>tutor.</b> The score that expresses the child’s reading performance is calculated as the total time needed to read the 40 words divided by the number of correctly read words. In each grade, children are classified in 5 groups based on their score as provided by human annotators. We show that when the score for a child is assessed automatically using a speech recognizer, a classification can be obtained with a substantial agreement (Cohen’s Kappa over 0. 6) with the human classification. As all children in the experiments were classified either correctly or in an adjoining group, we can conclude that the proposed system can provide large time gains in current manual classification procedures. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{medical training}} and education of cryosurgery—the destruction of cancerous tissue by freezing. Minimally invasive cryosurgery is performed by strategically placing an array of cryoprobes within a target region, {{in order to maximize}} freezing injury in the target region, while minimizing damage to its surrounding tissues. Cryoprobe placement has yet to be standardized, where cryosurgeons frequently base their practice on their own experience, recommendations made by cryodevice manufacturers, and accepted practices. Suboptimal cryoprobe layouts may leave untreated areas in the target region, lead to cryoinjury in the healthy surrounding tissues, require unnecessarily large numbers of cryoprobes, increase the duration of the surgical procedure, and increase the likelihood of post-cryosurgery complications, all of which affect the quality and cost of the medical treatment. While using prostate cryosurgery as a developmental model for surgical training, this study focuses on two key elements: (i) creating realistic prostate models for training, and (ii) developing training methods for the optimal cryoprobe layout. Tumor growth pattern in prostates at T 3 -stage cancer, representative of the cryosurgery candidate population, is characterized in order to identify tumor features that contribute to changes in the prostate shape. Extended free-form deformation (EFFD) is applied on a 3 D prostate template geometry to create localized surface changes that resemble cancerous prostates, where key tumor features compiled serve as deformation criteria. The computational technique is demonstrated in three case studies by systematically selecting critical tumor features and deforming the prostate template contour until selected feature parameters are met. A proof-of-concept for a <b>computerized</b> cryosurgery <b>tutoring</b> system was developed for the simplified case of uniform insertion-depth— 2 D cryoprobe layout planning. The tutoring system lists geometrical constraints of cryoprobes placement, simulates cryoprobe insertion, displays a rendered shape of the prostate, enables distance measurements, simulates the corresponding thermal history, and evaluates the mismatch between the target region shape and a pre-selected planning isotherm. The quality of trainee planning is measured in comparison with computer-generated planning, created for each case study by previously developed planning algorithms. Two versions of the tutoring system have been tested in the current study using 23 surgical residents: (i) an unguided version, where the trainee can practice cases in unstructured sessions, and (ii) an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), which forces the trainee to follow specific steps, believed by the authors to potentially shorten the learning curve. Posttest results indicate that the ITS system maybe more beneficial than the non-ITS system, but the proof-of-concept is demonstrated with either system. Based on the observed effectiveness of the ITS prototype and the learning behaviors of surgical residents, the cryosurgery tutoring system design was modified and extended for the advanced-case of variable insertion-depth— 3 D cryoprobe layout planning. The objective of the tutoring system remains essentially the same—to develop a cryoprobe layout for a given number of cryoprobes, in order to maximize the match between the resulting frozen region and the target region. The proof-of-concept was demonstrated by measuring learning gains of 18 surgical residents after training on the system. Residents showed significant improvement in minimizing the mismatch between the target region and frozen region...|$|R
