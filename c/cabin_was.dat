50|$|More {{than half}} of Carnival Victory's cabins have an ocean view, and 60% of these have a balcony. Twenty-five <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> {{wheelchair}} accessible. Penthouse suites are 345 sq ft; suites are 275 sq ft; ocean view <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> 185 sq ft; interior <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> 185 sq ft.|$|R
50|$|The ‘Rapid Response Community Shelter’ <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> {{presented}} to Mayor Bob Parker by PlaceMakers on 4 March 2011. The {{cost of the}} <b>cabins</b> <b>was</b> met by PlaceMakers {{and a number of}} suppliers. Most of the <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> constructed at PlaceMakers’ Christchurch Frame & Truss plant keeping local staff employed.|$|R
5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search for armed resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by Republicans that the <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> a fort. A structure that may have once been this <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, the soldiers who left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E
5|$|Even though Uncle Tom's <b>Cabin</b> <b>was</b> {{the best-selling}} {{novel of the}} 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story as a stage play or musical than read the book. Eric Lott, in his book Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production, {{estimates}} that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book's first-year sales.|$|E
5|$|During {{tests with}} the Ju 87 A-2, new {{technologies}} were tried out {{to reduce the}} effects of g forces. The pressurised <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> of great importance during this research. Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g could cause death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. When the United States Army occupied the Junkers factory at Dessau on 21 April 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical flight tests with the Ju 87.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> nine <b>cabins</b> {{built by}} the CCC {{available}} for rent year-round. The <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> primarily used by skiers after deer season until late March. The <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> rustic. A modern showerhouse is nearby. All of the <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> furnished with mattresses, chairs, table, stove, microwave, refrigerator, hot and cold running water, and electric lights.|$|R
50|$|The driver's <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> for two drivers. In each of {{them there}} are two {{independent}} panels to display the drive parameters, diagnostics and event recorder with a speedometer function. The two module driver's <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> equipped with climate control and rear-view mirrors with a monitor for four cameras. The <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> {{in accordance with the}} EN 1527 standard.|$|R
50|$|All <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} by reservation (up {{to one year}} in advance) year round, excepting two rustic units. One deluxe <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> designated as a pet cabin.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's <b>Cabin</b> <b>was</b> the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} AS-204 fire in 1967, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Spaceflight, Dr. George Mueller, {{announced}} the mission would be officially designated as Apollo 1. The capsule underwent a significant redesign {{as a result}} of the mishap. The atmosphere in the <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> changed from 100% oxygen to a 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen environment at launch. The astronauts' spacesuits, originally made of nylon, were changed to beta cloth, a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from fiberglass and coated with ]. There were other changes, including replacing flammable cabin materials with self extinguishing ones, and covering plumbing and wiring with protective insulation.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft, a 7-year old McDonnell Douglas MD-11, {{serial number}} 48448, {{registration}} HB-IWF, was manufactured in 1991 and Swissair was its only operator. It bore {{the title of}} Vaud, in honour of the Swiss canton of the same name. The <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> configured with 241seats. First and business class seats were equipped with an in-seat in-flight entertainment system. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney 4462 turbofan engines and had logged about 36,000 hours before the crash.|$|E
50|$|John Ware's <b>Cabin</b> <b>is</b> a {{restored}} early 20th century <b>cabin</b> that <b>was</b> used by John Ware, an African-American cowboy and important figure in Alberta's ranching history. The <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> {{located near the}} visitor center and is open on select days in the summer.|$|R
50|$|The {{historic}} district comprises 11 {{buildings on the}} lakeshore. The lodge, pier foundations and three <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> original structures, while seven <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt to complement the earlier buildings.|$|R
50|$|The park's {{lodge and}} {{original}} six <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> {{constructed by the}} 696th Company of the Civilian Conservation Corps from 1934 to 1935. The CCC used locally quarried sandstone and locally harvested lumber to build the lodge. In 1936, the lodge and <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> dedicated by Illinois Governor Henry Horner. The CCC later added a dining room and kitchen as well as six additional cabins to the complex. They were also responsible for building the lodge's furniture; {{the quality of the}} wooden furniture led Pere Marquette State Park to commission the 696th Company to furnish their lodge as well. In 1985, the lodge and <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> added to the National Register of Historic Places; the original <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> demolished and replaced by replica cabins in the same year, and several new <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> constructed. The new <b>cabins</b> <b>are</b> used to lodge visitors to the park, while the lodge houses a restaurant and gift shop.|$|R
5|$|The site of {{the cabins}} became a tourist {{attraction}} as early as 1854. In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting {{the idea of a}} monument to mark the {{site of the}} Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family was placed on the spot where the Breen-Keseberg <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> thought to have been, dedicated to the Donner Party. It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} a hard-hat diver, sent down {{to recover the}} gold and other valuables, found the bodies of two women {{at the foot of}} the saloon staircase, one with her arm around the other. The diver tried to reach them to take a lock of hair or some other {{personal}} item that could be identified by their loved ones, but the restriction of the air line made it impossible. The gold in the Captain's <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> recovered after much difficulty. While recovering the gold, several sharks that were caught near the wreck were found to contain human bones, remains and jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Westland also {{manufactured}} SAR {{versions of}} the Sea King for the Royal Norwegian Air Force, the German Navy and the Belgian Air Force. On SAR variants, the <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another key feature, used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing, inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft's sponsons. Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods, and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> available: a normal day cabin and {{sleeping}} <b>cabin</b> which <b>is</b> 200 mm longer. The sleeping <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> equipped with bunk bed of which upper bunk can be lifted close to ceiling for better visibility. The bunks and rear windows are with curtains.|$|R
50|$|In this period, {{steamboat}} <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> conventionally {{named after}} {{states and the}} officers' quarters were the largest. This structure housing the largest <b>cabins</b> <b>was</b> identified with Texas, which was then the largest state.|$|R
5000|$|Armoured <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> {{built on}} {{continuous}} mining machines - these <b>cabins</b> <b>were</b> {{thought to be}} able to protect the operator {{in the event of an}} outburst. This was subsequently proven to be wrong.|$|R
5|$|A hunter named Robinson, whose <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> at the lake's {{northern}} end about 1800, {{was the first}} recorded inhabitant. He gave the lake its earliest known name: Robinson's Lake. However, {{for most of the}} 19th century the lake was known as Long Pond, because of its elongated shape. From 1822 to 1827 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. Beginning in 1827 the northbound daily stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon. The stage operated until 1851; the road was the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike until 1908, when the modern Pennsylvania Route 487 was built. Route 487 follows the course of the turnpike as it approaches the lake from the south, then passes to the east of the lake instead.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran across his chest as he lay in bed. The Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
50|$|The one-story <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> a wood frame {{structure}} {{on a low}} stone foundation, {{right on the edge}} of the Grand Canyon. The shallow-pitched roof is covered with wood shingles. The <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> connected to other lodge buildings using compatible, unobtrusive materials, and has been cited as an early example of an adaptive reuse of a historic structure. The <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> one of the guest accommodations of the Bright Angel lodge.|$|R
50|$|The Osterhout Log <b>Cabin</b> <b>is</b> a log <b>cabin</b> {{located within}} Guild Park and Gardens, Guildwood, Scarborough, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Situated along the Scarborough Bluffs, the <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} oldest {{remaining}} buildings in Toronto.|$|R
50|$|Upper Toklat Ranger Station No. 24, {{also known}} as the Upper Toklat River <b>Cabin</b> <b>is</b> a log shelter in the National Park Service Rustic style in Denali National Park. The <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> now part of a network of shelters for patrolling park rangers {{throughout}} the park. It is a standard design by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs and was built in 1930. The <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> one of five cabins originally built by the Alaska Road Commission to provide shelter to crews working on park roads. The Upper Toklat River <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> centrally located and was a distribution point for supplies.|$|R
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Johnson {{was born}} in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, to Jacob Johnson (1778–1812) and Mary ("Polly") McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. He was of English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a log <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> a {{political}} asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins. Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three. Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.|$|E
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the <b>cabin</b> <b>was</b> filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
50|$|The Maltese Cross <b>Cabin</b> <b>is</b> a <b>cabin</b> used by Theodore Roosevelt, {{before he}} <b>was</b> President. The <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} {{located at the}} visitor center at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, just outside the town of Medora, North Dakota.|$|R
5000|$|One of its log guest <b>cabins</b> <b>is</b> {{known as}} the [...] "Hemingway Cabin", where Ernest Hemingway stayed in 1928 with his wife Pauline while writing A Farewell to Arms. The <b>cabin</b> <b>is</b> {{approximately}} 42 x 18 ft.|$|R
50|$|Rock <b>Cabin</b> <b>is</b> a three-sided wood <b>cabin</b> which <b>was</b> {{built against}} a cliff, with {{one side of}} the cabin being the cliff face.
