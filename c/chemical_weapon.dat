5|$|From 12 to 14 September 2013, {{details of}} the Framework were {{negotiated}} at the InterContinental Hotel in Geneva, Switzerland. High-level negotiations were held between Kerry and Lavrov, with large teams of experts simultaneously working on technical details. A key breakthrough was reported to occur when the U.S. and Russia agreed on their approximations of the Syrian <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> stockpile (estimated at 1,000 tons of sarin, mustard agent and VX nerve agent). On 14 September 2013 the Framework was agreed and signed.|$|E
5|$|Johann Fennhoff (portrayed by Ralph Brown) is a Russian hypnotist {{working for}} Leviathan, whose brother {{died from the}} effects of Stark's <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> Midnight Oil. Fennhoff infiltrates the SSR under the guise of rescued {{psychiatrist}} Dr. Ivchenko, and steals Midnight Oil for himself. He then tries to use hypnosis to make Stark spread Midnight Oil over New York, but is defeated by Carter and the SSR. He is arrested, gagged, and imprisoned with Arnim Zola.|$|E

5|$|Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael {{and demand}} that he perform a series of {{operations}} to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA). Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA and steal an experimental <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his own activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him. Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lester start planning their most daring feat ever: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the {{herbicides}} contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were {{not intended to be}} used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas, {{also known}} as bertholite, was first used as a weapon in World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres. As {{described}} by the soldiers, it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper and pineapple. It also tasted metallic and stung {{the back of the}} throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid, destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters, which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy. After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon,</b> but it was soon replaced by the more deadly phosgene and mustard gas.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, the {{development}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons</b> was highly criticised, and, in 1970, the Swedish government stated {{that it would not}} further develop or produce any <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b> In 1994, Sweden signed the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Weapons</b> Convention that forbids {{the development}}, production, stockpiling and use of <b>chemical</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{destruction}} of Syria's chemical weapons began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the {{destruction of}} its chemical weapons and its <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for destruction. The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the use of chemical weapons in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government.|$|E

25|$|Chemical nociceptors have TRP {{channels}} that {{respond to a}} wide variety of spices. The one that sees the most response and is very widely tested is capsaicin. Other chemical stimulants are environmental irritants like acrolein, a World War I <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon</b> and a component of cigarette smoke. Apart from these external stimulants, chemical nociceptors have the capacity to detect endogenous ligands, and certain fatty acid amines that arise from changes in internal tissues. Like in thermal nociceptors, TRPV1 can detect chemicals like capsaicin and spider toxins.|$|E
25|$|Another type {{of carbon}} {{tetrachloride}} extinguisher was the fire grenade. This {{consisted of a}} glass sphere filled with CTC, that {{was intended to be}} hurled {{at the base of a}} fire (early ones used salt-water, but CTC was more effective). Carbon tetrachloride was suitable for liquid and electrical fires and the extinguishers were fitted to motor vehicles. Carbon tetrachloride extinguishers were withdrawn in the 1950s because of the chemical's toxicity – exposure to high concentrations damages the nervous system and internal organs. Additionally, when used on a fire, the heat can convert CTC to phosgene gas, formerly used as a <b>chemical</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
