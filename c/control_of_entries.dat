5000|$|Tourism {{carrying}} capacity is a now antiquated approach to managing visitors in protected areas and national parks which evolved {{out of the}} fields of range, habitat and wildlife management. In these fields, managers attempted to determine the largest population of a particular species that could be supported by a habitat {{over a long period}} of time. [...] Many authors, such as Buckley, Wagar, Washburne, McCool, and Stankey have critiqued the concept as being fatally flawed in both the conceptual assumptions made and its limited practical application. For example, the notion of a {{carrying capacity}} assumes the world, such as the social-ecological systems in which protected areas and tourism destinations are situated, are stable. But we know they are dynamically complex and impossible to predict. We know that to implement a carrying capacity on a practical level, assumes a level of <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>entries</b> into a destination or protected area not usually found in the real world. We know that a carrying capacity, if one could be determined, requires considerable financial and technical resources to administer; and we know that when demand exceeds a limit, the ways in which scarce opportunities are allocated are contentious.|$|E

40|$|In eukaryotes, the {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} Cdk 1 p (Cdc 2 p) plays {{a central role}} in entry into and {{progression}} through nuclear division during mitosis and meiosis. Cdk 1 p is activated during meiotic nuclear divisions by dephosphorylation of its tyrosine- 15 residue. The phosphorylation status of this residue is largely determined by the Wee 1 p kinase and the Cdc 25 p phosphatase. In fission yeast, the forkhead-type transcription factor Mei 4 p is essential for entry into the first meiotic nuclear division. We recently identified cdc 25 C as an essential target of Mei 4 p in the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into meiosis I. Here, we show that wee 1 C is another important target of Mei 4 p in the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into meiosis I. Mei 4 p bound to the upstream region of wee 1 C in vivo and in vitro and inhibited expression of wee 1 C, whereas Mei 4 p positively regulated expression of the adjacent pseudogene. Overexpression of Mei 4 p inhibited expression of wee 1 C and induced that of the pseudogene. Conversely, deletion of Mei 4 p did not decrease expression of wee 1 C but inhibited that of the pseudogene. In addition, deletion of Mei 4 p-binding regions delayed repression of wee 1 C expression as well as induction of expression of the pseudogene. These results suggest that repression of wee 1 C expression is primarily owing to Mei 4 p-mediated transcriptional interference...|$|R

The most important findings are rather counter-intuitive: smaller firms are more successful than larger firms, and greater openness of the emerging market have lower success. Other findings are that success is higher with earlier <b>entry,</b> greater <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> mode, and shorter cultural and economic distance between the home and host nations. Importantly, with or without control for these drivers, success in India is lower than that in China. The authors discuss the reasons for and implications of these findings. ...|$|R

40|$|Mammalian oocytes {{are arrested}} in {{prophase}} {{of the first}} meiotic division. Progression into the first meiotic division is driven {{by an increase in}} the activity of maturation-promoting factor (MPF). In mouse oocytes, we find that early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi 1), an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) that is responsible for cyclin B destruction and inactivation of MPF, is present at prophase I and undergoes Skp 1 –Cul 1 –F-box/βTrCP-mediated destruction immediately after germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Exogenous Emi 1 or the inhibition of Emi 1 destruction in prophase-arrested oocytes leads to a stabilization of cyclin B 1 –GFP that is sufficient to trigger GVBD. In contrast, the depletion of Emi 1 using morpholino oligonucleotides increases cyclin B 1 –GFP destruction, resulting in an attenuation of MPF activation and a delay <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> into the first meiotic division. Finally, we show that Emi 1 -dependent effects on meiosis I require the presence of Cdh 1.

Forced dephosphorylation of Cdc 2 p on tyrosine- 15 thus induced meiosis I in mei 4 mutant cells without a delay, although no spores were formed.

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{contribution}} which economists, and others using economic modes of reasoning, {{have made to}} the analysis of the regulation of law firms. It particularly focuses on the analysis of self-regulation by the profession. The chapter begins by rehearsing the traditional cartel argument against self-regulation and its links with the modern private interest theory of regulation via capture theory. This is contrasted with the market failure view of regulation which {{in the context of the}} professions focuses on the information asymmetry between the professional and the client. There is then a brief discussion of the merits of self-regulation and inter-profession competition before turning to an examination of the instruments by which professional regulation is exercised: <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> advertising or other means <b>of</b> competition, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> fee levels, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> fee contracts and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> organisational form.

The focus throughout is on what the economics literature has had to say on the regulation of the practice of law. Thus more general treatments of the economics of the law firm are not discussed...|$|R

Under laissez faire pricing and free <b>entry</b> the number <b>of</b> vacant cabs need not be efficient and could be either higher than optimal or less depending upon the relative bargaining power of individual cabs and potential customers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} model of banking regulation from a positive political economy perspective. The main characteristic of this model, based on the interrela-tion between regulators and incumbent banks, is that regulation is driven by public interest and political economy motives. The public interest of regulators includes the efficiency and soundness of the banking industry. The political economy motives con-sist of two elements. First, incumbent banks demand regulation to obtain higher than competitive profits (rent-seeking motive). Second, regulation by itself is rewarding for the regulator. In the model, the government finances the public-sector deficit with banking resources (fiscal motive). Regulators make use of two instruments. The first is to require banks to hold min-imum capital adequacy levels. Theory predicts that increasing bank capital {{reduces the risk of}} bank failure. The second instrument is the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> which makes bank charters valuable, so banks follow a conservative behavior to protect their char-ters. Entry restrictions, however, {{have a negative impact on}} efficiency in the industry...|$|R
