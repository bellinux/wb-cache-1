5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating of the <b>coffee</b> <b>bean,</b> under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour {{of the coffee}} is impaired. They built the first station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E

25|$|The lipids {{found in}} green coffee include: {{linoleic}} acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, diterpenes, triglycerides, unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, esters, and amides. The total content of lipids in dried green coffee is between 11.7 and 14 g/100 g. Lipids are {{present on the}} surface and in the interior matrix of green coffee beans. On the surface, they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids (unsaturated C6 to C24) making up to 3% of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram/g dried green <b>coffee</b> <b>bean.</b> Such compounds form a wax-like cover {{on the surface of the}} <b>coffee</b> <b>bean</b> (200 to 300mg lipids/100g dried green <b>coffee</b> <b>bean)</b> protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects. Further, such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure. Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides, linoleic acid (46% of total free lipids), palmitic acid (30% to 35% of total free lipids), and esters. Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids (13.5 to 17.4g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans) than robustas (9.8 to 10.7g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans). The content of diterpenes is about 20% of the lipid fraction. The diterpenes found in green coffee include cafestol, kahweol and 16-O-methylcafestol. Some of these diterpenes have been shown in in vitro experiments to protect liver tissue against chemical oxidation. In coffee oil from green coffee beans the diterpenes are esterified with saturated long chain fatty acids.|$|E

25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the <b>coffee</b> <b>bean</b> into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the <b>coffee</b> <b>bean.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in the process is the {{roasting}} of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the <b>coffee</b> <b>bean</b> both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.|$|E

50|$|Coffee {{preparation}} {{is the process}} of turning <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps: raw <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> must be roasted, the roasted <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.|$|R
25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green <b>coffee</b> <b>bean</b> more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green <b>coffee</b> <b>bean,</b> a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of free glucose was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.|$|E
25|$|Further, Nathanson fed {{tobacco hornworm}} larvae with leaves sprayed with such psychoactive drugs as caffeine, {{formamidine}} pesticide didemethylchlordimeform (DDCDM), IBMX or theophylline. He observed a similar effect, namely inhibition of feeding followed by death. Nathanson concluded that caffeine and related methylxanthines could be natural pesticides developed by plants as protection against worms: Caffeine {{is found in}} many plant species, with high levels in seedlings that are still developing foliage, but are lacking mechanical protection; caffeine paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding upon the plant. High caffeine levels have also {{been found in the}} soil surrounding <b>coffee</b> <b>bean</b> seedlings. It is therefore understood that caffeine has a natural function, both as a natural pesticide and as an inhibitor of seed germination of other nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving it a better chance of survival.|$|E
25|$|Fungal {{resistance}} to herbivores represents an environmentally sustainable alternative to pesticides that has experienced reasonable success in agricultural applications. The organic farming industry has embraced mycorrhizal symbionts as one tool for improving yields and protecting plants from damage. Infected crops of soybean, ribwort plantain, cabbage, banana, <b>coffee</b> <b>bean</b> plant and tomato all show markedly {{lower rates of}} herbivore damage compared to uninfected plants. Endophytic fungi show great promise {{as a means of}} indirect biocontrol in large-scale agricultural applications. The potential for biotechnology to improve crop populations through inoculation with modified fungal strains could reduce toxicity to livestock and improve yields of human-consumed foods. The endophyte, either with detrimental genes removed or beneficial new genes added, is used as a surrogate host to transform the crops genetically. An endophyte of ryegrass has been genetically transformed in this way and used successfully to deter herbivores.|$|E

25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, <b>coffee</b> <b>bean,</b> dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
25|$|Chlorogenic acids {{belong to}} a group of {{compounds}} known as phenolic acids, which are antioxidants. The content of chlorogenic acids in dried green coffee beans of robusta is 65mg/g and of arabica 140mg/g, depending on the timing of harvesting. At roasting temperature, more than 70% of chlorogenic acids are destroyed, leaving a residue less than 30mg/g in the roasted <b>coffee</b> <b>bean.</b> In contrast to green coffee, green tea contains an average of 85mg/g polyphenols. These chlorogenic acids could be a valuable, inexpensive source of antioxidants. Chlorogenic acids are homologous compounds comprising caffeic acid, ferulic acid and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, which are connected by an ester bond to the hydroxyl groups of quinic acid. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acid is more potent than of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or mannitol, which is a selective hydroxy-radical scavenger. Chlorogenic acids have a bitter taste in low concentrations such as 50mg/l water. At higher concentrations of 1g/l water, they have a sour taste. Chlorogenic acids increase the solubility of caffeine and are important modulators of taste.|$|E

In contrast, Maillard reaction products may be the principal components with free radical scavenging activity in more severely (medium and dark) roasted coffees...|$|R
40|$|The {{aroma and flavour}} {{of coffee}} are {{developed}} in the roasting process. Major volatile flavour compounds identified in roasted <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> are pyrazines. Since the roasting process significantly affects these volatile compounds, the roasting conditions need to be optimised in ensuring the quality of roasted <b>coffee</b> <b>beans.</b> In this study, the roasting temperature and roasting time for Indonesian Arabica and Robusta <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> were optimised based on the concentration of selected pyrazines (2 -methylpyrazine, 2, 3 dimethylpyrazine, 2 ~ 5 -dimethylpyrazine, 2 ~ 3, 5 -trimethylpyrazine and 2, 3, 5, 6 tetramethylpyrazine) using response surface methodology (RSM), supported by overall sensory evaluation by an expert panelist and trained panelists. Since undesirable acrylamide {{is known to be}} produced during roasting process, minimising the amount of acrylamide was also considered in the optimisation of roasting process. Pyrazines were extracted using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatgraphy with flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) while acrylamide was analysed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) and GC-FID. Optimised conditions for roasting <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> were obtained at roasting temperature of 167 °C for 22 minutes for Arabica <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> and roasting temperature of 167 °C for 27 minutes for Robusta <b>coffee</b> <b>beans.</b> The optimised conditions were applied in roasting <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> samples from different varieties (Arabica and Robusta) and origins (Asia, Africa and America) and the dataset on the amount of pyrazines was subjected to multivariate analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was able to discriminate between Arabica and Robusta <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> with total variance of 91. 94 %, supported by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showing two distinct clusters and discriminant analysis (DA) with 1000 / 0 correct classification. PCA revealed two groups whereby <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> from Asia were distinctly separated from those of America and Africa with total variance of 92. 74 %. In accordance, HCA showed 2 clusters, cluster 1 for Asia and cluster 2 for America and Africa. The analysis of pyrazines was applied to commercial coffee samples. Application of PCA and HCA resulted in 5 groups; 2 groups consisting of pure coffee samples and three groups of instant coffee samples. A method {{to reduce the amount of}} aery lamide produced during roasting without affecting the amount of pyrazines was studied by the addition of asparaginase. Reduction of acrylamide up to 96. 53 % was obtained by soaking the <b>coffee</b> <b>beans</b> with 3000 U/g of prior incubating at 50 °C for 30 min.
