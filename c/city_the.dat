5|$|Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet {{sailed to}} the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but found that this had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of Cardia, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had not prepared for a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos. The siege dragged on for several months, causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the <b>City,</b> <b>the</b> Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> Athenians were thus able to take possession of the <b>city</b> <b>the</b> next day.|$|E
