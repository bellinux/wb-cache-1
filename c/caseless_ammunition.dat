25|$|The Ki-44-II Otsu (also {{known as}} the Ki-44-IIb) could be armed with a Ho-301 40mm autocannon. While this was a {{relatively}} high-caliber weapon, it used <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> with a low muzzle velocity and short range, which was effective only in close attacks. Some of these aircraft were used against USAAF bombers by a special Shinten Seiku Tai (air superiority unit), comprising at least four aircraft, {{that was part of}} 47th Sentai, based at Narimasu airfield in Tokyo. Pilots from such units attempted to shoot down B-29s and, once their ammunition was expended, to ram them – effectively a suicide attack. While the concept appeared straightforward, ramming a B-29 at high altitudes was difficult to achieve in practice.|$|E
25|$|Work on a {{successor}} for the venerable G3 rifle had been ongoing in Germany {{since the second}} half of the 1970s. These efforts resulted in the innovative 4.73mm G11 assault rifle (developed jointly by a group of companies led by H), that used <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> (designed by the Dynamit Nobel company). It had been predicted that this weapon would eventually replace the G3, therefore further development of H's series of firearms chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been halted. Heckler & Koch, having no incentive to pursue a new 5.56mm weapon system, was content with the export-oriented HK33 and G41 rifles. However, the G11 program came to an abrupt end when the Bundeswehr cancelled its procurement due to defence budget cuts after the unification of East and West Germany and H was acquired in 1991 by British Aerospace's Royal Ordnance division (known today as BAE Systems).|$|E
2500|$|The Eagle's initial {{versions}} {{were the}} F-15 single-seat variant and TF-15 twin-seat variant. (After the F-15C was first flown, the designations were changed to [...] "F-15A" [...] and [...] "F-15B"). These versions would be powered by new Pratt & Whitney F100 engines {{to achieve a}} combat thrust-to-weight ratio in excess of 1:1. A proposed 25mm Ford-Philco GAU-7 cannon with <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> suffered development problems. It was dropped {{in favor of the}} standard M61 Vulcan gun. The F-15 used conformal carriage of four Sparrow missiles like the Phantom. The fixed wing was put onto a flat, wide fuselage that also provided an effective lifting surface. The first F-15A flight was made on 27 July 1972, with the first flight of the two-seat F-15B following in July 1973.|$|E
25|$|HK has {{a history}} of {{innovation}} in firearms, {{such as the use of}} polymers in weapon designs and the use of an integral rail for flashlights on handguns. HK also developed modern polygonal rifling, noted for its high accuracy, increased muzzle velocity and barrel life. Not all of its technologically ambitious designs have translated into commercially successful products (for instance, the advanced but now abandoned G11 military rifle, which fired <b>caseless</b> high-velocity <b>ammunition).</b> In its extensive product range, HK has used the following operating systems for small arms: blowback operation, short-recoil, roller-delayed blowback, gas-delayed blowback, and gas operation (via Short-stroke piston).|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} <b>caseless</b> firearm and <b>ammunition</b> systems {{produced}} was made by Daisy, the airgun maker, in 1968. The Daisy V/L Rifle used a [...]22 caliber (5.5 mm) low-powered caseless round with no primer. The rifle was basically a spring-piston air rifle, but when used with the V/L ammunition the energy from the compression of the piston heated the air behind the caseless cartridge enough to ignite the propellant, and this generated {{the bulk of the}} energy of firing. The Daisy V/L Rifle system was discontinued in 1969 after the ATF ruled that it was not an airgun, but a firearm, which Daisy was not licensed to produce.|$|R
2500|$|The {{designers}} project further improvements. [...] These include improved projectile {{technologies such}} as environmentally friendly bullets and a change in bullet size {{in order to increase}} combat effectiveness, as well as the integration of electronics such as ammunition count readouts, lasers, optical sights, rangefinders, and bullet drop compensation. The Army is pursuing cased telescoped ammunition. [...] This development is far along, and they say a new LMG could be fielded within two years (2014) with unequivocal support. [...] The Marine Corps is pursuing <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition,</b> which is less developed and will take several more years to refine. A compact version is also being developed with a 4-inch shorter barrel and folding, telescoping buttstock. The 5.56mm LSAT machine gun has been renamed the Cased Telescoped Light Machine Gun (CT LMG).|$|E
2500|$|The LSAT {{light machine}} gun, of the LSAT (Lightweight Small Arms Technologies) program, is a developmental, {{powerful}} {{light machine gun}} (LMG). The purpose {{of the program was}} to develop a lighter, yet very reliable LMG. [...] The program was initiated in 2004, when the Joint Service Small Arms Program (JSSAP) challenged the American defence industry to develop a lighter small arms and also design lighter ammunition. [...] The LMG provides a major reduction in weight over legacy weapons, as well as improvements in other areas, such as controllability and reliability. As of 2008, it had two configurations, one that fires cased telescoped ammunition, and one that fires <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b> [...] After further research and development into both technologies and the guns that fire them, one of the two variants was to be chosen for production. By May 2015, 85,000 cased-telescoped rounds had been fired through 10 test weapons, with testers claiming the weapon had gone as far as it can go until the Army decides if it wants to make it a program of record.|$|E
2500|$|Development {{began with}} {{the two types of}} weight-reducing ammunition, and a light machine gun to serve as a testbed and {{technology}} demonstrator. [...] Use of an LMG for this purpose is notable, considering its greater technical complexity than infantry rifles. [...] The use of advanced computer simulations to accelerate development may have mitigated this, and the [...] [...] For development, the use of extensive computer simulation and modelling reduces both time and expenditure for prototyping and testing. The program also uses a 'spiral development' approach, whereby the weapon and ammunition is rolled out in stages or 'spirals', each stage producing a new version that is an improvement on those from previous spirals. A competition down-selected the design concepts of various companies to leave an AAI Corporation-led team of companies as the developers of the weapon system. The cohesive team of companies is combined with government support to ensure success. [...] The parallel development of the two ammunition types meant that, if the <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> effort succeeded, much of the development work gained with the composite cased weapon could be applied to it, and, if it failed, the composite-cased version was likely to succeed on its own.|$|E
50|$|LSAT <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> is <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{produced}} {{as part of}} the U.S. Army’s Lightweight Small Arms Technologies (LSAT) program.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the Lightweight Small Arms Technologies (LSAT) {{program was}} {{initiated}} which licensed the G11 <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b> In Phase 1 lasting until January 2005, the HITP formula was reverse engineered and evaluated. In the 28-month-long Phase II, the G11 <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> was replicated and customized to U.S. Army preferences (higher burn rate). In May 2007, the <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> was scaled and {{adapted to the}} 5.56 mm projectile in a telescoped and round form. An alternative polymer cased version was created in parallel.|$|E
50|$|In August 2013, AAI Corporation {{was awarded}} a $2.05 million {{contract}} to continue developing parts of the LSAT program. Part of the contract is to refine 5.56 mm <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> prototypes for testing. The <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> effort will focus on improving propellant and ignition formulations in a 5.56 mm configuration.|$|E

50|$|While {{it seems}} a simple {{operation}} to replace the case {{with a piece of}} solid propellant, the cartridge case provides more than just a way to keep the cartridge components together, and these other functions must be replaced if the case is to be replaced. <b>Caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> is not without its drawbacks, and it is these drawbacks that have kept modern <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> from achieving wider success.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{has been}} a popular {{military}} rifle concept {{since the end of}} World War II, but has never met with public approval due to its sole source nature (and it cannot be handloaded at home). The main benefits of <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> to the military are that ammunition can be made lighter, enabling soldiers to carry several hundred rounds, and the fact that case extraction is not required allows a faster automatic rate of fire, both of which are immaterial {{to the needs of the}} typical civilian shooter or hunter, who rarely wants to carry hundreds of rounds of ammunition, or is allowed to own an automatic firearm. Voere attempted to introduce <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> to civilian shooters in 1991 with the VEC-91.|$|E
50|$|The Daisy V/L was {{the first}} {{production}} rifle for <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b> It was released in 1968 by Daisy Outdoor Products.|$|E

50|$|<b>Caseless</b> <b>{{ammunition}}</b> {{is a type}} {{of small}} arms ammunition that eliminates the cartridge case that typically holds the primer, propellant, and projectile together as a unit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> also {{produces}} no ejected shells (which both improves the weapon's protection from dirt and removes {{any need to}} [...] "police" [...] cases after firing).|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Smith & Wesson engineers, {{researching the}} {{possibility}} of a gun that could electronically fire <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition,</b> created a prototype weapon similar to the M76, but with some alterations included so that it could fire the <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Visually it was identical to the standard M76, except for a structure in front of the trigger guard that served as a housing for two 12-volt batteries. Although the gun worked quite well, the ammunition proved susceptible to damage from rough handling and the elements, and the project was scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The {{proprietary}} {{nature of}} the rifle's <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> and supply chain problems prevented it from being successful in the United States, but Voere still produces the rifle for the European market, as of 2007.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{machine gun}} {{development}} has been slowed {{by the fact that}} existing machine gun designs are adequate for most purposes, although significant developments are taking place with regard to <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition,</b> anti-armor and anti-missile weapons.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The 4.73×33mm <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{used in the}} G11 rifle. The {{components}} are, {{from left}} to right, the solid propellant, the primer, the bullet, and a plastic cap that serves to keep the bullet centered in the propellant block.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, {{the program}} had {{achieved}} working prototypes for the polymer-cased ammunition and the LMG that fires it, and these were tested by the army in 2012. The less orthodox <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> and a rifle firing both types of ammunition has also begun. The designers project further developments. These include improved projectile technologies, such as greener bullets and a more lethal caliber, {{as well as the}} use of electronics, such as rounds counters, and lasers for sighting, target acquisition, and steering. [...] After further research and development into both ammunition types and the weapons that fire them, one of the two shall be chosen for production. In August 2013, AAI Corporation was awarded a contract to continue development of both cased telescoped and <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some {{artillery}} shells use an obturating ring {{at the rear}} of the shell to provide a tight seal for the breech. This allows a mostly <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> without the sealing issues generally encountered in such ammunition. The obturating ring provides the sealing that would normally be provided by a cartridge case.|$|E
50|$|The normal {{solution}} to the problem of heat is to increase the heat resistance by switching to a propellant with a higher ignition temperature, typically a non-crystalline explosive carefully formulated to provide an appropriate rate of combustion. Heckler & Koch, in concert with Dynamit Nobel, managed such a task by producing relatively heat-resistant <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E
50|$|Development of the T86 {{started in}} 1992, with the stated {{objective}} of replacing the venerable T65 series. Several radical concepts, such as <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition,</b> were explored but ultimately rejected {{due to high}} risk. Still, the XT86 prototype revealed {{to the public in}} 1996 demonstrated several innovative features and significant departure from US influence in firearms design.|$|E
50|$|The Heckler & Koch G11 series used <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{where the}} {{propellant}} was molded onto the bullet itself, making the round smaller and much lighter. The new K2 version {{used in the}} ACR tests held 45 rounds in a single long magazine lying {{along the top of}} the barrel, leading to a distinctive and somewhat blocky appearance.|$|E
50|$|The Ho-301 was a Japanese 40 {{millimeter}} calibre autocannon {{that saw}} limited use during World War II, on Japanese Army Nakajima Ki-44 and Kawasaki Ki-45 KAI aircraft. It was unusual in using <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Although the effective {{range of the}} cannon was only 150 meters (490 ft), the Ho-301 was light and rapid-firing for its caliber.|$|E
50|$|The Jaguar's main {{weapons is}} CTA International's CT40 cannon firing 40mm <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> with {{a rate of}} fire of 200 rounds a minute. Two MMP {{anti-tank}} guided missiles, a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun are also carried and eight smoke grenades are also carried. The Jaguar can lift its cannon 45° up, allowing it to fire on aerial targets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{eliminates}} the metal case that typically holds the primer or igniter and the powder charge (smokeless powder) that propels the bullet. The metal case absorbs {{a large portion}} of the waste heat of firing. Ejecting this hot, empty case removes that heat from the weapon. With caseless rounds, other means of reducing waste heat are necessary, especially in automatic fire.|$|E
50|$|In 1993 Voere of Austria {{began selling}} {{a gun and}} <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Their system used a primer, {{electronically}} fired at 17.5 ± 2 volts. The upper and lower limits prevent fire from either stray currents or static electricity. The direct electrical firing eliminates the mechanical delays associated with a striker, reducing lock time, and allowing for easier adjustment of the rifle trigger.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{development}} shifted {{yet again}} to the new caliber 4.73x33mm (DM11) in a telescoped form. In 1984, the Gesellschaft für hülsenlose Gewehrsysteme (GHGS), founded by H&K GmbH and Dynamit Nobel AG, completed a license agreement for a custom version (worth 3.8 million USD) with the U.S. Department of Defense and for the adoption of <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> with the Bundeswehr and NATO.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{consists}} of a solid mass of propellant, originally nitrocellulose, cast into shape to form {{the body of the}} cartridge, with cavities to accept the bullet and a primer, preferably combustible, which are glued into place. The completed cartridge might also contain a booster charge of powdered propellant to help ignite the body and provide initial thrust to the bullet.|$|E
50|$|Some {{assault rifles}} have used <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition.</b> One of the better-known weapons {{of this type}} is the G11 made by Heckler & Koch as a {{potential}} replacement for the G3 battle rifle. Although the G11 never entered full production, it went {{through a number of}} prototype stages as well as field testing, including testing as part of the American Advanced Combat Rifle program. While it was scheduled to be adopted by the West German military with a plan set out to procure 300,000 G11K2 rifles over a period from 1990 to 2002, the expenses created by the reunification of Germany and the impossibility of modifying the G11 to use NATO-standard ammunition led to the cancellation of the G11 project and the adoption of a cheaper, more conventional NATO-standardised assault rifle, the 5.56mm G36. The G11's <b>caseless</b> <b>ammunition</b> was later used {{as the basis for the}} caseless round development in the US Lightweight Small Arms Technologies program.|$|E
