The separation method consist of <b>continous</b> <b>flow</b> of a blood sample (diluted in PBS) through a microfluidic channel which presents on the bottom "dots" of feromagnetic layer. By appling a magnetic field perpendicular on the flowing direction, the feromagnetic "dots" generates a gradient of magnetic field which amplifies the magnetic force. As a result, the red blood cells are captured {{on the bottom of}} the microfluidic channel while the rest of the blood is collected at the outlet.

40|$|Data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{particular}} form of testing that identifies data <b>flow</b> relations as <b>test</b> objectives. Data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> has recently attracted new interest {{in the context of}} testing object oriented systems, since data flow information is well suited to capture relations among the object states, and can thus provide useful information for testing method interactions. Unfortunately, classic data <b>flow</b> <b>testing,</b> which is based on static analysis of the source code, fails to identify many important data flow relations due to the dynamic nature of object oriented systems. This thesis presents Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing,</b> a technique which rethinks data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> to suit the testing of modern object oriented software. Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> stems from empirical evidence that we collect on the limits of classic data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> techniques. We investigate such limits by means of Dynamic Data Flow Analysis, a dynamic implementation of data flow analysis that computes sound data flow information on program traces. We compare data flow information collected with static analysis of the code with information observed dynamically on execution traces, and empirically observe that the data flow information computed with classic analysis of the source code misses a significant part of information that corresponds to relevant behaviors that shall be tested. In view of these results, we propose Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing.</b> The technique promotes the synergies between dynamic analysis, static reasoning and test case generation for automatically extending a test suite with test cases that execute the complex state based interactions between objects. Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> computes precise data flow information of the program with Dynamic Data Flow Analysis, processes the dynamic information to infer new test objectives, which Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> uses to generate new test cases. The test cases generated by Dynamic Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Testing</b> exercise relevant behaviors that are otherwise missed by both the original test suite and test suites that satisfy classic data flow criteria...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} limits of current data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> {{approaches}} from a radically novel viewpoint, and shows that the static data flow techniques used so far in data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> to identify the test objectives fail to represent the universe of data flow relations entailed by a program. This paper compares the data flow relations computed with static data flow approaches with the ones observed while executing the program. To this end, the paper introduces a dynamic data flow technique that collects the data flow relations observed during testing. The experimental data discussed in the paper suggest that data <b>flow</b> <b>testing</b> based on static techniques misses many data <b>flow</b> <b>test</b> objectives, and indicate {{that the amount of}} missing objectives (false negatives) can be more limiting than the amount of infeasible data flow relations identified statically (false positives).

40|$|Numerous {{investigations}} on the {{in vitro}} corrosion of Man-made Mineral Fibres (MMMF) {{were carried out}} in the course of an extended study. The corrosion tests were performed as <b>continous</b> <b>flow</b> experiments at constant temperature (37 xC) and flow rate with two model electrolyte solutions. The corroded fibres were characterized in terms of dissolution velocities and the appearance of corroded surfaces. The majority of investigated fibres maintained their typical shape and reached constant velocities with time. For these cases, dissolution velocities were a decisive criterion to compare the dissolution behaviour of different fibres. For several other cases, two types of corrosion damage were identified beside the dissolution process, i. e. corrosion layer formation and pitting corrosion. Both effects were probably due to the production process, and lead to a loss of cylindric geometry during corrosion. For the latter cases, the criterion of dissolution velocities could be applied with some r eservations only...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently the {{knowledge}} extraction community takes {{a closer look}} to new models where data arrive in timely manner like a fast and <b>continous</b> <b>flow,</b> i. e. data streams. As {{only a part of}} the stream can be stored, mining data streams for sequential patterns and updating previously found frequent patterns need to cope with uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical approach which biaises the initial support for sequential patterns. This approach holds the advantage to maximiez either the precision or the recall, as chosen by the user, and limit the defradation of the other criterion. Moreover, these statistical supports help building statistical borders which are the relevant sets of frequent patterns to use into an incremental mining process. Theoretical results show that the technique is not far from the optimum, from the statistical standpoint. Experiments performed on sequential patterns demonstrate the interest of this approach and the potential of such techniques. ...|$|R

The proportion of MB leprosy patients was 39. 5, 35. 6 and 19. 4 % in Brazil, Nepal and Nigeria, respectively.

ML <b>Flow</b> <b>test</b> results and smears were negative in 69. 1 and 82. 7 % of PB patients, while smears were positive in 58. 6 % of MB patients in Brazil and 28. 3 % in Nepal.
