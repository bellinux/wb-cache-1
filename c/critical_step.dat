5|$|Indeed, the endosymbiotic {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} organelles sees a form of {{horizontal}} gene transfer as a <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals. The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within the cells of eukorytes such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, had descended from independent bacteria that came to live symbiotically within other cells. It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus.|$|E

25|$|Copper acetate hydrate adopts {{the paddle}} wheel {{structure}} seen also for related Rh(II) and Cr(II) tetraacetates. One oxygen atom on each acetate {{is bound to}} one copper at 1.97Å (197pm). Completing the coordination sphere are two water ligands, with Cu–O distances of 2.20Å (220pm). The two five-coordinate copper atoms are separated by only 2.62Å (262pm), which {{is close to the}} Cu–Cu separation in metallic copper. The two copper centers interact resulting in a diminishing of the magnetic moment such that near 90K, Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 is essentially diamagnetic due to cancellation of the two opposing spins. Cu2(OAc)4(H2O)2 was a <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> in the development of modern theories for antiferromagnetic coupling.|$|E
25|$|True north, concept of: The Song Dynasty (9601279) {{official}} Shen Kuo (10311095), {{alongside his}} colleague Wei Pu, improved the orifice {{width of the}} sighting tube to make nightly accurate records of the paths of the moon, stars, and planets in the night sky, for a continuum of five years. By doing so, Shen fixed the outdated position of the pole star, which had shifted over the centuries since the time Zu Geng (fl. 5th century) had plotted it; {{this was due to}} the precession of the Earth's rotational axis. When making the first known experiments with a magnetic compass, Shen Kuo wrote that the needle always pointed slightly east rather than due south, an angle he measured which is now known as magnetic declination, and wrote that the compass needle in fact pointed towards the magnetic north pole instead of true north (indicated by the current pole star); this was a <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> in the history of accurate navigation with a compass.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>critical</b> <b>step...</b> was the {{registration}} of voters according to guidelines established by Congress and interpreted by Generals Sheridan and Charles Griffin. The Reconstruction Acts called for registering all adult males, white and black, except {{those who had}} ever sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then engaged in rebellion... Sheridan interpreted these restrictions stringently, barring from registration not only all pre-1861 officials {{of state and local}} governments who had supported the Confederacy but also all city officeholders and even minor functionaries such as sextons of cemeteries. In May Griffin... appointed a three-man board of registrars for each county, making his choices on the advice of known scalawags and local Freedmen's Bureau agents. In every county where practicable a freedman served as one of the three registrars... Final registration amounted to approximately 59,633 whites and 49,479 blacks. It is impossible to say how many whites were rejected or refused to register (estimates vary from 7,500 to 12,000), but blacks, who constituted only about 30 percent of the state's population, were significantly overrepresented at 45 percent of all voters.|$|E

500|$|Though docking {{is often}} {{considered}} cruel and unnatural by animal rights activists, {{it is considered}} by sheep producers large and small alike to be a <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> in maintaining the health of sheep. [...] Long, wooly tails make shearing more difficult, interfere with mating, and make sheep extremely susceptible to parasites, especially those that cause flystrike. Both castration and docking can be performed with several instruments. An elastrator places a tight band of rubber around an area, causing it to atrophy and fall off {{in a number of}} weeks. This process is bloodless and does not seem to cause extended suffering to lambs, who tend to ignore it after several hours.

500|$|For another twenty years, the {{mechanism}} by which ATP is generated remained mysterious, with scientists searching for an elusive [...] "high-energy intermediate" [...] that would link oxidation and phosphorylation reactions.

At first, this proposal was highly controversial, but it was slowly accepted and Mitchell was awarded a Nobel prize in 1978.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of element shape on the <b>critical</b> time <b>step</b> are investigated. The common rule-of-thumb, used in practice, is that the <b>critical</b> time <b>step</b> is set by the {{shortest}} distance within an element divided by the dilatational (compressive) wave speed, with a modest safety factor. For regularly shaped elements, many analytical solutions for the <b>critical</b> time <b>step</b> are available, but this paper focusses on distorted element shapes. The main purpose is to verify whether element distortion adversely affects the <b>critical</b> time <b>step</b> or not. Two types of element distortion will be considered, namely aspect ratio distortion and angular distortion, and two particular elements will be studied: four-noded bilinear quadrilaterals and three-noded linear triangles. The maximum eigenfrequencies of the distorted elements are determined and compared {{to those of the}} corresponding undistorted elements. The <b>critical</b> time <b>steps</b> obtained from single element calculations are also compared to those from calculations based on finite element patches with multiple elements.

The agreement {{was the result of}} 17 months of discussions. John Drake, PR spokesperson for Harmonix, stated that Apple Corps [...] "respected and appreciated what Harmonix does creatively for rhythm games" [...] as part {{of the success of the}} deal. Eversheds, the legal firm working for Apple Corps. for both The Beatles: Rock Band and the abandoned remake of Yellow Submarine by Disney, stated that it took six months to complete the complex agreements and paperwork over the copyrights, trademarks, and publishing issues. Viacom's deal with The Beatles' property owners includes royalties with a guaranteed minimum of $10million and upwards of $40million based on initial sales projections, an amount that chairman Martin Bendier of Sony/ATV Publishing has stated to be [...] "not even comparable to anything that has been done before". The licensing of the Beatles' work for the game was considered a <b>critical</b> <b>step</b> in the later negotiations and availability of the band's songs on iTunes about a year after the game's release. A further complication arose about a year after the game's release; Chrysalis Group legally challenged EMI over a previous 1965 agreement whereby EMI would pay Chrysalis up to 1.5% of royalties on sales of the Beatles' records, and claimed that they are owned ₤500,000 for the two million units sold of The Beatles: Rock Band.
