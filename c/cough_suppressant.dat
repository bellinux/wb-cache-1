25|$|Today {{the main}} use of camphor is as a <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant</b> {{and as a}} decongestant. It is an active {{ingredient}} (along with menthol) in vapor-steam decongestant products, such as Vicks VapoRub.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a marked}} {{difference}} between dextromethorphan hydrobromide, contained in most <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant</b> preparations, and dextromethorphan polistirex, contained in the brand name preparation Delsym. Polistirex is a polymer that is bonded to the dextromethorphan that requires more time for the stomach to digest it as it requires that an ion exchange reaction take place prior to its dissolution into the blood. Because of this, dextromethorphan polistirex takes considerably longer to absorb, resulting in more gradual and longer lasting effects reminiscent of time release pills. As a <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant,</b> the polistirex version lasts up to 12 hours. This duration also holds true when used recreationally.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{dextromethorphan}} is as a <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant,</b> for the temporary relief of cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation (such as commonly accompanies the flu and common cold), {{as well as}} those resulting from inhaled particle irritants. However, controlled studies have found the symptomatic effectiveness of dextromethorphan similar to placebo. This could also serve {{as an example of the}} power of the placebo effect.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to other}} {{chemicals}} available to 18th century regular physicians, opium was a benign {{alternative to the}} arsenics, mercuries, or emetics, and it was remarkably successful in alleviating {{a wide range of}} ailments. Due to the constipation often produced by the consumption of opium, {{it was one of the}} most effective treatments for cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea. As a <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant,</b> opium was used to treat bronchitis, tuberculosis, and other respiratory illnesses. Opium was additionally prescribed for rheumatism and insomnia.|$|E
25|$|In many {{documented}} cases, dextromethorphan {{has produced}} psychological dependence {{in people who}} used it recreationally. However, it does not produce physical addiction, according to the WHO Committee on Drug Dependence. It is considered less addictive than the other common weak opiate <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant,</b> codeine. Since dextromethorphan also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) users describe that regular recreational use {{over a longer period}} of time can cause withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Additionally, disturbances have been reported in: sleep, senses, movement, mood, and thinking.|$|E
25|$|Reddish-brown and {{extremely}} bitter, laudanum contains {{almost all of}} the opium alkaloids, including morphine and codeine, and its high morphine concentration makes it a potent narcotic. Laudanum was historically used to treat a variety of ailments, but its principal use was as an analgesic and <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant.</b> Until the early 20th century, laudanum was sold without a prescription and was a constituent of many patent medicines. Today, laudanum is recognized as addictive and is strictly regulated and controlled as such throughout most of the world. The United States Uniform Controlled Substances Act, for one example, lists it on Schedule II.|$|E

25|$|Dextromethorphan (DXM or DM) {{is a drug}} of the morphinan {{class with}} sedative, dissociative, and {{stimulant}} properties (at higher doses). It is a <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant</b> in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines including generic labels and store brands, Benylin DM, Mucinex DM, Camydex-20 tablets, Robitussin, NyQuil, Dimetapp, Vicks, Coricidin, Delsym, TheraFlu, Cheracol D, and others. Dextromethorphan has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief (as either the primary analgesic, or an opioid potentiator) over psychological applications {{to the treatment of}} addiction. It is sold in syrup, tablet, spray, and lozenge forms. In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder.|$|E
25|$|Misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, {{rather than}} using a <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant</b> whose sole active {{ingredient}} is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine, any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan. Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener found in many cough syrups containing dextromethorphan, can also have negative side effects including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of dextromethorphan. Guaifenesin, an expectorant commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.|$|E
25|$|The racemic parent {{compound}} racemorphan was first {{described in a}} Swiss and US patent application from Hoffmann-La Roche in 1946 and 1947, respectively; a patent was granted in 1950. A resolution of the two isomers of racemorphan with tartaric acid was published in 1952, and DXM was successfully tested in 1954 as part of US Navy and CIA-funded research on nonaddictive substitutes for codeine. DXM {{was approved by the}} FDA in 1958 as an over-the-counter antitussive. As had been initially hoped, DXM was a solution for some of the problems {{associated with the use of}} codeine phosphate as a <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant,</b> such as sedation and opiate dependence, but like the dissociative anesthetics phencyclidine and ketamine, DXM later became associated with nonmedical use.|$|E

It {{is intended to}} treat mild pain and also has antitussive (<b>cough</b> <b>suppressant)</b> and local anaesthetic effects. The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias.

Additionally, {{there is no evidence that}} hydrocodone is useful in children. Similarly, a 2012 Dutch guideline regarding the treatment of acute cough does not recommend its use. (The opioid analogue dextromethorphan, long claimed to be as effective a <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant</b> as codeine, has similarly demonstrated little benefit in several recent studies.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Dextromethorphan, or DXM, {{a common}} active {{ingredient}} {{found in many}} over-the-counter <b>cough</b> <b>suppressant</b> cold medicines, {{is used as a}} recreational drug and entheogen for its dissociative effects. It has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses. Dextromethorphan has powerful dissociative properties when administered in doses well above those considered therapeutic for cough suppression. Recreational use of DXM is sometimes referred to in slang form as [...] "robo-tripping," [...] whose prefix derives from the Robitussin brand name, or Triple Cs, which derives from the Coricidin brand. (The pills were printed with [...] "CCC" [...] for [...] "Coricidin Cough and Cold.")
