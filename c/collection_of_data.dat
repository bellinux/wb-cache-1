5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{the theory of}} biology, {{grounded}} in systematic observation and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science. Many of his observations were made during his stay {{on the island of}} Lesbos, including especially his descriptions of the marine biology of the Pyrrha lagoon there. His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E

Further, information on the patient's insight, judgment, and capacity for abstract reasoning is used to inform decisions about treatment strategy and the choice of an appropriate treatment setting.|$|E
5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting and easy to read. This differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented {{more than a mere}} <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting a <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> values by numeric keys, {{each of which}} is an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

25|$|Galton devoted much of {{the rest}} of his life to {{exploring}} variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted. In so doing, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.|$|E
25|$|In applications, it is {{frequently}} useful {{to build a}} B-tree to represent a large existing <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> and then update it incrementally using standard B-tree operations. In this case, {{the most efficient way}} to construct the initial B-tree is not to insert every element in the initial collection successively, but instead to construct the initial set of leaf nodes directly from the input, then build the internal nodes from these. This approach to B-tree construction is called bulkloading. Initially, every leaf but the last one has one extra element, which will be used to build the internal nodes.|$|E

25|$|In {{computer}} science, a {{linked list}} is a linear <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element {{points to the}} next. It is a data structure consisting {{of a group of}} nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references.|$|E
25|$|One naïve Bayesian {{approach}} to hypothesis testing is to base {{decisions on the}} posterior probability, but this fails when comparing point and continuous hypotheses. Other approaches to decision making, such as Bayesian decision theory, attempt to balance the consequences of incorrect decisions across all possibilities, rather than concentrating on a single null hypothesis. A number of other approaches to reaching a decision based on data are available via decision theory and optimal decisions, {{some of which have}} desirable properties. Hypothesis testing, though, is a dominant {{approach to}} data analysis in many fields of science. Extensions to the theory of hypothesis testing include the study of the power of tests, i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is false. Such considerations can be used for the purpose of sample size determination prior to the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the signing}} of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939, Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, and the Soviet Union invaded Poland on 17 September, {{resulting}} in the occupation of Poland by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The first Gestapo–NKVD meeting took place in Brześć nad Bugiem (Brest) reportedly on 27 September 1939, while some units of the Polish Army were still fighting (see: Invasion of Poland) resulting in mass internment of soldiers and their extrajudicial shootings {{on both sides of the}} Curzon Line. At the meeting, the German and Soviet officials reached a mutual agreement about the fate of Polish infantry soldiers captured by the Red Army. Between 24 October and 23 November 1939 a total of 42,492 Polish prisoners of war were transferred from Kozelsk and Putyvl camps across the Nazi-Soviet demarcation line and handed over to the Germans. Both Gestapo and NKVD expected the emergence of Polish resistance and discussed ways of dealing with the clandestine activities of the Poles. In the immediate aftermath of the meeting, the Soviet NKVD began the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> leading to the Katyn massacre committed in the spring of 1940.|$|E

500|$|After {{touring the}} {{disaster}} area, Florida Governor Reubin Askew noted, [...] "I think we're {{going to have}} to take a long, close look at some of the construction [...] Some of the structures simply won't be able to be built back in the exact location where they were." [...] Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm. He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties. The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid. Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid. Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area. In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet [...] wide referred to as Eloise Inlet. Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models.
