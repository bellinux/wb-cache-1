An important aspect of supramolecular chemistry, which has recently come {{to the attention of}} the scientific community, is the structural rôle played by metals in intra-molecular and inter-molecular interactions. Metals are essential elements for many of the fundamental activities of cells. Storing, metabolism and trafficking of metals through the cellular membrane and within the cytoplasm is mediated by many proteins via well tuned mechanisms because of the toxicity of free ions. Re-cently the high sociological impact of neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer disease, Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, Parkinson disease, etc.) has pushed the attention of researchers from the Biophysical and Biomedical point of view towards the study of the rôle played by metals in the misfolding process, re-garded as a possible <b>concurrent</b> <b>cause</b> of protein aggregation and plaque formation.

60|$|There is one Phænomenon more, which may, if care be used, exhibit to the beholder, {{as it has}} divers {{times to}} me, an {{exceeding}} pleasant, and not less instructive Spectacle; And that is, if curiosity and diligence be used, you may so split this admirable Substance, {{that you may have}} pretty large Plates (in companion of those smaller ones which you may observe in the Rings) that are perhaps an 1/8 or a 1/6 part of an inch over, each of them appearing through the Microscope most curiously, intirely, and uniformly adorned with some one vivid colour: this, if examined with the Microscope, may be plainly perceived to be in all parts of it equally thick.

60|$|Of {{the more}} special {{appearances}} which the photosphere presents, {{let us take}} first the faculæ. These are ascribed to waves in the photosphere; {{and the way in}} which such waves might produce an excess of light has been variously explained in conformity with various hypotheses. What would result from them in a photosphere constituted and conditioned as above supposed? Traversing a canopy of cloud, here thicker and there thinner, a wave would cause a disturbance very unlikely to leave the thin and thick parts without any change in their average permeability to light. There would probably be, at some parts of the wave, extensions in the areas of the light-transmitting clouds, resulting in the passage of more rays from below. Another phenomenon, less common but more striking, appears also to be in harmony with the hypothesis. I refer to those bright spots, of a brilliancy greater than that of the photosphere, which are sometimes observed. In the course of a physical process so vast and so active as that here supposed to be going on in the Sun, we may expect that <b>concurrent</b> <b>causes</b> will occasionally produce ascending currents much hotter than usual, or more voluminous, or both. One of these, on reaching the stratum of luminous and illuminated cloud forming the photosphere, will burst through it, dispersing and dissolving it, and ascending to a greater height before it begins itself to condense: meanwhile allowing to be seen, through its transparent mass, the incandescent molten shell of the sun's body.|$|E
60|$|All laws of {{causation}} are {{liable to}} be in this manner counteracted, and seemingly frustrated, by coming into conflict with other laws, the separate result of which is opposite to theirs, or more or less inconsistent with it. And hence, with almost every law, many instances in which it really is entirely fulfilled, do not, at first sight, appear to be cases of its operation at all. It is so in the example just adduced: a force in mechanics means neither more nor less than a cause of motion, yet the sum of the effects of two causes of motion may be rest. Again, a body solicited by two forces in directions making an angle with one another, moves in the diagonal; and it seems a paradox to say that motion in the diagonal is the sum of two motions in two other lines. Motion, however, is but change of place, and at every instant the body is in the exact place it would have been in if the forces had acted during alternate instants instead of acting in the same instant (saving that if we suppose two forces to act successively which are in truth simultaneous we must of course allow them double the time). It is evident, therefore, that each force has had, during each instant, all the effect which belonged to it; and that the modifying influence which one of two <b>concurrent</b> <b>causes</b> is said to exercise with respect to the other may be considered as exerted not over the action of the cause itself, but over the effect after it is completed. For all purposes of predicting, calculating, or explaining their joint result, causes which compound their effects may be treated as if they produced simultaneously each of them its own effect, and all these effects co-existed visibly.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Mobility is {{a central}} feature of many {{distributed}} systems of ever growing complexity. To make their formal analysis and verification feasible, process algebras — notably the π-calculus — have been introduced and extensively studied. A well-established method of verifying the correctness of general distributed systems has been model-checking which is completely automatic and relatively fast compared to other alternatives, and so particularly attractive in industrial context. Mobile systems are highly <b>concurrent</b> <b>causing</b> state space explosion when applying model-checking techniques. To cope with this problem, techniques based on partial order semantics of concurrency seem to offer the desired level of efficiency. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate how one of such techniques — based of unfoldings of high-level Petri nets — could be used for verification of π-calculus terms. Our starting point was an existing compositional translation from a finite fragment of the π-calculus into a class of high-level Petri nets. We developed a prototype tool based on this theoretical translation and an existing efficient unfolder and verifier. In this paper, we describe initial experimental results in support of specific design choices. Crucially, developing the prototype was not a straightforward task since the theoretical translation does not produce nets which conform to the input format required by the verifier. The paper states how this mismatch has been overcome and draws conclusions for future uses of unfoldings technique in the modelchecking of mobile systems...|$|R

Scarcely any change can rightly be ascribed to one agency alone, to the neglect of the permanent or temporary conditions under which only this agency produces the change. But as it does not materially affect our argument, we prefer, for simplicity's sake, to use throughout the popular mode of expression. Perhaps it will be further objected, that to assign loss of heat as the cause of any changes, is to attribute these changes not to a force, but to the absence of a force. And this is true. Strictly speaking, the changes should be attributed to those forces which come into action when the antagonist force is withdrawn. But though there is inaccuracy in saying that the freezing of water is due to the loss of its heat, no practical error arises from it; nor will a parallel laxity of expression vitiate our statements respecting the multiplication of effects. Indeed, the objection serves but {{to draw attention to the}} fact, that not only does the exertion of a force produce more than one change, but the withdrawal of a force produces more than one change.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} and an equally strong {{reason why the}} law of a complex effect must be less general than {{the laws of the}} causes which conspire to produce it. The same causes, acting {{according}} to the same laws, and differing only in the proportions in which they are combined, often produce effects which differ not merely in quantity, but in kind. The combination of a centripetal with a projectile force, in the proportions which obtain in all the planets and satellites of our solar system, gives rise to an elliptical motion; but if the ratio of the two forces to each other were slightly altered, it is demonstrated that the motion produced would be in a circle, or a parabola, or an hyperbola; and it is thought {{that in the case of}} some comets one of these is probably the fact. Yet the law of the parabolic motion would be resolvable into the very same simple laws into which that of the elliptical motion is resolved, namely, the law of the permanence of rectilineal motion, and the law of gravitation. If, therefore, in the course of ages, some circumstance were to manifest itself which, without defeating the law of either of those forces, should merely alter their proportion to one another (such as the shock of some solid body, or even the accumulating effect of the resistance of the medium in which astronomers have been led to surmise that the motions of the heavenly bodies take place), the elliptical motion might be changed into a motion in some other conic section; and the complex law, that the planetary motions take place in ellipses, would be deprived of its universality, though the discovery would not at all detract from the universality of the simpler laws into which that complex law is resolved. The law, in short, of each of the <b>concurrent</b> <b>causes</b> remains the same, however their collocations may vary; but the law of their joint effect varies with every difference in the collocations. There needs no more to show how much more general the elementary laws must be than any of the complex laws which are derived from them.|$|E

These currents have been detected on high- and medium-voltage lines. In some cases they are even used on the main system for remote reading of electric meters. This implies that radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields are present near the electric network in addition to the 50 / 60 Hz fields. The intensity of these RF fields is low but the intensity of currents induced in the human body by exposure to magnetic fields increases with frequency. Because scientific research has not yet clarified whether the risk is related to the value of magnetic induction or to the currents this kind of exposure produces in the human body, it is reasonable to suggest that the presence of the RF magnetic fields must be considered in the context of epidemiologic studies.

It has been estimated that alcohol abuse represents the world's third largest risk factor for disease and disability; it is a causal factor of 60 types of diseases and injuries and a <b>concurrent</b> <b>cause</b> of at least 200 others. Liver is the main organ responsible for metabolizing ethanol, thus it has been considered for long time the major victim of the harmful {{use of alcohol}}. Ethanol and its bioactive products, acetaldehyde-acetate, fatty acid ethanol esters, ethanol-protein adducts, have been regarded as hepatotoxins that directly and indirectly exert their toxic effect on the liver. A similar mechanism has been postulated for the alcohol-related pancreatic damage. Alcohol and its metabolites directly injure acinar cells and elicit stellate cells to produce and deposit extracellular matrix thus triggering the "necrosis-fibrosis" sequence that finally leads to atrophy and fibrosis, morphological hallmarks of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Even if less {{attention has been paid to}} the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, ethanol produces harmful effects by inducing: (1) direct damaging of the mucosa of the esophagus and stomach; (2) modification of the sphincterial pressure and impairment of motility; and (3) alteration of gastric acid output.

For each variable the calculation of heterogeneity was performed. For continuous variables the calculation of ES and its significance were performed while Odds Ratio (OR) and its significance were calculated for not continuous variables. The results show a statistically significant increase of SBP and DBP in HE workers compared to LE and IE workers while HR is statistically higher in HE participants compared to LE participants. The prevalence of both hypertension and ECG abnormalities is statistically higher in HE workers compared to LE and IE workers. Taking into account both the extremely high heterogeneity among studies and the ES/OR values we suggest a particular attention to the measurement and evaluation of SBP, DBP and HR in workers with chronic exposure to noise. Also ECG for workers with chronic exposure to noise is suggested in order to identify and evaluate possible abnormalities noise could be a <b>concurrent</b> <b>cause</b> of. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
