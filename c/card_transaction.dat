5|$|At {{the request}} of Lothian Buses, {{installation}} of 30 ticket machines at key bus stops began in 2007. Passengers had to purchase tickets before boarding the bus, reducing dwell times, but the machines were not popular with users and were scrapped in 2011. Consideration was given to installing similar on-street ticket machines, and new, advanced machines (capable of reading smartcards and accepting credit/debit cards) were installed in early 2014 at each tram stop. The new ticket machines are the Galexio-Plus type supplied by the French-based company Parkeon. however the option to accept banknotes or give change is not available. The minimum spend for a <b>card</b> <b>transaction</b> is £3 {{which is more than}} the cost for a single ticket.|$|E

50|$|Credit <b>card</b> <b>transactions</b> now {{represent}} {{a large percentage}} of low value transactions on which credit card companies charge merchants. Most of such credit <b>card</b> <b>transactions</b> are more of a habit than an actual need for credit {{and to the extent that}} such purchases represent convenience or lack of planning to carry cash on the part of consumers, these transactions add a layer of unnecessary expense. However, debit or check <b>card</b> <b>transactions</b> are cheaper than processing paper checks.|$|R

25|$|For {{merchant}}s, {{a credit}} <b>card</b> <b>transaction</b> {{is often more}} secure than other forms of payment, such as cheques, because the issuing bank commits to pay the merchant the moment the transaction is authorized, {{regardless of whether the}} consumer defaults on the credit card payment (except for legitimate disputes, which are discussed below, and can result in charges back to the merchant). In most cases, cards are even more secure than cash, because they discourage theft by the merchant's employees and reduce the amount of cash on the premises. Finally, credit cards reduce the back office expense of processing checks/cash and transporting them to the bank.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, PayPal is {{licensed}} as a money transmitter, on a state-by-state basis. But {{state laws}} vary, as do their definitions of banks, narrow banks, money services businesses and money transmitters. [...] Although PayPal is not {{classified as a}} bank, the company is subject {{to some of the}} rules and regulations governing the financial industry including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act. The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from P2P payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit <b>card</b> <b>transaction,</b> specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges. Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit <b>card</b> <b>transaction</b> occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.|$|E
2500|$|Also, the Financial Ombudsman Service {{position}} is that section 75 protection does not apply where PayPal or any eMoney service becomes involved in the credit <b>card</b> <b>transaction.</b> This leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service. They only have recourse with the courts. However, The key issues which determine the applicability of section 75 are identified very clearly in Office of Fair Trading v Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and others [...] EWCA Civ 268 7 and the Bank of Scotland v Alfred Truman (a firm) [...] 583 (QB). This is legal authority that section 75 protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product, via an eMoney service.|$|E
