5|$|Lukačević and his Chetniks {{were drawn}} into closer <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Axis {{during the second}} phase of Case White, which took place in the Neretva and Rama river valleys in late February 1943 {{and was one of the}} largest anti-Partisan offensives of the war. Despite the fact that the Chetniks were an anti-Axis {{movement}} in their long-range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods, their involvement in Case White is one of the most significant examples of their tactical or selective <b>collaboration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Axis occupation forces. In this instance, the participating Chetniks received Italian logistic support and included those operating as legalized auxiliary forces under Italian control. During this offensive, between 12,000 and 15,000 Chetniks fought alongside Italian forces, and Lukačević and his Chetniks also fought alongside German and Croatian troops against the Partisans.|$|E

5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems.
