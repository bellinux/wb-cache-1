Images of the mesiobuccal root of 100 maxillary first molars were acquired by CBCT and then roots were cross-sectioned into two parts, starting at 3 mm from the apex. Data were recorded and analyzed according to Weine's classification for root canal configuration, and Hsu and Kim's classification for isthmuses. In the analysis of CBCT images, 8 root canals were classified as type I, 57 as type II, 35 as type III. In the <b>cross-sectioning</b> technique, 19 root canals were classified as type I, 60 as type II, 20 as type III and 1 as type IV. The classification of isthmuses was predominantly type I in both CBCT and <b>cross-sectioning</b> evaluations for sections at 3 mm from the apex, while for sections at 6 mm from the apex, the classification of isthmuses was predominantly types V and II in CBCT and <b>cross-sectioning</b> evaluations, respectively.

Compared to a production spring wire, <b>cross-section</b> area can be reduced about 2. 4 [%] without increasing maximum stress level.

30|$|Much of {{the earlier}} {{published}} research was focused on examining cross-sections of the wallboard, visibly determining the depth of calcination based on different bands of color within the cross-section (Posey and Posey 1983). The Posey study reported that an investigator could visibly identify subtle color changes in individually cut cross-sections of the wallboard and prescribe the DOFD associated with the color changes.

FIB <b>cross-sectioning</b> indicates that films deposited at room temperature have an irregular crystalline structure with voids, but those grown at 160 °C are denser with a better polycrystalline structure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{methodology}} {{to derive}} <b>cross-section</b> data from measurements {{in a cold}} neutron beam was studied. Mostly, capture <b>cross-sections</b> at thermal energy are derived relative to a standard <b>cross-section,</b> e. g. the <b>cross-section</b> of the 1 H(n,γ), 14 N(n,γ), or 197 Au(n,γ) reaction, and proportionality between the standard and the measured <b>cross-section,</b> evaluated at different energies in the sub-thermal region, is often assumed. Due to this assumption the derived capture <b>cross-section</b> at thermal energy can be biased by more than 10 %. Evidently the bias {{depends on how much}} the energy dependence of the <b>cross-section</b> deviates from a direct proportionality with the inverse of the neutron speed. The effect is reduced in case the <b>cross-section</b> is not derived at thermal energy but at an energy close to the average energy of the cold neutron beam. Nevertheless, it is demonstrated that the bias can only be avoided in case the energy dependence of the <b>cross-section</b> is known and proper correction factors are applied. In some cases the results are also biased when the attenuation of the neutron beam within the sample is neglected in the analysis. Some of the <b>cross-section</b> data reported in the literature suffer from such bias effects. Hence, the results have to be corrected using the correction factors presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|For {{accurate}} {{determination of}} thickness-profile in vessel quantification, {{it is important}} to find appropriate vessel crosssections. To obtain vessel <b>cross-sections,</b> a centerline-based approach has been widely used, but it has several inherent problems causing improper <b>cross-sections.</b> First, this approach cannot define <b>cross-sections</b> in a unique way. Second, <b>cross-sections</b> are sensitive to the degree of smoothness of a detected vessel centerline. Third, a small variation in a centerline causes a considerable change in the resultant <b>cross-sections</b> and this phenomenon brings about improper crosssections in the abnormal vessel of asymmetric structure. Finally, wrong <b>cross-sections</b> may be detected due to the intersection with the other <b>cross-sections</b> in a region of high curvature. In this paper, instead of a centerline, we propose and adopt a complementary geodesic distance field. Then, we detect a sequence of equidistant lines by using the proposed distance field. Finally, we determine <b>cross-sections</b> by refining the obtained equidistant lines. Due to the prospective properties of the proposed distance field, we can alleviate all of the conventional problems and obtain the <b>cross-sections</b> more proper for vessel quantification. Through the intensive simulation using various 2 -D synthesized images, we prove that the proposed method provides non-intersecting <b>cross-sections</b> which are insensitive to local variation of geometrical shapes in abnormal vessels...|$|R
