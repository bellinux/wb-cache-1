40|$|Coal is a combustible, <b>carbonaceous,</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> that {{is formed}} by the accumulation, compaction, and {{physical}} and chemical alteration of vegetation [Simon and Hopkins 1981; Bates and Jackson 1987]. Coal is classified according to its type, grade, and rank. The type of coal relates to the plant materials from which the coal originated. The grade of coal refers to {{the purity of the}} coal-or the amount of inorganic material (including ash and sulfur) left after the coal is burned [Bates and Jackson 1987; Stefanko 1983]. The rank of coal indicates its degree of metamorphosis and roughly correlates to the geological age of the coal or the geological environment from which it has been mined [Bates and Jackson 1987]. Rank also indicates the percentage of carbon in dry, mineral-free coal [Whitten and Brooks 1973] {{and the degree to which}} the coalification process has progressed [Larsen 1981]. The geological process of coalification begins with organic materials (e. g., celluloses, lignins, and other plant compounds that are deoxygenated and then dehydrogenated) and ends with coal of various geological ages, from lignite to anthracite [Larsen 1981]. Table 3 - 1 presents the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) classification of coals by rank. According to Parkes [1982], high-rank coal includes anthracite and semianthracite coal ("hard coal," with 91 % to 95 % carbon); intermediate-rank coal includes low-, medium-, and high-volatile bituminous and sub-bituminous coal ("soft coal," with 76 % to 90 % carbon); and low-rank coal includes lignite (with 65 % to 75 % carbon or less). The rank of coal tends to increase from the western to the eastern United States, with anthracite occurring primarily in eastern Pennsylvania [Schlick and Fannick 1971]. Most of the coal currently mined in the United States is bituminous [Given 1984]. A classification of the coal in the United States is provided in Table 3 - 2...|$|E

Significant accumulations of polymetallic felsic VHMS deposits (Kudz Ze Kayah, GP 4 F, and Wolverine) have only been discovered in the Kudz Ze Kayah unit and Wolverine succession to date. In the hanging wall of the Money Creek thrust, felsic volcanic and high-level intrusive rocks in the Fire Lake unit have calc-alkalic and tholeiitic affinities with low high field strength element (HFSE) contents and intermediate Zr/Sc (9. 4 – 43. 4) and Zr/TiO 2 (254 – 864) ratios.

40|$|Hydrocarbons {{and organic}} {{biomarkers}} extracted from black shales and other <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> are valuable {{sources of information}} on the biodiversity and environment of early Earth. However, many Precambrian hydrocarbons including biomarkers are suspected of being younger contamination. An alternative approach is to study biomarkers trapped in oil-bearing fluid inclusions by bulk crushing samples and subsequently analysing the extracted hydrocarbons with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, this method does not constrain the hydrocarbons to one particular oil inclusion, which means that if several different generations of oil inclusions are present in the sample, a mix of the content from these oil inclusions will be analysed. In addition, samples with few and/or small inclusions are often below the detection limit. Recently, we showed {{that it is possible to}} detect organic biomarkers in single oil-bearing fluid inclusions using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). In the present study, single fluid inclusion analysis has been performed on Proterozoic samples for the first time. Four individual oil-bearing fluid inclusions, found in 1430. Ma sandstone from the Roper Superbasin in Northern Australia, were analysed with ToF-SIMS. The ToF-SIMS spectra of the oil in the different inclusions are very similar to each other and are consistent with the presence of n-alkanes/branched alkanes, monocyclic alkanes, bicyclic alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and tetracyclic and pentacyclic hydrocarbons. These results are in agreement with those obtained from bulk crushing of inclusions trapped in the same samples. The capability to analyse the hydrocarbon and biomarker composition of single oil-bearing fluid inclusions is a major breakthrough, as it opens up a way of obtaining molecular compositional data on ancient oils without the ambiguity of the origin of these hydrocarbons. Additionally, this finding suggests that it will be possible to analyse minute oil samples beyond the capability of established techniques. This may allow the biomarker record of the biosphere, as preserved in fluid inclusions, to be extended further back in time, and hence makes it possible to more accurately trace the early evolution of life on Earth, and search for life on other planets or moons. 16 page(s...|$|R

However, the mineralogy and the mechanisms of concentration of these critical elements in different types of hydrothermal ore deposits remain poorly constrained. We investigated the mineralogical distribution of Ge, Ga and In at the Mt Carlton high-sulfidation epithermal deposit in NE Australia, using electron probe microanalysis and laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Parageneses from which selected minerals were analyzed include: Stage 1 acid sulfate alteration (alunite), Stage 2 A high-sulfidation enargite mineralization (enargite, argyrodite, sphalerite, pyrite, barite), Stage 2 B intermediate-sulfidation sphalerite mineralization (sphalerite, pyrite, galena) and Stage 3 hydrothermal void fill (dickite). Moderate to locally high concentrations of Ga were measured in Stage 1 alunite (up to 339 ppm) and in Stage 3 dickite (up to 150 ppm). The Stage 2 A ores show enrichment in Ge, which is primarily associated with argyrodite (up to 6. 95 wt % Ge) and Ge-bearing enargite (up to 2189 ppm Ge). Co-existing sphalerite has comparatively low Ge content (up to 143 ppm), while Ga (up to 1181 ppm) and In (up to 571 ppm) are higher. Sphalerite in Stage 2 B contains up to 611 ppm Ge, 2829 ppm Ga and 2169 ppm In, and locally exhibits fine colloform bands of an uncharacterized Zn-In mineral with compositions close to CuZn 2 (In,Ga) S 4. Barite, pyrite and galena which occur in association with Stage 2 mineralization were found to play negligible roles as carriers of Ge, Ga and In at Mt Carlton. Analyzed reference samples of enargite from seven similar deposits worldwide have average Ge concentrations ranging from 12 to 717 ppm (maximum 2679 ppm). The deposits from which samples showed high enrichment in critical elements {{in this study are}} all hosted in stratigraphic sequences that locally contain <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> In addition to magmatic-hydrothermal processes, such rocks could potentially be important for the concentration of critical elements in high-sulfidation epithermal deposits...|$|R
40|$|The Pueblo Viejo district, {{located in}} the Cordillera Central of the Dominican Republic, {{contains}} large Au-Ag deposits associated with acid-sulfate alteration within spilites, conglomerates and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> that were deposited in a maar-diatreme complex. Much of the Au mineralization occurs in pyritic, carbonaceous siltstones of the Pueblo Viejo Maar-Diatreme Member of the Cretaceous Los Ranchos Formation. Pyrite is the only Fe-bearing phase in mineralized rock, whereas siderite is the dominant Fe-bearing phase in siltstones distal to mineralization. Disseminated pyrite occurs as framboids, cubes, pyritohedra, concretions and cement. Early framboids occur throughout the district. Au occurs as inclusions in later non-framboid disseminated pyrite (NFDP); an occurrence that is interpreted to be indicative of contemporaneous deposition. Pyrite framboids exhibit {{a wide range of}} [delta] 34 S-values (- 17. 5 to + 4. 8 [per mille sign]) and are interpreted to have formed during biogenic reduction of pore-water sulfate. The NFDP yield restricted [delta] 34 S-values (, s = +/- 2. 4 [per mille sign], n = 43) similar to those obtained from later vein pyrite (, s = +/- 1. 5 [per mille sign], n = 12). Alunite and barite have [delta] 34 S-values ranging from + 18. 8 to + 21. 6 [per mille sign]. The interpretation that the NFDP, vein pyrite, alunite and barite, and possibly even the framboidal pyrite share a common source of igneous sulfur is supported by the [delta] 34 S data. Siderite occurs as concretions and cement, contains abundant Mg (Fe 0. 75 Mg 0. 19 Mn 0. 03 Ca 0. 02 CO 3) and has [delta] 13 C- and [delta] 18 O-values ranging from - 2. 5 to + 1. 1 %. and + 14. 6 to + 19. 5 [per mille sign], respectively. These data are consistent with the interpretation that the siderite formed in lacustrine sediments and that the carbonate in the siderite is probably methanogenic, although contributions from oxidation of organic matter during biogenic sulfate reduction, thermal decarboxylation of organic matter, or magmatic vapor cannot be ruled out. Disseminated Au mineralization in the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> formed when a hydrothermal fluid encountered reactive Fe 2 + in diagenetic siderite. The ensuing pyrite deposition consumed H 2 S and destabilized the Au (HS) - 2 complex, leading to precipitation of Au.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The Himalaya are the {{geologic}} {{manifestation of}} continental collision, and in northern Pakistan the Main Mantle thrust (MMT) {{is a major}} suture along which the collision occurred. A newly recognized basement uplift near Besham village in southern Kohistan, adjacent to the MMT, is bounded on {{the east and west}} by north-trending high angle fault zones. The uplift exposes basement rocks that are significantly different from any of the other plutonic and metamorphic rocks of southern Kohistan and that are not seen elsewhere in the Pakistan Himalaya west of the Nanga Parbat-Haramosh massif (NPHM). Rocks of the Besham area are subdivided from oldest to youngest into five groups. The oldest rocks are (1) the Besham group, metasediments and heterogeneous gneisses. In conjunction with field evidence, major, trace, and rare earth element analyses of Besham gneisses suggests that the gneisses formed in situ from a sedimentary protolith. The presence of both quartzofeldspathic gneiss and sodic quartzofeldspathic gneiss in the Besham group may be attributable to variable protolith composition. The Besham group was intruded by (2) mafic dikes that were subsequently metamorphosed to amphibolites. Geochemical data suggests that these tholeiitic dikes have island arc geochemical affinities. (3) The third group of rocks compose the Lahor granitic complex, which includes cogenetic, small granitic intrusions and associated pegmatites; the Shang granite, the Dubair granite and the Shorgara pegmatite. Unconformably lying upon these three units is (4) the Karora group, which comprises conglomeratic, calcareous, and <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> The Karora group provides evidence for more than one metamorphic event in the Besham area basement uplift, i. e., the Karora group is metamorphosed to middle greenschist facies, in contrast with the underlying units, which are metamorphosed to epidote- amphibotite facies. The youngest unit observed in the Besham area basement uplift is (5) a relatively undeformed leucogranite that intrudes both the Karora group and the Besham group. The leucogranite is a previously unrecognized unit. The metamorphic and granitic rocks of the Besham area uplift may be correlative with basement exposed in the Nanga Parbat-Haramosh massif. Specifically, the quartzofeldspathic gneisses of the Besham group may correlate with the Nanga Parbat gneisses, and the amphibolites found in the Besham area may correlate with mafic dikes of the massif. Further study of both the Besham area uplift and the NPHM can provide a better understanding of Precambrian basement rocks of northern Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence and}} arguments that <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> were {{a source for}} Au and As in sediment-hosted orogenic and Carlin-type gold deposits and develops a corresponding genetic model. In this two-stage basin-scale model, gold and arsenic are introduced early into black shale and turbidite basins during sedimentation and diagenesis (stage 1) and concentrated to ore grades by later hydrothermal, structural, or magmatic processes (stage 2). In reduced continental margin basin settings, organic matter, sedimented under anoxic to euxinic conditions, immobilizes and concentrates gold, arsenic, {{and a range of}} trace elements (particularly V, Ni, Se, Ag, Zn, Mo, Cu, U) present in marine bottom waters, into fine-grained black mudstone and siltstone of slope and basin facies. During early diagenesis, gold and certain other trace elements (Ni, Se, Te, Ag, Mo, Cu, ±PGE) are preferentially partitioned into arsenian pyrite that grows in the muds. These processes produce regionally extensive black shale and turbidite sequences enriched in syngenetic gold and arsenic, commonly from 5 to 100 ppb Au and 10 to 200 ppm As. Rare organic- and sulfide-rich metalliferous black shales may contain up to 1 to 2 ppm Au and over 1, 000 ppm As, present as refractory gold in arsenian pyrite and nanoparticles of free gold. During late diagenesis and early metamorphism (stage 2) the diagenetic arsenian pyrite is recrystallized to form coarser grained pyrite generations, and the organic matter is cooked to bitumen. Under higher grade metamorphism (lower greenschist facies and above) arsenian pyrite in carbonaceous shales is converted to pyrrhotite. These processes release gold, arsenic, sulfur and other elements (Sb, Te, Cu, Zn, Mo, Bi, Tl, and Pb) from the source rocks to become concentrated by hydrothermal processes, locally to produce gold ores, in structural sites such as fold hinge zones, shear or breccia zones within or above the black shale sequence. LA-ICP-MS analyses of diagenetic pyrite in carbonaceous sediments, both associated and not associated with gold deposits, suggests that invisible gold contents of greater than 250 ppb in diagenetic pyrite, are indicative of carbonaceous shale source rocks with the potential to produce economic gold deposits. Application of this sedimentary source-rock model enables a systematic exploration approach for sediment-hosted gold deposits, based on the distribution, composition and structure of carbonaceous shale sequences and their contained diagenetic pyrite...|$|R

Fission-track dating of zircons was also tentatively applied to granitic cobbles derived from the basement <b>rocks</b> to the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> These data are useful to clear not only the characterization of the <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> but also the sedimentary history in the Shimanto terrane of this area. ...|$|R
50|$|Iron-rich <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> are <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> {{which contain}} 15% or more iron. However, most <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks</b> contain iron in varying degrees. The {{majority}} of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods: The Precambrian (3800 to 570 million years ago), the early Paleozoic (570 to 410 million years ago), and the middle to late Mesozoic (205 to 66 million years ago). Overall, they make up a very {{small portion of the}} total sedimentary record.|$|R
50|$|Sedimentary breccia {{is a type}} of clastic <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> {{which is}} made of angular to subangular, {{randomly}} oriented clasts of other <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rocks.</b> A conglomerate, by contrast, is a <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> composed of rounded fragments or clasts of pre-existing rocks. Both breccia and conglomerate are composed of fragments averaging greater than 2 mm in size. The angular shape of the fragments indicates that the material has not been transported far from its source.|$|R
50|$|The exposed bulk of Turbidite Hill {{consists}} of a very thick diabase (dolerite) sill {{that is part of}} the Ferrar Dolerite. The summit of Turbidite Hill {{consists of}} a relatively thin layer of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> of the Buckley Formation (Coal Measures), which is part of the Beacon Supergroup. This layer is either a large block of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> enclosed within a diabase sill or a layer of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>rock</b> lying between two sills.|$|R
