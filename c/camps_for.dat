5|$|Most French {{prisoners of}} war were not held in <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> most of the war, but instead, over 93 percent of French {{prisoners of war}} lived and worked on Kommandos of work details. Under {{the terms of the}} Geneva Convention NCOs were, like officers, {{exempted}} from work during captivity, but Germans often forced them to work. Workers were fed but virtually their entire wages were paid directly to the German army and prisoners were only allowed to retain 70 pfennigs per day.|$|E
5|$|The Partisan {{attack on}} the camp and their liberation of a {{significant}} number of children brought the Ustaše to the realisation that this and similar <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> children could not be maintained. In late October 1942, 500 of the remaining children were dispersed to families in the surrounding villages by the Catholic aid group, Caritas. A total of 1,637 boys and girls were taken in by families in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages. Of the remaining children, 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška. The Jastrebarsko camp was then dismantled.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{organization}} in Central California and the group in Northern California continue to develop and present summer <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> youth by youth, led by a corps of volunteer adults.

Participation in the Monterey-based group has continued to increase each year, to 420 participants in 2015, including 33 youth from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, up from 70 in 2006. The group sponsored by the White Stag Association has attracted between 40 and 83 campers from 2010 to 2014. The two programs have operated continuously since the program's founding entirely on a voluntary basis, with an estimated 21,000 youth having attended its camps.|$|E

5|$|Local labour was {{supplied}} by an Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) detachment, initially consisting of eight Australian Army officers and eleven native police. A {{week after the}} landing, 199 native labourers were brought in from Lae. Initially, the ANGAU detachment {{found it difficult to}} lure the frightened local people in from the bush, but as the word spread that there was food and safety to be had within the American perimeter, large numbers began to walk in. ANGAU established a native settlement in the Biding River area. By 13 February, 680 native labourers were at work. They constructed <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> the Americans, carried supplies to units in the mountains and brought back the wounded, and worked in the hospital. ANGAU also carried out patrols, providing intelligence on the Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol Flyers {{basketball}} team have {{competed in the}} British Basketball League, the UK's premier professional basketball league, since 2014.

5|$|The {{camp was}} {{operated}} by 20–25 German and Austrian {{members of the}} SS-Totenkopfverbände and 80–120 Wachmänner ("watchmen") guards who had been trained at a special SS facility in the Trawniki concentration camp near Lublin, Poland; all Wachmänner guards were trained at Trawniki. The guards were mainly ethnic German Volksdeutsche from the east and Ukrainians, with some Russians, Tatars, Moldovans, Latvians, and Central Asians, {{all of whom had}} served in the Red Army. They were enlisted by Karl Streibel, the commander of the Trawniki camp, from the prisoner of war (POW) <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> Soviet soldiers. The degree to which their recruitment was voluntary remains disputed; while conditions in the Soviet POW camps were dreadful, some Soviet POWs collaborated with the Germans even before cold, hunger, and disease began devastating the POW camps in mid-September 1941.|$|E
50|$|Servigliano {{prison camp}} {{began as a}} POW <b>camp</b> <b>for</b> Austrian {{soldiers}} of World War I.

5|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} large mammals {{is found in}} the three National Parks, which are designated conservation areas. Akagera contains typical savanna animals such as giraffes and elephants, while Volcanoes is home to an estimated one-third of the worldwide mountain gorilla population. Nyungwe Forest boasts thirteen primate species including chimpanzees and Ruwenzori colobus arboreal monkeys; the Ruwenzori colobus move in groups of up to 400 individuals, the largest troop size of any primate in Africa. Rwanda's population of lions was destroyed {{in the aftermath of the}} genocide of 1994, as national parks were turned into <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> displaced people and remaining animals were poisoned by cattle herders. In June 2015, two South African parks donated seven lions to Akagera National Park, reestablishing a lion population in Rwanda. The lions were held initially in a fenced off area of the park, and then collared and released into the wild a month later.|$|E
5|$|With the {{censorship}} of Polish theater (and the virtual {{end of the}} Polish radio and film industry), underground theaters were created, primarily in Warsaw and Kraków, with shows presented in various underground venues. Beginning in 1940 the theaters were coordinated by the Secret Theatrical Council. Four large companies and more than 40smaller groups were active throughout the war, even in the Gestapo's Pawiak prison in Warsaw and in Auschwitz; underground acting schools were also created. Underground actors, many of whom officially worked mundane jobs, included Karol Adwentowicz, Elżbieta Barszczewska, Henryk Borowski, Wojciech Brydziński, Władysław Hańcza, Stefan Jaracz, Tadeusz Kantor, Mieczysław Kotlarczyk, Bohdan Korzeniowski, Jan Kreczmar, Adam Mularczyk, Andrzej Pronaszko, Leon Schiller, Arnold Szyfman, Stanisława Umińska, Edmund Wierciński, Maria Wiercińska, Karol Wojtyła (who later became Pope John Paul II), Marian Wyrzykowski, Jerzy Zawieyski and others. Theater was also active in the Jewish ghettos and in the <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> Polish war prisoners.|$|E
5|$|However, the Germans {{were now}} {{trapped in the}} {{interior}} of Gaul, as their return route to the Rhine was barred by the Roman armies. In Julian's sector, the Caesar despatched squadrons of cavalry to lie in ambush on three roads and these successfully intercepted and destroyed the returning barbarian bands. But in Barbatio's sector, the main body of Germans were allowed to pass unmolested: Barbatio's chief-of-staff Cella rejected the urgent plea of two of his cavalry tribuni (regimental commanders) Valentinianus (later emperor Valentinian I ruled 364-75) and Bainobaudes to deploy their squadrons on a highway that they expected the enemy would use. The escaping force reached some islands in the Rhine near Strasbourg where the raiding-bands had moved their <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> safety in response to the Roman pincer movement. Nevertheless, Julian pursued them vigorously. Although without boats, his men succeeded in reaching one island, as the river had become fordable at some points due to summer drought. An entire raiding-band was surprised and slaughtered, a success repeated on a few other islands. In response, the Germans evacuated the remaining islands, removing their sutlers, baggage and booty {{to the far side of}} the Rhine.|$|E
50|$|Camp Tel Noar (CTN) {{was founded}} by Eli and Bessie Cohen in 1945 as a Zionist <b>camp.</b> <b>For</b> many years, the camp was {{operated}} as the Tel Noar Lodge, a Zionist <b>camp</b> <b>for</b> teens and young adults.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the <b>Camp</b> <b>For</b> All Connection project is to {{facilitate}} access to electronic health information resources at the <b>Camp</b> <b>For</b> All facility. Setting/Participants/Resources: <b>Camp</b> <b>For</b> All is a barrier-free camp working in partnership with organizations to enrich {{the lives of children}} and adults with chronic illnesses and disabilities and their families by providing camping and retreat experiences. The camp facility is located on 206 acres in Burton, Texas. The project partners are Texas Woman 2 ̆ 7 s University, Houston Academy of Medicine-Texas Medical Center Library, and <b>Camp</b> <b>For</b> All. Brief Description: The <b>Camp</b> <b>For</b> All Connection project placed Internet-connected workstations at the camp 2 ̆ 7 s health center in the main lodge and provided training in the use of electronic health information resources. A train-the-trainer approach was used to provide training to <b>Camp</b> <b>For</b> All staff. Results/Outcome: Project workstations are being used by health care providers and <b>camp</b> staff <b>for</b> communication purposes and to make better informed health care decisions <b>for</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>For</b> All campers. Evaluation Method: A post-training evaluation was administered {{at the end of the}} train-the-trainer session. In addition, a series of site visits and interviews was conducted with camp staff members involved in the project. The site visits and interviews allowed for ongoing dialog between project staff and project participants...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, the Citizen Forces {{deteriorated}} {{during the}} war as the AIF was given precedence for manpower and other resources. While {{the size of the}} force increased during 1915, a high proportion volunteered for overseas service with the AIF. Many officers were used to train AIF recruits, and camp facilities and equipment were also assigned to the expeditionary force. This greatly disrupted the Citizen Forces training activities, with few units conducting camps during late 1915 or 1916. While there were intakes of conscripts to the Citizen Forces during 1916 and 1917, few were ever required to undertake periods of training or active service. In October 1916 approximately 37,000 reservists were called up {{for a short period of}} compulsory training ahead of the first plebiscite on conscription. By 1918 the Citizen Forces were close to collapse as many of its best members had transferred to the AIF and the remaining personnel were largely untrained. Attempts were made to revive the Citizen Forces during the last months of the war. The initially successful German Spring Offensive, which began in March, led to concerns Japan could attack Australia. In response, regular training <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> militia units were reinstated. A scheme to set up a reserve force manned by returned AIF veterans attracted 17,000 volunteers, yet they received no training.|$|E
5|$|When {{registration}} commenced on October 16, 1940, no {{structure was}} in place to handle thousands of anticipated conscientious objectors. Church representatives meeting with government officials learned that little thought had been put into the program, and the churches were advised to create a plan. Because the government wanted to deal with one body, not individual religious denominations, the National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors was formed as a liaison between the churches and the federal government. The historic peace churches outlined a plan that included running and maintaining CPS camps under church control. However, President Roosevelt opposed any plan not involving military control over the draftees. To save their plan and retain civilian direction of the program, the churches offered to fund the camps. Aides convinced Roosevelt that putting the COs to work in out-of-the-way camps was preferable to repeating the difficulties of World War I. Selective Service and the peace churches agreed to a six-month trial of church supported and funded <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> conscientious objectors and thus Civilian Public Service was born.|$|E
5|$|After the {{crossing}} was complete, the division was relieved from V Corps and assigned to Major General Wade H. Haislip's XV Corps. The division was allowed a one-month rest, resuming its advance on 25 November, attacking the forts north of Mutzig. These forts {{had been designed}} by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1893 to block access to the plain of Alsace. The 45th Division next crossed the Zintzel River before pushing through the Maginot Line defenses. During this time much of the division's artillery assets were attached to the 44th Infantry Division to provide additional support. The 45th Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Robert T. Frederick, who had previously commanded the 1st Special Service Force, was reassigned to VI Corps on New Year's Day. From 2 January 1945, the division fought defensively along the German border, withdrawing to the Moder River. It sent half of its artillery to support the 70th Infantry Division. On 17 February the division was pulled off the line for rest and training. Once this rest period was complete, the division was assigned to XV Corps for the final push into German territory. The 45th moved north to the Sarreguemines area and smashed through the Siegfried Line, on 17 March taking Homburg on the 21st and crossing the Rhine between Worms and Hamm on the 26th. The advance continued, with Aschaffenburg falling on 3 April, and Nuremberg on the 20th. The division crossed the Danube River on 27 April, and liberated 32,000 captives of the Dachau concentration camp on 29 April 1945. The division captured Munich {{during the next two}} days, occupying the city until V-E Day and the surrender of Germany. During the next month, the division remained in Munich and set up collection points and <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> the massive numbers of surrendering troops of the German armies. The number of POWs taken by the 45th Division during its almost two years of fighting totalled 124,840 men. The division was then slated to move to the Pacific theater of operations to participate in the invasion of mainland Japan on the island of Honshu, but these plans were scrubbed before the division could depart after the surrender of Japan, on V-J Day.|$|E
50|$|By April 1943 the Finns made up {{a quarter}} of the camp’s total population, the rest being made up of Germans and Italians.

5|$|In Bačka and Baranja, the Volksdeutsche and Hungarian {{authorities}} killed {{significant numbers}} of Serbs. After small-scale armed resistance broke out in Hungarian-occupied Bačka and Baranja {{in the second half}} of 1941, the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures. In September 1941 alone the Hungarian occupation forces summarily executed 313 people. Measures included the establishment of temporary concentration camps at Ada, Bačka Topola, Begeč, Odžaci, Bečej and Subotica, as well as at Novi Sad, Pechuj and Baja. According to Professor Paul Mojzes, some 2,000 Jews and a large number of Serbs were detained in these <b>camps</b> <b>for</b> periods from two weeks to two months, with Jews that had not been interned being employed as forced labourers. Several thousand people remained in camps until the end of the war. Some of the Jews that had migrated to Bačka and Baranja during the inter-war period were expelled to the NDH or the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were killed. The communist-led Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito was never strong in Bačka and Baranja because the flat terrain of the region did not lend itself to guerilla warfare, and because South Slavs, from which the Partisans drew their recruits, only made up one-third of the regional population. Some Partisan units raised in the occupied territories were sent to the NDH to reinforce Partisan formations operating there. Despite their initial resistance, the Chetnik movement was largely inactive during the occupation, maintaining some covert activity only. The Partisans and their regional committee had largely been destroyed by the end of 1941.|$|E
