50|$|Alisma plantago-aquatica, {{also known}} as European water-plantain, <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain</b> or mad-dog weed, is a {{perennial}} flowering plant widespread across most of Europe and Asia from Portugal and Morocco to Japan, Kamchatka and Vietnam. It is also regarded as native in northern and central Africa {{as far south as}} Tanzania. It is reportedly naturalized in southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State and Connecticut. Some sources maintain that the species is widespread across North America, but these reports appear to have been based on misidentified specimens. It is found on mud or in fresh waters.|$|E
40|$|DETERMINING RESISTANCE INDEX OF WEEDS ASSOCIATED TO RICE CULTIVATION (Oryza sativa L.) TO ALS INHIBITOR HERBICIDES AND THEIR MOLLECULAR CHARACTERISATION The general {{objective}} of this project was to prove and characterize on a scientific basis the existence of resistance to different SU herbicides and other ALS inhibitors (“crossed resistance”) in species of rice weeds, and also to generate background information on echo-physiological characteristics of those weed species. Research works conducted on variable flatsedge (Cyperus difformis), bog bulrush (Schoenoplectus mucronatus) and <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain</b> (Alisma plantago aquatica) {{have made it possible}} to conclude that only the latter has a dormancy condition and that in order to overcome this state, seeds must be kept in cold temperatures (4 º C, 30 days) and manually scarified. As for the germination response of variable flatsedge and bog bulrush seeds to light, these showed to be photosensitive; <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain</b> seeds, on the other hand, are capable of germinating with no light stimulus. It was also concluded that <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain</b> has a germination temperature range that is broader than that of variable flatsedge and bog bulrush seeds, for which the germination maximum is achieved when seeds of each species are exposed to a specific optimum temperature. Within the rice weed species studied, the biggest resistance problems were observed in relation to the herbicide bensulfuron-methyl, for which the resistance indexes determined were higher in the <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain,</b> followed by variable flatsedge and then bog bulrush. For a second herbicide with a lower resistance degree –metsulfuron-methyl-, some resistant ecotypes of <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain</b> were identified, but no resistant ecotypes were identified for the other species studied. No resistance levels were determined for the herbicide “penoxulam”, which is currently a promising and effective solution for Chilean rice producers. According to samples of soils and seeds from rice fields (7 th and 8 th Regions) collected during the 3 seasons, it was possible to determine that density values were the maximum for the variable flatsedge, with an average over 4 million pl ha - 1, and only 1 to 2 million for the other species: <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain,</b> bog bulrush and cockspur grass. With regard to the frequency of appearance in tested fields, the variable flatsedge also had the highest value (60 %) among all identified species. It is possible to conclude that variable flatsedge is the weed species with prevailing economic importance in the tested rice soils, followed by <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain,</b> bog bulrush and cockspur grass (Echinochloa cruz-galli). Out of all the species that were identified, the bog bulrush presented the highest rate (> 90 %) of individuals resistant to the bensulfuron-methyl and metsulfuron-methyl herbicides. This resistance is caused by an alteration in the enzyme’s active site which makes a high proportion of the studied ecotypes insensitive to the bensufurol-methyl herbicide. Although sequencing of the resistance gen was not possible within the project, it is believed to be a promising work line to be continued. Based on molecular markers for genetic diversity and distance used in the studied <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain</b> populations, it is possible to differentiate 2 major genetically different groups; one of which is subdivided in 2 more groups. This genetic grouping is highly geographically correlated according to the latitude. It is probably originated due to geographical barriers, or due to the distribution of rice irrigation waters, which is the main source of seed movement in <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain</b> populations. A new herbicide used in rice weeds management was penoxulam applied in post-emergency (once the water sheet is lower). The data obtained show an effective control in <b>common</b> <b>water-plantain</b> and cockspur grass, opposite to the effect on bog bulrush where the herbicide only reduces the height of plants, rendering an ineffective control. The appearance of this new product has provided rice farmers with a useful and secure tool. Ecotypes with cross resistance to this herbicide would probably develop if it is repeatedly used during consecutive years (> 3). With that in mind, recommendations are being given together with its commercialization, for only 1 application per season combined with rotation of herbicides with different action mechanisms (MCPA, bentazon). Within the framework of the project, it has been possible to conduct 7 pre and graduate thesis, 4 presentations in national congresses and 1 presentation in an international congress. Results obtained should translate into at least 2 indexed publications (ISI). Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of ducks number on weeds diversity and density in paddy fields, an experiment was conducted at Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resource University during growing season of 2011 - 2012. Experiment was arranged in split plot based on complete randomized block design with four replications. Main factors were duck number at three levels (consisting of control, 400 and 800 ducks. ha- 1) and sub plots were three contrast cultivars (including Tarom as a traditional, and Shirodi and Ghaem as improved cultivars). Results of ANOVA showed highly significant differences between ducks, cultivars and ducks × cultivar interaction in terms of weeds density including nutsedge (Cyperus spp. L.), <b>common</b> <b>Water-plantain</b> (Alisma plantago-aquatica L.), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli L.), duckweed (Lemna minor L.), azolla (Azolla pinata R. Br.) and paddy yield. Accordingly, the lowest weed density and diversity were recorded at 800 and 400 ducks. ha- 1, respectively. Among rice cultivars Tarom and Ghaem had the minimum and the maximum weeds density and diversity. The highest nutsedge density (67 plant. m- 2) was related to Ghaem cultivar in control (without duck) plots as much as 97 % higher than 800 ducks. ha- 1. Maximum paddy yield was observed in 800 ducks. ha- 1 in Shirodi (5. 3 t. ha- 1), Ghaem (4. 3 t. ha- 1) and Tarom (3. 6 t. ha- 1) as much as 23, 7 and 20 % higher than those cultivars in 400 ducks. ha- 1, respectively. Finally, in the current research conditions using 800 ducks. ha- 1 and Tarom cultivar resulted the best performance because of the lowest weed diversity and density as compared to other treatments...|$|E
