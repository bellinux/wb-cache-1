Based on <b>cultivated</b> <b>areas</b> <b>irrigated</b> barley in all counties of Ardabil province during six years (2000 - 2005), 46 sample barley fields were selected and weed species were counted in each sampling point and population indices were calculated with Thomas method. By using specific furmula the density, frequency and uniformity of each weed species in fields were calculated. In each field longitude, latitude and altitude were recorded by using GPS. These data were used for producing weed maps using GIS. Results showed that Galium tricurnatum, Fumaria vaillantiand Raphanus raphanistrum were dominante broadleaf species in irrigated barley fields of Ardabil province. The dominant grassy weed species in these fields were Avena fatua and Secale cereal.

The outcome variables are <b>cultivated</b> <b>area,</b> sown <b>area</b> and effectively <b>irrigated</b> <b>area,</b> and ordinary least squares regression and fixed effects models are used for the analysis. Findings - In spite of sustained investments into irrigation from 1998 to 2011, there has been almost no impact on agricultural land. <b>Cultivated</b> <b>area</b> and sown area have fallen across all five sample provinces while effectively <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> remains largely unchanged.

In the last twenty years, the reduction in water-availability and the increasing costs of system-management have highly limited the <b>cultivated</b> <b>areas</b> which are <b>irrigated</b> by means of water-distribution nets. In the recent years, most of the Italian investments in the irrigation-field have been oriented toward upgrading the open-channels irrigation nets, which were built starting from 50 &rsquo;, by substituting these latter with pipes.

Such a type of knowledge may be used to improve as well as buildup mathematical models for a decisions-support toward the management of complex irrigation districts.

The growth in <b>area</b> <b>irrigated</b> through both public and private investment in the past three decades is impressive. The <b>area</b> <b>irrigated</b> in India increased from 23 million ha in 1950 / 51 to 60 million ha in 1984 / 85. Of this <b>irrigated</b> <b>area,</b> 25 million ha was in major surface systems, 9 million ha in minor surface systems, and 26 million ha in groundwater systems. The most rapid growth was in groundwater development: the area under groundwater increased fourfold after 1950 / 51, while the area under major and minor irrigation doubled.
