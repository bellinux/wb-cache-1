40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} curing conditions {{on the performance of}} steel/CFRP double strap joints subjected to combined loading, cyclic temperature and humidity. A series of joints, <b>cured</b> respectively <b>at</b> an elevated temperature (120 degrees C) and room temperature (about 23 degrees C) were exposed to different combined environmental and loading conditions. It was found that <b>curing</b> <b>at</b> an elevated temperature had no effects on the joint ultimate strength tested at room temperature. However, at 50 degrees C, the joints <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> 120 degrees C showed almost no strength reduction, in comparison to those <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> room temperature with a 50 % strength reduction. <b>Curing</b> <b>at</b> elevated temperature also helped to improve the time-to-failure of joints: joints <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> room temperature failed within less than 2 h when exposed to the environmental conditions, while joints <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> 120 degrees C could survive up to 270 h, dependent on the applied load levels. Partial safety factors proposed in design guidelines for FRP composites under environmental effects were used to evaluate the experimental results obtained, suggesting a very critical degradation of joint mechanical properties due to the environmental effects investigated in this study...|$|R

These characteristics of cement pastes were studied using non-evaporable water content measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD), compressive strength test, electrical resistivity and porosity measurements, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was shown that temperature enhanced the early hydration. The cement pastes <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> elevated temperatures generally showed an increase in compressive strength {{at an early age}} compared to the cement paste <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> room temperature, but the strength gain decreased at later ages. The electrical resistivity of the cement pastes <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> elevated temperatures was found to decrease more noticeably at late ages compared to that of the room temperature cured cement paste. SEM examination indicated that hydration product was more uniformly distributed in the microstructure of the cement paste <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> room temperature compared to the cement pastes <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> elevated temperatures. It was observed that high temperature curing decreased the compressive strength and electrical resistivity of the cement pastes at late ages in a more pronounced manner when higher levels of TiO 2 nanoparticles were added...|$|R

The mechanical strength of the pastes was likewise determined at different ages, while mercury intrusion porosimetry was used to establish porosity and pore size distribution. The results confirmed that <b>curing</b> cement <b>at</b> higher temperatures tended to increase the early age hydration rate significantly and decrease longterm compressive strength. The decline in 28 -day compressive strength in pastes <b>cured</b> <b>at</b> high temperatures was attributed to their higher porosity and less uniform microstructure.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{relationship}} between the compressive strength and microscopic structure of geopolymer mortar using 100 % of fly ash instead of cement. The experimental variable is the curing temperature, which may influence the compressive strength of the geopolymer.

As a result, the concrete performing water <b>curing</b> <b>at</b> 5 °C after subjected to initial frost damage improve the long-term strength and the freezing-thawing durability. The concrete implementing water <b>curing</b> <b>at</b> 30 °C enhance the long-term strength and the resistance to freezing-thawing action as well as the early strength.
