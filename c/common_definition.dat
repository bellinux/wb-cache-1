25|$|A {{defining}} {{feature of}} the venues Rabinow has called for and worked on is collaboration. Understood {{as a mode of}} work, Rabinow defines collaboration in distinction to cooperation. A cooperative mode of work consists in “demarcated tasking on distinct problems and objects, with occasional if regular exchange.” Cooperation does not entail either a <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of problems or shared techniques of remediation. A collaborative mode of work, by contrast, proceeds from an interdependent division of labor on shared problems. It entails a <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of problems (or acceptance of a problem-space).|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of the onset of puberty may depend on perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late pubescent individuals, etc.). A <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> for the onset of puberty is physical changes to a person's body. These physical changes are the first visible signs of neural, hormonal, and gonadal function changes.|$|E

Shan shui painting is more like a vehicle of philosophy.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{a closed}} primary, in which votes can be cast in a party primary only by people {{registered}} with that party, in that state. Undeclared voters—those not registered with any party—can vote in either party primary. However, it does not meet a <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of an open primary, because people registered as Republican or Democratic on voting day cannot cast ballots in the primary of the other party.|$|E
25|$|One <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of {{the term}} focuses on three concepts: the fascist negations (anti-liberalism, anti-communism and anti-conservatism); {{nationalist}} authoritarian goals of creating a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture; and a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence and promotion of masculinity, youth and charismatic leadership. According to many scholars, fascism—especially once in power—has historically attacked communism, conservatism and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of adaptation, a central concept in evolution, is a trait that was {{functional}} to the reproductive {{success of the}} organism and that is thus now present due to being selected for; that is, function and evolution are inseparable. However a trait can have a current function that is adaptive without being an adaptation in this sense, if for instance the environment has changed. Imagine {{an environment in which}} having a small body suddenly conferred benefit on an organism when previously body size had had no effect on survival.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1980s, an open {{operating}} system standardization effort now known as POSIX provided a common baseline for all operating systems; IEEE based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification (SUS) administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group, to provide a <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} other {{definitions}} were proposed by other scientists {{in the years following}} Gauthier's paper. The first such new definition, which attempted to adhere to the standards of the PhyloCode, was published by Modesto and Anderson in 2004. Modesto and Anderson reviewed the many previous definitions and proposed a modified definition, which they intended to retain most traditional content of the group while keeping it stable and monophyletic. They defined Reptilia as all amniotes closer to Lacerta agilis and Crocodylus niloticus than to Homo sapiens. This stem-based definition is equivalent to the more <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of Sauropsida, which Modesto and Anderson synonymized with Reptilia, since the latter is better known and more frequently used. Unlike most previous definitions of Reptilia, however, Modesto and Anderson's definition includes birds, as they are within the clade that includes both lizards and crocodiles.|$|E

25|$|War is a {{state of}} {{organized}} armed conflict between states or non-state actors. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others—whether between combatants or upon non-combatants—to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, riots, revolts, and melees, are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be nonviolent or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people {{died as a result of}} war. A <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> defines war as a series of military campaigns between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over sovereignty, territory, resources, religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a civil war. Among animals, all-out war against fellow members of the same species occurs only among large societies of humans and ants.|$|E
25|$|Refractory metals are a {{class of}} metals that are {{extraordinarily}} resistant to heat and wear. The expression is mostly used {{in the context of}} materials science, metallurgy and engineering. The definition of which elements belong to this group differs. The most <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> includes five elements: two of the fifth period (niobium and molybdenum) and three of the sixth period (tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium). They all share some properties, including a melting point above 2000°C and high hardness at room temperature. They are chemically inert and have a relatively high density. Their high melting points make powder metallurgy the method of choice for fabricating components from these metals. Some of their applications include tools to work metals at high temperatures, wire filaments, casting molds, and chemical reaction vessels in corrosive environments. Partly due to the high melting point, refractory metals are stable against creep deformation to very high temperatures.|$|E

500|$|According to {{literary}} historian Alexandru Dobrescu, Caion is the prototype [...] "detractor" [...] in Romanian culture, [...] "born of frustration", the Zoilus to Caragiale's Homer. Dobrescu writes: [...] "In the <b>common</b> <b>definition,</b> the detractor is someone consciously working to debase (or destroy) one's good standing. The cobbler envious of his neighbor, the cordwainer, {{who will go}} lengths to besmirch the latter in hopes of 'helping' him lose his clientele, is a detractor." [...] His verdict about Caion's unicity in a Romanian context is placed in doubt by another author, Constantin Coroiu, who finds it unrealistic.|$|E
500|$|It is {{currently}} a widely held view that Gettysburg was a decisive victory for the Union, but the term is considered imprecise. It is inarguable that Lee's offensive on July 3 was turned back decisively and his campaign in Pennsylvania was terminated prematurely (although the Confederates at the time argued {{that this was a}} temporary setback and that the goals of the campaign were largely met). However, when the more <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of [...] "decisive victory" [...] is intended—an indisputable military victory of a battle that determines or significantly influences the ultimate result of a conflict—historians are divided. For example, David J. Eicher called Gettysburg a [...] "strategic loss for the Confederacy" [...] and James M. McPherson wrote that [...] "Lee and his men would go on to earn further laurels. But they never again possessed the power and reputation they carried into Pennsylvania those palmy summer days of 1863." ...|$|E
500|$|Self-harm (SH), also {{referred}} to as self-injury (SI), self-inflicted violence (SIV), nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) or self-injurious behaviour (SIB), refers to a spectrum of behaviours where demonstrable injury is self-inflicted. The behaviour involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent. [...] The most common form of self-harm involves cutting of the skin using a sharp object, e. g. a knife or razor blade. The term self-mutilation is also sometimes used, although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome, inaccurate, or offensive. Self-inflicted wounds is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non-lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat. This differs from the <b>common</b> <b>definition</b> of self-harm, as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose. A broader definition of self-harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of disordered eating.|$|E
