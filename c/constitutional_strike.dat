40|$|The Supreme Court affirmed, in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, {{that the}} Constitution permits us to {{experiment}} with school-choice programs and, in particular, with programs that include religious schools. However, the constitutions of nearly forty States contain provisions - generically called Blaine Amendments - that speak more directly and, in many cases, more restrictively, than does the First Amendment to the flow of once-public funds to religious schools. This Article {{is a series of}} reflections, prompted by the Blaine Amendments, on education, citizenship, political liberalism, and religious freedom. First, the Article considers {{what might be called the}} federalism defense of the provisions. It concludes that even full-throated support for the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s so-called federalism revival does not require one to regard the Blaine Amendments as courageous efforts by particular communities to provide greater protection to religious freedom, by insisting on a sharper, and more rigid, separation of church and state. In fact, these provisions might better be seen as representing the failures of particular communities fully to appreciate the nature and implications of religious freedom and liberal pluralism. Second, the Article sounds a cautionary note concerning the fact that the Blaine Amendments were in large part the product of widespread concern about the political and cultural effects of Roman Catholicism. While it is true that the Blaine Amendments - like much else in the American experience - were anti-Catholic, they are best understood as reflecting more than mere bigotry. Rather, the Blaine Amendments can usefully be situated in the context of the rich and growing scholarly literature on civic education, and on the challenges posed by religious faith, teachings, and communities to certain conceptions of political liberalism. Although we are at present confronting the Blaine Amendments primarily as constraints imposed by positive law on local policy choices about school funding, these provisions take us to the heart of perennial questions about statecraft, and soulcraft. They represent, among other things, the enactment into law of certain claims about the aims of education, the prerogatives of the liberal state, the proper scope of religious obligation, and even the nature and end of the human person. Finally, the Article proposes that Blaine Amendments might most profitably be engaged not simply as rules of positive law, but as theological arguments. The point of this observation is not to assert that the Blaine Amendments 2 ̆ 7 religious meaning is a <b>constitutional</b> <b>strike</b> against them, but rather to enrich our conversations about them. After all, if the Blaine Amendments are not merely legal constraints on state legislatures 2 ̆ 7 funding options, but also claims about the content and proper sphere of religious beliefs, obligations, and loyalties, then it would seem perfectly appropriate to raise constructive, yet unapologetic and unbracketed, religious counter-claims about these matters in response...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{limitations on the}} <b>constitutional</b> right to <b>strike</b> that apply to public employees in France. While recognizing the right to strike for all salaried workers, whether employed in the private or public sector, the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution, incorporated by reference into the present Constitution, allows for limitations being imposed on that right by statute. Indeed, specific legislation has either prohibited or limited the right to strike for various classes of public employees. This has been held constitutionally valid insofar as the statutory bar or restriction is required to prevent essential functions of the State from being interrupted or {{to ensure that the}} vital needs of the country are being provided for. Even where no specific restrictive legislation applies, strikes by the staff of « public services » — including not only central and local government employees, but also employees of major nationalized industries, institutions such as hospitals, and even private undertakings providing some public utility or service — are subject, under the Labour Code, to a number of restrictions. In particular, five days' notice of the strike must be given by a representative union. And certains forms of striking, such as rotating strikes, are prohibited. In addition, the employer authority may, under the doctrine of « essential services », make administrative regulations identifying which units or staff positions are considered essential.

5000|$|On 30 January 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada {{ruled that}} there is a <b>constitutional</b> right to <b>strike.</b> In this 5-2 {{majority}} decision, Justice Rosalie Abella ruled that [...] "along with their right to associate, speak through a bargaining representative of their choice, and bargain collectively with their employer through that representative, the right of employees to strike is vital to protecting the meaningful process of collective bargaining..."

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} steps in the {{denouement}} of the Supreme Court of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s 1987 Labour Trilogy, which denied constitutional protection to collective bargaining and strikes. The first blow to those decisions came in Dunmore, where the Court adopted a collective rather than individual definition of the Charter freedom of association, while another was dealt by B. C Health, where the Court extended s. 2 (d) protection to collective bargaining. The Supreme Court might still avoid finding a <b>constitutional</b> right to <b>strike,</b> but, in the author 2 ̆ 7 s view the Court has probably gone too far to turn back.

Health, in this respect, she points to an important difference between collective bargaining and strikes: the former is a positive obligation which imposes on governments a corresponding duty, whereas the latter is a negative entitlement to be free from government interference. While there is a risk that the constitutionalization of strike activity may involve the courts in reviewing labour policy, the solution is not to dilute the content of s. 2 (d), but to create a 2 ̆ 2 customized 2 ̆ 2 s. 1 test for justifying infringements of the guarantee in the labour context - one which would explicitly defer to policy decisions by the legislature...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I address the {{question}} of sympathetic action - action by one group of workers designed to aid another group of workers in their struggle with an employer, manifested most obviously through refusals by workers to cross a picket line - through the lens of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 	As the law currently stands in Canada, undertaking sympathetic action collectively is invariably illegal as it is considered an illegal "strike" under Canadian labour legislation. Further, workers who undertake sympathetic action - whether collectively or individually - can be subject to discipline or discharge by their employer. I argue that workers who undertake sympathetic action can have numerous motivations, ranging from economic self-interest to deeply-held political or moral beliefs (the latter manifested through the concept of "solidarity"), and that when those motivations include expressive or conscientious interests, sympathetic action should be entitled to protection by the fundamental freedoms of conscience, expression, and association found in section 2 of the Charter. I further argue that a each of these freedoms represents a different aspect of the inherent dignity and worth of an individual, and that a right to sympathetic action promotes both those freedoms and Charter values. Finally, I argue that a constitutional right to sympathetic action is a free-standing right that can exist {{even in the absence of}} a <b>constitutional</b> right to <b>strike.</b> This thesis reviews the current and historical state of Canadian law (in both the statutory labour relations regimes and in common law) regarding sympathetic action, the potential application of the Charter freedoms of conscience, expression, and association to sympathetic action, and finally options for reform that reduce or eliminate restrictions on sympathetic action and therefore make our labour relations system more in keeping with Charter values...|$|R
40|$|This {{treatise}} {{discusses the}} increasing of the procedural and substantive {{limitations on the}} employees’ right to strike. The Constitution permits the right to strike to be limited {{in terms of the}} laws of general application. The Labour Relations Act (LRA) is a good example. Such limitation must be reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society, based on human dignity, equality and freedom. The study sought to investigate whether further increasing the existing limitations on the right to strike unduly breaches employees’ <b>Constitutional</b> right to <b>strike</b> and the purpose of the LRA. Further, the study sought to find out whether the additional content requirements in the strike notice amount to importing into the LRA additional limitations on the fundamental right to strike that enjoys no textual support. Through an extensive literature review, the findings arguably show that indeed further increasing the limitations on the employees’ right to strike may unduly infringe their right to strike. Moreover, the increase of the content requirements in a strike notice creates an unnecessary hurdle to employees wishing to strike. One of the most important finding made is that instead further increasing the limitations on the right to strike, going back to the basics of negotiation to alleviate strikes, particularly wage-related strikes is vital. To achieve this, it is important for employers to re-establish social and individual relationships with their employees, whereby they become aware of the issues that employees face on a daily basis. Also, establishing proper workplace dialogue and forums would assist employers in becoming aware of employees concerns. This would thereby prevent strikes, as problems can be dealt with beforehand.

Ever since the rise of the Internet it has attracted utopian ideas of a free and borderless cyberspace, a men-made global commons that serves an international community of users. First commercialization and now the prevalence of state surveillance have significantly depreciated the utopist patina. Internet’s borderless nature which was once heralded to rise above the nation state has actually enabled some states to rise above their borders when engaging in mass surveillance that affects users on a global scale. International human rights law and emerging Internet governance principles have not been authoritative enough to protect users’ privacy and the confidentiality of communications.

It is true that the individual is a suspect in the police investigation of the murder, and that the government is investigating the business or charity for possible financial links to terrorists. However, the suspicion is wrong, or at least unprovable. As far as can be determined from the available evidence, the individual did not commit a murder, and the business or charity did not provide funds to terrorists. If the party identified as a suspect or investigation target brings a defamation action, the defendant will assert that the report it made to the public was true and truth is a complete defense to a defamation claim. The plaintiff, however, will assert that the report damaged the plaintiff’s reputation by causing the public to suspect the plaintiff of criminal or improper acts and the suspicion was false, so the defense of truth should not succeed. Which version of “truth” will prevail in these circumstances? What must be true for the defendant to avoid liability? This is the question that this article examines and attempts to answer.

40|$|Abstract Background Ayurveda is {{an ancient}} system of {{personalized}} medicine documented and practiced in India since 1500 B. C. According to this system an individual's basic constitution {{to a large extent}} determines predisposition and prognosis to diseases as well as therapy and life-style regime. Ayurveda describes seven broad constitution types (Prakriti s) each with a varying degree of predisposition to different diseases. Amongst these, three most contrasting types, Vata, Pitta, Kapha, are the most vulnerable to diseases. In the realm of modern predictive medicine, efforts are being directed towards capturing disease phenotypes with greater precision for successful identification of markers for prospective disease conditions. In this study, we explore whether the different constitution types as described in Ayurveda has molecular correlates. Methods Normal individuals of the three most contrasting constitutional types were identified following phenotyping criteria described in Ayurveda in Indian population of Indo-European origin. The peripheral blood samples of these individuals were analysed for genome wide expression levels, biochemical and hematological parameters. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway based analysis was carried out on differentially expressed genes to explore if there were significant enrichments of functional categories among Prakriti types. Results Individuals from the three most contrasting <b>constitutional</b> types exhibit <b>striking</b> differences with respect to biochemical and hematological parameters and at genome wide expression levels. Biochemical profiles like liver function tests, lipid profiles, and hematological parameters like haemoglobin exhibited differences between Prakriti types. Functional categories of genes showing differential expression among Prakriti types were significantly enriched in core biological processes like transport, regulation of cyclin dependent protein kinase activity, immune response and regulation of blood coagulation. A significant enrichment of housekeeping, disease related and hub genes were observed in these extreme constitution types. Conclusion Ayurveda based method of phenotypic classification of extreme constitutional types allows us to uncover genes that may contribute to system level differences in normal individuals which could lead to differential disease predisposition. This is a first attempt towards unraveling the clinical phenotyping principle of a traditional system of medicine in terms of modern biology. An integration of Ayurveda with genomics holds potential and promise for future predictive medicine. </p...|$|R
40|$|Section 213 of the Labour Relations Act defines ’strike’ as {{the partial}} or {{complete}} concerted refusal to work, or the retardation or obstruction of work, by {{persons who are}} or have been employed by the same employer or by different employers, {{for the purpose of}} remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of any matter of mutual interest between the employer and employee, and any reference to “work” this definition includes overtime work, whether it is voluntary or compulsory. According to Mcllroy: “As long as our society is divided between those who own and control the means of production and those who only have the ability to work, strikes will be inevitable because they are the ultimate means workers have of protecting themselves. ” 1 The Constitutional Court justified the exclusion of a constitutional right to lock out and the inclusion of a <b>constitutional</b> right to <b>strike</b> by indicating that the right to strike is not equivalent to a right to lock out and is essential for workplace democracy. 2 The right to strike is essential to bolster collective bargaining and thereby to give employees the power to bargain effectively with employers.

To combat this and have a say in the workplace, the Constitutional Court held that “employees need to act in concert to provide them collectively with sufficient power to bargain effectively with employers and exercise collective power primarily through the mechanism of strike action”.

40|$|In {{the modern}} tort reform {{movement}} that {{dates to the}} mid- 1970 s, courts have struck down a number of reform statutes as unconstitutional under state constitutions. Commentators on all sides have treated these decisions as a new phenomenon in American law. In fact, American tort law has developed {{for over a century}} in the shadow of state (and occasionally federal) constitutional law. Beginning in the late nineteenth-century, state tort reform legislation came under sustained constitutional critique. The legislation at issue included employers 2 ̆ 7 liability laws that expanded liability for work accidents; spark fire statutes that made railroads liable for fires caused by engine sparks; stock statutes that made railroads liable for cattle killed on the tracks; wrongful death statutes that capped the damages available in death cases; and workmen 2 ̆ 7 s compensation statutes. Late nineteenth and early twentieth-century state courts developed a small number of outer bounds on the legislative power to alter the rules of tort law. In many relatively uncontroversial cases, courts enforced specific and express <b>constitutional</b> rules to <b>strike</b> down statutes such as those that capped wrongful death damages despite a constitutional provision barring such caps. In another well-established line of cases, courts limited legislatures 2 ̆ 7 authority to allocate accident costs to parties with no causal connection to the accident in question. Such legislative allocations of accident costs without causation amounted to an illegitimate legislative taking. But on those occasions in which courts reached outside these limited rationales to strike down legislative changes in the common law of torts, courts caused political uproar and helped to bring on themselves the great Progressive Era court crisis. In particular, constitutional interventions to block the enactment of workmen 2 ̆ 7 s compensation statutes {{at the opening of the}} twentieth-century produced political attacks on the legitimacy of judicial review that nearly stripped state courts of their power to review the constitutionality of legislation. The long history of the American constitutional law of torts is a cautionary tale for all involved. Supporters of modern tort reform efforts have little occasion for seeing unprecedented threats to basic constitutional principles like separation of powers and popular sovereignty. But those who would use state constitutional litigation to ward off legislated tort reform should be wary, too. Under the guise of judicial review, state courts have all too often used state constitutional provisions to interfere with experiments in public policy that over time have come to be widely respected...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of housing rights {{jurisprudence}} on Chinese legal and policy frameworks in the housing sector, examines the key related issues, and assesses whether current practices {{are in line with}} international best practice. The thesis considers three major questions, viz. 1 What are housing rights? 2 What is the significance of housing rights in the Chinese context? 3 Given the features and nature of housing rights, and China’s transitional societal background, how could housing rights be implemented? By looking at the jurisprudence and jurisprudential development of housing rights in international law and related humanitarian jurisprudence, this thesis proposes a three-layer framework of housing rights, which encompasses property and resource dimensions. While the property dimension requires the state to refrain from interfering in property interest in housing, the resource dimension establishes a set of principles for directing governmental duties in utilizing and redistributing resources. The governments should enable equal and equitable access to housing and housing-related resources, and ensure housing development is a human-centered, sustainability-oriented process. China is a transitional society, where the Constitution shows a trend towards strengthening property rights protection, but institutional constraints on property rights remain. There are also transformative schemes in the housing sector that take the form of land reform and public housing programs. An overview of the housing regime in China identifies three primary limitations: an incoherent legal framework of Chinese takings law related to the property dimension of housing rights; problems with equal and equitable access to land resource as reflected by the urban-rural divide in the land tenure system; and the lack of a sustainability vision in public housing development. It is, therefore, argued that implementing housing rights involves enshrining values and principles related to housing rights in the domestic constitution. This can take the form of reinterpreting the Chinese constitutional property according to the three-layer framework of housing rights. Such a reinterpretation sheds further light on how to resolve the key issues in the current housing regime. This study concludes that housing rights require Chinese <b>constitutional</b> property to <b>strike</b> a balance between protecting existing property-holdings and the transformative schemes in the housing sector. For the property dimension of Chinese constitutional property, housing rights help to construct a coherent jurisprudence for Chinese takings law. The resource dimension of housing rights serves as an assessment tool for the policy framework to guide both the utilization and redistribution of land resources and the development of public housing programs. This facilitates the legal and policy framework in the housing sector to be informed by humanitarian jurisprudence and be in line with international best practice. The pioneering nature of this thesis lies in its exploration of humanitarian jurisprudence which is new to Chinese constitutional reasoning, and the extension of jurisprudential discussion of housing rights to public policy formulation. It is also innovative in proposing the three-layer framework of housing rights. Some of the findings from the discussion of international jurisprudence may be extended not only to the Chinese setting but also to other transitional economies which face similar housing issues and concerns in their policy-making. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
