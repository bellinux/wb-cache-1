50|$|The European (Berne) {{loading gauge}} is usually 3150 mm wide by 3,175 mm rising to 4280 mm in the centre. This is a <b>clearance</b> <b>envelope</b> (see loading gauge) on a curve of 250 m radius.|$|E
50|$|When {{both the}} trip arm and trip valve were new, {{this did not}} matter; the train did not fill its entire <b>clearance</b> <b>envelope,</b> and the trip arm would contact the trip valve normally. However, with normal wear of the wheels and rails, and with the train {{rounding}} a curve at speed (and therefore riding off-centre) it was another matter. The first wheel {{on the right-hand side}} of the train hit a bolt in the mechanism attached to the trip arm and knocked the arm down. It would then rise again, but too late: with the train moving quickly, the trip valve, just a few feet behind the wheel, would already have gone past, thus making the train stop useless for ensuring signal compliance.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{report concluded}} that the Afro 4000's structure gauge does not fit in the South African infrastructure <b>clearance</b> <b>envelope.</b> While the PRASA rolling stock, the Class 7E and 7E2 locomotives which were used during the tests, also do not comply with the structure gauge clearance under the bridge, there was no direct contact of the carbody with the overhead contact wire since the pantographs are insulated from the roof. The Afro 4000, however, has a minimum calculated roof clearance of only 10 mm, which poses an operational electrical risk. Since it does not fit the designed earth clearances at bridges and tunnels and {{the height of the}} locomotive encroaches too close to the contact wire, the risk to the driver and the locomotive is high. One of the recommendations was that delivery of the Afro 4000 should be delayed, pending a suggested design review.|$|E
40|$|A {{system of}} access {{platforms}} and equipment within {{the space shuttle}} orbiter processing facility at Kennedy Space Center is described.

40|$|Voltage {{uprating}} is {{a reliable}} method {{for increasing the}} power transfer capability of an existing overhead line. It is essential to meet the primary air clearance requirements for power frequency, switching and lightning overvoltages while evaluating the suitability to uprate the line to a higher voltage level. In this paper, a method is discussed to establish the necessary <b>clearance</b> <b>envelopes</b> for power frequency, switching and lightning overvoltages. The results are based on {{an investigation into the}} clearance requirements for IEC- 60071. A case study based on uprating a 275 kV overhead line with L 3 towers design to 400 kV is presented. Finally, issues and opportunities associated with uprating the L 3 tower to 400 kV are explored...|$|R
40|$|Initial <b>envelope</b> <b>clearance</b> and {{subsequent}} flight testing of a new, fully augmented airplane with an extremely {{high degree of}} static instability can place unusual demands on the flight test approach. Previous flight test experience {{with these kinds of}} airplanes is very limited or nonexistent. The safe and efficient flight testing may be further complicated by a multiplicity of control effectors that may be present on this class of airplanes. This paper describes some novel flight test and analysis techniques in the flight dynamics and handling qualities area. These techniques were utilized during the initial flight <b>envelope</b> <b>clearance</b> of the X- 29 A aircraft and were largely responsible for the completion of the flight controls clearance program without any incidents or significant delays...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{automated}} detectors, it was the responsibility of on-board train crew and track-side workers to visually inspect trains for defects, and then to bring the train to a halt, if a defect were observed. To detect [...] "hotboxes," [...] i.e., overheating bearings, they would look for oil smoke during the day or a red glow at night. As early as the 1940s, automatic defect detectors were installed to improve upon the manual process. Hotboxes could be detected using new infrared light sensors; high and wide loads by wires outlining the <b>clearance</b> <b>envelope,</b> and dragging equipment through [...] "brittle bars" [...] - frangible bars mounted between the rails. The detectors would transmit their data via wired links to remote read-outs in stations, offices or interlocking towers. A stylus-and-cylinder gauge would record a reading for every axle; if a journal were too hot, or if some other defect were detected, the offending axle would register a sharp spike on the graph. An alarm would sound as well, and the employee on duty at that locality would either use manual signals or the signaling system to bring the train to a halt and, if possible, to inform {{the crew of the}} approximate location of the problem.|$|E

It is shown that the open-loop frequency response of an aircraft with highly relaxed static stability can be successfully computed on the ground from telemetry data.

40|$|Flight flutter {{testing is}} an {{integral}} part of flight <b>envelope</b> <b>clearance.</b> This paper discusses advancements in several areas that are being investigated to improve efficiency and safety of flight test programs. Results are presented from recent flight testing of the F/A- 18 Systems Research Aircraft. A wingtip excitation system was used to generate aeroelastic response data. This system worked well for many flight conditions but still displayed some anomalies. Wavelet processing is used to analyze the flight data. Filtered transfer functions are generated that greatly improve system identification. A flutter margin is formulated that accounts for errors between a model and flight data. Worst-case flutter margins are computed to demonstrate the flutter boundary may lie closer to the flight envelope than previously estimated. This paper concludes with developments for a distributed flight analysis environment and on-line health monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} quarter century, the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) and the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) have played major roles in the development, demonstration, and {{validation}} of aeroservoelastic modeling, analysis, design, and testing methods. Many of their contributions resulted from their participation in wind-tunnel and flight-test programs aimed at demonstrating advanced active control concepts that interact with and/or exploit the aeroelastic characteristics of flexible structures. Other contributions {{are a result of}} their interest in identifying and solving adverse aeroservoelastic interactions that allow unique flight-test demonstrations or flight <b>envelope</b> <b>clearance</b> programs to be successfully completed. This paper provides an overview of some of the more interesting aeroservoelastic investigations conducted in the transonic dynamics tunnel (TDT) at LaRC and in flight at DFRC. Four flight-test projects are reviewed in this paper. These test projects were selected because of their contributions to the state-of-the-art in active controls technology (ACT) or because of the knowledge gained in further understanding the complex mechanisms that cause adverse aeroservoelastic interactions...|$|R
40|$|The Quiet Spike (QS) flight {{research}} program was an aerodynamic and structural proof-of-concept of a telescoping sonic-boom suppressing nose boom on an F- 15 B aircraft. The program {{goal was to}} collect flight data for model validation up to 1. 8 Mach. The primary test philosophy was maintaining safety of flight. In the area of stability and controls the primary concerns were to assess the potential destabilizing effect of the spike on the stability, controllability, and handling qualities of the aircraft and to ensure adequate stability margins across the entire QS flight envelop.

40|$|A maximum-likelihood output-error {{parameter}} estimation technique {{is used to}} obtain stability and control derivatives for the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center SR- 71 A airplane and for configurations that include experiments externally mounted {{to the top of}} the fuselage. This research is being done as part of the <b>envelope</b> <b>clearance</b> for the new experiment configurations. Flight data are obtained at speeds ranging from Mach 0. 4 to Mach 3. 0, with an extensive amount of test points at approximately Mach 1. 0. Pilot-input pitch and yaw-roll doublets are used to obtain the data. This report defines the {{parameter estimation}} technique used, presents stability and control derivative results, and compares the derivatives for the three configurations tested. The experimental configurations studied generally show acceptable stability, control, trim, and handling qualities throughout the Mach regimes tested. The reduction of directional stability for the experimental configurations is the most significant aerodynamic effect measured and identified as a design constraint for future experimental configurations. This report also shows the significant effects of aircraft flexibility on the stability and control derivatives...|$|R
40|$|The design {{goals for}} the X- 31 flight control system were: (1) level 1 {{handling}} qualities during post-stall maneuvering (30 to 70 degrees angle-of-attack); (2) thrust vectoring to enhance performance across the flight envelope; and (3) adequate pitch-down authority at high angle-of-attack. Additional performance goals are discussed. A description of the flight control system is presented, highlighting flight control system features in the pitch and roll axes and X- 31 thrust vectoring characteristics. The high angle-of-attack <b>envelope</b> <b>clearance</b> approach will be described, including a brief explanation of analysis techniques and tools. Also, problems encountered during envelope expansion will be discussed. This presentation emphasizes control system solutions to problems encountered in envelope expansion. An essentially 'care free' envelope was cleared for the close-in-combat demonstrator phase. High angle-of-attack flying qualities maneuvers are currently being flown and evaluated.

40|$|The Quiet Spike F- 15 B flight {{research}} program investigated supersonic shock reduction using a 24 -ft sub-scale telescoping nose boom on an F- 15 B airplane. The program primary flight test {{objective was to}} collect flight data for aerodynamic and structural models validation up to 1. 8 Mach. Other objectives were to validate the mechanical feasibility of a morphing fuselage at the operational conditions and determine the near-field shock wave characterization. The stability and controls objectives were to assess {{the effect of the}} spike on the stability, controllability, and handling qualities of the aircraft and to ensure adequate stability margins across the entire research flight envelop. The two main stability and controls issues were the effects of the telescoping nose boom influenced aerodynamics on the F- 15 B aircraft flight dynamics and air data and angle of attack sensors.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the human engineering {{analysis performed on}} the Materials Science Research Rack- 1 and Quench Module Insert (MSRR- 1 /QMI) using Transom Jack (Jack) software. The Jack software was used to model a virtual environment consisting of the MSRR- 1 /QMI hardware configuration and human figures representing the 95 th percentile male and 5 th percentile female. The purpose of the simulation {{was to assess the}} human interfaces in the design for their ability to meet the requirements of the Pressurized Payloads Interface Requirements Document - International Space Program, Revision C (SSP 57000). Jack was used in the evaluation because of its ability to correctly model anthropometric body measurements and the physical behavior of astronauts working in microgravity, which {{is referred to as the}} neutral body posture. The Jack model allows evaluation of crewmember interaction with hardware through task simulation including but not limited to collision avoidance behaviors, hand/eye coordination, reach path planning, and automatic grasping to part contours. Specifically, this virtual simulation depicts the human figures performing the QMI installation and check-out, sample cartridge insertion and removal, and gas bottle drawer removal. These tasks were evaluated in terms of adequate <b>clearance</b> in reach <b>envelopes,</b> adequate accessibility in work envelopes, appropriate line of sight in visual envelopes, and accommodation of full size range for male and female stature maneuverability. The results of the human engineering analysis virtual simulation indicate that most of the associated requirements of SSP 57000 were met. However, some hardware design considerations and crew procedures modifications are recommended to improve accessibility, provide an adequate work envelope, reduce awkward body posture, and eliminate permanent protrusions...|$|R
