50|$|In {{computer}} programming a <b>control</b> <b>break</b> {{is a change}} in the value of one of the keys on which a file is sorted which requires some extra processing. For example, with an input file sorted by post code, the number of items found in each postal district might need to be printed on a report, and a heading shown for the next district. Quite often there is a hierarchy of nested control breaks in a program, e.g. streets within districts within areas, with the need for a grand total at the end. Structured programming techniques have been developed to ensure correct processing of control breaks in languages such as COBOL and to ensure that conditions such as empty input files and sequence errors are handled properly.|$|E

In this workshop, the DOW-loop's logic is examined via the power of example to reveal its aesthetic beauty and pragmatic utility.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, a novel {{intermittent}} impulsive synchronization {{scheme is}} proposed to realize synchronization of two chaotic delayed neural networks. Intermittent impulsive <b>control</b> <b>breaks</b> through {{the limitation of}} the upper bound of the impulsive intervals in general impulsive control. In our synchronization scheme, impulsive control is only activated in the control windows, rather than during the whole time. Several synchronization criteria for chaotic delayed neural networks are established utilizing the method of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and the Lyapunov–Razumikhin technique. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our main results...|$|R

Although he regarded them as formally equivalent, a re-analysis of his own argument for their equivalence brings out two important assumptions on which it rests: weak additivity and actor's control. When weak additivity breaks down, neitherfi tness concept is appropriate in its original form. When actor's <b>control</b> <b>breaks</b> down, neighbour-modulated fitness may be appropriate, but inclusive fitness is not. Yet I argue that, despite its more limited domain of application, inclusive fitness provides a distinctively valuable perspective on social evolution...|$|R
