40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{different}} eating times on blood <b>circulation</b> <b>index,</b> pulse wave energy (E), and radial augmentation index (RAI) of healthy adult men. Methods: Blood <b>circulation</b> <b>index,</b> E, and RAI were measured using a three-dimensional (3 -D) pulse imaging system (3 -D MAC) at before, right after, 30  minutes after, 1 hour after, and 2  hours after eating. Results: In the blood <b>circulation</b> <b>index,</b> heart rate (HR), estimated cardiac output (ECO), and estimated cardiac output index (ECI) increased significantly right after eating compared to before eating. By contrast, estimated circulation resistance (ECR) and estimated circulation resistance index (ECRI) decreased significantly right after eating compared to before eating. E had a tendency to increase right after eating compared to before eating and decrease gradually at every experimental point (left and right Chon, Kwan, and Cheok). RAI had a tendency to decrease right after eating compared to before eating and increase gradually at every experimental point. Conclusions: Different eating times can bring about changes on blood <b>circulation</b> <b>index,</b> E, and RAI. These changes show a certain tendency and coincide with the physiological factors that eating causes a rise of HR, an increase of systolic cardiac pump performance, and a reduction of peripheral vascular resistance...|$|E

The monthly <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> {{used in this study}} include the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the East Atlantic (EA), the Scandinavian (SCAN) and the East Atlantic-Western Russia (EA-WR) patterns, as well as the recently published Westerly Index (WI), defined as the persistence of westerly winds over the eastern north Atlantic region. The results indicate that European drought variability is better explained by the station-based NAO index and the WI than by any other combination of <b>circulation</b> <b>indices.</b> In northern and central Europe the variability of drought severity for different seasons and time-scales is strongly associated with the WI. On the contrary, {{the influence of}} the NAO on southern Europe droughts is stronger than that exerted by the WI.

40|$|This {{study is}} aiming {{to improve the}} {{understanding}} of hydrodynamic circulation in large shallow lakes. The Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in east China, is picked up as the study area for three reasons. The basin of Lake Taihu is considered as the most populated and developed area as a backyard of Shanghai. Lake Taihu is a typical shallow lake with average water depth of 1. 9 m. The lake is suffering from severe ecological problems during the past 20 years caused by the growing industrial, agricultural and urban waste water. Literature review showed that in the previous researches over the Lake Taihu, more emphasize was put on resulting concentration of contaminants and nutrients in the water while the hydrodynamic circulation are less quantitatively focused. In this study, hydrodynamic <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> are applied to quantify hydrodynamic circulation in Lake Taihu. This study {{has been carried out}} through various empirical modeling, schematized modeling and complete 3 d modeling approach. To quantify the water circulation and water exchange in the lake, hydrodynamic <b>circulation</b> <b>indices,</b> such as water age and residence time, are introduced. To evaluate the hydrodynamic <b>circulation</b> <b>indices,</b> a simple schematized model is first set up and analyzed to demonstrate the functions and characteristics of different <b>circulation</b> <b>indices.</b> Model input data such as water level, inflow/outflow discharge (mass balance), and land reclamation are analyzed. Since the wind is generally regarded as the driving force for shallow lakes, wind input data is emphasized and corrected for land-measured data. The contribution of different conditions, including various wind conditions, to the water exchange between the lake water and water body discharged from the canals, is evaluated. Then a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for Lake Taihu is set up and has been calibrated with water level data of year 2008. The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model is used to demonstrate the hydrodynamic circulation pattern in Lake Taihu. Sensitivity tests on the input data and physical parameters shows that the discharge is the most important factor if the wind is not driven force under normal wind conditions. Innovative engineering measurements and design scenarios are proposed to enhance the water circulation, which will potentially promote the water quality in certain subzones of the lake. These design scenarios, including recovery of land reclamation, global dredging, local barrier, local trenches and submerged reef, are investigated. It is found that, although the anthropogenic changes on bed don’t provide global improvement in <b>circulation</b> <b>indices,</b> local improvement is generally observed in subzones of the lake. Furthermore, wave effects are assessed via an empirical nomogram model, a schematized model and a wave model for the Lake Taihu. Results and analysis show that wave effects are not significant for Lake Taihu under normal wind conditions. This study applies hydrodynamic <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> to quantify the circulation in Lake Taihu, thus to improve the understanding the hydrodynamic circulation pattern in the lake. This approach could be extended to the hydrodynamic studies in similar large, shallow lakes. The modeling tools are essential for further environmental, biological and ecological study.

The first three EOF patterns of the study are the central tendency of European pressure (EOF 1), a zonal flow pattern over Europe (EOF 2), and a blocking/cyclonic pattern in the eastern North Atlantic (EOF 3). EOF analyses on sub-periods of the station records suggest episodes of more intense meridional circulation (EOF 3) from 1822 to 1870, and stronger zonal westerlies from 1947 to 1995. Simple zonal <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> were also constructed for a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index using Gibraltar and Reykjavik (1821 - 1995), a western European zonal index using Madrid, Barcelona, Trondheim and Lund (1786 - 1995), and a Paris-London index (1774 - 1995). Correlation analysis suggests that the NAO {{may be a better}} indicator of eastern North Atlantic blocking or cyclonicity (EOF 3) than of European zonal flow, especially outside the winter months.

Our results confirmed that certain levels of PEEP may improve respiratory system compliance thus induce a maximal tidal volume. But with the increasing levels of PEEP, systemic venous return and consequently cardiac output would be reduced (Kamath et al. 2010; Abdel-Hady et al. 2008), in the end peripheral perfusion would be decreased. Our aims were to find a balance among these factors, {{in search of an}} optional PEEP for each individual patient, with improvement of respiratory system compliance and least inhibitive cardiac effect. We detected the changes of PVI and CVP according to different levels of PEEP (0, 5, 10  cmH 2 O), and found out 5  cmH 2 O of PEEP induced a best respiratory system compliance thus an ideal tidal volume without affecting the <b>circulation</b> <b>index</b> including CVP and SpO 2 values.

40|$|Climate models {{indicate}} a future wintertime precipitation {{reduction in the}} Mediterranean region but there is large uncertainty in the amplitude of the projected change. We analyse CMIP 5 climate model output to quantify the role of atmospheric circulation in the Mediterranean precipitation change. It is found that a simple <b>circulation</b> <b>index,</b> i. e. the 850 hPa zonal wind (U 850) in North Africa, well describes the year to year fluctuations in the area-averaged Mediterranean precipitation, with positive (i. e. westerly) U 850 anomalies in North Africa being associated with positive precipitation anomalies. Under climate change, U 850 in North Africa and the Mediterranean precipitation are both projected to decrease consistently with the relationship found in the inter-annual variability. This enables us to estimate that about 85 % of the CMIP 5 mean precipitation response and 80 % {{of the variance in}} the inter-model spread are related to changes in the atmospheric circulation. In contrast, there is no significant correlation between the mean precipitation response and the global-mean surface warming across the models.

The winter haze pollution in BTH had distinct inter-annual and inter-decadal variabilities without a significant long-term trend. According to the spatial distribution of correlation coefficients, six atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> (I 1 to I 6) were defined from the key areas in sea level pressure (SLP), zonal and meridional winds at 850  hPa (U 850, V 850), geopotential height field at 500  hPa (H 500), zonal wind at 200  hPa (U 200), and air temperature at 200  hPa (T 200), respectively. All of the six indices have significant and stable correlations with the winter visibility and number of hazy days in BTH. In the raw (unfiltered) correlations, the correlation coefficients between the six indices and the winter visibility (number of hazy days) varied from 0. 57 (0. 47) to 0. 76 (0. 6) with an average of 0. 65 (0. 54); in the high-frequency ([*]<[*] 10  years) correlations, the coefficients varied from 0. 62 (0. 58) to 0. 8 (0. 69) with an average of 0. 69 (0. 64). The six <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> together can explain 77. 7  % (78. 7  %) and 61. 7  % (69. 1  %) variances of the winter visibility and the number of hazy days in the year-to-year (inter-annual) variability, respectively. The increase in I c (a comprehensive index derived from the six individual <b>circulation</b> <b>indices)</b> can cause a shallowing of the East Asian trough at the middle troposphere and a weakening of the Siberian high-pressure field at sea level, and is then accompanied by a reduction (increase) of horizontal advection and vertical convection (relative humidity) in the lowest troposphere and a reduced boundary layer height in BTH and its neighboring areas, which are favorable for the formation of haze pollution in BTH winter, and vice versa. The high level of the prediction statistics and the reasonable mechanism suggested that the winter haze pollution in BTH can be forecasted or estimated credibly based on the optimized atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>indices.</b> Thus it is helpful for government decision-making departments to take action in advance in dealing with probably severe haze pollution in BTH indicated by the atmospheric circulation conditions...|$|R

Conclusions: The influence of hypertonic sodium chloride hydroxyethyl starch 40 injection for the cardiac and pulmonary function state of patients with radical surgery of esophageal cancer is better, and the application effect for the surgical patients is better...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{circulation}} {{is important}} in determining the surface climate and environment. To quantify its effect, <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> or classifications of circulation type are often used. In this study, the classification system developed by Lamb (1950. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 76 : 393 – 438) is applied to obtain circulation information for Sweden on a monthly basis. For that purpose, monthly mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) data from 1873 to 1995 is used to derive six <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> {{and to provide a}} circulation catalogue with 27 circulation types. The frequency of circulation types over different periods is computed and described. Four major types (cyclonic, C; west, W; southwest, SW; anticyclonic, A) have been identified. The catalogue and the associated indices provide a tool for interpreting the regional climate and for developing statistical downscaling models to derive regional climate change scenarios for Sweden. An example is given to illustrate the application and usefulness of this climatology. It deals with the linkage between the mean regional temperature in southwestern Sweden and the large-scale circulation. It is shown that directional flows with a westerly component clearly favour a positive temperature anomaly, while the anticyclonic condition often induces a negative anomaly. Moreover, it is the westerly or southwesterly flows that accompany extreme positive temperature anomalies, whereas anticyclonic conditions {{play an important role in}} creating extrem...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> {{can be used}} {{to explain}} the {{variability}} of runoff on a continental scale. Beside well-known regional anomalies of precipitation and runoff that correlate with phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) there are also drifting fields of annual discharge anomalies. Following the trend of the NAO, these fields move along a longitudinal axis from western Europe to the Lena catchment in Siberia and back again. The same pattern is observable in the changing flow regimes. This paper describes the origin and causes of these anomaly fields and explains them as the results of important climate variations in the northern hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|Using monthly mean National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis {{data for}} the period 1958 - 1996, based on a new <b>circulation</b> <b>index</b> in the {{tropical}} western Pacific region, this paper investigates extreme winter circulation conditions in the northwestern Pacific and their evolution. The {{results show that the}} extreme winter circulation anomaly in the northwestern Pacific exhibits a strong association with those appearing in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere including the northern Asian continent, part of the Barents Sea, and the northeastern Pacific. As the season progresses, an anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly appearing in the northwestern Pacific gradually moves northeastwards and extends westwards. Its axis in the west-east direction is also stretched. Therefore, easterly (westerly) anomalies {{in the southern part of}} the anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomaly continuously expand westwards to the peninsula of India. Therefore, the South Asian summer monsoon would be weaker (stronger). Simultaneously, another interesting phenomenon is the evolution of SLP anomalies. As the season progresses (from winter to the following summer), SLP anomalies originating from the tropical western Pacific gradually move towards, and finally occupy the Asian continent, and further influence the thermal depression over the Asian continent in the following summer...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a dynamical seasonal forecast system is evaluated for the prediction of summer monsoon rainfall over the Indian region during June-September (JJAS) by using hindcast of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seasonal ensemble prediction system (EPS) model, based on five ensembles of March, April and May initial states {{for a period of}} 32 years (1979 - 2010). The hindcast climatology during JJAS simulates the mean monsoon circulation at lower and upper tropospheres very well in JMA model using March, April and May ensembles with a more realistic simulation of Webster and Yang's broad scale monsoon <b>circulation</b> <b>index.</b> The JMA hindcast climatology during JJAS simulates the rainfall maxima over the west-coast of India and the head Bay of Bengal reasonably well, although, the latter is slightly shifted southwestward. Associated with better forecast skills of El Nino in the JMA model, the interannual variability of All India Summer Monsoon Rainfall (AISMR) during the 32 -year period has also been very well simulated with a high significant (99 % level) correlation in April ensemble followed by that of March and May ensembles. Thus, the present analysis indicates that the JMA seasonal forecast model can prove to be a useful tool for the dynamical seasonal forecast of AISMR...|$|E
40|$|Infrasound waves {{propagate}} in {{the atmosphere}} by a well known mechanism produced by refraction of the waves, return to earth, and reflection at the surface into the atmosphere for subsequent bounces. A figure illustrates this phenomenon with results from a ray trace model. In this instance three rays are returned to earth from a region centered at about 50 kilometers in altitude and two from a region near 110 kilometers in altitude. The control of the wave refraction is largely dominated by the temperature-height profile and inversions; however, a major influence is also produced by the atmospheric wind profile. Another figure illustrates the considerable ray differences for rays moving in the wind direction (to the right) and in the counter direction (to the left). It obviously can be expected that infrasonic signal amplitudes will be greatly influenced by the winds {{in the atmosphere}}. The seasonal variation of the high altitude atmospheric winds is well documented. A third figure illustrates this with average statistics on the observed zonal wind {{in the region of}} 50 plus or minus 5 kilometers in altitude. The results are based upon a survey by Webb; Webb terms this parameterization the Stratospheric <b>Circulation</b> <b>Index</b> (SCI). The very strong seasonal variation has the ability to exert a major seasonal influence on infrasonic signals. The purpose here is to obtain a method for the correction of this effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between surface atmospheric circulation and temperature in Europe from the 1770 s to 1995 is examined using correlation analysis. The atmospheric circulation {{is represented by}} six indices: the three leading principal components (PCs) of an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of 20 European pressure series from 1822 to 1995, which represent the central tendency of European pressure (EOF 1), a zonal circulation pattern (EOF 2) and a meridional pattern (EOF 3), a North Atlantic zonal index constructed from Gibraltar and Reykjavik pressure series for 1821 – 1995; a Western European zonal index constructed from Madrid, Barcelona, Lund and Trondheim for 1786 – 1995; and an index constructed from Paris and London, 1774 – 1995. Eight long temperature series from northwestern and central Europe were correlated with these <b>circulation</b> <b>indices.</b> European temperatures in general had the highest correlations with the zonal <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> in winter, with almost 70 % of the variability in the temperature records explained by variations in the zonal index. The correlation coefficients between PC 3 (representing meridional circulation) and temperatures were highest in spring and autumn, particularly for Scandinavia. Running correlation series calculated over 25 -year windows reveal significant non-stationarities in the {{relationship between}} surface temperature and atmospheric circulation on decadal time scales, suggesting caution must be used in extrapolating current relationships between circulation and temperature for future climate predictions based on downscaling or past palaeoclimatic reconstructions...|$|R

Thus, the problem of attribution of precipitation changes splits into two distinct steps: understanding how forcings influence circulation patterns and finding relationships between these patterns and the behavior of precipitation. Here, we deal with this second step, by analyzing data about eight <b>circulation</b> <b>indices</b> and their influence on precipitation anomalies in an extended Italian Alpine region. The methods used are bivariate nonlinear analysis and neural network modeling. We identify the most influential circulation patterns in each season and work out neural network models {{that are able to}} substantially describe the climate variability of precipitation at this regional scale...|$|R
