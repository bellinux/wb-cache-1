40|$|AbstractFundamental {{results of}} Tannaka duality include the {{reconstruction}} of a coalgebra in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces from its <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations equipped with the forgetful functor, and the characterization <b>of</b> those <b>categories</b> equipped with a functor into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces which are equivalent to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations of some coalgebra. This paper generalizes these results by replacing the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces by an arbitrary monoidal category and replacing coalgebras by their several-object analogue. Applications include providing sufficient conditions on a small R-linear category to ensure that its <b>category</b> <b>of</b> presheaves {{is equivalent to the}} <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations of some R-coalgebra. In particular we construct an R-coalgebra whose <b>category</b> <b>of</b> representations is equivalent to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> chain complexes over R...|$|R

If the Kleisli <b>category</b> <b>of</b> T moreover forms an order-enriched category, then the monad induced by the new situation is Kock–Zöberlein. Injective objects in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> Kleisli monoids with respect to the class of initial morphisms then characterize the objects <b>of</b> the Eilenberg–Moore <b>category</b> <b>of</b> T, a fact that allows us to recuperate a number of known results, and present some new ones...|$|R
