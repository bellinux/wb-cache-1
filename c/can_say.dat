5|$|After {{the release}} of Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No!, many {{teachers}} who showed the film to their students reported receiving disclosures of abuse. Because many of the teachers said they were unsure of {{how to deal with}} the disclosures, Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare. Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child makes such a disclosure.|$|E
5|$|Copies of Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! were {{purchased}} by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. The VHS tapes circulated widely {{in schools and}} rape crisis centers in Australia; although showings began to decrease as VHS became less popular, the film was a significant teaching tool. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E

5|$|Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! resurfaced in 2014 when Harris, then 83 years old, was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986 against four young girls; the {{youngest}} {{was seven years}} old. The prosecutors found Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! on YouTube and wanted to show it at trial for its unintentional irony, but the film was ruled irrelevant to the case and not admitted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! was {{released}} in the United Kingdom in October 1985 on VHS with notes for teachers and two relevant books, and was distributed by Skippon Video, Skippon's UK-based company. Although several other short children's educational films about sexual abuse were {{on the market in}} the UK including several also released that year, Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! was the only British film; the others were made in Australia, Canada and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E

5|$|Southwark Crown Court found Harris {{guilty of}} all twelve counts of indecent assault. During the trial, it was learned that, while making Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No!, Harris was {{involved}} in a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend; the relationship began when the victim was 13 years old and lasted for 15 years. Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release, including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release. The first victim was about the age of the children in Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse. A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.|$|E

I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that the zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. He adds that among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Scare, {{filmed in}} a North London school, {{consists}} of role-playing scenes with actual teachers. The film instructs teachers {{to listen to}} the child, to discuss the incident with the child's parents and to contact the appropriate authorities. The Tavistock Clinic helped with the film's production, and an expert from the organisation appears on-camera to promote child protection projects in schools. Although Harris appears in Beyond the Scare, his role is less prominent than in Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! and his activism against child abuse ended soon afterwards.|$|E

Latin versions of both had recently been published in Lyon, and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) {{in his first two}} verses, the first of which is appended to this article.

5|$|Kids <b>Can</b> <b>Say</b> No! was {{the first}} British children's film about sexual abuse. The film is {{intended}} to teach children between ages five and eight how to avoid situations where they might be abused, {{how to get out}} of such situations, and how to get help if they are abused. Skippon later said that, although the people working on the film tried to keep it from being frightening to children, the task was difficult. She said that the film was not intended for home viewing and that only well-informed adults trained in the subject should present it to children.|$|E

5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes.

It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over.

Nemo does not back down and keeps assuring her of his feelings. Finally, Elise gives in and a few years later, they get married. In one version of the story line, Elise dies in an accident on the return from the wedding. Nemo keeps her ashes, having promised her to spread them on Mars. In a far future, Nemo carries Elise's ash to Mars and spreads them on the planet's surface. Aboard the spacecraft traveling back to Earth, he meets Anna. Before they <b>can</b> <b>say</b> much to each other, the ship is destroyed by meteoroids. In an alternate version of events, he works at the same television studio but his assistant drowns instead. The assistant's widow is Anna, whom he recognizes. Another storyline has Nemo and Elise married with three children. However, their marriage is unhappy as Elise suffers from borderline personality disorder and chronic depression. She has attacks of hysteria and, despite Nemo's attempts to save their marriage, ultimately leaves him to pursue Stefano.|$|E
