This was defended from attack by the mill stream, which separated it from the village, and which was crossed only by the road leading down to the ford. The bridge was a wooden one, and this had been already partly sawn away. As soon as the last of the defenders <b>crossed</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the bridge was chopped down. Along the line of the stream Harry had erected a defense, breast high, of sacks of wheat from the mill. The enemy, as they straggled out through the burning village, paused, on seeing the strong posilion which yet remained to be carried. The mill stream was rapid and deep, and the approaches swept by the fire from the mill. There was a pause, and then the cannon were brought up and fire opened upon the mill, the musketry keeping up an incessant rattle from every wall and clump of bushes.|$|R
50|$|Departing Little Rock on 23 March, Steele's Corps {{of about}} 20,000 troops, {{including}} the Thirty-sixth Iowa Infantry Regiment, immediately encountered rebel {{resistance in the}} form of skirmishers along the line of March. The first major engagement took place as Steele’s column was crossing the Little Missouri River. The Confederates had burned the only bridge across the river—swollen by spring rains—but federal scouts had located the a passable crossing at Elkin’s Ford. The rebels lay in ambush at the ford and viciously attacked as the federals made their crossing. A sharp infantry and artillery exchange ensued in which the 1st Battalion of the Thirty-sixth Iowa played a key role. Under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Drake, the federals fought off a rebel force more than twice their number and secured the south bank after an all-day fight. The rebels abandoned their effort and withdrew, allowing Steele to <b>cross</b> the <b>remainder</b> of the VII Corps the following day.|$|R
60|$|Early on {{the morning}} of the 24th Hooker moved Geary's division, {{supported}} by a brigade of Cruft's, up Lookout Creek, to effect a <b>crossing.</b> The <b>remainder</b> of Cruft's division was to seize the bridge over the creek, near the crossing of the railroad. Osterhaus was to move up to the bridge and cross it. The bridge was seized by Gross's brigade after a slight skirmish with the pickets guarding it. This attracted the enemy so that Geary's movement farther up was not observed. A heavy mist obscured him from the view of the troops on the top of the mountain. He crossed the creek almost unobserved, and captured the picket of over forty men on guard near by. He then commenced ascending the mountain directly in his front. By this time the enemy was seen coming down from their camps on the mountain slope, and filing into their rifle-pits to contest the crossing of the bridge. By eleven o'clock the bridge was complete. Osterhaus was up, and after some sharp skirmishing the enemy was driven away with considerable loss in killed and captured.|$|R

As the tornado approached the area just south of Durant and crossed U.S. Route 51, it narrowed and reached one of its weaker points in its track, but {{was still on the}} ground.However, shortly thereafter it re-intensified somewhat and began causing significant tree damage in rural western Attala County. The tornado continued across northern Attala County, causing tree damage and heavily damaging a number of rural residences, including in the community of Hesterville. The tornado intensified further as it crossed the Natchez Trace Parkway, and once again produced high-end EF3 damage as it passed northwest of Weir. Numerous homes were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area. The tornado maintained strong intensity as it <b>crossed</b> the <b>remainder</b> of Choctaw County, including damaging a number of homes as it cross Highways 415, 9 and Highways 15. The tornado rapidly narrowed and weakened as it crossed into Oktibbeha County, and dissipated north of the town of Sturgis after being on the ground for nearly 3 hours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pipeline}} begins from Almetyevsk in Tatarstan, the Russian heartland, {{where it}} collects oil from western Siberia, the Urals, and the Caspian Sea. It runs to Mozyr in southern Belarus, where it splits into a {{northern and southern}} branch. The northern branch <b>crosses</b> the <b>remainder</b> of Belarus across Poland to Schwedt in Germany. [...] It supplies refineries in Płock and in Schwedt. The northern branch is also connected by the Płock-Gdańsk pipeline with the Naftoport terminal in Gdańsk, which is used for oil re-exports. [...] In Schwedt the Druzhba pipeline is connected with the MVL pipeline to Rostock and Spergau.The southern branch runs south through Ukraine. In Brody the Druzhba pipeline is connected with the Odessa-Brody pipeline, which is currently used to ship oil from the Druzhba pipeline to the Black Sea. In Uzhgorod the pipeline splits into lines to Slovakia (Druzhba-1 - original Druzhba route) and to Hungary (Druzhba-2). The line through Slovakia is divided once again near Bratislava: one branch leading in a northwest direction to the Czech Republic and the other going southward to Hungary. The Druzhba-1 pipeline branches off toward Hungary in Banská Bystrica Region (Slovakia) near the river of Ipeľ, crosses the Hungarian border at Drégelypalánk and leads to Százhalombatta (not depicted on the map {{at the beginning of}} the page). In Hungary, the Druzhba-1 pipeline supplies Duna refinery while Druzhba-2 supplies Duna and Tisza refineries.|$|R

The Middlesex then passed through them, moving south-west onto the main {{road in front of}} 3 RAR where they knocked out a North Korean tank which was blocking their advance. By nightfall they had linked up with the Australians, consolidating their positions and securing a safe <b>crossing</b> for the <b>remainder</b> of the brigade, including the wheeled vehicles which followed that evening.

5000|$|For {{the next}} several years, the war was {{centered}} in the County of Maine, with Duke William on the offensive. But King Henry in 1057, [...] "burning to avenge the insult inflicted on him by the duke, summoned Geoffrey, count of Anjou, to prepare a large army for another expedition into Normandy." [...] (GND) This combined effort placed Duke William temporarily on the defensive. He retreated before the invaders as they moved deeper into Normandy. After penetrating to the Bessin, the Franco-Angevin army began to ford the River Dives near the estuary which is tidal. After the king and Count Geoffrey had <b>crossed</b> over, the <b>remainder</b> of their army got stuck on the opposite bank by the incoming tide. Duke William launched a sudden attack and defeated them. King Henry and Count Geoffrey withdrew again from Normandy and never returned. Count Geoffrey continued to offer resistance in Maine against the Norman expansion until his death on 14 November 1060.|$|R
50|$|As {{soon as the}} Indians retreated, Samuel South and Peter Hackett, {{both young}} men, were {{dispatched}} to take {{the trail of the}} men and inform them of the news. The boys found them near the mouth of Drowning Creek and Red River early on the morning of March 21. Of the 40 men, approximately 20 had left families within the fort. They returned with the boys to Estill's Station. The <b>remainder</b> <b>crossed</b> the Kentucky river and found the Indian trail. Captain Estill organized a company of 25 men, followed the Indians, and suffered what is known as Estill's Defeat, later known as the Battle of Little Mountain (March 22, 1782) in Montgomery Co. Captain Estill and nine of his men were killed. Peter Hackett, then about 18, was wounded. Both Indians and Whites withdrew, the Indians suffering greater losses. Peter Hackett {{is believed to have been}} holding Estill's horse when Estill was mortally wounded. It is said that James was overpowered and killed with a butcher's knife by an Indian chief. James' weakened arm contributed to his inability to defend himself.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} analysis tools for flight loads prediction in the pre-design stage. The analysis tools are embedded in a parametric modelling environment. Emphasis will be on prediction of aerodynamic loads on specific structural parts, like the fin, during dynamic manoeuvres. Principal requirement is that these loads can be computed with low effort, but with sufficient accuracy. In the frame of this work, an available transport aircraft model has been taken as reference. The aerodynamic loads on the fin are computed using the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM), allowing for comparison with the original aerodynamics data base. For this structural component of the aircraft, a dense panel grid is chosen. In order to account for aerodynamic <b>cross</b> interferences, the <b>remainder</b> of the aircraft geometry is also taken into account, but with a considerably coarser grid. From the comparison with the original database, correction factors and uncertainty bounds are estimated. Next, the geometry of the fin is modified. Based on aerodynamic loads computed with the VLM, the impact on (lateral) manoeuvre loads is analyzed. Hereby the estimated uncertainty levels from the first step are used to predict sensitivities for consideration in structural sizing. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The {{church is}} {{composed}} of the main church and the later exonarthex. The main church is a three-aisled basilica with a cross roof formed by a vertical transept in the main aisle. The side-aisles are considerably lower and are separated from the central aisle by columns supporting six arches. To the east the church features three three-sided apses. The walls {{of the church to}} the height of 2 m are built of large limestone ashlar blocks, some of which have been arranged to form <b>crosses,</b> while the <b>remainder</b> was built in the typically Byzantine enclosed brick system (square stones with bricks around). The external walls feature ceramic decorations in the form of jagged bands, maeanders, crosses, etc. The windows are double- or triple-arched, and feature ceramic decorations. the exonarthex, which was added in the late 14th century, is of the cross-in-square type, with four small corner niches. The structure was largely built with reused material. The monastery's founder, John Doukas, was buried before the south wall of the church; a fresco above his tomb shows him [...] "as a monk being presented by an angel to the enthroned Virgin".|$|R
5000|$|Watchman Nee {{based his}} {{speaking}} on the first eight chapters of the New Testament book of Romans. Nee takes the first eight chapters of Romans as a [...] "self-contained unit" [...] and divides these chapters into two parts: Romans 1:1 to 5:11 as part one and Romans 5:12 to 8:39 as part two. In {{the first part of}} Romans [...] "sins" [...] is given prominent attention and deals with the question of the sins man has committed before God. However, the second section deals with [...] "sin," [...] that is the inward nature, or inward working principle, within man that causes man to commit sin. Thus {{there is a difference between}} the acts of a sinner, sins, and the inward nature of a sinner, sin. Nee reveals that God's dual remedy is the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Cross of Christ. The Blood [...] "deals with what we have done, whereas the Cross deals with what we are. The Blood disposes of our sins, while the Cross strikes at the root of our capacity for sin". As Nee progressively moves along in his book, he first touches upon the Blood and then focuses upon the <b>Cross</b> for the <b>remainder</b> of the book.1 ...|$|R
25|$|In Kentucky, the Americans {{went on the}} {{defensive}} while Caldwell, Elliott, and McKee with their Indian allies prepared a major offensive. Fort Estill was attacked by Wyandot Indians in March 1782. Colonel Benjamin Logan, commanding officer of the region, and stationed at Logan's Station, learned that the Wyandot warriors were in the area on warpath. The Indians, aided by the British in Detroit, had raided from Boonsborough past Estill's Station along the Kentucky River. Logan dispatched 15 men to Captain Estill at Estill's Station with orders to increase his force by 25 more men and reconnoiter {{the country to the}} north and east. Following orders, Captain Estill reached the Kentucky River a few miles below the mouth of Station Camp Creek and camped that night at Sweet Lick, now known as Estill Springs. On the day after they left Estill's Station, a body of Indians appeared there at dawn on March 20, they raided the fort, scalped and killed a Miss Innes in sight of the fortification and took Monk, a slave of Captain Estill, and killed all the cattle. As soon as the Indians retreated, Samuel South and Peter Hackett, both young men, were dispatched to take the trail of the men and inform them of the news. The boys found them near the mouth of Drowning Creek and Red River early on the morning of March 21. Of the 40 men, approximately 20 had left families within the fort.
