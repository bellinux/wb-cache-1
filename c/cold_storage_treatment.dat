40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of digging date at the nursery and duration of cold storage treatments applied after digging on the vegetative growth, flower production and fruit quality of two Californian short-day cultivars, "Chandler" and "Douglas", when winter planted in south-west Portugal. During four consecutive years, three field (1991 / 92, 1992 / 93 and 1993 / 94) and one growth chamber (1994 / 95) trials were layer out with three digging dates (middle of October, beginning and middle of November) and three cold storage treatments at 2 #+-# 1 deg C (0, 2 and 4 weeks). vegetative and flowering responses to digging dates and cold storage treatments varied between years and cultivars. The highest productivity of both cultivars was obtained with the 3 "r"d digging date with no <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatment.</b> However, in 199394, when the plants had received a greater number of chilling hours in the nursery, chilling had an inhibitory effect on flower production of "Chandler" dug on the latest date, resulting in reduced fruit yield and increased vegetative vigor. "Douglas" had a relatively high chilling requirement compared to "Chandler" and did not respond to early chilling. Increased field chilling promoted higher leaf and stolen numbers and greater leaf area in both cultivars, and also higher crown number in "Chandler" and petiole length in "Douglas". Additional cold storage treatments stimulated vegetative development and decreased flower and inflorescence number. However, in 199192, when the plants received less number of chilling hours in the nursery, <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatment</b> in early digging dates increased plant productivity. Inflorescence number per plant was the main yield component responsible for differences in yield between years, Thus, improving growing conditions, namely by increasing the temperature in the winter months (January and February) will improve plant productivityAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid on 12 quality parameters of apricot fruit in treatments of cold storage (1 °C for 7, 14 and 21 days) and shelf-life (4 and 8 days at 25 °C after a 21 -day <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatment).</b> Fruit quality parameters included 6 physico-chemical characteristics (weight loss, fruit firmness, total soluble solids, acidity, total soluble solids/acidity ratio and juice pH) and 6 sensory properties (skin and flesh colour, texture, taste, visual appearance and overall acceptability). Among physico-chemical characteristics, applications of 0. 2 mmol/L methyl jasmonate and 2 mmol/L salicylic acid significantly reduced fruit weight loss, fruit softening and juice pH and maintained soluble solid content and acidity over the whole storage period. Among sensory properties, all parameters were generally increased by methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid treatments compared to water-treated control and the water-treated fruits showed the lowest scores below the acceptability limit except for skin colour.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} determining {{if there were any}} changes in the volatile profile of strawberries cv. Camarosa, when subjected to various freezing and thawing treatments. Strawberries were cut in half, one half of the berries were frozen directly at - 20 °C or - 80 °C or rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen (N 2) (- 196 °C). They were then stored overnight or for a week. Berries were later left to thaw at room temperature (natural thawing) for about 1 h and some were forced-thawed in a 30 °C water bath. Headspace volatile compounds were determined using an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation-Mass Spectrometer (APCI-GPA) and validated with a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). In a comparison of thawed half berries and fresh berries, most esters such as hexyl acetate, ethyl methyl hexanoate, methyl acetate were increased significantly by week-long and not by overnight freeze/thaw treatments.

Hyperspectral {{images of}} {{cucumbers}} were acquired {{before and during}} <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatment</b> as well as during subsequent room temperature (RT) storage to explore {{the potential for the}} detection of chilling induced damage in whole cucumbers. Region of interest (ROI) spectral features of chilling injured areas, resulting from cold storage treatments at 0 C or 5 C, showed a reduction in reflectance intensity during multi-day post-chilling periods of RT storage. Large spectral differences between good-smooth skins and chilling injured skins occurred in the 700 - to 850 -nm visible/NIR region. A number of data processing methods, including simple spectral band algorithms and principal component analysis (PCA), were attempted to discriminate the ROI spectra of good cucumber skins from those of chilling injured skins. Results revealed that using either a dual-band ratio algorithm (Q 811 / 756) or a PCA model from a narrow spectral region of 733 - to 848 -nm could detect chilling injured skins with a success rate of over 90 %. Furthermore, the dual-band algorithm was applied to the analysis of images of cucumbers at different conditions, and the resultant images showed more correct identification of chilling injured spots than PCA method. The results also suggested that chilling injury was relatively difficult to detect at the stage of the first 0 to 2 days of post-chilling RT storage, due to insignificant manifestation of chilling induced symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Tissue-culture derived mother {{plants were}} {{established}} in a greenhouse suspended-gutter, nutrient-film technique growing system to evaluate runner tip productivity in the system. Effects of cultivar (`Allstar 2 ̆ 7, `Chandler 2 ̆ 7, `Latestar 2 ̆ 7, `Northeaster 2 ̆ 7, and USDA selection B 27) and duration (0, 1, or 2 months) of cold storage at 1 °C on tip viability, rooting success, and performance in fruit production were determined. The average number and weight of runner tips produced in the gutter production system, the capacity of runner tips to form cohesively rooted plug plants, and the number and length of adventitious roots produced by runner tips varied significantly among the cultivars and the three storage durations (0, 1, or 2 months). In the field, plants produced from runner tips stored for 2 months produced more runners than plants produced from freshly harvested runner tips. Crown number differed among the cultivars, but was not affected by <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatment.</b> No treatment differences were noted for the fruit harvest parameters evaluated. The {{results suggest that the}} transplants derived from mother plants grown in a greenhouse-based soilless system can be useful for annual plasticulture strawberry production in colder climates. Although long periods of cold storage of runner tips resulted in lower tip-to-transplant conversion ratios, field performance of transplants was not adversely affected. Additional research is needed to improve greenhouse strawberry production practices for increasing runner output and storage conditions that maintain the integrity of cold-stored runner tips. Without these improvements it is unlikely that soilless runner tip production will become a widely accepted technique that would replace the field nursery tip production method currently used by commercial strawberry propagators...|$|E
40|$|Tuta absoluta is an {{invasive}} pest {{species that}} affects tomatoes and other solanaceous crops and {{is found in}} Europe and other Mediterranean areas. Hitherto, fumigation with methyl bromide is the only measure used to control this pest during the postharvest period. Because of methyl bromide phytotoxicity and health, safety and environmental concerns, alternatives to this product need to be investigated. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to determine the ability of T. absoluta to complete its preimaginal development on tomato fruit during the postharvest period and to evaluate the effectiveness of different supra atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels and cold storage treatments on T. absoluta control. T. absoluta was unable to complete its development from egg to adult on fruit of three tomato varieties. In contrast, T. absoluta completed its preimaginal development when more mature larvae were provided with the tomato fruit. The exposure of T. absoluta to a modified atmosphere of 95 % CO 2 at 25 °C for 48 h was effective for the control of all life stages, but negatively affect fruit quality. An increment in the exposure time to 72 h was necessary in order to obtain the same level of control at 40 % CO 2. A <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatment</b> at 1 °C for a total of 10 days was also effective for the control of the T. absoluta eggs. These two treatments did not negatively affect the quality of the fruit. Therefore, these appear to be effective alternatives to postharvest methyl bromide fumigation and future studies need to be planned to validate the commercial feasibility of these findings.

However, after extended storage at low temperature some cultivars have alterated ripening processes, resulting in a lack of juice and a woolly texture. To improve {{our understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms involved in the responses of peach fruit to cold storage we determined gene expression changes of fruit (cv. O’Henry) under different postharvest conditions: ripening (5 days at 21 ◦C), cold storage (21 days at 4 ◦C) and induction of woolliness (21 days at 4 ◦C followed by 5 days at 21 ◦C). Cluster analyses of genes differentially expressed between treatments revealed unique patterns associated with biological processes that operate during postharvest treatments. Genes up-regulated during postharvest ripening and woolliness include components of ethylene, and aroma biosynthesis as well as oxidative stress response. During <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatment</b> and woolliness, several genes linked to the oxidative stress response increased in abundance, suggesting changes in redox status. Quantitative RTPCR analysis showed a sequential increase levels of mRNAs encoding key components of cellular stress response. Moreover, after 21 days of cold storage, expression of genes encoding oxidoreductase, catalase, superoxide dismutase and gluthatione reductase was still significantly higher than before cold treatment, suggesting that fruit cells were able to respond to the increased production of ROS that was induced by extended cold storage. In the woolly fruit, up-regulation of stress response genes was accompanied by down-regulation of key components of metabolic pathways that are active during peach ripening. The altered expression pattern of these genes might account for the abnormal ripening of woolly fruit.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{research}} that is being carried out into the relationship between food and consumers is progressively reinforced by continuous findings in literature confirming that consumers choose foods basing on their functional cognition and sensory perception, especially when buying fruit and vegetables. Therefore, {{it is important for}} table grape producers to be aware of consumers' concerns and preferences both, during the purchasing stage and after, during consumption at home, when experiential attributes have more importance. In both cases, sensory attributes {{play an important role in}} determining consumers' purchase behavior of table grape. Table grapes cv 'Italia' and 'Red Globe' are produced in South Italy (Sicily and Apulia) and appreciated by consumers for their superior taste and other intrinsic qualities, both in Italy and in other European countries. Nevertheless, harvested grapes of these cultivars deteriorate rapidly without post-harvest appropriate treatments, especially in terms of fungal rot, rachis browning, berry drop, softening, moisture loss and off flavor, and this fast deterioration is the main limitation to market acceptance. The objective of this study is to assess consumers preferences in regards to 22 sensory attributes of fresh table grapes cv 'Italia' and 'Red Globe', after a <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatment</b> of 90 days at 1 ± 1 °C and 90 ± 2 % RH, combined with low SO 2 concentration.

Consumers were asked to score table grape sensory attributes, using a 9 -pt scale, after long storage of 30, 60 and 90 d. For this study, the table grapes were harvested from two locations, Canicattì and Naro during the last week of September and treated with SO 2 fumigation, with SSC > 14 %, for prolonging shelf life. Analysis of scores revealed that consumers preferred cv 'Italia' for its uniform color and no shades of berries and for a balanced tasting sugar/acidity ratio. The cv 'Red Globe' performed good results for crunchy berries and intense berry aroma, detachment of berries and skin tannicity.

This was the impetus to study {{the possibility of using}} abscisic acid (ABA) concentration of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

The experiment included two lifting times (mid-November, mid-January), two pretreatments (normal dormancy, fall photoperiod), and three <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>treatments</b> (dark, light, and bareroot). Needle samples were taken four times during the experiment: 1) after 48 hours in the cold room, 2) prior to taking seedlings out of the cold room after 25 days of storage, 3) 48 hours in the growing environment, and 4) at the time of bud break. Seedling vigor in relation to treatments was assessed under two growing environments: 1) growth room and 2) cold frame. Seedlings were planted in mid-December and mid-February. The concentration of ABA in the needles was quantified by successive procedures of extracting ABA through poly-N-viriylpyrrolidone (PVP), diethylarninoethyl cellulose (DEAE), and octadecyl silica (C 18) columns, preparative purification with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and final quantitation with gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) using an electron capture detector. Results indicate that time of lifting did not affect survival greatly, but markedly influenced the time of bud break. <b>Storage</b> <b>treatments</b> did not result in statistically significant differences in ABA concentrations, survival or shoot growth. Generally, pretreatment with supplementary light in the fall did not produce different results from the normal dormancy pretreatment. Considerable variability in ABA concentrations amongst treatments was found, an occurrence which probably precluded detection of its relationship to seedling vigor. However, there was a tendency, though not significant, of increasing ABA concentrations from mid-November to mid-January. The failure to detect a relationship between ABA and seedling vigor may have been due to a transitory role of ABA in stress conditions or inability to quantitate ABA in its site of action, stomata. Results of this study, along with those of previous studies, support continuance of research on ABA in physiology of plants and its potential use as an indicator of seedling vigor. However, a new synthesis of the role of ABA in seedling metabolism would be fruitful before undertaking new empirical studies as the whole concept of hormone action is undergoing a evolutionary realignment...|$|R

With light present for germination, 1 and 2 month <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> periods had 10 % germination. Germination was not independent of <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> in dark <b>treatments,</b> with only 5 % of seeds germinating in controls without <b>cold</b> <b>storage.</b> In competition with C. stoebe, T. bipinnatum had reduced above-ground biomass and root length compared to T. bipinnatum grown with a conspecific and individually. Below-ground biomass for T. bipinnatum was significantly reduced in competition with C. stoebe compared to when it was grown individually. The only alteration in growth for C. stoebe was in below-ground biomass, which was greater in competition with T. bipinnatum. Limited seed germination and competition during establishment may explain why T. bipinnatum occurs at lower densities in areas invaded by C. stoebe. Further {{research is needed to}} quantify survival of mature T. bipinnatum beyond the initial establishment in competition with C. stoebe...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the potential of}} application of tea polyphenols to the shelf life extension and quality maintenance of litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) fruit, the fruits were dipped into a solution of 1 % tea phenols for 5 min before <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> at 4 °C. Changes in browning index, contents of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, O 2. − production rate and H 2 O 2 content, levels of relative leakage rate and lipid peroxidation, and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity were measured after 0, 10, 20 and 30 days of <b>cold</b> <b>storage.</b> The results showed that application of tea polyphenols markedly delayed pericarp browning, alleviated the decreases in contents of total soluble solids (TSS) and ascorbic acid, and maintained relatively high levels of total phenolics and anthocyanins of litchi fruit after 30 days of <b>cold</b> <b>storage.</b> Meanwhile, the <b>treatment</b> reduced the increases in relative leakage rate and lipid peroxidation content, delayed the increases in both O 2. − production rate and H 2 O 2 contents, and increased SOD activity but reduced POD activity throughout this storage period. These data indicated that the delayed pericarp browning of litchi fruit by the treatment with tea polyphenols {{could be due to}} enhanced antioxidant capability, reduced accumulations of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, and improved membrane integrity...|$|R
40|$|Application of polyamines {{has been}} {{reported}} to improve shelf life in different fruits. In this research the effect of different concentrations of putrescine with hot water on postharvest life of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa cv. Hayward) at 0 ± 0. 5 °C was studied. Fruits were treated with putrescine (0, 1 and 2 mmol/L) and stored for 16 weeks. Fruit quality attributes assessment including firmness, soluble solid content, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity were determined after 8 and 16 weeks of <b>cold</b> <b>storage.</b> Putrescine <b>treatment</b> had significant effect on firmness, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity, but had no significant effect on soluble solid content. After 8 and 16 weeks the highest firmness was for 2 mol/ L putrescine treatment. After 8 weeks the highest titratable acidity and ascorbic acid content were observed with 2 mol/ L putrescine treatment and after 16 weeks were observed with 1 mol/ L putrescine treatment. Putrescine treatment showed significant effect on antioxidant capacity in both measurements. The results revealed that kiwifruit storage life could be extended by putrescine treatment due, apparently, to its effect on delaying the ripenıng and senescence processes. Putrescine application in combination with hot water can be a suitable substitute for chemical post harvest treatment in kiwifruit...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{improve the}} {{availability}} of vessel grafts for allotransplantation, the current experimental {{study was designed to}} first investigate the function of vessels obtained from non-heartbeating donor rats at various time points postmortem; second, to assess the sensitivity of vessels recovered after circulatory arrest toward prolonged cold storage; and third, to determine vessel function following <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> with antimicrobial additives. MethodsWe investigated vessel tone development and endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent relaxations in a Mulvany myograph of aorta and saphenous artery sampled up to 24 hours after circulatory arrest. Additionally, tissue reductive capacity and lactate dehydrogenase release were measured. ResultsVessels recovered 2 hours postmortem showed similar results as controls recovered without delay. Vessels recovered 6 hours or more after circulatory arrest showed reduced vessel tone development (ie, aorta) : response to potassium < 15 % and response to norepinephrine < 25 % of vessels recovered without delay; A. saphena response to potassium: < 12 % and response to norepinephrine < 10 % of control vessels recovered without delay. All vessels recovered after circulatory arrest showed a similar <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> sensitivity as controls, with exception of a decreased endothelial function of A. saphena harvested 6 hours postmortem (one-third response of non-stored control vessels). Treatment of vessels recovered immediately or after circulatory arrest with gentamycin, piperacillin, and metronidazole as additives to the optimized <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> solution did not alter vessel function. Flucloxacillin as a <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> additive reduced vessel tone development in aorta but not in A. saphena. Addition of amphotericin B to the storage solution completely abolished any vessel function and impaired tissue reductive capacity despite presence of radical scavengers. ConclusionsThe use of vessels from non-heartbeating donors in general and subsequent prolonged <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> seems feasible when vessels are recovered within 2 hours. The use of antibiotics needs to be carefully assessed for each intended-to-use tissue. For vessels tested, a combination of gentamycin, piperacillin, and metronidazole supported the maintenance of vessel function. Clinical RelevanceVessel allograft transplantation is an option after vascular prosthesis infection with promising survival rates and low reinfection rates. It is rarely used due to the limited availability of suitable grafts. Use of grafts recovered from non-heartbeating donors (as done for bone and tendon grafting) might increase the number. However, maintaining vessel physiological function and documenting tissue sterility require sophisticated procedures. Consequent standardization of tissue storage and procurement seem necessary to fulfill legal requirements. The current experimental study provides a first outline with respect to standardization of tissue sampling, <b>cold</b> <b>storage,</b> and antimicrobial <b>treatment...</b>|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of leaf morphology {{must be taken}} to develop models of ecosystem productivity and climate change projections. Once leaves are removed from a plant they begin to lose water and degrade. If specimens cannot be measured immediately after harvest, it is important to store the leaves in a manner that reduces morphological changes. If preserved specimens are used, estimates that closely match fresh measurements need to be calculated. This study examined the change in leaf area after <b>storage</b> <b>treatments</b> and developed models {{that can be used to}} more accurately estimate initial leaf area. Fresh leaf area was measured from ten plant species then stored in one of two common <b>storage</b> <b>treatments.</b> After <b>storage,</b> leaf area was re-measured and comparisons were made between species and growth forms. Leaf area decreased the most after permanent <b>storage</b> <b>treatments</b> and the least after temporary storage.

40|$|Abstract — The present {{work is to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} different stacking arrangements on the performance of the <b>cold</b> <b>storage.</b> To analyze performance of the <b>cold</b> <b>storage,</b> an experiment is carried out in which the temperature distribution within the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> and power consumption in the different stacking arrangement are kept under observation. The temperature inside the chamber is a crucial parameter on which whole performance of <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> depends. Various arrangement of stacking is accomplished by the changing the gap between the columns of stack. The experiment is carried out for the three arrangements with gap between the columns of stack of 10 cm, 20 cm and 30 cm. For better temperature distribution within the <b>cold</b> <b>storage,</b> good air circulation inside the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> is desirable. And it is also done by the changing arrangement of stacking. Therefore, the optimization of temperature within the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> is carried out in different stacking arrangement and resulting in improving the performance of <b>cold</b> <b>storage...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceStorage at low {{temperature}} {{is a valuable}} method for increasing the shelf-life of natural enemies such as insect parasitoids. <b>Cold</b> <b>storage</b> is usually performed under sub-optimal temperatures, and therefore it is generally associated with major fitness costs. Tolerance to <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> is a very plastic trait influenced by {{a wide range of}} endogenous (biotic) and exogenous (abiotic) factors experienced before, during, or after cold exposure. In fact, every hierarchical level from inter-species to inter-individuals shows a high plasticity in the response to cold exposure. Mortality represents the ultimate level of a range of sub-lethal perturbations accumulating during chilling. Even if individuals remain alive after <b>cold</b> <b>storage,</b> a reduction of several fitness-related traits may be observed directly, later in development or even in the next generation. The present review focuses on <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> of insect parasitoids. We first consider the genotypic-based plasticity in <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> tolerance and the complex network of endogenous and exogenous factors affecting the phenotypic plasticity in <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> tolerance.
