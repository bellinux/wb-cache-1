5000|$|Another {{plan was}} {{to emerge in the}} 1950s when Bradford Corporation members {{discussed}} a circular rail service through Bradford using a new tunnel. This would see a train leaving Forster Square and calling at Manningham, Frizinghall, Shipley, Thackley, Idle, Eccleshill, Laisterdyke, St Dunstan's, Bradford Exchange and back into Forster Square (and vice versa). This would utilise the closed Shipley and Windhill Line. The underground tunnel was eventually rejected as the height difference between Exchange and Forster Square of 70 ft made the gradient unacceptable. [...] By the late 1950s and early 1960s many of the Victorian buildings in central Bradford were demolished {{to make way for the}} urban vision of the then Bradford city engineer Stanley Wardley. [...] Although the land between the two stations was cleared to make way for new office blocks and an urban ring road, the plans did not include a <b>cross</b> <b>rail</b> link. A slightly different vision did emerge in the 1970s when the Victorian Bradford Exchange station was demolished and a new integrated Bradford Interchange rail and bus station was built to the south of Bridge Street.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} Value Engineering process {{developed in}} North America {{in the late}} 1940 ‟s, was primarily based on functional analysis. However; the North American Value Engineering process was not adopted in Europe. Instead various mixed methods were assembled under the umbrella term of Value Management. Nowadays there is much debate about what Value Engineering is {{and how is it}} defined? This question arises in part due to there being no standard approach in Europe as a whole in undertaking ValueManagement or Value Engineering exercises. With this in mind, Masters level research was undertaken from three perspectives (theory, case study and industry). The research revealed in consistencies between the theoretical perspective and the two other perspectives. To address these inconsistencies; it is proposed that perhaps, it is now time to revert to the original North American Value Engineering process of function analysis, with the addition of the constraints triangle (time, cost, quality). Perhaps this is the best starting point in developing as standard approach to the Value Engineering process in Europe. To understand if these inconsistencies are Europe wide or unique to the Irish market, the author intends to undertake PhD research with his present employer Ferrovial Agroman, on a <b>Cross</b> <b>Rail</b> contract in the UK...|$|E
40|$|Closed access. This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Special Interest Publication, Infrastructure Risk and Resilience [© The Institution of Engineering and Technology]During the next decade, railway stations in England will be impacted by the billions of pounds being invested in current projects such as High Speed 2, <b>Cross</b> <b>Rail</b> and new refurbishment schemes to modernise and develop rail infrastructure. Railway stations are highly networked and open locations that are often crowded, which makes them particularly vulnerable to security threats. Hence, there is a clear need to identify the range of stakeholders and policies that influence the resilience of railway stations to security threats, and to understand the challenges that are inherent in addressing the legislative and operational requirements of their design. As part of an on-going research project, a state-of-the-art literature review, stakeholder analysis and mapping and interviews with key stakeholders have established critical implications for the future resilience of railway stations. Findings reveal that there is a multiplicity of stakeholders responsible for the complex operational and legal frameworks affecting major railway stations. Regardless of the interdependencies between stakeholders and their intersecting individual operational regulations and legislative requirements, there is a distinct lack of a coherent consistent and collective approach to resilience, with issues being dealt with by separate stakeholders and policies. This paper provides a current and innovative contribution to aid the understanding of the complex and interconnected forms of relationships which exemplify the station. The diverse range of stakeholders will gain an increased knowledge and appreciation of the necessity for a collaborative and integrated strategy, which is essential in both addressing the design and operation of the railway station. The findings advocate changes in institutional practices, so these interconnections are addressed now to ensure the effective assimilation of strategies are cohesive and which safeguard the resilience of railway stations for future generations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Now a days as the {{industries}} are developing rapidly, man power reduces gradually in industries. In olden days almost all industries uses conventional machines for manufacturing processes. In conventional machining processes, the time consumption is very high, labour cost {{is high and}} which increases the manufacturing cost of the product. The accuracy is also not achieved as per the design requirements. To overcome all these difficulties, {{the industries}} are made automated through some devices such as electronic components, pneumatic device electrical equipments etc. For producing economically better quality products with high productivity, accuracy and quality, the conventional machine tools are being replaced gradually by the automated machine tool devices. Automation of the machines are made with help of Pneumatic device, Sensors, Mechatronics, and PLCs etc. Here the efforts are made to develop a electro pneumatic circuit for a shaping operations using a shaper machine. This makes the operations semi automatic producing shaping operations by a single point cutting tool. The three movements of the shaper are a) The reciprocating movement of the ram. b) The Crosswise movement of the tool lead across the <b>cross</b> <b>rail.</b> c) The vertical up and down movement of the table. The above movements are being automated using electropneumatic components such as pneumatic cylinders, direction control valves, flow control valves and other electrical and electronics devices. For automation of the shaper, an electropneumatic circuit is developed {{with the help of}} sensors, solenoids, electrical and electronic devices. The electro pneumatic circuit developed is simulated, executed and will be interfaced with PLCs, L 10 /L 20 manufactured by BOSCH – REXROTH Germany. A prototype of the set up is also planned for better understanding and demonstration purpose.
