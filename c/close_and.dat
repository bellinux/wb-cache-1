5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels <b>close</b> <b>and</b> calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels <b>close</b> <b>and</b> potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels <b>close</b> <b>and</b> the process may begin again.|$|E
5|$|A public {{hall was}} built on part of the Manor Farm site in 1965 and named Winston Churchill Hall. The land upon which it was built had been Barn <b>Close</b> <b>and</b> was bought by Councillor T. R. Parker in 1932 from King's College. He {{presented}} the land to the Ruislip Village Trust {{as the site of}} a future public hall and the Trust gave it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would be the sole use.|$|E

30|$|By Lemmas 2.4 and 2.8 we obtain that SGEP(F_ 1,φ_ 1,F_ 2,φ_ 2) and _i= 1 ^∞F(S_i) are <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex subsets of C. Hence Γ is a <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex {{subset of}} C. It follows by Lemma  2.5 that C_n+ 1 is <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex for each n∈N.|$|R
30|$|Clearly, K_ 1 =K is <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex. Assume K_n is <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex {{for some}} n≥ 1. It {{is easy to}} see that K_n+ 1 ={v∈ K _n: 2 〈 v, Ju_n-Jz_n〉≤ u_n - z_n +ω _n}. Consequently, it is <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex. Hence, Step  1 is completed.|$|R

The following day, Goebbels and his wife committed suicide, after poisoning their six children with cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Due to both Mamie and Nelson, {{widespread}} flooding {{was reported}} {{across much of}} northern China, with 19rivers overflowing.

Moreover, about 8,000homes were flooded and 120,000houses received damage Nearly 1million people were directly affected by the typhoon. The typhoon killed more than 120,000animals and sank more than 200boats. Overall, 17fatalities occurred and 165were injured. Losses totaled $172million (1985USD).|$|E

5|$|In the pre-Islamic {{period on}} the island of Java, Shaivism and Buddhism were {{considered}} very <b>close</b> <b>and</b> allied religions, though not identical religions.

5|$|More of a {{traditional}} rivalry due to {{the large amount of}} Kiwi internationals Melbourne has fielded in their history.

These two sides played an annual ANZAC Day clash each year between 2009–2014. For 2015 it was played earlier in April before moving back to ANZAC Day for 2016.|$|E

30|$|By {{the same}} {{argument}} as in the proof of [[43], Lemma 2.4], one can show that F(T) ∩ F(S) is <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex.

Consequently, ΠΩ is well defined.|$|R
