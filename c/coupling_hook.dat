50|$|The {{sets were}} formed from three basic types of car: motor car, kitchen car and parlour car. The cars were {{permanently}} coupled and hermetically sealed for {{maintenance of the}} air-conditioning settings. The sets were symmetrical with a motor car at each end, and two kitchen cars serving their respective halves of the train. In an emergency, the buffers {{on the front of}} the sets were used in conjunction with a normally concealed <b>coupling</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{loop line}} was {{required}} to maintain the correct direction of rolling stock coupling hooks. Prior {{to the construction of}} the loop teams of men were required to change the direction of all hooks on through travelling wagons over the Wairarapa Line, and this was done at Masterton or Woodville depending on the period. The <b>coupling</b> <b>hook</b> direction anomaly was caused by the fact the Wellington - Palmerston North - Woodville - Wellington line is an enormous balloon loop in its own right.|$|E
50|$|In later years, Thomas' rear {{buffer beam}} has {{returned}} to the original higher position, although it is deeper to allow the buffers, <b>coupling</b> <b>hook,</b> and vacuum brake hoses to be in the correct position. Thomas also carries an electric light on the right-hand side of his front buffer beam and a red tail light mounted on the centre of his bunker, whereas the originals had removable kerosene lamps mounted on lamp irons, which Thomas incidentally has, although they are not used but instead included for continuity with the other engines.|$|E

50|$|The {{chain brake}} was {{operated}} by a 5/8 in link chain, which was carried on sheaves underneath the train along the centre, connected by <b>coupling</b> <b>hooks</b> between carriages or trucks. Under each vehicle, the chain hanged slack while not in use. It passed under two pulleys which were attached to pulling-rods to operate the wooden brake blocks. To operate the brakes, the chain could be tightened from {{either end of the}} train. The guard's van could be used to retard a train on down grades, or to stop the entire train. In the event of a broken or disconnected chain, however, the brake system was useless. By c. 1876, a simple vacuum brake system was introduced as a reserve brake.|$|R
25|$|In British 00 scale (similar to H0 scale) models the 'tension lock' coupler {{developed}} by Tri-ang is standard. This {{is similar in}} operation to the meatchopper type of coupling. Remote uncoupling is possible by using a sprung ramp between the rails. The design of the hooks is such that the couplings will not uncouple when under tension (instead depressing the ramp). When the train is pushed over the ramp, it will lift the <b>coupling</b> <b>hooks</b> as the train passes over. By halting the train over the ramp, it is split at this point. While it works well, it is often seen as ugly and obtrusive (although smaller designs are available, these are not always fully compatible with other models) and many British modellers prefer to retrofit either Kadee types or working hook and chain couplings.|$|R
40|$|Samples {{from the}} scarcely-studied {{sedimentary}} seabed from the Isla del Coco (Costa Rica) yielded {{a single species}} of Ta-naidacea, belonging to a new genus of Leptocheliidae, Cocotanais.

Other distinct characters of the males are a triangular cephalothorax, a three-articled antennular peduncle and swollen bases of pereopods 4 – 6. Females have a four-articled antennule, a maxilliped endite with three distal flat spines and two inner <b>coupling</b> <b>hooks,</b> and a maxilliped basis with two long setae.

Kyle confronts the two men and forces them to get a rapid HIV test at a nearby testing van. The results come back negative and he shows them to Sebastian, who is relieved, but still distant. Joey and Langston still can't talk to Junot and Savannah, who then take it upon themselves to make the first move.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} {{couplers}} is to join rail cars or locomotives {{to each other}} so they all are securely linked together. Major Eli Janney, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War, invented the semi-automatic knuckle coupler in 1868. It automatically locks the couplers on cars or locomotives together without a rail worker having to get between the cars, and replaced the [...] "link and pin" [...] coupler, which was {{a major cause of}} injuries to railroad workers. The locking pin that ensures Janney couplers remain fastened together is withdrawn manually by a worker using the [...] "cut lever", which is operated from either side of the railroad car and does not require the person to go between the cars. The only time the worker has to go between cars is after they have been securely <b>coupled,</b> to <b>hook</b> up the air lines for the pneumatic brakes, and the head-end power cables in the case of passenger cars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} for their eighth studio album, Gold Plated, which {{was named after}} Pete Haycock's Veleno guitar and produced by Mike Vernon. The song was specifically written and produced after {{the manager of the}} band, Miles Copeland III, demanded that the band append a radio-friendly song to the track listing. The band at the time had released eight albums and although that had translated into fame, they did not have a great impact on the charts. Copeland suggested a cover version of an Elvis Presley song; this suggestion was ignored, and instead the band came up with an original composition [...] "from absolutely nowhere". It was simply a case of sitting in the studio, conjuring up a rhythm, appending the traditional dual vocals for which Climax Blues Band were known for, and coming up with a <b>couple</b> of <b>hooks.</b> The sudden emergence of the song irritated the producer, as he thought the band had been withholding a hit from him.|$|R

At last he thought of the closet, and walked up to it. It was of no use a little man like Nathaniel Pipkin pulling the door inwards, when a great strong fellow like old Lobbs was pulling it outwards. Old Lobbs gave it one tug, and open it flew, disclosing Nathaniel Pipkin standing bolt upright inside, and shaking with apprehension from head to foot.
