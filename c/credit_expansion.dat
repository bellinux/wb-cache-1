The spectacular crash of 1929 followed five years of reckless <b>credit</b> <b>expansion</b> by the Federal Reserve System under the Coolidge Administration. The passing of the Sixteenth Amendment, the passage of The Federal Reserve Act, rising government deficits, the [...] passage of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act, and the Revenue Act of 1932, exacerbated the crisis, prolonging it.|$|E
2500|$|Ludwig von Mises {{wrote in}} the 1930s: [...] "Credit {{expansion}} cannot increase the supply of real goods. It merely brings about a rearrangement. It diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed {{by the state of}} economic wealth and market conditions. It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods. As a result, the upswing lacks a solid base. It is not a real prosperity. It is illusory prosperity. It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth, i.e. the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment. Rather, it arose because the <b>credit</b> <b>expansion</b> created the illusion of such an increase. Sooner or later, it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the War of 1812, Raguet was {{a leading}} inflationist, {{supporting}} deliberate inflation through increasing the available supply of currency and credit. However, his position changed after the Panic of 1819. The Panic also converted Raguet from a protectionist to a leading promoter of free trade. While a state senator, Raguet sent a questionnaire to legislators and prominent citizens in each county of the state {{to determine the extent of}} the depression. One of the questions was [...] "Do you consider that the advantages of the banking system outweigh its evils?" [...] Sixteen out of nineteen counties answered in the negative. Raguet concluded that the depression was a result of bank <b>credit</b> <b>expansion</b> and the subsequent contraction as physical money was drained from the bank's vaults. He promoted restrictions on banks and of granting bank charters.|$|E

We revisit that result with a new dataset from developed and developing countries that decomposes private credit into household credit and enterprise credit. We argue that household credit growth raises debt levels without much effect on long-term income. Rapid household <b>credit</b> <b>expansions</b> generate vulnerabilities that can precipitate a banking crisis. Enterprise <b>credit</b> <b>expansions</b> can have the same effects but it is tempered by the associated increase in income. Our estimates show that household <b>credit</b> <b>expansions</b> have been a statistically and economically significant predictor of banking crises. Enterprise <b>credit</b> <b>expansions</b> are also associated with banking crises but their effect is weaker and less robust. Banking crisis Household and business credit growth...|$|R

2500|$|Hayek's {{principal}} {{investigations in}} economics concerned capital, money, {{and the business}} cycle. Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility {{to the value of}} money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for [...] "industrial fluctuations" [...] based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work {{as a starting point for}} his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the [...] "Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary <b>credit</b> <b>expansion</b> and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that [...] "the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process".|$|E

Based on a standard VAR model of monetary policy extended to include measures of financial instability and <b>credit</b> <b>expansions,</b> we examine the interaction between monetary policy and financial stability.

As the effects from price shocks are strong and persistent compared to other shocks, our conclusion is that we cannot reject that price stability and financial stability are mutually consistent goals for monetary policy.

In MAPMOD, bank loans create purchasing power that facilitates adjustments in the real economy.

50|$|Government {{efforts to}} take over the <b>credit</b> <b>expansion</b> also proved ephemeral {{in the early years of}} the transition. Domestic credit {{increased}} about nine times between the end of 1991 and 1992. The <b>credit</b> <b>expansion</b> was caused in part by the buildup of interenterprise arrears and the RCB's subsequent financing of those arrears. The Government restricted financing to state enterprises after it lifted controls on prices in January 1992, but enterprises faced cash shortages because the decontrol of prices cut demand for their products. Instead of curtailing production, most firms chose to build up inventories. To support continued production under these circumstances, enterprises relied on loans from other enterprises. By mid-1992, when the amount of unpaid interenterprise loans had reached 3.2 trillion rubles (about US$20 billion), the government froze interenterprise debts. Shortly thereafter, the government provided 181 billion rubles (about US$1.1 billion) in credits to enterprises that were still holding debt.|$|E
40|$|Expanding credit {{access is}} a key {{ingredient}} of development strategies worldwide. Microfinance practitioners, policymakers, and donors have ambitious goals for expanding access, and seek efficient methods for implementing and evaluating expansion. There is less consensus {{on the role of}} consumer <b>credit</b> in <b>expansion</b> initiatives. Some microfinance institutions are moving beyond entrepreneurial credit and offering consumer loans. But many practitioners and policymakers are skeptical about “unproductive ” lending. These concerns are fueled by academic work highlighting behavioral biases that may induce consumers to overborrow. A South African lender relaxed its risk assessment criteria by randomly approving some marginal applications that normally would have been rejected. We then estimate the resulting impacts using survey data on borrower behavior and well-being, and administrative data on loan repayment. We find that marginal loans produced measurable benefits in the form of increased employment, reduced hunger, and reduced poverty. We also find that the marginal loans were profitable for the lender.

Borio and Lowe (2002) answer this question in the affirmative for a sample of 34 countries, but the question is surprisingly difficult to answer for individual developed countries that have faced very few, if any, financial crises in the past. To circumvent this problem, we focus on financial stress and ask whether credit and asset price movements can help predict it. To measure financial stress, we use the Financial Stress Index (FSI) developed by Illing and Liu (2006). Other innovations include the estimation and forecasting using both linear and endogenous threshold models, and a wide range of asset prices (stock and housing prices, for example).
