25|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} to localize individual poems by studying the geography, flora, and fauna to which they refer. This approach usually does not yield firm results. For example, there are no wolves in Iceland, but we <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that Icelandic poets {{were familiar with the}} species. Similarly, the apocalyptic descriptions of Völuspá have been taken as evidence that the poet who composed it had seen a volcanic eruption in Iceland - but this is hardly certain.|$|E
25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders with his eyes closed, {{leaning back in his}} chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing that is going on around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that Wolfe is working.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} account written in early 1862, Ward {{and his brother}} arrived in Shanghai, China in 1860 {{for the purpose of}} trading, perhaps as an extension of their father's New York office. This may be true, but given Ward's activities in the 1850s it is almost certain that Ward had ulterior motives for his return. We <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> he had little respect for the Shanghai business practices, which he dismissed as “lying, swindling and smuggling”. Their arrival coincided with a buildup of Taiping forces in the area.|$|E
25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it.

25|$|Another {{institutional}} {{factor that}} may have an important effect is proportionality, i.e., how closely the legislature reflects {{the views of the}} populace. Under a pure proportional representation system the composition of the legislature is fully proportional to the votes of the populace and a voter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that he will be represented in parliament, even if only from the opposition benches. (However many nations that utilise a form of proportional representation in elections depart from pure proportionality by stipulating that smaller parties are not supported by a certain threshold percentage of votes cast will be excluded from parliament.) By contrast, a voting system based on single seat constituencies (such as the plurality system used in North American, the UK and India) will tend to result in many non-competitive electoral districts, in which the outcome is seen by voters as a foregone conclusion.|$|E

He {{explains}} to Ramsay that Jon Snow has been letting Wildlings through the Wall and fears {{that they will}} make their way south. When Ramsay asks why the Umbers have not already sworn fealty, Smalljon expresses his dislike for Roose Bolton and declares that was why Ramsay killed him, despite Ramsay's false insistence that Roose was poisoned. Ramsay offers assistance if Smalljon will swear to him as Warden of the North but he refuses, citing Roose's betrayal of his oath to Robb Stark. Instead, Smalljon demonstrates his loyalty by presenting Ramsay with [...] "a gift", two hooded figures who are revealed to be Rickon Stark and Osha. When Ramsay asks him how he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that the boy is Rickon Stark, Smalljon presents him with the severed head of Rickon's direwolf Shaggydog.|$|E

500|$|It was {{therefore}} no surprise when closure notices were posted in March 1961. The {{last day of}} regular services was Saturday 10 June 1961 when a pair of C class 0-6-0's replaced the usual H class tanks. The event was recorded by a BBC cameraman who filmed the 09:07 departure from Paddock Wood. The Tonbridge crew had chalked on the cabside of the engine [...] "Shed no tears for the single track, for perhaps we may come back. And if we do, you <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> we'll see you all again once more." [...] Later in the day the trains were lengthened {{with the addition of}} former LSWR push-pull set No. 656 and a Maunsell corridor coach.

The daughter of bandleader Jack Payne was on-hand to toast the final departure.|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy {{for a glass of}} water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> to know me tomorrow at St. Georges."

Clark Green (Clark Duke) feels he {{is ready for the}} position, citing his key role in various sales, but Dwight wants someone who he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> will not team up with Pam against him. To that end, he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends, including his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), best friend Rolf (James Urbaniak), part-time private investigator Trevor (Chris Gethard), former Corporate executive Troy Undercook (Noel Petok), and his karate teacher Sensei Ira (Lance Krall). To Dwight's horror, though, none of his candidates are competent enough to even make it through the full job interview, much less be paper salesmen. Clark ends his interview after answering Dwight's complicated questions perfectly, pointing out that he {{has no choice but to}} hire him if he wants someone who can do the job.|$|E

500|$|Soon after, in May 1924, {{the club}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour, beginning with an ill-tempered match against Czechoslovakian side Sparta Prague. The match was an intensely physical encounter with Cardiff accusing their opposition of dirty tactics. As the teams left the pitch {{at the end of}} the first-half, a furious Keenor, upset at the nature of some tackles he had received, yelled at the Prague players [...] "If I get anymore kicks on the shin I shall be chopping someone off at the knee". In the second-half, Cardiff players found themselves being physically assaulted by members of the crowd, who aimed kicks and punches at the players, when they approached the sidelines to take throw-ins and corner-kicks, going on to lose the match 3–2. They later played matches against First Vienna in Austria and Borussia Dortmund and Hamburger SV in Germany. The following season, the side reached the final of the 1924–25 FA Cup where they suffered a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United, who claimed their fifth FA Cup win, following a goal from Fred Tunstall. After the Final, Keenor stated: [...] "Just because we lost in our very first Cup Final, I don't think there is any cause to get down in the mouth. I can say here and now that one day soon our followers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that Cardiff City will bring that cup to Wales." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote, [...] "This {{version of}} The Mummy has no pretenses to be {{anything}} other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think Raiders of the Lost Ark with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think Night of the Living Dead stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy grafted onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope road picture (The Road to Hamunaptra?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof." [...] Publications like The Austin Chronicle and Dallas Observer {{came to the conclusion that}} despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion; talking about the special effects, the Observer lamented [...] "If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy." [...] Other publications such as Jump Cut felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to The Mummy; [...] "The mummy", Ernest Larson wrote for the Jump Cut, [...] "is standard-issue I.L.". Kim Newman of the British Film Institute judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic. USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was [...] "not free of stereotypes", a sentiment with which the BFI concurred. [...] "If someone complains of a foul odor, you <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene.
