5|$|The {{expressway}} crosses Taylor-Massey Creek and the East Don River, and <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> of the valley, swinging northwards toward Eglinton Avenue. In this section, the DVP passes {{around the}} apartment buildings of Flemingdon Park. The lanes split again before the underpass at Spanbridge Road, {{the road that}} connects a three-tower complex of apartments {{to the east of}} the parkway with Flemingdon Park to the west. The lanes pass beneath the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange.|$|E

5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect <b>climbs</b> <b>out,</b> and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E

5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> of the elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the community, NY75 intersects Langford Road, {{designated}} as NY249 west of the junction and County Route39 (CR39) east of NY75. Past NY249, the route exits Langford and heads across another stretch of fields and farms toward the Eden town line. NY75 breaks from its due north routing just south of it, taking on a more westerly heading to avoid a valley surrounding the south branch of Eighteenmile Creek. It ultimately enters the valley, however, winding its way northward down the depression's southwestern side to reach the creek floor. From here, NY75 follows the base of the valley to the northwest for , serving a handful of homes situated along the forested creekside. The route eventually <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> of the gully and heads due north for a short distance across more fields to a junction with US62.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E

5|$|At Gunnison, US-89 turns east before curving {{northeast}} {{into the}} Sanpete Valley, {{formed by the}} San Pitch River, {{a tributary of the}} Sevier River. Along US-89 in this valley are several small cities: Manti, Ephraim, Mount Pleasant, and Fairview. Between Ephraim and Mount Pleasant, US-89 meets the south end of SR-132 at Pigeon Hollow Junction. SR-132 was formerly US-189, connecting US-89 with US-91 in Nephi. Beyond Fairview, where the scenic SR-31 turns east, US-89 <b>climbs</b> <b>out</b> of the valley, reaching a summit at Hill Top (elevation 6400 feet/2000 m). Thistle Creek parallels the next leg of the highway, descending through a canyon to the junction with US-6 near the ghost town of Thistle, flooded by a landslide in 1983. Thistle Creek and Soldier Creek, paralleled by US-89 and US-6, merge near this junction to form Spanish Fork, which the overlapped routes follow northwest through Spanish Fork Canyon into the Utah Valley at Moark Junction. US-89 splits to the north from US-6 there, skirts the west edge of Mapleton, and merges with SR-51 - the old Arrowhead Trail (US-91) - south of downtown Springville.|$|E
5|$|At {{the nursing}} home, the leprechaun {{pretends to be}} O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton <b>climbs</b> <b>out.</b> Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E
