40|$|Four {{different}} label-free, minimally invasive, live {{single cell}} analysis techniques were applied in a quantitative comparison, to characterize {{embryonic stem cells}} and the hepatocytes into which they were differentiated. Atomic force microscopy measures the cell's mechanical properties, Raman spectroscopy measures its chemical properties, and dielectrophoresis measures the membrane's capacitance. They were able to assign cell type of individual cells with accuracies of 91 % (atomic force microscopy), 95. 5 % (Raman spectroscopy), and 72 % (dielectrophoresis).

SPARE-AD was first established as a highly sensitive and specific MRI-marker of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) subjects (AUC =  0. 98). Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE ε 4 provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17. 8 (last vs. first quartile). In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of Aβ 1 – 42, t-tau, and p-tau 181 p to the previous model did not improve predictive value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in <b>combination</b> <b>offer</b> the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade an {{hypothesis}} has been developed linking certain chemicals (natural and synthetic) to observed and sus-pected adverse effects on reproduction in both wildlife and humans. The issue of ‘endocrine disruption ’ originally focused on che-micals that mimic {{the action of the}} natural hormone oestrogen. However, the concern is now encompassing effects on the whole endocrine system. In response to public awareness, regulatory agencies (including the US EPA) and the OECD are formulating potential testing strategies and have begun the process of validating defined tests to systematically assess chemicals for their endo-crine-disrupting activities. In order to investigate chemicals that have the potential to cause endocrine disruption, a large number of in vitro and in vivo assays have been identified. In vitro test systems (particularly when used in <b>combination)</b> <b>offer</b> the possibility of providing an early screen for large numbers of chemicals and can be useful in characterising the mechanism of action and potency.

Alterations {{in the catalytic}} activity of CYP 1 B 1 and COMT enzymes have been found associated with altered breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women in many populations. The substitution of leucine (Leu) to valine (Val) at codon 432 increases the catalytic activity of CYP 1 B 1, however, substitution of Val to methionine (Met) at codon 158 decreases the catalytic activity of COMT. The present study was performed to evaluate the associations of CYP 1 B 1 Leu 432 Val and/or COMT Val 158 Met polymorphisms with total, premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risks in Indian women. COMT and CYP 1 B 1 polymorphisms in controls and breast cancer patients were analyzed employing polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) followed by gel electrophoresis. Although CYP 1 B 1 and COMT genotypes did not exhibit statistically significant association with breast cancer risks when analyzed individually, COMT wild type (Val 158 Val) in combination with CYP 1 B 1 heterozygous variant (Leu 432 Val) [OR: 0. 21; 95 % CI (0. 05 – 0. 82), p value; 0. 021] and COMT heterozygous variant (Val 158 Met) in combination with CYP 1 B 1 wild type (Leu 432 Leu) [OR: 0. 29; 95 % CI (0. 08 – 0. 96), p value; 0. 042] showed significant protective association with premenopausal breast cancer risk.

40|$|The recent boom in {{shale gas}} {{development}} in the Marcellus Shale has increased interest in the methods to distinguish between naturally occurring methane in groundwater and stray methane associated with drilling and production operations. This study evaluates the relationship between natural methane occurrence and three principal environmental factors (groundwater redox state, water type, and topography) using two pre-drill datasets of 132 samples from western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia and 1417 samples from northeastern Pennsylvania. Higher natural methane concentrations in residential wells are strongly associated with reducing conditions characterized by low nitrate and low sulfate ([NO 3 −][*]<[*] 0. 5 [*]mg/L; [SO 42 −] [*]<[*] 2. 5 [*]mg/L). However, no significant relationship exists between methane and iron [Fe(II) ], which is traditionally considered an indicator of conditions that have progressed through iron reduction. As shown in previous studies, water type is significantly correlated with natural methane concentrations, where sodium (Na) -rich waters exhibit significantly higher (p< 0. 001) natural methane concentrations than calcium (Ca) -rich waters. For water wells exhibiting Na-rich waters and/or low nitrate and low sulfate conditions, valley locations are associated with higher methane concentrations than upland topography. Consequently, we identify three factors (“Low NO 3 − & SO 42 −” redox condition, Na-rich water type, and valley location), which, in <b>combination,</b> <b>offer</b> strong predictive power regarding the natural occurrence of high methane concentrations. Samples exhibiting these three factors have a median methane concentration of 10, 000 [*]µg/L. These heuristic relationships may facilitate the design of pre-drill monitoring programs and the subsequent evaluation of post-drill monitoring results to help distinguish between naturally occurring methane and methane originating from anthropogenic sources or migration pathways...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} of memory and decision making in relative and retrospective judgment. Theories of memory and decision making are often rigorously tested {{using a variety of}} data sets, and the resulting theories can be applied to a large selection of psychological phenomena. In Chapter 1 I argue that theoretical development in relative and retrospective judgment is in contrast often very specialized. Theories of relative and retrospective judgment cannot easily be applied to other memory and decision making phenomena. Another approach is to take broad models or principles from the wider literature and apply them to relative and retrospective judgment. I suggest that the SIMPLE model of memory (Brown, Neath, & Chater, 2007) and the decision by sampling model (DbS; Stewart, Chater, & Brown, 2006) can in <b>combination</b> <b>offer</b> a comprehensive and unifying account of relative judgment. In Chapter 2 I find that both relative and retrospective judgments are consistent with range-frequency theory. I also find evidence for range effects which are inconsistent with decision by sampling. Chapter 3 investigates the role of similarity in these relative judgments using the distance based sampling model (Qian & Brown, 2005). The results show no evidence for distance based sampling. A combined SIMPLE and DbS model (SDbS) is applied to data from previous studies in Chapter 4. SDbS and range-frequency theory can account for the data – including range effects - equally well. In Chapter 5 I use an incentivized free recall task to elicit atypical serial position curves in three experiments. SIMPLE is shown to be able to fit the effect of output position which appears important in decision making behavior. Overall, this thesis suggests that SDbS is a candidate model for unifying retrospective and relative judgment with the wider memory and decision making literature...|$|E
40|$|When a {{collection}} exceeds a certain size {{there will be}} a need for tools to help organise and manage it. Collection management software is one such tool. Collectors of mainstream collectibles, such as coins and books, usually have access to multiple software of this type. However, due to the great variations in what people tend to collect there is an abundance of collecting areas. Most of these areas are small and therefore not the focus of software developers. As a consequence, few or no tools are tailored to managing these more uncommon types of collectibles. A generic Collection Engine might solve this gap. Such a framework will offer a powerful foundation for developing tools able to represent all types of collectibles, {{and at the same time}} be tailored towards the collection or collections in question. Such a solution will also support different types of combined collections. This master report describes an attempt to develop a Collection Engine. The success of the resulting Collection Engine is mainly due to a parameterised and generic database model at its base. This database model emerges around a set of generic terms abstracted from typical collectible properties. Several structures make it flexible enough to store all major aspects of any collectible. The database model will accomodate itself to changes in the represented problem domain.

40|$|Our group {{recently}} discovered {{and developed a}} diastereoselective reaction yielding C 3 -quaternary indolenines from the combination of ?,?-unsaturated N-aryl ketonitrones and mono- or di-activated alkynes in toluene at 80 ?C. This reaction builds {{a high level of}} complexity in a single step, and the C 3 -quaternary indolenines produced show promise as precursors to indole-containing molecules of biological and medicinal interest. However, we found our substrate scope was limited by the methods available for the synthesis of the ?,?-unsaturated N-aryl ketonitrones necessary for the reaction. As a result of this need, we sought to develop a new way to access these ?,?-unsaturated N-aryl ketonitrones. Our priorities were to develop a method that was expedient with regard to time and number of steps, modular, general, and could rely on inexpensive commercially available starting materials. The method that we have reported proceeds in three steps: starting with a commercially available aniline derivative and ?,?-unsaturated aldehyde an imine is synthesized and alkylated using an organolithium reagent. The resultant secondary amine is then oxidized using Oxone? to obtain the ?,?-unsaturated N-aryl ketonitrone. Only the nitrone is subject to a discrete purification step, and it can generally be isolated in yields of 50 - 80 %. Unfortunately, the nitrones generated using this technique would not react with activated alkynes to yield indolenines. The two techniques discussed herein offer valuable insight into a poorly understood area of nitrone reactivity and are both synthetically useful in their own right. The studies performed make it clear that nitrones are a very viable synthetic intermediate; many nitrones can be easily accessed and then used to create very complex molecules in a diastereoselective manner. Both of these synthetic techniques in <b>combination</b> <b>offer</b> a valuable alternative approach to many complex and biologically interesting indole containing alkaloids. It is hoped that this work will serve as fertile ground for further studies towards increasing the utility of this chemistry...|$|E

In the last few decades, continuous progress in analytical methodology has been achieved with substantial {{increase in the number}} of new, more specific and more sensitive methods for drug-protein adducts. The methods used for drug-protein adduct studies include those for separation and for subsequent detection and identification. Various chromatographic (e. g., affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography) and electrophoretic techniques [e. g., sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and capillary electrophoresis], used alone or in <b>combination,</b> <b>offer</b> an opportunity to purify proteins adducted by reactive drug metabolites. Conventionally, mass spectrometric (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance, and immunological and radioisotope methods are used to detect and identify protein targets for reactive drug metabolites. However, these methods are labor-intensive, and have provided very limited sequence information on the target proteins adducted, and thus the identities of the protein targets are usually unknown. Moreover, the antibody-based methods are limited by the availability, quality, and specificity of antibodies to protein adducts, which greatly hindered the identification of specific protein targets of drugs and their clinical applications. Recently, the use of powerful MS technologies (e. g., matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight) together with analytical proteomics have enabled one to separate, identify unknown protein adducts, and establish the sequence context of specific adducts by offering the opportunity to search for adducts in proteomes containing a large number of proteins with protein adducts and unmodified proteins. The present review highlights the separation and detection technologies for drug-protein adducts, with an emphasis on methodology, advantages and limitations to these techniques. Furthermore, a brief discussion of the application of these techniques to individual drugs and their target proteins will be outlined...|$|E
40|$|In {{this essay}} and the {{contributions}} that follow, we advocate {{an expansion of}} the parameters of mainstream healthcare law to include feminist analyses of embodiment. We suggest that a more thorough engagement with the meaning and value of embodiment can better inform normative assessment and critical appraisal in healthcare law. Law's conventional approach to regulating bodily interventions has been to consider the body as an object of analysis rather than as a category of analysis. In our view, legal analysis could offer a richer understanding of law's engagement with bodies and bodily materials if it adopted a thicker conception of embodiment. Such a conception would seek to account for the ways in which we value the living physical body as it enables our being in the world and our interactions with others. We argue that in framing our understandings of embodiment, healthcare law would benefit from employing cultural studies methods, as well as the bioethical analysis on which it has traditionally drawn. In particular, we view feminist scholarship on embodiment as a key resource for thinking through such a shift in parameters and methodology. Building on this work, we argue for a shift from more familiar notions of sexual difference to embodied differences. This would direct attention to the myriad ways in which law values or denigrates bodies and the choices we make about our bodies. We suggest that healthcare law has implicitly considered the body in three key ways—as an object of choice, a site of property and a source of vitality. We then argue that a more explicit conception of legal embodiment entails four key dimensions—subjective, intersubjective, material and symbolic—which in <b>combination</b> <b>offer</b> a normative and critical framework 1 for deciding which values act as trumps in a given situation and for assessing how and why a particular value or combination of values come to be perceived as important in a given moment...|$|E
