40|$|Abstract It is an {{emerging}} phenomenon that the leading multinational companies are studying {{how to use}} the engagement experiences of customers and communities as the foundation of value co-creation. To achieve this, the business leaders have increasingly adopted an ecological organizational <b>form,</b> namely <b>business</b> ecosystem. Google, Amazon and Microsoft are the real world examples and pioneers in this field. However, in the academic research, it is addressed by a number of researchers that there is significant lack of empirical studies that examines the emergence and formation of business ecosystem, especially in ICT industry. In essence, this study takes Cloud as the context to develop concepts on the emergence of business ecosystem and examine the manifestation of such evolution in the emerging business field. Through extensive literature reviews and empirical interviews, the current study developed answers to the research question, “How do new business ecosystems emerge, in the context of Cloud computing?” at qualitative level. In general, it is considered in the study that business ecosystem is a type of more advanced <b>business</b> <b>form</b> emerged recently. It has the characteristics as follow: provision of value, integration with external partners, requiring multiple participants, shifting from individual to collaborative thinking, interdependence of the participants, value co-creation, co-petition, open innovation and shared fate of success or failure. From a macro level viewpoint, the emergence of business ecosystem {{is the result of the}} <b>continuous</b> evolution of <b>business</b> <b>forms,</b> from linear type towards a more complex networked type. At a micro level, for an ecosystem to emerge in a given industry, it involves strategic design and appropriate execution. Furthermore, a set of critical elements need to be in the right place for a business ecosystem to emerge, which including: prerequisite conditions for ecosystem to emerge, external environmental and resource, shared vision, leadership of the ecosystem, common platform, mechanisms of the ecosystem, ecosystem healthiness, and IT infrastructure. The study further suggests that the emergence of business ecosystem as a new <b>business</b> <b>form</b> is not out of luck or probability. It is a natural path that under governance of the evolution forces existing in the social-economic contexts, just as the evolution of all the living creatures in the natural environment. For this broader perspective, the emergence of ecosystem is inevitable due to the social-economic and technological driving forces...|$|R

40|$|This {{project has}} two primary {{objectives}}. Both objectives will {{be achieved through}} research of current data and the creation, distribution and analysis of a <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> industry survey. The first objective was {{to draw attention to}} the growing demand for electronic substitutes for traditional printed <b>business</b> <b>forms,</b> and educate the <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> industry about the biggest threat and opportunity of these technologies, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). This was accomplished by outlining the technology and processes of EDI and describing the various benefits of EDI over traditional printed <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> systems. Such educational descriptions and analysis were necessary due to the lack of attention given to the intense growth in electronic substitutes by <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> trade publications and leaders. The second objective was to quantify the level of awareness that exists for EDI throughout the <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> industry, assess the current and future investment in and development of EDI and electronic forms software and systems by the major forms producing companies of the U. S. and identify what level of leadership has been received with regards to combating or investing in these technologies. The answers to these questions represent new information not currently in existence. A survey of <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> producers was necessary to attain much of this information. The educational information predominantly focuses on EDI instead. of the complete range of electronic substitutes for <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> due to the significant effect that this one technology has. A wide range of sources were consulted, from <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> industry reports to EDI promoters to governmental commerce statistics. This extensive literature search confirmed my earliest convictions that there is a lack of leadership and of significant educational information, at least in accessible print, about the threats and opportunities of EDI and other electronic technologies. A survey of 155 randomly selected forms producers from a population of approximately 500, netted 40 respondents. Most respondents were small producers who had experienced increases in both sales and profits in the past year. The survey shows that forms producers claim to have a fair degree of knowledge about EDI, believe that EDI will have a significant affect on the <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> industry, and EDI offers a fair degree of advantage over the traditional <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> system. Most respondents do not, however, monitor their customers use of electronic substitues for <b>business</b> <b>forms.</b> Most respondents do not invest in electronic technologies as a product or service alternative to current <b>business</b> <b>forms.</b> When asked about their desired role in providing such technologies and future participation in an EDI VAN service project, most respondents were favorable to the ideas. When asked if the forms industry leadership had done enough to educate them about electronic technology threats and opportunities, respondents definitely felt neglected and desired more information. The comments respondents wrote on the surveys were interesting but showed a general lack of understanding for what investment in new technologies really entails. Surprisingly, despite the small size of most of the firms responding to the survey and the fact that most had experienced increased profits, most expressed their feelings that they had a good understanding of EDI, EDI had significant advantages over there products and services and they are interested in investing in new technonlogies. In general it is clear, but perhaps not definitively conclusive, that hypotheses 1 and 2 are false and hypotheses 3 and 4 are true. Further questions are probed and answered in the Conclusions section. This report is an excellent pilot study but must be expanded and refined in order to formulate concrete recommendations to aid the industry...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine the {{theoretical}} arguments for and against the importance of new <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> {{for the growth of}} start-ups. Part I briefly reviews the recent history of business organisational law and reform within Europe. Our review of extant European <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> reveals that the absence of new business entities (and structural reforms) may be due to status quo bias and other network effects. Turning to the importance of new <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> for the growth of start-ups, Part II addresses the question which organisational and legal structures are favourable for the growth of start-ups. It is suggested that the introduction of an efficient organisational form for start-ups is crucial to further stimulate the development of a successful venture capital market in Europe. In Part III we give consideration to the possibility of developing new <b>business</b> <b>forms,</b> based on US mechanisms, which could lead to an increase in the level of high tech start-ups. The prospect for the emergence of new <b>business</b> <b>forms</b> depends in part on the removal of legal and non-legal barriers. The final section evaluates whether we can project a pattern of regulatory competition in the business organisation context that could prompt lawmakers to innovate by introducing new legal entities. ...|$|R
