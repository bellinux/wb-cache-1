40|$|For a <b>centered</b> <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> X in a Wiener space, {{differentiable}} in {{the sense}} of Malliavin, the functional GX is defined using operators from the Malliavin calculus applied to X. By assuming linear or quadratic bounds on GX, we are then able to derive Pearson-type tail bounds on X. Moreover, our results are in fact applicable to comparisons with tails of general distributions, subject to a good control of GX. This is done by relying on a strategy developed by I. Nourdin and G. Peccati, as we relate GX with a Stein equation relative to indicator functions. ^ We apply a similar Nourdin-Peccati analysis to derive bounds on distances between probability laws, this time using a Stein equation relative to Lipschitz functions. We do this by a careful study of the solution to the appropriate Stein equation. With this analysis, we are able to give convergence results to general distributions. ^ Finally, we specialize to convergence results for sequences in a Wiener chaos.

40|$|The Ensemble Kalman Filter is an {{efficient}} algorithm for data assimilation; {{it allows for}} an estimation of forecast and analysis error by updating the model error covariance matrices at the analysis step. This algorithm has been coupled to the CHIMERE chemical transport model in order to assimilate ozone ground measurements at the regional scale. The analyzed ozone field is evaluated using a consistent set of observations and shows a reduction of the quadratic error by about a third and an improvement of the hourly correlation coefficient despite of a low ensemble size designed for operational purposes. A classification of the European observation network {{is derived from the}} ozone temporal variability in order to qualitatively determine the observation spatial representativeness. Then, an estimation of the temporal behavior of both model and observations error variances of the assimilated stations is checked using a posteriori Desroziers diagnostics. The amplitude of the additive noise applied to the ozone fields can be diagnosed and tuned online. The evaluation of the obtained background error variance distribution through the Reduced <b>Centered</b> <b>Random</b> <b>Variable</b> standard deviation shows improved statistics. The use of the diagnostics indicates a strong diurnal cycle of both the model and the representativeness errors. Another design of the ensemble is constructed by perturbing model parameter, but does not allow creating enough variability if used solely. Finally, the overall filter performance over evaluation stations is found to be relatively unaffected by different formulations of observation and simulation errors...|$|E
