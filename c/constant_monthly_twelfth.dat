SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Recurrent ulceration rates of around 10 % are reported after PCV. Recurrence rates are, however, {{proportional to the}} duration of follow-up. Series presenting long-term follow-up are sparse in the literature. METHODS: From 1969 to 1979, 350 patients underwent elective PCV. Three hundred forty-seven accessible patients were observed prospectively at intervals of 1 to 5 years to detect recurrent ulcers. The median duration of follow-up was 140. 2 months (range 1 month- 22. 75 years). RESULTS: Seventy-six of the 347 patients (21. 9 %) developed recurrent ulcers. Calculation of the integrated ulcer recurrence rate indicates a <b>constant</b> <b>monthly</b> recurrence risk of 0. 16 %. Recurrences occurred as late as 17 3 / 4 years after operation. Eighty per cent of the recurrences occurred after 10 years of follow-up.

40|$|Drinking water {{availability}} {{is one of}} the emerging challenges of the 21 st century. Different approaches have been investigated as possible sources of water for arid regions. Atmospheric water vapor processing is a developing approach whose aim is to cool air to condensate the water available in the atmospheric moisture. Air dehumidification allows obtaining pure drinking water for geographical regions far from the sea, rivers or lakes, even if it is an expensive technology compared to desalinization. Gas compression refrigerators are effective and simple systems {{that can be used for}} water production through air dehumidification. Their performance are strictly related to the weather conditions of the installation location and are greatly affected by the operating parameters of the gas compression refrigerators. The object of this paper is to optimize the volumetric flow of the external humid air with the aim of maximize the quantity of the condensed water, in relation to the weather conditions (air temperature, pressure and humidity), as well to evaluate the energy consumption per liter of drinking produced water.

40|$|A major {{consequence}} of South Africa's strong economic growth since the democratic dispensation of 1994 is the {{rapid increase in}} domestic demand for oil energy. With small amounts of proven oil reserves, the rise in oil demand as an energy source has resulted in South Africa's growing dependence on external sources for its domestic crude oil needs. High oil prices, instability in major oil producing regions and the rise in 'oil-nationalism' are major concerns {{for the security of}} South Africa's oil supplies. Accordingly, a comprehensive understanding of oil import security risks can serve as a vital guide in formulating any energy policy framework(s) aimed at alleviating the impact of such risks. This study utilises portfolio theory and develops an empirical framework to provide quantitative measures of systematic and specific risks of South Africa's crude oil imports over the period 1994 to 2007. The paper examines the relationship between supply sources diversification and oil energy security risks, and provides an objective evaluation of different import adjustment strategies on South Africa's total crude oil import risks. The results show that a policy of having <b>constant</b> <b>monthly</b> imports from each supply region reduces the specific and systematic risks of the oil import portfolio by an average rate of 71 % and 2. 9 % respectively. Significant reduction in specific risks of South Africa's oil imports is achieved if imports from risky regions (mainly the Middle East) can be diversified to relatively less risky regions of Europe and North America.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Patients {{with left}} atrial {{isomerism}} and interrupted inferior vena cava palliated with a superior cavopulmonary connection or Kawashima procedure (KP) {{have a high}} incidence of developing pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. The necessity for hepatic vein redirection (HVR) and its timing remains a controversy. We aimed to assess the clinical outcome of patients with left atrial isomer-ism following a KP. The main end points were death, requirement for HVR and the impact of HVR on oxygen saturation. METHODS: Retrospective review of 21 patients with a diagnosis of left atrial isomerism, interruption of the inferior vena cava and single-ventricle physiology managed with a KP at a single centre between January 1990 and March 2010. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had a KP, with 12 subsequently undergoing HVR. There was relatively a <b>constant</b> <b>monthly</b> decrement in the proportion of patients who were free from death or HVR up until 60 months following the KP, with a dramatic increase in the hazard after this time. The Cox proportional hazards regression model demonstrated a reduced early risk for HVR or death in patients who underwent pulmonary artery banding versus arterial shunt as the primary procedure (hazard ratio: 0. 10; P = 0. 01), and an increased risk with bilateral superior vena cavas (SVCs) (hazard ratio: 3. 4; P = 0. 04) and age at KP (hazard ratio: 1. 02 per month increase in age at KP; P = 0. 02).

In a 2 -year study period, 11 314 faecal samples from 8302 patients with gastroenteritis were cultured with supplement of the filter method. We recovered a high {{incidence of}} Campylobacter concisus (annual incidence 35 / 100 000 inhabitants), almost as high as the common Campylobacter jejuni/coli. In contrast, there was a very low incidence of other non-thermophilic Campylobacter species, such as Campylobacter upsaliensis. Campylobacter concisus was, unlike C. jejuni/coli, found more frequently among small children (< 1 year) and the elderly (≥ 65 years). Around 10 % of the patients with C. consisus had co-infections dominated by Clostridium difficile and Salmonella enterica, whereas co-infections occurred in about 5 % of C. jejuni/coli patients. We observed a seasonal variation in C. jejuni/coli with a peak incidence in late summer months and autumn, whereas there was an almost <b>constant</b> <b>monthly</b> prevalence of C. concisus. Among patients participating in a questionnaire sub-study, there was a higher degree of close contacts with animals, especially dogs, as well as a higher travel exposure among C. jejuni/coli patients compared with C. concisus patients. We did not culture any C. concisus in stool samples from a small cohort of healthy individuals. Future studies have to focus on the clinical follow-up and the long-term risk of inflammatory bowel diseases in C. concisus-positive patients. We conclude that there is {{a high incidence of}} C. concisus in Denmark...|$|R

We examined the effect of time, age (adults vs. juveniles), gender (adult males and females), and environmental covariates (temperature, rainfall, NAO index) on survival probabilities. The modelling found a high and <b>constant</b> <b>monthly</b> survival probability (mean ± SE) estimated at 0. 96  ±  0. 01, similar between both adults and juveniles and independent of environmental conditions and gender. These findings agree with expectations from island-based life-history theory where relatively mild conditions and lack of predators should favour high survival rates to compensate for the low reproductive output. The annual survival rate was estimated at 0. 62, which was also consistent with this pattern when compared with survival estimates of mainland bullfinch and passerine species on other subtropical islands obtained in similar CMR studies. Based on a canonical estimator, the size of the studied population (mean ± SE) was estimated at 1608  ±  326 individuals. Given that the population size was only around 120 – 400 individuals in the early 1990 s, we suggest that the high survival probabilities currently applying to this critically endangered species may have substantially contributed to the recent recovery of this population. Future research studies on the species' demography should continue to monitor survival in order to measure the effect of management interventions currently taking place within the range of the Azores Bullfinch, including the restoration of the biodiversity rich laurel forest, but also focusing on nest success, which is important for understanding population dynamics...|$|R
40|$|An {{intensive}} monitoring {{investigation was}} conducted within the Kamech catchment (Cape Bon, Tunisia) {{to document the}} effect of scale on the hydrological and erosive responses in a Mediterranean climate regime with cracking soils. An evaluation of the individual contribution of topsoil and gully processes to total sediment delivery at different spatial scales was also conducted. Continuous runoff and erosion measurements during a 7 -yr period at four nested gauging stations were examined in a plot (P 1; 1. 32 ha), a plot + gully (P 2 +G; 1. 37 ha), a micro-catchment (MC; 15. 2 ha), and the entire catchment (C; 263 ha). Data analysis showed a high interannual variability and contribution {{of only a few}} events; three major events generated approximately 20 % of the total runoff and at least 50 % of the total erosion at all of the monitoring stations. The results also highlight the strong seasonal dynamics of both water and sediment delivery, with a time lag observed between runoff and sediment responses. The presence of open cracks in autumn was identified as a main factor explaining this time lag. A <b>constant</b> <b>monthly</b> and annual specific runoff response was observed among the stations, and a simple linear model combining a single rate of topsoil (17 t ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) and gully (80 t ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) erosion (weighted by their contribution area) successfully predicted the differences observed in the mean annual erosion rates among the stations.

40|$|International audienceHeat fluxes {{across the}} ocean-atmosphere {{interface}} {{play a crucial}} role in the upper turbulent mixing. The depth reached by this turbulent mixing is indicated by an homogenization of seawater properties in the surface layer, and is defined as the Mixed Layer Depth (MLD). The thickness of the mixed layer determines also the heat content of the layer that directly interacts with the atmosphere. The seasonal variability of these air-sea fluxes is crucial in the calculation of heat budget. An improvement in the estimate of these fluxes is needed for a better understanding of the Mediterranean ocean circulation and climate, in particular in Regional Climate Models. There are few estimations of surface heat fluxes based on oceanic observations in the Mediterranean, and none of them are based on mixed layer observations. So, we proposed here new estimations of these upper-ocean heat fluxes based on mixed layer. We present high resolution Mediterranean climatology (0. 5 °) of the mean MLD based on a comprehensive collection of temperature profiles of last 43 years (1969 - 2012). The database includes more than 150, 000 profiles, merging CTD, XBT, ARGO Profiling floats, and gliders observations. This dataset is first used to describe the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer depth on the whole Mediterranean on a monthly climatological basis. Our analysis discriminates several regions with coherent behaviors, in particular the deep water formation sites, characterized by significant differences in the winter mixing intensity. Heat storage rates (HSR) were calculated as the time rate of change of the heat content integrated from the surface down to a specific depth that is defined as the MLD plus an integration <b>constant.</b> <b>Monthly</b> climatology of net heat flux (NHF) from ERA-Interim reanalysis was balanced by the 1 °x 1 ° resolution heat storage rate climatology.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{is the ability}} to obtain enough nutritionally adequate food at all times. In 2011, 14. 9 % of U. S. households were food insecure. Food insecure populations have increased risk of chronic diseases and micronutrient deficiencies. Cyclical resource attainment may lead to inconsistent energy intakes, while resource management skills like budgeting may counter this. Qualitative research is limited on food preferences, what is purchased during resource constraint and how they compare with dietary recommendations. This study describes food choices and coping strategies that low-income, food insecure households use to obtain foods when resources are constrained. Four sets of two focus groups recruited SNAP participants and eligibles from Massachusetts (total participants= 22) to discuss (1) food choices and planning and (2) purchasing strategies utilized. Content analysis was used to describe “favorite/important”, “healthy” and “unhealthy” foods, foods purchased, coping strategies, and to compare responses with USDA food groups. Participants were classified as cyclic (evidence of uneven monthly food purchases) or constant spenders (evidence of <b>constant</b> <b>monthly</b> food purchases). Reported coping strategies and food purchases were compared between cyclic and constant spenders. Protein/meat, grains, and vegetables were top “favorite/important” choices. Top “healthy” food designations were vegetables, proteins and grains, which closely mirrored USDA recommendations. Four self-described “unhealthy” food categories emerged: fast/take-out; “processed”; solid-fat home foods; sugar-laden desserts/beverages. Fourteen participants were classified as “cyclic”, while seven participants as “constant”. Cyclic spenders utilized coping strategies similarly described to obtain “enough” food and exhibited unsustainable practices as depriving self for others. Constant spenders closely matched resource management strategies utilized to obtain the “kinds” of foods desired, like budgeting. While other food purchases were similar, cyclic spenders reported not purchasing fruit and vegetables in times of constrained resources. This study provides needed qualitative information on how low-income individuals describe important, healthy and unhealthy foods and what is purchased in times of resource constraints. These findings support previous research showing cyclical resource attainment can lead to nutritional risks, while financial management skills can increase food security through constant access to foods. The results highlight the need for resource management education and stress specific areas of nutrition education...|$|R
40|$|Watersheds buffer the {{temporal}} pattern of river flow relative to {{the temporal}} pattern of rainfall. This "ecosystem service" is inherent to geology and climate, but buffering also responds to human use and misuse of the landscape. Buffering {{can be part of}} management feedback loops if salient, credible and legitimate indicators are used. The flow persistence parameter Fp in a parsimonious recursive model of river flow (Part 1, van Noordwijk et al., 2017) couples the transmission of extreme rainfall events (1 -Fp), to the annual base-flow fraction of a watershed (Fp). Here we compare Fp estimates from four meso-scale watersheds in Indonesia (Cidanau, Way Besai and Bialo) and Thailand (Mae Chaem), with varying climate, geology and land cover history, at a decadal timescale. The likely response in each of these four to variation in rainfall properties (including the maximum hourly rainfall intensity) and land cover (comparing scenarios with either more or less forest and tree cover than the current situation) was explored through a basic daily water-balance model, GenRiver. This model was calibrated for each site on existing data, before being used for alternative land cover and rainfall parameter settings. In both data and model runs, the wet-season (3 -monthly) Fp values were consistently lower than dry-season values for all four sites. Across the four catchments Fp values decreased with increasing annual rainfall, but specific aspects of watersheds, such as the riparian swamp (peat soils) in Cidanau reduced effects of land use change in the upper watershed. Increasing the mean rainfall intensity (at <b>constant</b> <b>monthly</b> totals for rainfall) around the values considered typical for each landscape was predicted to cause a decrease in Fp values by between 0. 047 (Bialo) and 0. 261 (Mae Chaem). Sensitivity of Fp to changes in land use change plus changes in rainfall intensity depends on other characteristics of the watersheds, and generalisations {{made on the basis of}} one or two case studies may not hold, even within the same climatic zone. A wet-season Fp value above 0. 7 was achievable in forest-agroforestry mosaic case studies. Inter-annual variability in Fp is large relative to effects of land cover change. Multiple (5 - 10) years of paired-plot data would generally be needed to reject nochange null hypotheses on the effects of land use change (degradation and restoration). Fp trends over time serve as a holistic scale-dependent performance indicator of degrading/ recovering watershed health and can be tested for acceptability and acceptance in a wider social-ecological context...|$|R

With respect to system reliability, during July to December 1997, a total of thirty-eight internal and non-recurring TIC problems occurred. Eighty-four percent of all problems were either critical or major in severity. Approximately three-fourths of all problems were located in the Processing subsystem. Sixty percent of all problems were associated with TransView, the primary TIC software program.

AC Transit alone contributed approximately 55 % of the overall call volume throughout the reporting period. On average, for Oakland, the busiest regional system, approximately 3 % of the TATS system capacity was utilized. The BART strike had a significant effect on overall call volume only during September 1997. Overall, however, the BART strike did not have any lasting effect on overall TATS call volume.

Both bivariate and multivariate Granger tests indicate information content in a number of macroeconomic variables versus the real price changes for the Stockholm area and the entire country. A simple VAR model was estimated with the price changes for family houses in the Stockholm area, a proxy for consumption growth and the change in the rate in the unemployment rate as endogenous variables and a number of exogenous macro variables.

The reaction with alternate high and low rate <b>constants</b> enhances <b>monthly</b> mean wintertime sulfate by 4 - 20 % and 0. 4 - 1. 2 % respectively. The reaction does not significantly impact summertime sulfate. The higher sulfate predictions in winter compare better with the observed data as the model tends to underpredict sulfate concentrations both in winter and summer. We also investigate the potential impact of the gas-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide by the Stabilized Criegee Intermediate (SCI) using a recently measured rate constant for its reaction with sulfur dioxide. Model results indicate that the gas-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide by the SCI does not significantly affect sulfate concentrations due to the competing reaction of the SCI with water vapor. The current estimate of the rate constant for the SCI reaction with water vapor is too high for the SCI reaction with sulfur dioxide to significantly affect sulfate production. However, a sensitivity analysis using a lower rate constant for the water vapor reaction suggests that the SCI reaction with sulfur dioxide could potentially enhance sulfate production in the model. Further study is needed to accurately measure the rate constants of the aqueous-phase oxidation of S(IV) by nitrogen dioxide and the gas-phase reaction of the SCI with water vapor.

For the sample period of 1928 - 2008, if we use the realized volatility instead of the squared return series for the estimation of nonparametric components of the models, the nonstationary semiparametric ARCH models give a better explanation and forecast of the realized volatility...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of Southern Ocean sea ice were conducted using the Los Alamos numerical sea ice model CICE version 4 (CICE 4) which was configured in stand-alone mode on a moderately high-resolution Southern Ocean grid. The atmospheric forcing {{was derived from}} the hemispheric forecasting model Polar Limited Area Prediction Systems and ocean forcing from the global ocean general circulation model Australian Climate Ocean Model. An eleven-year simulation was carried out for the interval from 1998 to 2008. Results show that the meridional position of the sea ice edge follows an annual cycle of northward (southward) movement during ice growth (decay). This cycle is largely driven by thermodynamics but ice advection also contributes. Once a mature winter ice pack has formed, ice advection exceeds thermodynamic expansion in providing impetus for northward ice edge movement, most prominently in regions such as north of Prydz Bay and the western Weddell Sea. These zones are characterized by persistent southerly winds. With progressing seasons there is an increase in the size and number of longitudinal zones where ice advection out-paces the thermodynamic advance of the ice edge. This is caused by a slowing in the thermodynamically-driven expansion, while ice advection remains fairly <b>constant</b> over <b>monthly</b> intervals. Eventually there is a time interval when the zonal average northward ice velocity is greater than the zonal average northward expansion of the ice edge and so ice advection is dominant in determining the ice edge position. This is not sustainable {{due to a lack of}} thermodynamic growth in austral spring, consequently the ice retreats poleward. We examined the relationship between total ice area and total ice volume. There exists a correlation which is best in February. This correlation deteriorates as the year progresses so that July fails at 90...|$|R
40|$|Pore {{pressure}} changes play a {{major role}} in the stability of natural slopes, whose safety factor value is usually much smaller than that generally accepted in any other geotechnical problem. Correct assessment of potential seasonal pore pressure distributions is therefore a crucial issue in slope stability analysis. Based on long-term monitoring of some natural slopes, this paper compares the pore pressure distribution recorded in saturated fine-grained deposits and in shallow unsaturated granular covers, both monitored in southern Italy. In spite of the expected differences, the soils display some common features. In particular, from December to mid-May (wet period) in all examined cases the pore water pressures are quite <b>constant</b> over a <b>monthly</b> scale. Thus an essentially steady-state pore pressure condition establishes. It is in this phase, which is characterised by an essentially downward flux, that the safety factor drops to its lowest yearly value. Finally, a simplified method is adopted to model the steady-state pore pressure during thewet period and to calculate the average rain infiltration in equilibriumwith the steady-state condition; the results thereby obtained are compared with the findings of an advanced approach, based on the hydrological balance...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a mosquito population depends heavily on climatic {{variables such as}} temperature and precipitation. Since climate change models predict that global warming will impact on the frequency and intensity of rainfall, {{it is important to}} understand how these variables affect the mosquito populations. We present a model of the {{dynamics of}} a Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito population that incorporates the effect of rainfall and use it to study the influence of the number of rainy days and the mean monthly precipitation on the maximum yearly abundance of mosquitoes M_max. Additionally, using a fracturing process, we investigate the influence of the variability in daily rainfall on M_max. We find that, given a <b>constant</b> value of <b>monthly</b> precipitation, there is an optimum number of rainy days for which M_max is a maximum. On the other hand, we show that increasing daily rainfall variability reduces the dependence of M_max on the number of rainy days, leading also to a higher abundance of mosquitoes for the case of low mean monthly precipitation. Finally, we explore the effect of the rainfall in the months preceding the wettest season, and we obtain that a regimen with high precipitations throughout the year and a higher variability tends to advance slightly the time at which the peak mosquito abundance occurs, but could significantly change the total mosquito abundance in a year.

40|$|The paper {{argues for}} the use of scanner data from EPOS systems for use in the {{compilation}} of consumer price indices. A number of methods of calculating micro-indices from such data are outlined. Scanner data for colour television sets in the U. K. are used as an example. The Tornqvist chained index is used as a benchmark against which alternative formulations, including those based on representative products, can be judged, the errors often being substantial. The paper argues {{for the use}} of scanner data, illustrates methods of compiling micro-indices and points to the potential for serious errors from conventional methods. This paper is concerned with the computing of elementary aggregates for Consumer Price Indices (CPls). Its purpose is to address two neglected points in the literature. First, it will argue {{for the use of}} EPOS (Scanner) data in the compilation of CPIs. Second, it will outline and illustrate via such data how rigidities in the weighting systems can lead to serious errors. The latter has only been addressed in the compilation of CPls at a more aggregated level where weights from a, (by necessity) previous and out-of-date, Household Expenditure Survey are applied at least annually, the weights being held <b>constant</b> for the <b>monthly</b> indices between the annual rebase in December or January. The errors involved in using out-of-date annual weights have been considered in Fry and Pasharides (1986) and Silver and Ioannidis (1994). Studies relating to the use of fixed weights in the months (or in some countries, years) between rebasing are problematic due to the very lack of weights for these periods, the author being unaware of any such studies. The use of scanner data provides an opportunity to remedy this...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. Tilapia culture {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} world aquaculture production. Several tilapia strains {{have been developed}} locally and one of these has been developed for brackishwater aquaculture. BEST or the Brackishwater Enhanced Selected Tilapia {{was developed by the}} Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources with the aim of promoting brackishwater culture of this commodity to further improve tilapia production in the Philippines. This study will determine the growth performance of BEST reared in organically fertilized brackishwater ponds at three different stocking densities. The study was conducted in nine (9) units of 200 m 2 ponds. Pond preparation was done following standard procedures that include drying, liming, teaseed application and fertilization. Stocking was done after twenty days when primary productivity in the ponds was noted. Three culture systems were used, namely: extensive (Treatment 1 or T 1), semiintensive (Treatment 2 or T 2) and intensive (Treatment 3 or T 3) systems. The study was conducted for 120 days. Results showed that fish in ponds in treatment T 1 had an average body weight (ABW) of 52. 1 g, T 2 stocks with ABW of 223. 1 g and T 3 stocks with an ABW of 214. 5 g. Meanwhile, T 1 stocks had a survival rate of 91. 9 % while stocks under T 2 and T 3 had survival rates of 80 % and 84 % respectively. T 1 results showed losses amounting to P 382 since total revenue of P 958 is smaller than total cost of P 1, 340. T 2 harvest on the other hand registered a total revenue of P 10, 368 and total cost of P 4, 375 hence net return of P 5, 634. T 3 also had total revenue of P 21, 419 with a total cost of over P 8, 498 giving a net return of P 12, 471. T 2 showed a return on investment (ROI) of 128 % and a payback period of 0. 77 year. T 3 had an ROI of 139 % and payback period of 0. 71 year. Average feed conversion ratio (FCR) in two runs for two treatments are the same at 1. 1 Water parameters like DO, salinity, temperature; water level and pH were also taken. Water level in the ponds ranged from 70 to 74 cm, salinity at 6. 3 - 6. 9 ppt, DO at 1. 5 - 1. 7 ppm, temperature at a <b>constant</b> 29 Â°C, <b>monthly</b> pH ranges were from 7. 1 to 8. 0 and transparency of 34 - 47 cm...|$|R
40|$|Mining {{activities}} {{are well known}} for their negative effects {{on the environment and}} animals, due to the deposition of large volume of wastes in the form of tailings on the soil. These wastes or tailings contain high levels of heavy metals, sulphides and cyanide. Heavy metals {{are one of the most}} persistent pollutants in the environment and have been shown to bioaccumulate in animals. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of mine tailings on the snouted harvester termite, Trinervitermes trinervoides, inhabiting the Vaal River region. These termites play a significant role in the food chain as they provide a proteinand energy-rich food source to numerous predators therefore any bioaccumulation of heavy metals may adversely impact the food chain. Three aspects of the termite biology was studied, namely, the density and distribution of the termite mounds, the temperature profile of the mounds and the heavy metal content of the termites, mounds and surrounding soil. Three sites were chosen in accordance to their position relative to a tailings dam with the furthest site being the Control site. The most contaminated site and site closest to the tailings dam (AEL site) had the highest termite mound density, followed by the least contaminated site (Control site) and then the intermediately contaminated site (West Complex). The AEL site had many incipient mounds but few large mounds indicating that although there was a high turnover of new mounds, the longevity of these mounds was low. Higher densities at the AEL site may be explained by the water table being closer to the surface as a result of the tailings dam, allowing the termites easier access to water and hence a more favourable environment within the mound. The centre temperatures of the mounds at all three sites were kept <b>constant</b> on a <b>monthly</b> basis but fluctuated on a seasonal basis. The West Complex site had the highest and most variable centre mound temperatures. The average heavy metal content of the surface layer did not differ significantly from the average heavy metal content of the mounds at the AEL and West Complex site, indicating that the termites are not making heavy metals more bioavailable to the environment. The termites at the AEL site had the highest levels of Cu and Zn out of all the sites and accumulated these metals to levels toxic to mammals. Alates (a major food source for many animals) however, did not accumulate any heavy metals therefore it is unlikely the food chain is being negatively impacted by the termites. From this study there is no indication that the snouted harvester termite density or behaviour are being impacted by the tailings dam...|$|R
40|$|Eimeria – {{infections are}} {{protozoan}} parasitoses that occur worldwide among many domestic and farm animals, thus also among Old World Camels (OWC). The morphology, the endogenous and exogenous development of Eimeriae that are specific for camels {{as well as}} the alterations that can be detected histopathologically in such an infection are not comprehensively investigated and the majority of publications on this topic is more than 20 years old. Furthermore, there are no studies on factors associated with Coccidiosis (Eimeriosis) which is the clinically relevant form of an Eimeria infection. At present, the anticoccidial drug toltrazuril (Baycox®) is being used but is not registered for OWC. In addition there is largely a lack of understanding for the pharmacocinetic, tolerance and effectiveness in this genus. It was the goal of this work to collect new information about all of the above questions. Dromedaries were experimentally infected with E. cameli using different experimental set-ups, such as age, type of housing, infectious dose and medication. The course of the infection was investigated. To describe the endogenous development of E. cameli daily faeces samples were collected and examined for oocysts using a quantitative test [sedimentation]. Trials on the tenacity and observation of sporulation served to collect data on the exogenous development of the parasite. Furthermore, studies on the morphology of sporulated oocysts of this species were conducted. Histopathological examinations on 1, 192 intestine sections of 221 OWC were done to describe pathological alterations {{as well as the}} location of the developmental stages in the gastrointestinal tract. Together with microbiological data this information was used to conduct a statistical analysis on potential risk factors for clinically relevant coccidiosis. In addition a possible association with other endoparasites was tested. Finally, pro- and metaphylactic treatment with toltrazuril (Baycox®) were conducted on experimentally infected dromedaries. This work deals with the three species E. cameli, E. dromedarii and E. rajasthani in OWC in Dubai. For E. cameli a prepatent period of 16 - 40 days could be determined by experimental infection as well as a patent period of 12 - 48 days. The shedding curves showed mostly a bimodal distribution which is compatible with an undulating excretion of oocysts. This could be due to two asexual proliferation phases in E. cameli that are staggered in time. It was not possible to identify a clear circadian dynamic in the oocyst excretion. After experimental infection between 20 x 106 and 182 x 106 oocysts were shed. Among all animals the one with the lowest infectious dose and the youngest age shed most occysts. None of the different infectious doses led to a clinically apparent illness compatible with coccidiosis. Repeated blood samples showed that neutrophile granulocytes can be elevated during the prepatent period as a possible consequence of an Eimeria – infection. At an ambient temperature of 22 - 24 °C E. cameli sporulated within 8 - 20 days. E. cameli is very robust towards high temperatures and low relative humidity. Prevalence data from routine faeces samples in the emirate of Dubai were analysed for a period of 4 years, between 2003 – 2006. There was no significant variation over the years. In addition, prevalence from month to month were rather <b>constant</b> with a <b>monthly</b> average of 16. 3 %. The morphological studies were able to describe the fragile and transparent outer veil of E. cameli which was detected for the first time by YAGOUB (1989). The endogenous developmental stages can be found principally in the Lamina propria mucosae of the epithelium of the small intestine. The highest number of parasites {{can be found in the}} crypts of jejunum and ileum. Compared with an infection with E. cameli or small Eimeriae alone a mixed infection with Eimeria species (E. cameli + small Eimeriae) was statistically significantly associated with coccidiosis, the clinically relevant course of an Eimeria infection. It is possible that this risk is elevated further with a concurrent Cl. perfringens infection with irreversible damage in vital organs leading to death. Medication experiments with toltrazuril (Baycox®) showed that this anticoccidial drug (when given once oral p. i. on different days) was not able to interrupt the life cycle and a patent infection of Eimeriae. Giving the drug three times oral with a dose of each 20 mg/kg body weight with intervals of 5 to 6 days no side effects were observed supporting the notion of good tolerability. The rapid increase of the serum level in the first three days demonstrates its rapid absorption. The decline of the curve after reaching the peak supports the idea that toltrazuril is metabolized and its metabolites are excreted. Literature studies and the own investigations have shown that Eimeria infections in dromedaries are frequent. However, most infections are mono-infections with just one species which, according to my findings, lead in the most of the cases just to a subclinical course of infection. On the other hand, in dromedaries coccidioses can lead to severe and fatal illness. In front of the background of an increasing concentration of animals in camel farms (with an increased risk for infection due to coprophagia) this illness could gain far greater importance in the near future...|$|R
