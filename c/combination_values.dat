Some literature has examined the relationship of evacuation population and evacuation time in the face of disasters. For instance, Sherali et al. (1991) showed that a cumulative population fraction dissipated over time following a three-segment piece-wise linear relationship. Wood and Schmidtlein (2013) and Fraser et al. (2014) both used least-cost distance analyses to study the different evacuation times needed by the evacuees following a tsunami disaster. Kılcı et al. (2015) proposed a model similar to the P-center model, which maximizes the minimum weight of shelters, provides an objective result at different threshold <b>combination</b> <b>values</b> and evacuation population, as well as describes the effects of other factors, such threshold value for minimum utilization of open shelter areas and maximum pairwise utilization difference of candidate shelter areas. Kongsomsaksakul et al. (2005) proposed a bi-level model based on Stackelberg game theory to solve problems of shelter location and evacuation following flood disasters, presenting relationships between shelter capacity and the number of selected shelters. Bayram et al. (2015) considered traffic flow in a P-median model to minimize evacuation time, describing how evacuation time increased in concert with traffic flow, and discussed the effects of shelter number and tolerance levels on total evacuation time. Most recently, Xu et al. (2018) provided a hybrid bi-level model for earthquake emergency shelter location and allocation by considering the dynamic number of evacuees and its implementation, and the model results were also compared with the ones from multiple objective models. Optimization heuristics algorithms have been introduced to solve these models due to the complexity of the location problem (Li et al. 2009; Hu et al. 2012, 2014; Zhao et al. 2015) that cannot be solved by traditional mathematical methods.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: In {{solving a}} {{classification}} problem in relational data mining, traditional methods, for example, the C 4. 5 and its variants, usually require data transformations from datasets stored in multiple tables {{into a single}} table. Unfortunately, we may loss some information when we join tables {{with a high degree}} of one-to-many association. Therefore, data transformation becomes a tedious trial-and-error work and the classification result is often not very promising especially when the number of tables and the degree of one-to-many association are large. Approach: We proposed a genetic semi-supervised clustering technique as a means of aggregating data stored in multiple tables to facilitate the task of solving a classification problem in relational database. This algorithm is suitable for classification of datasets {{with a high degree of}} one-to-many associations. It can be used in two ways. One is user-controlled clustering, where the user may control the result of clustering by varying the compactness of the spherical cluster. The other is automatic clustering, where a non-overlap clustering strategy is applied. In this study, we use the latter method to dynamically cluster multiple instances, as a means of aggregating them and illustrate the effectiveness of this method using the semi-supervised genetic algorithm-based clustering technique. Results: It was shown in the experimental results that using the reciprocal of Davies-Bouldin Index for cluster dispersion and the reciprocal of Gini Index for cluster purity, as the fitness function in the Genetic Algorithm (GA), finds solutions with much greater accuracy. The results obtained in this study showed that automatic clustering (seeding), by optimizing the cluster dispersion or cluster purity alone using GA, provides one with good results compared to the traditional k-means clustering. However, the best result can be achieved by optimizing the <b>combination</b> <b>values</b> of both the cluster dispersion and the cluster purity, by putting more weight on the cluster purity measurement. Conclusion: This study showed that semi-supervised genetic algorithm-based clustering techniques can be applied to summarize relational data with more effectively and efficiently...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{identification}} of the urban-rural fringes is very significant for deeply understanding the development processes and regulations of urban space and guiding urban spatial development in the future. Traditionally, urban-rural fringe areas are identified using statistical analysis methods that consider indexes from single or multiple factors, such as population densities, the ratio of building land, {{the proportion of the}} non-agricultural population, and economic levels. However, these methods have limitations, for example, the statistical data are not continuous, the statistical standards are not uniform, the data is seldom available in real time, {{and it is difficult to}} avoid issues on the statistical effects from edges of administrative regions or express the internal differences of these areas. This paper proposes a convenient approach to identify the urban-rural fringe using nighttime light data of DMSP/OLS images. First, a light characteristics–combined value model was built in ArcGIS 10. 3, and the combined characteristics of light intensity and the degree of light intensity fluctuation are analyzed in the urban, urban-rural fringe, and rural areas. Then, the Python programming language was used to extract the breakpoints of the characteristic <b>combination</b> <b>values</b> of the nighttime light data in 360 directions taking Tian An Men as the center. Finally, the range of the urban-rural fringe area is identified. The results show that the urban-rural fringe of Beijing is mainly located in the annular band around Tian An Men.

40|$|Two new {{three-dimensional}} rock mass strength {{criteria are}} developed in this dissertation by extending an existing rock mass strength criterion. These criteria incorporate {{the effects of}} the intermediate principal stress, minimum principal stress and the anisotropy resulting from these stresses acting on the fracture system. In addition, these criteria have the capability of capturing the anisotropic and scale dependent behavior of the jointed rock mass strength by incorporating the effect of fracture geometry through the fracture tensor components. Another significant feature of the new rock mass strength criterion which has the exponential functions (equation 6. 7) is having only four empirical coefficients compared to the existing strength criterion which has five empirical coefficients; if the joint sets have the same isotropic mechanical behavior, the number of the empirical coefficients reduces to two in this new strength criterion (equation 6. 10). The new criteria were proposed after analyzing 452 numerical modeling results of the triaxial, polyaxial and biaxial compression tests conducted on the jointed rock blocks having one or two joint sets by the PFC 3 D software version 5. In this research to have several samples with the same properties a synthetic rock material that is made out of a mixture of gypsum, sand and water was used. In total, 20 joint systems were chosen and joint sets have different dip angles varying from 15 to 60 at an interval of 15 with dip directions of 30 and 75 for the two joint sets. Each joint set also has 3 persistent joints with the joint spacing of 42 mm in a cubic sample of size 160 mm and the joints have the same isotropic mechanical behavior. The confining stress <b>combination</b> <b>values</b> were chosen based on the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) value of the modeled intact synthetic rock. The minimum principal stress values were chosen as 0, 20, 40 and 60 percent of the UCS. For each minimum principal stress value, the intermediate principal stress value varies starting at the minimum principal stress value and increasing at an interval of 20 percent of the UCS until it is lower than the strength of the sample under the biaxial loading condition with the same minimum principal stress value. The new rock mass failure criteria were developed from the PFC 3 D modeling data. However, since the joint sets having the dip angle of 60 intersect the top and bottom boundaries of the sample simultaneously, the joint systems with {{at least one of the}} joint sets having the dip angle of 60 were removed from the database. Thus, 284 data points from 12 joint systems were used to find the best values of the empirical coefficients for the new rock mass strength criteria. λ, p and q were found to be 0. 675, 3. 16 and 0. 6, respectively, through a conducted grid analysis with a high R 2 (coefficient of determination) value of 0. 94 for the new criterion given by equation 6. 9 and a and b were found to be 0. 404 and 0. 972, respectively, through a conducted grid analysis with a high R 2 value of 0. 92 for the new criterion given by equation 6. 10. The research results clearly illustrate how increase of the minimum and intermediate principal stresses and decrease of the joint dip angle, increase the jointed rock block strength. This dissertation also illustrates how different confining stress combinations and joint set dip angles result in different jointed rock mass failure modes such as sliding on the joints, failure through the intact rock and a combination of the intact rock and joint failures. To express the new rock mass strength failure criteria, it was necessary to determine the intact rock strengths under the same confining stress combinations mentioned earlier. Therefore, the intact rock was also modeled for all three compression tests and the intact rock strengths were found for 33 different confining stress combinations. Suitability of six major intact rock failure criteria: Mohr-Coulomb, Hoek-Brown, Modified Lade, Modified Wiebols and Cook, Mogi and Drucker-Prager in representing the intact rock strength was examined through fitting them using the aforementioned 33 PFC 3 D data points. Among these criteria, Modified Lade, Modified Mogi with power function and Modified Wiebols and Cook were found to be the best failure criteria producing lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 0. 272, 0. 301 and 0. 307, respectively. Thus, these three failure criteria are recommended for the prediction of the intact rock strength under the polyaxial stress condition. In PFC unlike the other methods, macro mechanical parameters are not directly used in the model and micro mechanical parameter values applicable between the particles should be calibrated using the macro mechanical properties. Accurate calibration is a difficult or challenging task. This dissertation emphasized the importance of studying the effects of all micro parameter values on the macro mechanical properties before one goes through calibration of the micro parameters in PFC modeling. Important effects of two micro parameters, which have received very little attention, the particle size distribution and the cov of the normal and shear strengths, on the macro properties are clearly illustrated before conducting the said calibration. The intact rock macro mechanical parameter values for the Young’s modulus, uniaxial compression strength (UCS), internal friction angle, cohesion and Poisson's ratio were found by performing 3 uniaxial tests, 3 triaxial tests and 5 Brazilian tests on a synthetic material made out of a mixture of gypsum, sand and water and the joint macro mechanical parameter values were found by conducting 4 uniaxial compression tests and 4 direct shear tests on jointed synthetic rocks with a horizontal joint. Then the micro mechanical properties of the Linear Parallel Bond Model (LPMB) and Modified Smooth Joint Contact Model (MSJCM) were calibrated to represent the intact rock and joints respectively, through the specific procedures explained in this research. The similar results obtained between the 2 polyaxial experiments tests of the intact rock and 11 polyaxial experimental tests of the jointed rock blocks having one joint set and the numerical modeling verified the calibrated micro mechanical properties and further modification of these properties was not necessary. This dissertation also proposes a modification to the Smooth Joint Contact Model (SJCM) to overcome the shortcoming of the SJCM to capture the non-linear behavior of the joint closure varying with the joint normal stress. Modified Smooth Joint Contact Model (MSJCM) uses a linear relation between the joint normal stiffness and the normal contact stress to model the non-linear relation between the joint normal deformation and the joint normal stress observed in the compression joint normal stiffness test. A good agreement obtained between the results from the experimental tests and the numerical modeling of the compression joint normal test shows the accuracy of this new model. Moreover, another shortcoming associated with the SJCM application known as the interlocking problem was solved through this research by proposing a new joint contact implementation algorithm called joint sides checking (JSC) approach. The interlocking problem occurs due to a shortcoming of the updating procedure in the PFC software related to the contact conditions of the particles that lie around the intended joint plane during high shear displacements. This problem increases the joint strength and dilation angle and creates unwanted fractures around the intended joint plane...|$|E
