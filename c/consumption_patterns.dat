5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the <b>consumption</b> <b>patterns</b> of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their <b>consumption</b> <b>patterns</b> when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of <b>consumption</b> <b>patterns</b> relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E

All food groups have positive income elasticity and negative price elasticity consistent with the theory of demand, but expenditure elasticities are higher than price elasticities. As a staple food, rice has relatively low expenditure and price elasticities in which rising household income and rising rice price do not affect much rice consumption. Most food commodity groups have uncompensated price elasticity close to 1, namely 0. 9 to 1. 1. The high price elasticities are found on fruit commodity group mainly affected by seasonal factors.

The analysis indicates {{that the use of}} traditional fuels dominates households 2 ̆ 7 <b>consumption</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, the extent of the dominance varies across cities/towns and across income groups. A multivariate analysis of the <b>consumption</b> <b>pattern</b> reveals that the probability of consuming traditional fuels in general declines with increase in income and prices of the traditional fuels where as it increases with the increase in the prices of the modern fuels. The probability of consuming modern fuels increases with increase in income and prices of the traditional fuels and declines with an increase in modern fuel prices. CLAD estimation of demand functions using micro data indicates that demand for all forms of energy are price elastic. Cross price relations indicate that kerosene is a substitute for both charcoal and firewood, where as electricity is a substitute for all the three. Charcoal and firewood are complements. The result that electricity is a substitute for all forms of energy gives indication that the long-run option in ensuring energy transition is to harness the huge hydro-electric generation potential of the country. All the energy sources considered were found to have income elasticities very close to one owing to the fact that energy consumption is a necessity. The other point to note is that household size has been identified as one important variable that increases demand for all forms of energy. Owing {{to the fact that the}} <b>consumption</b> <b>pattern</b> in Addis Ababa is substantially different from others, this effect is captured by a dummy variable and the estimated coefficients indicate that the use of traditional fuels increases with the probability of being outside Addis Ababa where as the opposite holds for the use of modern fuel, emphasizing the impact of the level of urbanization on energy <b>consumption</b> <b>pattern...</b>|$|R

Demonstrably, at equivalent levels of educational capital, social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions. How one describes one’s social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development. Also, across the divisions of labor, “economic constraints tend to relax without any {{fundamental change in the}} pattern of spending.” This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability, <b>consumption</b> <b>patterns</b> remain stable.|$|E

Figure 3 clearly shows that, with {{a rise in the}} income of the consumer, the initial budget line B1 moves outward parallel to itself to B2 and the consumer now chooses X' bundle to the initial bundle X*. The figure shows that, the demand for X2 has risen from X21 to X22 with an outward shift of the budget line from B1 to B2 (caused due to rise in the income of the consumer). This essentially means that, good X2 is a normal good as the demand for X2 rose with an increase in the income of the consumer.|$|E
25|$|Mobile {{search is}} {{important}} for the usability of mobile content for the same reasons as internet search engines became important to the usability of internet content. Early internet content was largely provided by portals such as Netscape. As the depth of available content grew, portals were unable to provide total coverage. As a result, Internet web search engines such as Google and AltaVista proved popular as a way of allowing users to find the increasingly specialist content they were looking for. In an international journal article, 'Exploring the logic of mobile search', Westlund, Gómez-Barroso, Compañó, and Feijóo(2011) outline a thorough review of research on mobile search usage, and also present an in-depth study of user patterns. They conclude that mobile search has started to change mobile media <b>consumption</b> <b>patterns</b> radically.

It is one of the primary components of GDP. GDP of any nation is nothing but the aggregate demand of goods and services. The relation between aggregate income and aggregate consumption is a significant component in explaining the analysis of national Income. The effect of consumption function on economic fluctuations was mentioned by all the eminent economists from Malthus to Wicksell in explaining the business cycle literature and its contribution in economic development. Over a period every economy, whether developed or developing, has observed change in the <b>consumption</b> <b>pattern,</b> which had been an outcome of changing life style. Better quality of life is an indicator of economic development and <b>consumption</b> <b>pattern</b> has changed with escalation in quality of life, proving its significance. This higher quality consumption is an outcome of increased disposable income supported by advanced retail outlets.

This is so that consumers will have an overview of time sampling data which is required in order to apply the NIALM technique.
