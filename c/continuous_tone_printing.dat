40|$|The {{researchers}} at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) have been reappraising 19 th Century print processes for {{the last fifteen years}} and Hoskins has published on the continuous tone properties of Woodburytype and its relation to other 19 thC processes such as photo-ceramics in previous papers to the IS&T PICT (1) and EI in 2003 (2). Since the invention of Walter Bentley Woodbury’s ‘Woodburytype process in 1865 (3), it has been possible to autographically print a true continuous tone black and white photographic image. New research at CFPR builds upon previous research to combining 19 th Century Photomechanical techniques with digital technology to reappraise the potential of these processes CNC milled relief printing blocks from which casts are taken will enable a physical and tactile surface quality that more closely resembles the autographic surface of the Woodburytype and the three colour carbon printing processes. Therefore this latest research aims to explore the potential of creating coloured pictorial imagery from a continuous tone relief surface. The specific context for the research is to create a surface quality and visual appearance that retains the character of the earlier autographic processes, such as letterpress and screen printing, which are undergoing a revival, This is happening for two reasons, one, for their hand crafted content, and secondly, because they create a physical and tactile surface that has a subjective quality, hard to define using standard testing methodologies. To prove the potential the research team have been using CNC milled images where the height of the relief image is dictated by creating a tone curve and then milling this curve into a series of relief blocks from which the image is cast in a silicone ink. A translucent image is cast from each of the colour matrices and each colour is assembled - one on top of another - resulting is a colour continuous tone print, where colour tone is created by physical depth of colour. A number of factors have come together to enable a reappraisal of <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> <b>printing.</b> Software is now readily available that will split a photographic image into a bump map image where the Z-axis corresponds to a set of height steps on a tonal step wedge from black to white. This software is easily transcribed to either a DXF for processing in G Code to CNC (Computer Numeric control) in order mill an image. In addition new silicone materials have become more readily available that can be precisely coloured. The aim is to create a digitally initiated, physical tactile surface that retains the qualities of arlier autographic process which is capable of being transferred to a range of substrates and demonstrates the potential for future research into new methods of <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> <b>printing.</b> This research {{is part of a larger}} parallel research project to investigate the potential of creating a physically printed relief surface that better represents the autographic mark making requirements of visual artists and designers.

Random dot printing is similar to <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> <b>printing</b> or very high frequency screen ruling and is capable of overcoming the limitatio of halftone printing. The randomly selected dots are achieved by the grain structure of the pre- sensitized printing plates. The advantages and the disadvantages of this process over conventional halftone printing process are discussed. The images and the test targets of both the processes were exposed to, and printed from a single plate for each process color so as to eliminate the ink and press variables. The experimental steps and the criteria for the plate exposure and processing have been discussed. The design of the flat {{and a copy of}} the reproduction are also included. For the purpose of objective evaluation of the color characteristics tone reproduction of both the processes and of each process color were studied. The hue error introduced by two different processes were measured. The proportionality of unwanted densities with the wanted density for each process color were derived and curves were plotted. Further, the attributes of colors, such as lightness or brightness, saturation and dominant wavelength (hue) were compared by plotting the chromaticity diagram (eIE 1931). The chromaticity diagrams were plotted for two different standard light sources and the results were discussed. For a better representation of the data an enlarged chromaticity diagram was used. The results may be interpreted to show that the random dot process allows a larger color gamut, produce brighter colors and shows less proportionality failure...|$|E

40|$|This archive {{contains}} material {{relating to}} the photo-mechanical printing process invented by Walter Woodbury in 1865. Like the collotype process this also {{takes advantage of the}} changing nature of bichromated gelatine after exposure to light to produce a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> <b>print.</b> Unlike the collotype process the bichromated gelatine layer does not form the printing plate. A negative is placed upon a sheet of bichromated gelatine and exposed to a light source, the sheet is then washed to flush out the excess bichromate. Where the light has passed through the negative the gelatine is no longer absorbent but where the negative blocked the light the gelatine will accept the water and swell. After the sheet has been washed it will be seen to have a relief surface, raised in the areas that represent the dark areas in the finished print and flat in the areas that represent the light areas of the print. Once dried, the gelatine sheet is placed on a steel plate in a hydraulic press and a sheet of lead that is half an inch thick and half an inch larger than the layer of gelatine is placed on top. The whole is then placed under pressure, and the relief surface of the gelatine sheet is embossed into the lead. The lead sheet produced forms the printing matrix used to make the print. It is placed face downwards in a press of Woodbury’s invention. A mixture of liquid gelatine and a colouring agent is then poured into the mould, a sheet of paper placed on the surface and the press closed. The press is then left for a few minutes allowing the liquid gelatine to set and adhere to the paper, which is then carefully lifted out of the press and placed in a drying rack. As the gelatine contracts slightly upon drying, causing the paper to curl inwards, these prints had to then be mounted. The archive contains journal articles taken from contemporary photographic journals describing this process and its potential amateur and commercial use as well as describing further refinements to the process. Also included are detailed descriptions of how the process was carried out at two contemporary commercial studios as well as a photographically illustrated description of how the process can be adapted for use in the digital age.

40|$|In {{a digital}} age where artists and {{printers}} {{are required to}} learn {{a wide range of}} skills, from graphic design to colour science, is it possible to return to a more artistic application of colour, tone and texture with a mechanically printed image using CAD software? The reproduction of digitally generated works is divided between the on screen (RGB) representation of colour and a colorimetric translation through an imaging pipeline to a printing device (CMYK). The developers’ goal of inkjet hardware and software is to match printed colour and texture {{as close as possible to}} its on screen representation. The texture in this case is a simulation though contrast, tone and through the illusional properties of halftoning. So far inkjet has not fully addressed the three dimensional rendering of texture. As touch-screen devices develop and evolve to replicate the creative methods of the artist, can an on screen difference in appearance between a thickly applied paint or watercolour, be replicated in the same way through the printing hardware? Drawing tablets have made digital input devices closer to how an artist would intuitively generate the image, so now is it the turn of the digital printer to bring the prints closer to how artists would apply the colour? My research and practice explores tonal image creation through texture via a variety of digital output devices that are not solely restricted to digital print machines. By looking at 19 th century photomechanical methods of low relief <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> images, primarily focusing on the Woodburytype. The Woodburytype process translates a two-dimensional tonal gradation present in the image to a three dimensional model in gelatine. The Woodburytype photomechanical print is the only <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> <b>print</b> process ever invented. The research moves into the 21 st century investigating alternative methods that incorporates vector based software and 3 D printing. The surface relief contained within the image is created through the varying density of pigmented gelatin which is used as a vehicle to transfer the image on to paper. However the Woodburytype and variations of the process have been achieved so far as single colour prints. Limitations with their technical process and materials available in the 19 th Century meant that the processes were never finalised. Within the context of 21 st Century technologies this research proposes to digitally explore the generation of print matrices through CNC and additive layer manufacturing (3 D printing) and the exploration of alternative materials that emulate 19 th Century pigmented gelatins but will assist in the introduction of two or more colours to create a more robust surface relief whilst retaining the photographic image qualities. By exploring, adapting and modifying current technology and methodologies the research and practice will provide the opportunity for developing closer links and crossovers between the industrial printer and the artistic printmaker.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{contemporary}} method of continuous tone colour printing {{based upon the}} Nineteenth Century printing process of Woodburytype as developed by Walter Bentley Woodbury in 1865. Woodburytype was the only truly <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> <b>printing</b> process yet invented, and died out {{in the late nineteenth}} century as more expedient and cost effective methods of printing prevailed, thus laying the path for current CMYK print technologies. Digital print itself, since its development as a range of colour printing technologies, has followed a route based on the half-tone dot and four colour separation predicated around CMYK. In recent years stochastic algorithms and dithering have allowed the lay down of multiple passes and colour sets to create a near continuous tone image. The downside of this approach is that in order to create a full colour subtractive image, the resultant prints have very little surface topography and a mechanical uniformity that demonstrates none of the surface characteristics, tactile qualities and rich tonal warmth of the 19 th century photo-mechanical processes. Current research at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) at the University of the West of England, Bristol, is exploring the potential of CNC milled imagery, where the tonal range of each colour is assigned a physical height to produce a continuous tone topographic relief printing matrix, from which the colour image is cast in a silicone ink. A translucent image is cast from each of the colour matrices and each colour is assembled one on top of another resulting in a true four colour separation continuous tone print, where colour tone is created by physical depth of colour...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{the primary}} focus for the {{creation}} and preservation of digitally based artwork in hardcopy has relied in recent years on the gradual refinement of digital printing devices, reference points for their development often appear to follow a strictly linear route. To broaden the current possibilities for permanent, accurate digital hardcopy, Thirkell and the Centre for Fine Print Research has been engaged in the re-assessment of some early photomechanical printing processes which were eclipsed by the mainstream printing approaches long {{before the advent of}} the digital era. Thirkell's paper drew on a three-part methodology surveying printing techniques through historical and current literature, examining actual printed examples and testing findings through practice. The paper re-evaluated the high resolution and archival qualities of three unique 19 th century printing processes in the context of current digital practice. Although in mainstream terms such techniques have become redundant, this re-assessment identified and demonstrated valuable principles such as lightfast ink qualities and continuous tone image rendering which has once again renewed currency in the rapidly expanding field of museum quality digital imaging and printing.

40|$|Advances in {{printing}} {{technologies in}} the late 19 th century {{led to the development}} of half-toning techniques enabling the economical reproduction of photographic images in print. Whilst undoubtedly successful in low cost high volume image reproduction, half-toning representations are less faithful in detail when compared to continuous tone photomechanical methods in use at that time. This thesis asks the question: can the creative application of 21 st century digital fabrication technologies enable the qualities of continuous tone imaging to be regained? In the 21 st-century, printmaking may be seen as the interchange of ideas, experimental practice and interdisciplinary thinking. Printmaking has always been a means of combining modern technology and methods with existing traditional and commercial imaging processes. Technological advancement in print however does not always provide a finer quality of print. Qualities often attributed to pre-digital <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> <b>printing</b> can be lost in the transition to a digital half tone print workflow. This research project examines a near obsolete 19 th century print process, the continuous tone Woodburytype, developed to address the issue of permanence in photography. Through a methodological approach analyses of the Woodburytype an empirical reconstruction of the process provides a comprehensive critique of its method. The Woodburytype’s surface qualities are not found in other photomechanical printing methods capable of rendering finely detailed photographic images. Its method of image translation results in the printed tonal range being directly proportional to the deposition thickness of the printing ink, however it never successfully developed into a colour process. By examining and evaluating digital imaging technology this study identifies, current computer aided design and manufacturing techniques and extends upon known models of Woodburytype printing through the development of this deposition height quality enabling a new digital polychromatic colour printing process...|$|E

The database consists of 567 historic articles relating to the collotype process; 55 biographies, 131 reference articles, 91 descriptions of the process which have been gathered from both extant and verbal sources, plus 34 formulae for printing collotype, many previously unpublished. Also included are photographic demonstrations and descriptions of three of the four remaining collotype studios in the world.

40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>tone</b> <b>printing,</b> either {{collotype}} or screenless lithography, are {{processes that}} are in limited use. The halftone method of reproduction {{is still the most}} economical way to reproduce a continuous tone original. This study dealt with the mechanism of screenless lithography, more specifically on how to make the use of negative working plates a feasible alternative to positive working plates. It is known that the positive working plate can print a longer range of tones than a negative working plate. So the main point of the experiment dealt with how to extend the range of a negative working plate. A negative plate is of high contrast, and so multiple negative working plates were used to print one image. Each plate in itself can print three to four steps of a continuous tone step wedge. In this experiment, three plates were used in the hopes of printing twelve steps in a continuous gradation. A continuous tone step wedge along with a black and white photograph were divided among the three plates. Twelve steps on the step wedge were identified, and so each film had four of the possible thirty steps which existed on the step wedge. These films were exposed to plates, and mounted on the press. Each image was run in registration with one another, and the solid ink density was varied to produce the continuous tone effect. From the press sheets examined, in which there are examples in this report, a high contrast image was produced. One of the main problems in the experiment was differences in emulsion coating on each individual plate. Which resulted in inconsistent exposure times from one plate to another. From repeated plate testing using a. 15 density increment continuous tone step wedge as a control guide, it was found that for the same exposure a hardening of the plate coating (and consequently of ink receptivity) corresponding to two steps equaling. 30 density difference was to be expected. This made it virtually impossible {{to get a handle on}} the correct exposure time needed for the plate. Results from this experiment show, that it is not possible to effectively print a continuous tone image with a negative working plate and or multiple negative plates. This is due to the high contrast of the negative working plate, thus making it suitable for mainly halftone lithographic purposes...|$|E

" There is a tendeney for very light "washed out highlights" to be accepted while "'blocked up shadows" are rejected. 4. Strong preference for positive material D-Log E Curve gradients which are higher instead of lower for the same general range of densities in the positive. 5. Moderate preference for prints made on Eastman Variable Contrast Paper (Experimental Emulsion 47763 A) inetead of prints made on DuPont Varigam when both are printed with ultraviolet light for use in the toe region or their respective D-Log E curves. This does not mean that DuPont Varigam paper is unacceptable.
