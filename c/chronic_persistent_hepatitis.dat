Three patients in this group had previously had a positive reaction before prednisone was given. There was no statistically significant correlation between the reactivity to LSP stimulation and the presence or absence of hepatitis-associated antigen (HBAg) in serum, or with the biochemical liver parameters. The response to in vitro stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) was found to be significantly lower as compared with the control group in eleven patients with alcoholic liver disease and in the patients with acute hepatitis who had HBAg in serum.

40|$|Pancreatitis-associated protein I (PAP I) is a {{secretory}} protein {{first described}} as an acute phase reactant during acute pancreatitis. Recently, induction of the PAP I gene was also described in liver during hepatocarcinogenesis. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of this induction, we used constructs carrying progressive deletions of the PAP I promoter fused to the CAT gene. We showed that the silencer conferring tissue specificity on the PAP I gene was inactive in hepatoma cells. Then, in an vitro transcription system, we compared the transcription capacity of nuclear extracts from normal liver and HepG 2 cells on constructs containing the silencer. The results confirmed that a trans-acting factor interacting with the PAP I silencer was present in liver cells and absent from hepatoma cells. On the other hand, immunohistochemistry showed that PAP I was expressed in {{a limited number of}} transformed hepatocytes. It was concluded that expression of PAP I in hepatocarcinoma occurred through inactivation of its silencer element and was not concomitant in all malignant cells. On that basis, we assayed PAP I in serum from patients with chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis or hepatocarcinoma. PAP I levels were normal in <b>chronic</b> active or <b>persistent</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> significantly higher in cirrhosis and strongly elevated in hepatocarcinoma. Because those clinical entities often develop in that sequence, serum PAP I appeared as a potential marker of hepatocarcinoma development...|$|R

Histological examinations {{in the group}} with normal AST activities were normal in two of 19 (11 %), showed non-specific reactive hepatitis in eight of 19 (42 %), <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in six of 19 (31 %), and chronic active hepatitis in three of 19 (16 %). Twenty three of 42 (55 %) had either persistently or temporary raised liver transaminases (mean AST 96. 2 IU/l, mean follow up 16 months).

The distribution of these adhesion molecules was compared with the presence on inflammatory cells of their natural ligands, lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1 and cluster of differentiation antigen- 2, respectively. In normal liver, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen- 3 reacted weakly with sinusoidal lining cells, portal vessel endothelium and scattered mononuclear inflammatory cells, whereas hepatocytes were constantly negative. In contrast, all 114 biopsy samples of acute or chronic liver diseases revealed strong expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen- 3 on sinusoidal lining cells and on hepatocytes in areas of inflammation. Hepatocellular membrane positivity resulted in a "honeycomb pattern" of staining, which was panacinar in acute hepatitis and focal in <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> or aggressive <b>hepatitis.</b> In various other chronic liver diseases, a multifocal periportal and intraacinar honeycomb pattern was detected.

We have analyzed the in situ distribution of two recently described vascular adhesion molecules (i. e., endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule- 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1) and of the lymphocyte "homing" receptor cluster of differentiation antigen- 44 in normal and inflamed liver biopsy specimens. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule- 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 were absent from normal liver tissue, but they were strongly expressed on sinusoidal lining cells in inflammatory liver disease. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule- 1 expression predominated diffusely throughout the liver parenchyma in acute hepatitis; in contrast, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 was mainly expressed in areas of periportal and intralobular inflammation in <b>chronic</b> active and <b>persistent</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> The "homing" receptor cluster of differentiation antigen- 44 was weakly expressed on scattered mononuclear cells and on sinusoidal lining cells in normal liver tissue, but it was strongly up-regulated on mononuclear inflammatory cells and sinusoidal lining cells in acute and chronic hepatitis.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Laryngeal {{symptoms}} are increasingly recognized {{to occur in}} <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough and may result from the sensory hyperresponsiveness that characterizes this condition. Apart from cough, the motor consequences of sensory activation have not been well described in <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough. The efficacy of speech pathology treatment for chronic cough suggests that laryngeal dysfunction may be relevant in <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough. This study investigated the relationship between cough reflex sensitivity and laryngeal dysfunction, which was assessed as paradoxical vocal cord movement (PVCM) and extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness, in patients with chronic cough. Study Design: Cross-sectional case-control comparison of subjects with chronic cough and healthy controls. Methods: Adults with <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 11) were assessed by cough-specific quality of life questionnaire, extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness to hypertonic saline provocation, capsaicin cough reflex hypersensitivity, and fibreoptic laryngoscopy to assess PVCM. Results: Laryngeal dysfunction was present in many patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough. PVCM was present in 56 % of subjects with chronic cough and accompanied by cough reflex hypersensitivity and impaired quality of life. Inspiratory airflows were reduced in cough with PVCM, and there was significant extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness. Conclusions: Laryngeal dysfunction is common in chronic cough, where it is manifest as paradoxical vocal cord movement and extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness. Laryngeal dysfunction in chronic cough is associated with reduced quality of life. Laryngeal hypersensitivity may be a common mechanism that can be effectively treated by speech language therapy...|$|R

III 2 F 3 stained significantly larger numbers of mononuclear cells in non-A, non-B chronic active hepatitis than in <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> <b>hepatitis</b> B or hepatitis B related liver cirrhosis. These results indicate that TNF alpha is produced and secreted by infiltrating mononuclear cells in focal inflammatory areas of the liver, and suggest that TNF alpha may {{have a role in}} the inflammatory activity of chronic liver disease...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: <b>Chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough can be {{associated}} with laryngeal dysfunction that leads to symptoms such as dysphonia, sensory hyperresponsiveness to capsaicin, and motor dysfunction with paradoxical vocal fold movement and variable extrathoracic airflow obstruction (reduced inspiratory airflow). Successful therapy of <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough improves symptoms and sensory hyperresponsiveness. The effects of treatment for chronic cough on laryngeal dysfunction are not known. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate effects of therapy for chronic cough and paradoxical vocal fold movement. Methods: Adults with chronic cough (n = 24) were assessed before and after treatment for <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough by measuring quality of life, extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness to hypertonic saline provocation, capsaicin cough reflex hypersensitivity and fibreoptic laryngoscopy to observe paradoxical vocal fold movement. Subjects with chronic cough were classified into those with (n = 14) or without (n = 10) paradoxical vocal fold movement based on direct observation at laryngoscopy. Results: Following treatment there was a significant improvement in cough related quality of life and cough reflex sensitivity in both groups. Subjects with chronic cough and paradoxical vocal fold movement also had additional improvements in extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness and paradoxical vocal fold movement. The degree of improvement in cough reflex sensitivity correlated with the improvement in extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness. Conclusion: Laryngeal dysfunction is common in <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough, where it is manifest as paradoxical vocal fold movement and extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness. Successful treatment for <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough leads to improvements in these features of laryngeal dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Background. <b>Chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} disorder and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease {{is considered to be}} the third leading cause, after asthma and postnasal drip. Therefore, patients with unexplained <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough usually undergo a stepwise evaluation to establish the existence of a reflux disease. Aim. To identify the most cost-effective diagnostic approach to assess gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in patients with unexplained <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough. Methods. Direct and indirect costs associated with six diagnostic strategies using 24 -h oesophageal pH-metry, oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy and the proton pump inhibitors test in different sequences, were evaluated using a decision tree model. If the first test was positive, the diagnostic work-up was stopped, if negative the patient proceeded to the second test, and so on. Clinical data from an observational prospective trial conducted in 51 patients with unexplained <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough were used in the economic model. Results. All six strategies had the same clinical effectiveness (78. 4 %). The diagnostic work-up with the lowest cost was the proton pump inhibitors test followed by pH-metry and then oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy with a total cost of EURO 211. 08 (direct EURO 142. 93, indirect EURO 68. 15). Conclusions. This study shows that the lowest cost is the strategy where proton pump inhibitors test is performed as first investigation. Implementation of this diagnostic work-up may lead to cost savings in the management of patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>persistent</b> cough. (c) 2006 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S. r. l.
