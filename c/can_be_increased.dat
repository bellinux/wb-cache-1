5|$|Pulmonary plethysmographs {{are used}} to measure {{functional}} residual capacity. Functional residual capacity cannot be measured by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum of 80% of their total functional capacity. The total lung capacity depends on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and 6 litres. Females {{tend to have a}} 20–25% lower capacity than males. Tall people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. Smokers have a lower capacity than nonsmokers.

From the moment they hatch their stats <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> with Chaos Drives or small animals, empowering them to compete in karate and racing minigames. Their alignment gradually changes, based on their affection for a characters; for example, a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic.

Although Chao eventually die, if they received enough affection during their lives they reincarnate.|$|E

Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, {{at high power}} levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem {{is transformed into}} another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E
5|$|Friendly and enemy non-player {{characters}} {{inhabit the}} two worlds. Friendly characters can provide Link with assistance or side-quests to complete. Link wields a sword and shield, {{which can be}} used to defeat enemies and deflects their attacks. Other combat items from past Zelda games return, such as the bow, the fire rod, bombs, and more. However, unlike previous games, the methods for obtaining and using these items is different. Rather than finding them in dungeons, they are rented or purchased from a merchant, named Ravio. Should Link fall in battle, his rented items will be returned to Ravio. They also do not require ammunition, instead their use is limited by the replenishing energy gauge. Link's total life energy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> by collecting heart pieces. His weapons can be upgraded by completing a side quest that involves searching for small hidden creatures and returning them to their parent. Link can also participate in several minigames to earn rupees, Hyrule's currency.|$|E
5|$|The Sands the Prince {{collects}} from {{enemies and}} the environment are tied to his magical abilities, themselves connected with the Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince to rewind time by up to ten seconds if he makes a mistake in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also slow time immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while {{they are unable to}} move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more Sand is collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out {{with a small amount of}} Sand available to him, its capacity <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.|$|E

5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|These {{characters}} also assist Mario in the game's turn-based battles, where damage inflicted {{against them}} results in temporary paralysis as the characters {{do not have}} individual HP statistics. Attacks in the game {{are similar to those}} in traditional RPGs, although the player can influence the power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario and his partners have a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points (FP) when performed. Such statistics <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> by earning Star Points (experience points) in combat to level up. There is also an on-screen gauge to display Star Energy, which is required to perform another type of move that accumulate in number as the player advances through the game. The player can locate hidden battle upgrades in the game's overworld, which promotes one partner character to a new rank at a time.|$|E
5|$|When {{taking an}} audition, a judge evaluates the idol over a 30-second period. The judge's {{interest}} level continuously decreases in 10% increments, but this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> with another minigame. The heart points obtained {{up to the}} audition {{are used in the}} minigame as the number of times the player is given to successfully appeal to the judge until all the points are exhausted. For instance, three heart points indicates the player will have three chances to increase a judge's interest level. At the end of the audition, a judge's interest level determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes the audition, he or she is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. For example, an idol starts at rank F with below 10,000 fans, and the next level up is a rank E with between 10,001 and 99,999 fans. The ranks continue from D to C, B, A and finally S.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the previous game's version of the series' Active Time Battle (ATB) system, called the Command Synergy Battle system. Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Abilities, or Item. Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills at a constant rate to a set maximum number of slots. The kinds of attack actions available are close-range melee attacks or ranged magical attacks, {{but there are also}} other magical actions that evoke healing or shielding abilities. The ATB bar <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>increased</b> in size throughout the game from three slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of combat, and the characters' health is fully restored after each fight. Players have the option of restarting a battle while {{in the middle of a}} fight. During some skirmishes, players are put through quick time events called Cinematic Actions that allows them to deal higher damage to foes and end certain battles.|$|E
