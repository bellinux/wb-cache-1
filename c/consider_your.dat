500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people <b>consider</b> <b>your</b> band's signature characteristics and just amplify them and make one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I thought we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, <b>consider</b> <b>your</b> shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, Florance {{was working}} as a floor manager at {{television}} station Channel 2; she said she was only doing one play a year during her holidays to keep her [...] "nose in the theatre".

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} believe the hippocampus is only involved in episodic memory and spatial cognition. This then {{raises the question}} where semantic memory may be located. Some believe semantic memory lives in temporal neocortex. Others believe that semantic knowledge is widely distributed across all brain areas. To illustrate this latter view, <b>consider</b> <b>your</b> knowledge of dogs. Researchers holding the 'distributed semantic knowledge' view believe that your knowledge of the sound a dog makes exists in your auditory cortex, whilst your ability to recognize and imagine the visual features of a dog resides in your visual cortex. Recent evidence supports {{the idea that the}} temporal pole bilaterally is the convergence zone for unimodal semantic representations into a multimodal representation. [...] These regions are particularly vulnerable to damage in semantic dementia, which is characterised by a global semantic deficit.|$|E

[...] For no apparent reason, he refers to Fibber as [...] "Johnny" [...] and Molly as [...] "Daughter". A recurring joke is that he refuses to tell his real name. In the 1940 episode [...] "Mailing Christmas Packages", he is referred to by another character as [...] "Roy", while in one episode (01/29/1946 and reiterated in the episode a week later) he claims his name is [...] "Rupert Blasingame". In the 3/25/41 episode, [...] "Fibber Changes His Name", he appears as Mr. Fumble, a lawyer. Also, in the 3/14/39 episode, Fibber calls him Mr. Sims, but he's having trouble with his memory in this episode, so this may be just an error in remembering, as he also calls Mr. Wilcox [...] "Harpo" [...] for perhaps the first time instead of Harlow, due to poor memory tricks. The Old-Timer's girlfriend is named Bessie, and she usually refers to him as [...] "O.T." [...] In a 15-minute episode {{near the end of the}} series, Mcgee and Molly spend the day trying to find one mysterious [...] "Adleton P. Bagshaw," [...] only to discover him to be the Old-Timer.

2500|$|Lady Zhen bore Cao Pi {{a son and}} a daughter. Their son, Cao Rui, {{later became}} the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. Their daughter, whose {{personal}} name was not recorded in history, was referred to as [...] "Princess Dongxiang" [...] (東鄉公主; literally [...] "Princess of the East District") in historical records. Lady Zhen remained humble even though Cao Pi deeply fancied her. She provided encouragement to Cao Pi's other wives who were also adored by him, and comforted those whom he less favoured. She also often urged Cao Pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants, citing the example of the mythical Yellow Emperor. Cao Pi was very pleased. Once, Cao Pi wanted to send Lady Ren (任氏), one of his concubines who fell out favour with him, back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her. When Lady Zhen heard about it, she told her husband, [...] "Lady Ren comes from a reputable clan. I can't match her in terms of moral character and looks. Why do you want to send her away?" [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "She is unruly, impulsive and disobedient. She has made me angry many times before. I'm sending her away." [...] Lady Zhen wept and pleaded with her husband, [...] "Everyone knows that you love and adore me, and they'll think that you're sending Lady Ren away because of me. I fear that I'll be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me. Please <b>consider</b> <b>your</b> decision again carefully." [...] Cao Pi ignored her and sent Lady Ren away.|$|E
