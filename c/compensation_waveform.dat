40|$|This thesis reviews design, test, and {{verification}} {{aspects of}} Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). A means of improving edge-placement accuracy and waveform quality in high speed, high performance, ASIC test and verification systems has been developed. Its {{aim is to}} minimize timing skew, maintain signal integrity at the Device Under Test (DUT), and actively reduce waveform distortions caused by uncertain DUT loading and transmission path imperfections. Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) is used to measure voltage reflection coefficients of both the load (DUT) and Pin Electronic Card (PEC) ends of the transmission path. Time domain waveform is obtained using Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT). Two prototypes, single and dual directional couplers, have been designed and implemented using Thickfilm-Hybrid Technology (TFH). Both couplers employ strip transmission line structures which support a Transverse Electromagnetic (TEM) propagation mode. FDR experimental results indicate that a matched dual direction. al coupler {{can be used in}} such an application, yielding results comparable to those obtained from an automatic network analyzer. The path between the PEC and the DUT is modelled using a signal flow graph (SFG) technique. The model contains both lumped, and distributed circuit elements, each of which is represented by scattering parameters. Load models that represent the DUT or PEC receiver are obtained through a direct search optimization algorithm. This thesis implements two such algorithms, the pattern search and simplex algorithms, based on an example load model. A technique to compute compensation waveforms for linear transmission paths has been developed. Two examples, matched and mismatched channels, are presented. Simulation results show that compensation waveforms computed from the channel characteristic almost completely correct edge-placement timing errors and greatly reduce reflection effects. Implementation of compensation waveforms by simple hardware is possible, leading to edge-placement correction which is almost as good as that obtained from a theoretically computed <b>compensation</b> <b>waveform...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} low bit-rate video coding {{scheme based on}} {{combination}} of motion <b>compensation</b> and <b>waveform</b> coding. In order to realize appropriate bit-allocation to both motion <b>compensation</b> and <b>waveform</b> coding according to the structural properties of video signals, we employ matching pursuits which can freely control a coding rate of motion compensated frame differences. Moreover we develop a new iterative motion compensation method which can also control a bit-rate flexibly and can successively improve quality of reconstructed images, and combine it with the above matching pursuits seamlessly and adaptively. In other words, motion compensation and matching pursuits are carried out alternatively and repeatedly to attain higher coding performance within a limited coding rate. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} proposed coding scheme shows SNR gains of 0. 3 – 1. 0 dB over the H. 263 standard and provides visually better reconstructed images with less blocking artifacts than it. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ultrawideband pulse radars {{have a great}} {{potential}} for high-range resolution in near field imaging {{and can be used}} for noncontact measuring in precision or specular products such as reflector antennas and aircraft fuselages. We have already proposed a high-speed 3 -D imaging algorithm, SEABED, which is based on a reversible transform, which is the boundary scattering transform, between the received signals and the target shape. However, the estimated image with SEABED is unstable with random noise because it utilizes a derivative of the received data. In this paper, we propose a robust 3 -D imaging algorithm with an envelope of spheres that completely resolves the instability due to derivative operations. Moreover, to enhance the resolution of estimated images, this method is combined with a direct <b>waveform</b> <b>compensation</b> method that does not sacrifice high-speed calcula-tion. Numerical simulations and an experiment confirm that the proposed method can realize fast, robust, and high-resolution 3 -D imaging for arbitrary targets.

40|$|Problems {{encountered}} during {{attempts to}} calibrate SAR imagery, recent successful experiments conducted with SEASAT SAR data, and a proposed {{program for the}} calibration and validation of the radar imagery from the forthcoming SIR-B SAR are discussed. The SEASAT SAR data for 10 passes over Death Valley, California, were processed with a modified digital correlator. The procedure included a preliminary screening of the data to check for raw data saturation, <b>compensation</b> of <b>waveforms</b> and estimation of the amplitude of the pilot tone. All data was normalized to this pilot tone signal to reduce the effects of variable gains in the data links and ground receivers. The digital correlation algorithm generated image data. Evaluation of 6 passes results in a maximum pass to pass gain variation of only 1. 1 dB and a standard deviation amongst the passes of 0. 35 dB. previously announced in STAR as N 83 - 2621...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Through-the-wall imaging {{techniques}} with ultrawide-band (UWB) radars are promising candidates for non-destructive testing and reliable human detection, especially in disaster areas, where victims are buried under collapsed walls. These applica-tions require high-resolution target imaging {{to identify the}} object shape, such as a human body. We have already proposed a high-quality 3 -dimensional (3 -D) imaging algorithm {{in the form of}} En-velope, that is aimed at near field sensing for non-contact measure-ment or target identification for robots. Envelope achieves real-time accurate 3 -D imaging with group mapping from multiple ob-served ranges to target points, and offers a reliable image even in noisy situations. However, this method does not maintain its quality for through-the-wall imaging because an observed range shift due to wall penetration causes a serious distortion in the image. This paper presents a high-resolution 3 -D imaging algorithm by modi-fying the original Envelope, and which gives a more accurate object shape behind a wall. Furthermore, to enhance the resolution of the estimated images, this method is combined with a direct <b>waveform</b> <b>compensation</b> method, known as spectrum offset correction. Nu-merical simulations and an experiment verify that our proposed method achieves high-resolution 3 -D imaging for through-the-wall radar applications.

40|$|Abstract:- A new zero voltage {{switching}} (ZVS) series {{active filter}} (SAF) is proposed. The circuit includes a phase shift based PWM full-bridge inverter. A cycloconverter {{is used to}} control the polarity of output voltage pulses of mentioned inverter. Combination of operation of inverter and cycloconverter results in a continuous compensation voltage. Using the proposed power circuit topology {{it is possible to}} ZVS of all of switches of SAF that results in reduction of switching stresses, power losses and electromagnetic interference. The other advantageous of proposed topology is considerable reduction of size, cost and power losses of isolating transformer that is due to high frequency energy transferring between inverter and cycloconverter. The mentioned SAF could compensate for voltage sag, voltage swell, voltage harmonics and asymmetric voltage quality problems by a smooth <b>compensation</b> voltage <b>waveform.</b> It can recover the absorbed energy from DC side of inverter during switching periods. The circuit can be uses in single-phase as well as three-phase circuits.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{based on}} fuzzy-repetitive {{control for the}} output <b>waveform</b> <b>compensation</b> of single-phase CVCF inverters is presented. The performance of CVCF inverters is evaluated in terms of output voltage waveform distortion with linear or nonlinear loads and transient response due to sudden changes in the load. The fuzzy PD controller is used to improve transient performance whenever the system exhibits an oscillatory or overshoot behavior. It preserves the simple linear structure of the conventional PD controller yet enhances its self-tuning control capability. Since fuzzy PD controller cannot provide good small-signal response, repetitive control is applied to generate high-quality sinusoidal output voltage in steady state. Repetitive control {{can be regarded as}} a simple learning control because the control input is calculated using the information of the error signal in the preceding periods. The repetitive controller is synthesizing to minimize low-order harmonic distortion. Thus, the fuzzy PD controller and repetitive controller can be combined to take advantage of their positive attributes. The control scheme is implemented based on DSP in a 400 Hz 5. 5 kW prototype. Simulation and experimental results prove that the proposed control scheme can achieve not only low THD during steady-state operation but also fast transient response subject to load step change.
