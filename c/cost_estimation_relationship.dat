40|$|The {{satellite}} cost models developed {{based on}} total mass {{has been more}} widely used in the past, but many limitations often make them difficult to apply or achieve desired accuracy. In addition, the compounded errors of such models are further increased by the variety of the missions that these systems are designed to perform. For the new cost model presented in this paper, {{the scope of the}} proposed cost model has been limited to earth observation satellites. These systems are further divided into EO (electro-optical) and SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) satellites. The proposed model can be applied to satellites with masses ranging from 100 to 1000 kg for EO satellites, and less than 5000 kg for SAR satellites. In order to overcome the limitations of the mass-based prediction models, the performance parameter was selected as the variable in a form of System Complexity Index (SCI). Cost Correction Relationship (CCR) is also applied to the cost model to increase the accuracy of the model. The resulting <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimation</b> <b>Relationship</b> (CER) shows that the proposed cost model provides much more accurate results in predicting the development cost of these satellites. The paper describes how the parameters were chosen and applied, discusses details of the proposed cost model, and shows application and results of the model as applied to other conceptual design cases...|$|E

Two major challenges are: (1) lack of validated methods or models, (2) large variation in existing security standards that limits applicability of existing methods. This paper reports an exploratory study in establishing effort estimation model for {{secure operating system}} software development in China. More specifically, we investigate the existing <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>relationships</b> {{in the domain of}} secure software systems, then conduct a comparative analysis of existing Chinese IT security standards and the corresponding international standards, and build a customized estimation model to leverage <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>relationships</b> with the most similar security requirements, with appropriate adjustment to reflect the differences in standards.

40|$|Difficulties with {{estimating}} {{the costs of}} developing new systems have been well documented, and are {{compounded by the fact}} that estimates are now prepared much earlier in the acquisition lifecycle, before there is concrete technical information available on the particular program to be developed. This report describes an innovative synthesis of analytical techniques into a <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> method that models and quantifies the uncertainties associated with early lifecycle <b>cost</b> <b>estimation.</b> The method described in this report synthesizes scenario building, Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) modeling and Monte Carlo simulation into an estimation method that quantifies uncertainties, allows subjective inputs, visually depicts influential relationships among program change drivers and outputs, and assists with the explicit description and documentation underlying an estimate. It uses scenario analysis and design structure matrix (DSM) techniques to limit the combinatorial effects of multiple interacting program change drivers to make modeling and analysis more tractable. Representing scenarios as BBNs enables sensitivity analysis, exploration of scenarios, and quantification of uncertainty. The methods link to existing <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> methods and tools to leverage their <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>relationships</b> and calibration. As a result, cost estimates are embedded within clearly defined confidence intervals and explicitly associated with specific program scenarios or alternate futures...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Access to energy, in {{the form}} of {{electricity}} and fuels, is a necessary condition for development. There are several reasons for biofuels to be considered important in many African countries. They include energy security, environmental concerns, foreign exchange savings and socio-economic opportunities for the rural population. Biofuels such as biogas, biodiesel and bioethanol may be easier to commercialise than other alternatives to crude-oil derived fuels, considering performance, infrastructure and other factors. Biofuels are in use in a number of developing countries (including some African ones for example, Mauritius, South Africa, Kenya), and have been commercialised in several OECD countries, as well as Brazil and China. A good understanding of the production cost of biofuels, and the availability of robust and indigenous <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> models is essential to their eventual commercialization. However, available process engineering <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>relationships</b> and factors are based on plant costs from developed countries, and thus have limited applicability and unknown accuracy when applied to African installations. The need to develop indigenous cost prediction relationships, which is central to economic feasibility studies, is driven not only by the limitations in terms of current data bases and methodologies for the generation of such. There is also a requirement for a more systematic presentation of cost data in equation forms, which will ensure easier and more rapid use of the data in numerical and economic models, and in preliminary design and plant optimisation in a time and cost effective manner, providing decision-makers with key information in the early design stages of a project. It is these shortcomings and challenges that this dissertation attempts to address, through an analysis of the economic input factors, and the development of more robust, indigenous <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>relationships</b> for both capital and operating costs for the biofuels process industry in Africa. The conceptual approach developed within this thesis addresses the current data gaps and deficiencies through analyses of establishment and operating costs of existing biofuels plants both on the continent and elsewhere. It aims to determine which factors most influence the production cost, and then proceed to modify known <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> tools for both capital and operating costs specifically for African biomass-to-biofuel conversion plants as a function of plant size, feedstock, location, exchange rates, and other site-specific variables. Shortcomings in the use of existing <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> models are addressed {{with the aid of a}} literature study, supported by the analysis of African biofuels plant establishment (biogas and bio-ethanol) and operating (bio-ethanol) costs‡. Plant establishment costs are analysed at two different levels of detail, corresponding to the concept development and pre-feasibility phases in the project planning cycle...|$|R

40|$|Most grant {{goals were}} {{accomplished}} {{over the course}} of the grant, albeit only partial success was achieved in applying ASDL s existing advanced design methods to HAVOC. The limited success in applying ASDL's advanced design methods occurred due to: fundamental 20 of 197 limitations in the RSM metamodeling process used; the highly computationally intensive nature of HAVOC as compared to many other advanced system synthesis and sizing codes; and the highly curved nature of low I(sub sp) rocket system spaces. These challenges encountered during the grant led to ongoing efforts in more efficient and robust sequential metamodeling/surrogate optimization based advanced design methods which are expected to overcome all of the challenges encountered with RSM during the grant.

This study assesses {{the reliability of}} multiple regression analysis (MRA), artificial neural networks (ANNs), case-based reasoning (CBR), and hybrid intelligence (Hi) to forecast costs of thin-film transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD) equipment. Newly completed equipment-development projects are provided by departments in a Taiwanese high-tech company, which is a top global producer of TFT-LCD equipment. The cross-fold validation method is applied to measure model performance, reliability, and prediction ease. Through comparison of various performance indices, the Hi method outperforms MRA, ANNs and CBR when used for cost prediction during conceptual stages. Although it is well developed in academia, artificial intelligence (AI) is rarely applied in practical project management. This study successfully describes an actionable knowledge-discovery process using a real-world data mining approach for the high-tech equipment manufacturing industry. Project managers (PMs) can benefit from applying the Hi approach to establish latent non-linear <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>relationships.</b> The Hi approach is empirically proven an effective prediction technique for PMs considering overall evaluation criteria when determining the best selling prices of TFT-LCD manufacturing equipment to clients.

It is called Integrated System Cost Model — ISCOM. This model has been implemented in a tool supporting the important early phase of satellite design. The tool is called MuSSat – Modelling and Simulation of Satellite Systems – provides the user with the means to easily and quickly model all aspects – and the various interdependencies between them – of a satellite system and to compare various alternative designs (Wilke, Quirmbach et al. 1999). Basis of the software tool is a modelling methodology developed at the Institute of Astronautics at the Technical University of Munich, which allows an integrated way of product, process and cost planning. MuSSat supports Target Costing process by allocating Target Costs to functions, objects and processes.

40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} development of a rapid cost assessment models for evaluation of exploration missions through the application of complexity based cost indices. In Fall of 2004, NASA began developing 13 documents, known as "strategic roadmaps," intended to outline a strategy for space exploration over the next 30 years. The Third Strategic Roadmap, The Strategic Roadmap for Solar System Exploration, focused on strategy for robotic exploration of the Solar System. Development of the Strategic Roadmap for Solar System Exploration led to the investigation of a large variety of missions. However, the necessity of planning around scientific inquiry and budgetary constraints made it necessary for the roadmap development team to evaluate potential missions not only for scientific return but also cost. Performing detailed cost studies for each of the large number of missions was impractical given the time constraints involved and lack of detailed mission studies; so a method of rapid cost assessment was developed by us to allow preliminary analysis. It has been noted that there is a strong correlation between complexity and cost and schedule of planetary missions. While these correlations were made after missions had been built and flown (successfully or otherwise), it seemed likely that a similar approach could provide at least some relative <b>cost</b> ranking. <b>Cost</b> <b>estimation</b> <b>relationships</b> (CERs) have been developed based on subsystem design choices. These CERs required more detailed information than available, forcing the team to adopt a more high level approach.

The basis for this marginal abatement <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> is a <b>relationship</b> between the outputs and the inputs of a firm or plant.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the current PhD thesis, a generic concept for the optimization of manufacturing processes of composite material components with regard to product’s quality and cost is introduced. In the proposed concept the configuration of the manufacturing unit is considered as an option for optimizing families of products with regard to quality and cost. For processes offering flexibility in selecting process features and parameters, the concept can be applied straight forward. The proposed concept relies on the consideration of the processes thermal cycle as essential for both the quality and cost of the produced part. It involves a quality sensitivity analysis based on experimental data, which relates the values of the thermal cycle parameters to predefined quality characteristics (e. g. critical mechanical properties) as well as a cost analysis by relating the parameters of the thermal cycle to cost data using the Activity Based Costing (ABC) methodology. Outcome of the above analyses is the derivation of the material dependent Quality Functions (QFs) along with the derivation of the process dependent <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimation</b> <b>Relationships</b> (CERs). The configuration of the manufacturing unit is considered as an option for optimizing families of products with regard to quality and cost. To achieve this, the heating process has been simulated by developing a parametric Finite Element model, so as to virtually conceive heating units and calculate the corresponding thermal cycles. The latter are exploited to calculate quality and cost values using the derived QFs and CERs. The optimal thermal cycle which leads to minimum cost that satisfies the design and quality requirements, along with the allowable thermal cycle windows, is derived, by involving an iterative optimization procedure. To carry out the optimization procedure a suitable software tool, the LTSM-OPT tool, is developed and introduced. The proposed concept has been applied to optimize the ‘cold’ Diaphragm Forming (CDF) process, as well as, the Laser Transmission Welding process (LTW). The thermal sub-process involved in the processes under consideration is numerically simulated such as to allow for the virtual application of the respective thermal cycle on the material. Using the developed software the features of the CDF heating system and the LTW system configuration along with the optimal thermal cycle for producing a helicopter canopy as well as for welding stiffeners on the aircraft fuselage skin, respectively, were obtained. The results of the first study were successfully exploited by EUROCOPTER to install a new flexible CDF facility and produce helicopter canopies by applying the derived optimal thermal cycle. As well, the results of the latter analysis were successfully exploited by AIRBUS to configure and adapt a laser diode source device to weld stiffeners and riblets to the aircraft fuselage skin, and thus produce integral aeronautic structures, by applying the optimized solution derived from the present study. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Project-based {{industries}} face major {{challenges in}} controlling project cost and completing within the budget. This {{is a critical}} issue as it often connects to the main objectives of any project. However, accurate estimation {{at the beginning of}} the project is difficult. Scholars argue that project complexity is a major contributor to <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> inaccuracies. Therefore, recognising the priorities of acknowledging complexity dimensions in <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> across similar industries is beneficial in identifying effective practices to reduce cost implications. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to identify the level of importance given to different complexity dimensions in <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> and to recognise best practices to improve <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> accuracy. Design/Methodology/Approach: An online questionnaire survey was conducted among professionals including estimators, project managers, and quantity surveyors to rank the identified complexity dimensions based on their impacts in <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> accuracy. Besides, in-depth interviews were conducted among experts and practitioners from different industries, in order to extract effective practices to improve the <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> process of complex projects.

40|$|AbstractConstruction <b>cost</b> <b>estimation,</b> {{which is}} {{normally}} labor-intensive and error-prone, {{is one of}} the most important works in the architecture, engineering, construction, and facilities management industry during a project's lifecycle. With the development of information technology, it is expected that the efficiency and accuracy of <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> for tendering of building projects (TBP <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> for short hereafter) can be greatly improved if it can be carried out automatically based on the design results using building information modeling (BIM-based design results for short hereafter). One of the major obstacle to realize the automatic TBP <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> is the acquisition of the construction information (e. g. construction method, equipment), which are necessary for TBP <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> but often not included in the design results. This paper aims to establish an approach to identify and acquire the construction information systematically in order to facilitate the automatic TBP <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> based on BIM-based design results. First, the process of TBP cot estimation based on BQ method in China is introduced and the related specifications are classified. Then a typical specification for TBP <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> is analyzed to identify the construction information that are required in TBP <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> and a typical specification for the requirement on design detail fulfillment is analyzed to identify the construction information that can be obtained from the design result. Next, based on the above results, the construction information that need to be established during TBP <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> are highlighted and an approach to acquire them based on BIM-based design results are presented. Finally, the applicability of the approach is discussed. For simplicity, the scope for the analysis is confined to TBP <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> of concrete construction of reinforced concrete structures in this paper...|$|R
40|$|As <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> is an {{important}} yet problematic part of project planning {{there is a need}} of process improvement to decrease the estimation errors. This paper has two purposes. Based on a qualitative case study conducted at a Swedish automotive company it describes the process of <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> in a real-life setting focusing on inhibitors to accurate cost estimates. Second, {{the results of this study}} are compared with four other studies with a similar purpose of concluding that a company-speciﬁc investigation of <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> inhibitors might give more actionable input to the activity of <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> process improvement than a more general investigation...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{most of the}} {{construction}} companies are using computer-aided softwares for <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> and <b>cost</b> control. The <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> is done before {{the construction}} begins while the cost control is performed during the construction period. The organization which controls the cost could {{be different from the}} organization which prepares the cost estimate. Moreover, different softwares are available for <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> and <b>cost</b> control. This may complicate the cost control process due to inconsistencies between the <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> and <b>cost</b> control data. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a system which could integrate the <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> and <b>cost</b> control processes. Such integration enables the transfer of <b>cost</b> <b>estimation</b> data automatically to the cost control process. Therefore, complete information regarding the cost status of the project can be accessed at any time. Systems Analysis and Design (SAD) approach using relational database management system is used to develop the integration model. MS Access ™ is used as a physical tool to implement and test the system. This paper provides a glimpse of the requirements analysis, system development and implementation stages...|$|R
