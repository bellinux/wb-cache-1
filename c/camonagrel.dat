40|$|Hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction {{in isolated}} blood-perfused rat lung; modulation by thromboxane A, platelet-activating factor, cysteinyl leukotrienes and endothelin- 1. S. CH£OPICKI, J. B. BARTUŒ, R. J. GRYGLEWSKI. Pol. J. Pharmacol., 2002, 54, 433 – 441. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is mediated by hypoxia-induced closure of voltage-gated potassium channels in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. It is also claimed that various vasoconstrictor mediators such as thromboxane A (TXA 2 2), platelet activating factor (PAF), cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs) or endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) contribute to HPV. Their role, however, has not been unequivocally accepted. On the contrary, {{it is well known}} that endothelium-derived nitric oxide negatively modulates HPV. Since NO counteracts action of vasoconstrictor mediators, we tested the hypothesis that modulatory role of TXA 2, PAF, cys-LTs and ET- 1 in HPV would become apparent in absence of endogenous NO. For that purpose we assessed contribution of these mediators to HPV in the isolated blood-perfused rat lung pretreated with a nonselective NOS inhibitor, L-NAME. HPV, which was greatly augmented by L-NAME (300 �M) alone, was inhibited neither by a TXA synthase inhibi- 2 tor (<b>Camonagrel,</b> 300 �M), nor by a PAF receptor antagonist (WEB 2170, 100 �M), nor by an inhibitor of five-lipooxygenase-activating protein (MK 886, 10 �M), nor by a non-selective ET- 1 receptor antagonist (LU 302872, 30 �M). In summary, in isolated blood-perfused rat lung, TXA 2, PAF, cys-LTs and ET- 1 seem not to be involved in HPV, whereas we confirm the dominant role of endogenous NO in blunting HPV...|$|E
