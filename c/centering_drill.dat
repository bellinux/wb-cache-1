50|$|<b>Center</b> <b>drills</b> are {{available}} with two different included angles; 60 degrees is the standard for drilling centre holes (for example for subsequent centre support in the lathe), but 90 degrees is also common and used when locating holes prior to drilling with twist <b>drills.</b> <b>Center</b> <b>drills</b> are made specifically for <b>drilling</b> lathe <b>centers,</b> but are often incorrectly used as spotting drills.|$|R
25|$|<b>Center</b> <b>drill</b> bits, {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe drill bits, {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the center of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe center. However, the true purpose of a <b>center</b> <b>drill</b> bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a spotting drill bit (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call <b>center</b> <b>drill</b> bits combined-drill-and-countersinks {{in order to make it}} unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).|$|R
50|$|A {{center is}} {{inserted}} into a matching hole <b>drilled</b> by a <b>center</b> <b>drill.</b> The hole is conical near {{and at the}} surface, and cylindrical, deeper.|$|R
25|$|Most modern solid-carbide bits {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a spot drill bit or a <b>center</b> <b>drill</b> bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or <b>center</b> <b>drill</b> bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.|$|R
50|$|<b>Center</b> <b>drill</b> is A two-fluted tool {{consisting}} of a twist drill with a 60° countersink; used to <b>drill</b> countersink <b>center</b> holes in a work piece to be mounted between centers for turning or grinding.|$|R
40|$|Radial crack replicas {{serve as}} {{evaluation}} standards. Technique entails intimately joining {{two pieces of}} appropriate aluminum alloy stock and <b>centering</b> <b>drilled</b> hole through and along interface. Bore surface of hole presents two vertical stock interface lines 180 degrees apart. These lines serve as radial crack defect replicas during eddy-current technique setup and verification...|$|R
50|$|Mansfield Armory, is a {{historic}} National Guard armory located in Mansfield, Pennsylvania, in Tioga County. It was built in 1938-1939 for the 108th Ambulance Company, 103rd Medical Regiment of the Pennsylvania National Guard. The utilitarian brick, 94 by 104 ft building has a <b>center</b> <b>drill</b> hall rising above the surrounding one story section.|$|R
25|$|Traditional {{twist drill}} bits {{may tend to}} wander when started on an {{unprepared}} surface. Once a bit wanders off course {{it is difficult to}} bring it back on <b>center.</b> A <b>center</b> <b>drill</b> bit frequently provides a reasonable starting point as it is short and therefore has a reduced tendency to wander when drilling is started.|$|R
50|$|A {{pilot hole}} may be drilled {{the full extent}} of the final hole, or may only be a portion of the final depth. The pilot drill may be a {{standard}} twist drill, another type of drill bit appropriate for the material, or, when the primary purpose is precisely locating a hole, may be made with a short, stiff <b>center</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|R
50|$|The National High School Drill Team Championships is a Drill Team Competition, held in Daytona Beach, Florida in {{the month}} of May each year at the ocean <b>center.</b> <b>Drill</b> teams from across the nation {{converge}} to compete in both the Master's and the Challenge level competitions. This event is currently the largest centralized drill team event. The company which runs the competition is Sports Network International, which hosts football and other Junior ROTC events as well.|$|R
50|$|Some {{self-tapping}} screws are also self-drilling, which means that, {{in addition to}} the tap-like flute in the leading threads, there is also a preliminary drill-like fluted tip that looks much like the tip of a <b>center</b> <b>drill.</b> These screws combine a thrilling-like action and the fastener installation itself into only one driving motion (instead of separate drilling, tapping, and installing motions); they are thus very efficient in a variety of hard-substrate applications, from assembly lines to roofing.|$|R

50|$|Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 25 or NMCB 25 is a Navy Reserve Seabee unit based {{out of the}} Mid-west. Its {{headquarters}} was in Fort McCoy, Wisconsin (1995-2013). There {{are several}} Naval Reserve support <b>drill</b> <b>centers</b> throughout the Midwest Chicago, Minneapolis, Greenbay, Milwaukee, and Rock Island. <b>Drill</b> <b>center</b> Madison no longer supports NMCB 25.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Center</b> <b>drill</b> bits {{are meant}} to create a conical hole for [...] "between centers" [...] {{manufacturing}} processes (typically lathe or cylindrical-grinder work). That is, they provide a location for a (live, dead, or driven) center to locate the part about an axis. A workpiece machined between centers can be safely removed from one process (perhaps turning in a lathe) and {{set up in a}} later process (perhaps a grinding operation) with a negligible loss in the co-axiality of features (usually TIR < and TIR < [...] is held in cylindrical grinding operations, as long as conditions are correct).|$|R
5000|$|Pagan Muzak is a {{landmark}} industrial-noise 7" [...] vinyl released by NON. The release was pressed with 17 tracks of locked grooves and includes an off <b>center</b> hole <b>drilled</b> for an alternate method of play.|$|R
25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of <b>center</b> <b>drill</b> bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill bit, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} of lathes within the metalworking field. Some variations {{are not all}} that obvious, and others are more a niche area. For example, a centering lathe is a dual head machine where the work remains fixed and the heads move towards the workpiece and machine a <b>center</b> <b>drill</b> hole into each end. The resulting workpiece may then be used [...] "between centers" [...] in another operation.The usage of the term metal lathe may also be considered somewhat outdated these days, plastics and other composite materials are in wide use and with appropriate modifications, the same principles and techniques may be applied to their machining as that used for metal.|$|R
50|$|GSP Training Center was {{established}} in 2009.

50|$|When {{drilling}} with {{a hand-held}} drill {{the flexibility of}} the bit is not the primary source of inaccuracy—it is the users hands. Therefore, for such operations, a center punch is often used to spot the hole <b>center</b> prior to <b>drilling</b> a pilot hole.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Fumio Inagaki is a geomicrobiologist whose {{research}} {{focuses on}} the deep subseafloor biosphere. He is {{the deputy director of}} the Research and Development <b>Center</b> for Ocean <b>Drilling</b> Science and the Kochi Institute for Core Sample Research, both at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).|$|R
50|$|Gun {{drilling}} {{was originally}} developed to drill out gun barrels {{and is used}} commonly for drilling smaller diameter deep holes. The depth-to-diameter ratio can be even greater than 300:1. The key feature of gun drilling is that the bits are self-centering; this is what allows for such deep accurate holes. The bits use a rotary motion similar to a twist drill; however, the bits are designed with bearing pads that slide along {{the surface of the}} hole keeping the <b>drill</b> bit on <b>center.</b> Gun <b>drilling</b> is usually done at high speeds and low feed rates.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, an {{analysis}} of several functioning projects has been carried out, where their specifics were thoroughly studied and conclusions made. One of the important parts of the work was devoted to the requirements to integrated template structures conceived in relevant NORSOK, ISO and DNV standards. The Main elements of Subsea Production Modules are considered in the work, their specific characteristics and components. Arctic metocean conditions that can affect selection, installation and the operational conditions of templates are analyzed. Operations and installation of subsea modules at Shtokman location are considered in the Thesis. 4 scenarios with different numbers of integrated template structures (2, 3, 4 and 6) and different numbers of wellslots in each were suggested and analyzed. For each scenario {{an analysis}} of related marine operations for the subsea modules was carried out. A program for installation cost estimates was built that enabled us to find the optimal scenario for the integrated template structures design. Various parameters affecting the cost of subsea infrastructure were analyzed and studied from different perspectives, e. g. geometrical well pattern system, the distance between <b>drilling</b> <b>centers,</b> <b>drilling</b> costs, etc. Risk analysis regarding the threats and consequences is also performed; risk assessment matrices and mitigation actions are established. As a result, a model for selecting an optimal Integrated Template Structure for the arctic/subarctic regions and Shtokman phase I field development was built...|$|R
50|$|At full size, the College {{was able}} to support a Headmaster couple, two Assistant Masters, and a steward. The staff and Headmaster shared out {{teaching}} responsibilities, which <b>centered</b> on <b>drilling</b> the pupils in Latin, Greek, modern languages and mathematics in preparation for university. Despite its small size, Lurgan {{came to be seen}} as an Irish grammar school of the first rank, and its pupils collected more than their numerical share of the honours and prizes distributed to Irish students in those days. One of the College's students was the future Belfast solicitor Albert Lewis, who studied there in 1879-1880.|$|R

5000|$|A {{prick punch}} {{is similar to}} a center punch but used for marking out. It has a sharper angled tip to produce a {{narrower}} and deeper point. It is also known as a dot punch. The mark can then be enlarged with a <b>center</b> punch for <b>drilling.</b> The tip of a prick punch is 40 degrees (the angle depends on what type of prick punch you are using.) ...|$|R
50|$|This type of rig is {{commonly}} used in connection with oil and/or natural gas drilling. There are more jackup rigs in the worldwide offshore rig fleet than other type of mobile offshore drilling rig. Other types of offshore rigs include semi-submersibles (which float on pontoon-like structures) and drillships, which are ship-shaped vessels with rigs mounted in their <b>center.</b> These rigs <b>drill</b> through holes in the drillship hulls, known as moon pools.|$|R
40|$|A new spindle’s axial {{thermal growth}} model based on {{temperature}} variation is proposed considering {{the limitations of}} spindle’s axial thermal growth model based on rotating speed. The model based on temperature variation is thereafter derived, and its mechanism is analyzed. It is found that model based on temperature variation is more robust. In the proposed model, a filtering method for calculating error and the identification process for parameters are also presented. The environmental temperature variation error and the repeatability of thermal growth at a constant rotating speed were investigated using a <b>drilling</b> <b>center.</b> Thereafter, the thermal growths at different rotating speeds were investigated using the same <b>drilling</b> <b>center.</b> Furthermore, the thermal growth with the disturbance of cooler was investigated using a milling center. The comparison of model based on rotating speed and model based on temperature variation is simulated, and {{the results indicate that}} the robustness of model based on temperature variation for rotating speeds and disturbance of cooler is stronger than model based on rotating speed. Finally, the experimental verification is carried out...|$|R
40|$|Properly {{designing}} a well’s drilling plan {{can be one}} of the most demanding engineering challenges. World-class wells should simultaneously meet cost, life-cycle productivity, safety, environmental and time constraints. Because of the complexity and ambiguity of such operations, real-time decision making can play an important role in the construction and maintenance of any hydrocarbon producing well. This paper discusses the current state of the art for the use of Real Time Operations (RTO) within the industry. An overview is given of the use of real-time updating of geological information and models to optimize well bore placement, production and ultimate recovery. The use of RTO and the development of RTO <b>Centers</b> for <b>Drilling</b> and Completions and Production Optimization are discussed in the context of geologically optimized productivity...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the Texas Oil Boom took hold {{creating}} tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largest passed by Austin at first, {{with the city}} slipping from 4th largest to 10th largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920. Bastrop, however, became a significant <b>center</b> for oil <b>drilling</b> and coal mining in the early-to-mid-20th century. San Marcos, and some other communities, established significant manufacturing operations during the world wars substantially diversifying their economies.|$|R
50|$|When {{two pieces}} of wood are {{to be joined by}} dowels {{embedded}} in blind holes, there are numerous methods for aligning the holes. For example, pieces of shot may be placed between the wood pieces to produce indentations when the pieces are clamped together; after the clamp is released, the indentations indicate the <b>center</b> points for <b>drilling.</b> Dowel <b>centers</b> are simple and inexpensive tools for aligning opposing blind holes. Various commercial systems, such as Dowelmax, have been devised to solve this problem.|$|R
