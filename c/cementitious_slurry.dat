40|$|ABSTRACT: Information on the {{influence}} of impregnation of <b>cementitious</b> <b>slurry</b> at the soil-structure interface of bored cast in-situ foundation is inadequate in available literatures. Moreover, influence of such impregnation on negating the detrimental effects of smear zone, formed by construction tools, surrounding the borehole is also unknown. In classical foundation engineering, influences of smear and impregnation are neither considered as dependent functions in determining contributory or negative shaft resistances, nor in shaft and base resistance interaction. This ignorance contributes empiricism in bearing capacity evaluation recognising it as one of the possible causes of variation of field performance with respect to prediction. Solution to these problems has been explored through field and simulated laboratory studies of smear and impregnation, developing new device and technique. Further, an approach to interface modelling of soil-structure is presented considering impregnation. ...|$|E
40|$|Cement-bitumen {{composites}} {{are produced}} by pouring selected <b>cementitious</b> grout <b>slurries</b> {{onto the surface of}} open graded asphalt skeletons, which subsequently filled the voids under the influence of gravitational action. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the mechanical properties of cement-bitumen composites as an alternative semi-flexible pavement surfacing material. This involves the selection of acceptable proportions of cementitious grouts as well as the development of satisfied grouted pavement mixes. The cementitious grout mixtures, open graded asphalt skeletons and grouted pavement mixes were tested for physical, strength and deformation performances...|$|R
50|$|This {{housing estate}} was mostly built by Wimpey around 1955, the {{majority}} of properties were built out of no fines by a method of cast pouring. The 'pour' contains 'no fine' particles (sand) and as such {{is a mixture of}} crushed pebbles and <b>cementitious</b> liquid <b>slurry.</b> The no fines building process allows for the quick construction of structures. Henley Green, Wood End and other 'council estates' were built to house an influx of workers who were mostly arriving in Coventry during a boom in the Car and other local industry.|$|R

A number of chemical activators including Na(2) SiO(3) (.) 9 H(2) O, NaOH, Na 2 SO 4 and CaCl(2) (.) 2 H(2) O were individually added at varying concentrations to bottom ash/Portland cement mixtures having different bottom ash contents. The effect of the selected compounds was evaluated in terms of macroscopic properties including mechanical strength and composition of <b>cementitious</b> materials/water <b>slurries.</b> The results showed that Na-based activators were not capable of improving {{the characteristics of the}} cementitious products if compared to Portland cement under both normal and accelerated curing. Conversely, the use of calcium chloride at 40 degreesC-curing did promote the pozzolanic properties of bottom ash, leading to UCS values of 45. 5 and 60. 0 MPa after 10 and 20 days, respectively, as opposed to a value of 43. 6 MPa obtained after 28 days for Portland cement under normal curing conditions.

40|$|The {{definition}} of the adhesion itself presents a duality : on the one hand, adhesion is understood to be a process through which two bodies are brought together and attached (bonded) to each other, {{in such a manner}} that external force or thermal motion is required to break the bond. The term "adhesion" (or "sticking") is usually applied in this sense in colloid research on coagulation phenomena. On the other hand, we may examine the process of breaking a bond between bodies that are already in contact; and here, as a quantitative measure of the intensity of adhesion, we can take the force or energy required to separate the two bodies. We studied this problem in the context of repairing mortars laid down on a concrete support; we focused our research on the behaviour of a <b>cementitious</b> <b>slurry</b> applied on two types of concrete support, characterised by their surface preparation (sandblasted and polished surface). We measured and observed the penetration of this slurry into the concrete support. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{oil and gas}} wells construction, one of {{the most}} {{critical}} processes is oil well cementing, whose function is to provide a zonal isolation between the pipe and sedimentary formation. For these reasons, one of the needs in the oil industry, specifically in cementing wells area, is the use of materials with high performance, in order to enhance the useful well's life, and reduce costs associated with their repair or losses due to failures in the cementing. Currently, the efforts in the area of high performance materials for oil wells cementing are focused on the development and use of Nanotechnology, science that study materials at nanoscale (10 - 9 m) and offers means to obtain substantial changes in the chemical, physical and mechanical properties, due to the increase of their surface that allows them to have a high reactivity. The cement is a complex mixture of inorganic chemical compounds, that contain mainly calcium silicates, aluminates (C 3 S, C 2 S, C 3 A), and gypsum. In the <b>cementitious</b> <b>slurry</b> preparation, the cement is put up in contact with water, producing the C-S-H gel as the main hydration product, with an amorphous initial structure that generate a mixture of solid final crystalline phases sometimes in the nanoscale sizes. This final structure is responsible for providing its mechanical properties. Therefore, their comprehension, modification and size control at nanoscale could enable the production of cementitious systems with improved properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} safety {{research area}} for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is to eliminate the occurrence of coal mine explosions or to mitigate their effects. One approach is to develop and evaluate new and innovative seal designs that provide increased explosion protection for mining personnel. The NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) cooperated with HeiTech Corp. of Virginia, Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd. of Queensland, Australia, and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in three separate research programs to evaluate the strength characteristics and air leakage resistance of numerous innovative seal designs and ventilation control structures for use in underground coal mines. For each phase of the program, various full-scale seals, stoppings, and an overcast design were constructed in PRL's Lake Lynn Experimental Mine near Fairchance, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. The seals and stoppings were built in crosscuts and were subjected to explosions to evaluate their strengths. Four pumpable cementitious seal designs ranging in thickness from 610 to 915 mm (24 to 36 in) were evaluated in the first cost-reimbursable research program with HeiTech Corp. A simple wooden framework with brattice liner {{was used as a}} form to contain the <b>cementitious</b> <b>slurry</b> during the curing period. As the seal designs decreased in thickness, higher compressive strength cementitious grout was used. All four seals withstood an explosion pressure pulse of at least 138 kPa (20 psi) while maintaining acceptable air leakage resistance. In the second cost-reimbursable research program with Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd. of Australia, several innovative seal and stopping designs and an overcast design were evaluated. Each of the seal designs and the overcast side and wing walls used one or more air-inflated vinyl bladder assemblies anchored to the mine roof and hitched into the ribs and floor. The air within these bladders was displaced with a high-strength cementitious grout. The overcast deck consisted of a 200 -mm (7. 8 -in) thick reinforced cementitious slab. This {{was the first time that}} an overcast structure had been explosion tested under full-scale conditions. All of the seals, stoppings, and overcast design passed the air leakage tests before being subjected to a series of explosions with static pressure pulses ranging from 14 to 475 kPa (2 to 69 psi). Instrumentation measured seal and overcast wall displacement as a function of time. The 450 -mm(17. 7 -in) thick seal in the 2. 8 -m(9 -ft) high third crosscut withstood an explosion pressure of 170 kPa (25 psi), but failed during a later test, which generated a peak static pressure of 475 kPa (69 psi) at the seal location. A similar 450 -mm-thick seal in the 2. l-m (7 -ft) high second crosscut withstood three explosion tests, which generated peak static pressures of 195, 205, and 370 kPa (28, 30, and 54 psi) at the seal location. Next, the overcast design withstood four explosions, which generated static overpressures ranging from 16 to 47 kPa (2. 3 to 6. 8 psi). A third program at the request of MSHA evaluated the effectiveness of using pressurized grout bags (Packsetter bags) along the mine roof and ribs in lieu of floor and rib hitching for a standard-type solid- concrete-block seal. This program was initiated to address an unusual geological mining condition encountered when building seals in entries where required rib hitching is not a viable option due to soft friable coal. Results showed that the use of these quick-setting grout-filled Packsetter bags pressurized internally to 300 kPa (44 psi) not only provides a seal that can withstand a l 38 -kPa static pressure explosion, but also provides a sealing option where rib hitching is not possible.

40|$|Condition {{assessment}} of reinforced concrete piles supporting a sugar storage shed was undertaken {{to investigate the}} cause and extent of observed defects. The piles were 45 {{years old at the}} time of inspection. It was determined that several deterioration mechanisms were actively occurring in the above ground section of the piles. These included reinforcement corrosion due to chloride ions and carbonation, alkali-silica reaction, sulphate attack and salt hydration distress. Extensive repairs to the piles had been performed since 1972. The types of repairs included shotcrete patches and concrete collars. <b>Cementitious</b> waterproofing <b>slurries</b> and organic coatings had been used on selected piles for protection. Variations in shotcrete materials had also been explored. The project provided a valuable opportunity to observe the actual performance of different repair strategies and materials over an extended period in an aggressive environment. Shotcrete repairs were considered to have performed significantly better than the other solutions, particularly where removal of contaminated but undamaged concrete was adequate. Further repairs were recommended where deterioration was evident or where prior repairs were showing indications of failure, in order to extend the life of the shed piles for a further 30 years. This paper presents discussion of the different operating deterioration mechanisms, how these have been manifested and progressed, the performance of prior repairs and current repair activities...|$|R
