5|$|The FSM {{government}} {{estimated that}} residents on Fais and Ulithi would need food rations for 3–6 {{months following the}} typhoon. Debris removal at Chuuk International Airport allowed for flights to the state to resume on April1. Emergency assistance across the nation was hampered by the remote and small nature of the islands it comprises. In many instances, <b>communities</b> <b>can</b> only be reached by boat. Further complicating issues was {{the large number of}} trees uprooted or downed by the storm which blocked numerous roads. Generators had been supplied to Ulithi and Fais by April6, allowing for water pumps to be activated and supply clean water. Power and water supply was gradually restored, although many remained without power by two weeks after the storm. On April6, a United States Coast Guard helicopter provided an aerial assessment of the islands affected. Damage assessment was difficult due to the many sparse islands affected across open ocean. Relief supplies stockpiled by the Micronesian Red Cross were distributed {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Maysak; however, these supplies were exhausted by April8. On April14, the FSM government sent a patrol boat to Chuuk, delivering rice, ramen noodles, and water.|$|E

25|$|The other Enlightenment {{debate about}} common sense, {{concerning}} common sense {{as a term}} for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues {{to be important in}} discussion of social science, and especially economics.

25|$|Further, food {{insecurity}} among undocumented <b>communities</b> <b>can</b> {{in some cases}} be traced to environmental injustices. Researchers argue that climate change increases {{food insecurity}} due to drought or floods and that the discourse must address issues on food security and on the food systems of the U.S. Another example may be large populations of undocumented communities along the Central Valley of California.

For example, in a nahuatl community near Mexico City, stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, does not replace it or give back {{in some way to}} the ahuaque, the protagonist dies. In this way, storytelling serves as a way to teach what the community values, such as valuing the environment.|$|E
25|$|Dominant {{native plants}} {{are capable of}} {{inhibition}} of EcM fungi on the roots of neighboring plants through the release of chemical compounds or through competitive interactions. Some invasive plants are capable of inhibiting the growth of native ectomycorrhizal fungi through similar mechanisms, especially if they become established and dominant. Invasive garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata, and its allelochemical benzyl isothiocyanate were shown to inhibit the growth of three species of EcM fungi grown on white pine (Pinus strobus) seedlings. Changes in EcM <b>communities</b> <b>can</b> have drastic effects on nutrient uptake and community composition of native trees, which can in turn have far-reaching ecological ramifications.|$|E
25|$|A bill {{signed into}} law in September 2014, {{mandated}} the CARB to draft a financial plan to meet California's goal of putting one million vehicles on the road while making sure that disadvantaged <b>communities</b> <b>can</b> participate. CARB had to change the Clean Vehicle Rebate program to provide an extra credit for low-income drivers who wish to purchase or lease an electric car. CARB also provides assistance to carsharing programs in low-income neighborhoods and install charging stations in apartment buildings in those communities. Under bill SB 1275, low-income residents who agree to scrap older, polluting cars will also get a clean vehicle rebate on top of existing payments for junking smog-producing vehicles.|$|E
