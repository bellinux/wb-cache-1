5|$|As large <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> fossil fuels, First World {{countries}} {{drew attention}} to environmental pollution. The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries. Countries that were considered to be developing, such as China and India, were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E

5|$|Frogs are primary {{predators and}} an {{important}} part of the food web. Being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz.

They felt that similarities to the design of the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic typography, would entice <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E
5|$|His music became {{immensely popular}} in Italy and France {{for more than}} a hundred years, with his first book of madrigals being reprinted fifty-eight times by 1654, and his music {{appearing}} in innumerable intabulations for instruments such as the lute, guitar, and viol. Additional hints to his popularity are the frequency with which anonymous compositions were attributed to him, and the appearance of his music in several paintings of musicians from the time. Likely his popularity was due to his gift for capturing the Italian spirit and marrying it with the technical perfection of the Franco-Flemish harmonic and polyphonic style; in addition he wrote catchy tunes which were easy to sing. Unlike later generations of madrigal composers, Arcadelt did not expect professional singers to be the only <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> his work; anyone who could read notes could sing his madrigals.|$|E

5|$|The Italian Heavy Draft was {{originally}} bred to be a versatile horse used in agriculture, urban settings, and military capacities, {{as well as}} for the production of large mules for the military. The breed's docility, size, strength, and speed made it extremely useful for Italian farmers before the introduction of mechanization. It is still used for farming in a few areas where mechanization is impractical. The mares are also still used for the production of mules, although most horses today are bred for meat. Italy is one of the top global <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> horse meat; consumption jumped by 31 percent between 2001 and 2006. Eleven- to eighteen-month-old foals are preferred for slaughter.|$|E
5|$|While Russia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> alcohol per capita in the world, the use of {{non-traditional}} surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing economic difficulties in Russia. With a price far below that of government-regulated vodka, surrogates reached an estimated height of twenty percent of the country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly pure alcohol that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available at all hours via strategically placed vending machines. In the Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable ethanol.|$|E
5|$|In June 1904, {{during the}} experiments, Zammit {{learned that a}} Maltese family of five members became {{simultaneously}} ill after consuming fresh unpasteurized milk from goats. Zammit decided to purchase healthy goats and tested them, {{and at one point}} also kept them {{on the first floor of}} the Castellania (then known as the public health building or the variants). Zammit was successful in the discovery of the disease. David Bruce, who led the MFC, discouraged the experiments when proposed by Zammit. However, when the experiment concluded in the discovery, Bruce tried to discredit Zammit by taking the merit for himself. Information about the role of Zammit was kept low profile or ignored. The fever was renamed after Bruce, as brucellosis. The MFC managed to find cure and ways to eradicate the fever, but had a hard time since there was lack of cooperation with sellers and <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> milk, some dismissing or ignoring the finding. It was under control by 1938, with the enforcement of standard procedures of pasteurizing milk. However, slaughtering of infected animals continued throughout the 20th century and there was another rising challenge for the department in 1994 and 1995.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. and the needs of businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages and bigger catches, and the brewing industry became operational all-year around. As U.S. ice exports diminished after 1870, Norway became {{a major player in the}} international market, shipping large quantities of ice to England and Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Cretaceous saw the fragmenting of the {{southern}} landmass, {{with the opening of}} {{the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and the isolation of New Zealand, while South America, Antarctica, and Australia grew more distant. The diversity of Cupedidae and Archostemata decreased considerably. Predatory ground beetles (Carabidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) began to distribute into different patterns; the Carabidae predominantly occurred in the warm regions, while the Staphylinidae and click beetles (Elateridae) preferred temperate climates. Likewise, predatory species of Cleroidea and Cucujoidea hunted their prey under the bark of trees together with the jewel beetles (Buprestidae). The diversity of jewel beetles increased rapidly, as they were the primary <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> wood, while longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) were rather rare: their diversity increased only towards the end of the Upper Cretaceous. The first coprophagous beetles are from the Upper Cretaceous and may have lived on the excrement of herbivorous dinosaurs. The first species where both larvae and adults are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle are found. Whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) were moderately diverse, although other early beetles (e.g. Dytiscidae) were less, with the most widespread being the species of Coptoclavidae, which preyed on aquatic fly larvae.|$|E
