2500|$|Edward G Budd {{developed}} the first all-steel automobile bodies. His first big supporters were the Dodge brothers. Following discussions {{which began in}} 1913, the brothers purchased from Budd 70,000 all-steel open touring bodies in 1916. They were soon followed by an all-steel Dodge sedan. Budd Company jointly founded and from 1926 to 1936 held an interest in The Pressed Steel Company of Great Britain Limited (Cowley, England), which built bodies for Morris Motors and others, and Ambi-Budd (Germany), which supplied Adler, Audi, BMW, NAG and Wanderer; and earned royalties from Bliss (who built bodies for Citroën and Ford of Britain). The Budd Company also created the first [...] "safety" [...] two-piece truck wheel, used extensively in World War II, and also built truck <b>cargo</b> <b>bodies</b> for the U.S. military.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{originally}} {{envisioned a}} 100-vehicle mixed fleet, but rampant inflation in the 1970s led to budget cutbacks {{that were made}} good by reducing the fleet to 60. The basic passenger vehicle emerged as a four-person design {{that looked like a}} minivan with no [...] "hood" [...] area for the engine. Since the emergency braking was extremely powerful, passengers were seated facing to the rear, and Japanese law already precluded standing in automated vehicles. In some versions, two of the four seats could be folded to allow larger loads, like prams or bicycles. CVS also tested light cargo vehicles, carrying between 300 and 400 kg. Three types of <b>cargo</b> <b>bodies</b> were tried; a flatbed version for palleted cargo that was loaded using two conveyor belts on a trackside [...] "station", another was similar to a pickup truck with a box end, and the last was an enclosed postal van.|$|R

This crane {{is larger than the}} standard Grove cranes found on regular M977 HEMTT and M985 HEMTT <b>cargo</b> <b>body</b> trucks. The truck/crane, called a Guided Missile Transporter (GMT), removes spent missile canisters from the launcher and then replaces them with fresh missiles. Because the crane nearly doubles the height of the HEMTT when not stowed, crews informally refer to it as the [...] "scorpion tail."

40|$|TFM specialises in the import, manufacturing, {{supply and}} support of {{specialist}} truck bodies for the transport, construction, forestry, <b>cargo</b> <b>body,</b> waste and environmental transport industries. The company consists of six separate facilities in the Olifantsfontein area. The project will focus specifically on the Main Plant facility. TFM recently realized that the company's current production and planning systems were outdated and ineffective, and that steps needed {{to be taken to}} improve this. The company decided that reassessing the current enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and bringing in new technologies would be the best course of action. Newer technologies and more modern views of production planning have all contributed globally to better product and process management techniques. The aim of this project is to investigate the methods and technologies that will enable TFM industries to have in time, in sequence, and accurate manufacturing progress information readily available. In the first stages of the project the main goal was to define the project problem statement, aim and scope. The next step was to identify what technologies would be best suited to the project and research each option extensively. The chosen technology was then researched further to determine the technical specifications. The next stage was to identify the available methods, tools, and techniques required to analyse the problem feasibility an...|$|E
40|$|Special ReportThis {{report is}} part of a series {{evaluating}} the data reported to the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. The earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was incomplete. This report examines the factors that are associated with reporting rates for the State of New Jersey. MCMIS Crash File records were matched to the New Jersey crash file to determine {{the nature and extent of}} underreporting. Overall, it is estimated that for 2010, 75. 3 % of reportable crash involvements were reported. Almost 90 % fatal crash involvements were correctly reported. Reporting rates were lower for less severe collisions: 84. 0 % of injured/transported crashes and 72. 3 % of towed/disabled crashes were reported. Low reporting rates of crashes covered by local enforcement agencies were a primary factor in the overall reporting rate. The New Jersey Highway Patrol had the highest reporting rate. Rates were substantially lower for crashes covered by police departments. State police and municipal police departments covered virtually all reportable crashes. Missing data rates on records reported to the MCMIS crash file are low for most variables. Corresponding data elements in the MCMIS and New Jersey crash files were reasonably consistent, except for vehicle configuration and <b>cargo</b> <b>body,</b> though even there only roughly 3 % to 4 % of records differed. Improvements in training to may address this issue. About 75 percent of records were submitted to the MCMIS file within 90 day post-crash period requirement...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study was}} carried out to assess the interference effects between {{the wake of a}} transport aircraft and several generic <b>cargo</b> <b>bodies</b> during the early stage of an airdrop scenario. Based on experimental data and preceding numerical simulations distinct positions of the trajectory being subject to strong interference effects were stati- cally reproduced. The flow field around the bodies was experimentally investigated using stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry and compared to steady and unsteady Reynolds- averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computations. The latter were carried out using the unstructured DLR TAU code. The primary focus is to assess the suitability, accuracy and the limitations of RANS methods in such challenging flow conditions. Therefore, the influence of several turbulence models was investigated and compared to experimental field velocity data. Although deviations {{in the wake of the}} bodies were observed, the qualitative agreement between the steady simulations and experiment was very good. Quantitatively, however, the steady approach leaves room for further improvements. The gap to the experimental data could partially be reduced in applying unsteady RANS methods...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 23) Special reportThis {{is one of}} {{a series}} of papers presenting the results of an evaluation of the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS) Crash File undertaken by the Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Earlier studies showed that reporting to the MCMIS Crash File was significantly incomplete. This report examines the sources of underreporting for the state of Michigan. In 2003, there were 5, 911 crash involvements in Michigan that were reportable to the MCMIS Crash file. 4, 926 involvements were reported for that year, for a reporting rate of 73. 7 %. 303 of the cases reported to the Crash file did not meet the reporting criteria. 92. 4 % of fatal involvements were reported, 73. 1 % of qualifying injury crash involvements, and 73. 4 % of crashes with a towed, disabled vehicle. Unlike many other states, in Michigan reporting officers are responsible to identify qualifying vehicles (trucks, buses, and vehicles placarded with hazardous cargo), but cases meeting the severity criteria are selected centrally. This system likely partially explains the overall pattern of underreporting. Underreporting also is related to the time of year, indicating delays in providing the data. Reporting rates also varied by jurisdiction, with larger communities with more cases having higher rates of underreporting. Data quality is also reviewed. In certain variables, data in the Michigan police report file differed from that in the Crash file for some cases. Some inconsistencies were also noted between <b>cargo</b> <b>body</b> and vehicle configuration in the police report file and in the MCMIS Crash file...|$|E
50|$|Standard {{power unit}} was the Leyland 0.680 rated {{at up to}} 200 bhp with the Leyland 0.600 with outputs from 125-140 bhp as an option, these were mounted {{vertically}} and transversely at the rear. The front axle was a Worldmaster unit and the rear {{was similar to the}} Worldmaster unit but with the driving head inverted. Leyland Self-Changing Gears Pneumocyclic transmission was offered in 4 or 5-speed versions, with electric or pneumatic control. Drive was transmitted from engine to gearbox through either a centrifugal clutch or in later models via a fluid-friction coupling which enabled a solid connection at higher road speeds. An Eaton two speed driving head to the axle was optional. For the Australian market only a third tag axle, mounted ahead of the rear axle, was also offered. This was based on the Worldmaster rear axle but without a driving head, and was fitted into a suspension system based on that of the Albion Reiver 6x2 lorry. The purpose was to reduce axle loading. Most of the 6x2 Lions went to the Western Australian Government Railways and had passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>bodies</b> fitted.|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{unreliability}} of {{the rail}} transports COOP choose trailers and not swap <b>bodies</b> as <b>cargo</b> units. Swap <b>bodies</b> have a lower net weight (three tonnes; they can accommodate 18 pallets) than trailers (ten tonnes; they can accommodate 33 pallets). For COOP, in 90  % of all cases {{the volume of the}} products (rather than the weight) is the limiting factor when filling cargo units. The use of trailers with a higher net weight than swap bodies leads tentatively to higher energy costs per tonne-kilometre; these extra costs are negligible for COOP.|$|R
