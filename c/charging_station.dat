5|$|Following from draft {{plans in}} August 2016, a new {{planning}} application was submitted by Interesting Developments on 16 January 2017 {{to convert the}} pub back into a house as it appeared around 1900, demolishing the 20th century extensions and modifications and restoring historic features such as the interior fireplaces and the oculus window, A separate part to the planning application included three two-storey two-bedroom terraced houses to be constructed on the pub garden, along with a redesigned and landscaped car park to include a <b>charging</b> <b>station.</b> An additional house {{to the rear of}} the pub was considered but not proposed; campaigners criticised the absence of plans to preserve some historic features, the partial demolition of the building and the proximity of the new buildings. Despite objections, planning permission was granted by Medway Council on 13 June 2017.|$|E

The aim of this thesis is to design an efficient photo voltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> and construction of omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station.</b> That's why various models were designed and calculated amount of energy. A photovoltaic <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> has 16 photovoltaic modules with dimensions 1293 mm* 329 mm* 34 mm. In this study five different type of solar <b>charge</b> <b>stations</b> were compared. These are, omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> (first type), south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with different angles (second type), south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with fixed angles (third type), inverse of omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> (fourth type), optimisation of south facing type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> with different angles (fifth type). After calculating of collected solar energy, the fifth type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> was chosen as the most efficient solar <b>charge</b> <b>station.</b> After these theoretical calculations, omega type solar <b>charge</b> <b>station</b> has been installed on the Electrical Engineering Department's roof.

25|$|A {{group of}} EVs and HEVs during their {{charging}} process draw very high current {{for a short}} duration of time which creates power pulsation on the grid. Power pulsation not only reduces {{the efficiency of the}} grid and cause voltage drop in the common coupling bus, but it can cause considerable frequency fluctuation in the entire system. To overcome this problem, supercapacitors can be implemented as an interface between the <b>charging</b> <b>station</b> and the grid to buffer the grid from the high pulse power drawn from the <b>charging</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{market share}} of plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) has been increasing {{in the last years}} which comes along with a raising demand for public <b>charging</b> <b>stations.</b> While the operation of low-power <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> (Mode- 3) is far from being profitable, prospects for fast <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> indicate attractive revenues. This is mainly based on a higher workload (shorter charging times), a higher willingness-to-pay of customers and a higher complementary situation compared to home-based charging [1]. Both also serve for different purposes: Slow charging is performed whenever there is an opportunity while fast charging will also allow short stops to recharge on long-distance trips (interim charging). In this paper, we investigate the potential for combining interim and opportunity charging at one location in order to increase the utilization and decrease the payback time of public fast <b>charging</b> <b>stations.</b> For modeling the operation of Mode- 3 <b>charging</b> <b>stations,</b> we applied the ALADIN model [2] and combine it with results from an optimal allocation of fast charging points in Germany (cf. [3]). Results are presented for four fast <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> around Stuttgart, Germany. Our results show that a combination of long-distance and local customers may increase the occupancy rate and therefore the profitability of fast <b>charging</b> <b>stations.</b> Yet, the willingness to detour of PEV users, the comparably small additional earnings for <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> together with a joint optimized location modelling might be analyzed in further work...|$|R
40|$|With the {{progressive}} exhaustion of fossil {{energy and the}} enhanced awareness of environmental protection, more attention is being paid to electric vehicles (EVs). Inappropriate siting and sizing of EV <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> could have negative effects {{on the development of}} EVs, the layout of the city traffic network, and the convenience of EVs' drivers, and lead to an increase in network losses and a degradation in voltage profiles at some nodes. Given this background, the optimal sites of EV <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> are first identified by a two-step screening method with environmental factors and service radius of EV <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> considered. Then, a mathematical model for the optimal sizing of EV <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> is developed with the minimization of total cost associated with EV <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> to be planned as the objective function and solved by a modified primal-dual interior point algorithm (MPDIPA). Finally, simulation results of the IEEE 123 -node test feeder have demonstrated that the developed model and method cannot only attain the reasonable planning scheme of EV <b>charging</b> <b>stations,</b> but also reduce the network loss and improve the voltage profile...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{develops}} {{a model for}} deployment of public <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> for electric vehicles and hybrids {{in the city of}} Uppsala in relation to the electricity demand. Areas for deployment of public <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> has been determined through traffic flow analysis and is displayed in a map over the city of Uppsala. The model was constructed using three different prognoses for an increase of electric vehicles and hybrids. Through the prognoses the electricity demand has been determined and the number of public <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> in relation to the electricity demand. It could be concluded that future public <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> is difficult to predict due to uncertainties concerning the future electric vehicle market. In this study it is concluded that the number of public <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> would not {{have a significant impact on}} the total electricity use in the city of Uppsala...|$|R
