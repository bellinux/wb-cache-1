40|$|Color-shaded and {{contoured}} {{images of}} global gridded instrumental data {{have been produced}} as a computer-based atlas, available to the climate community through Internet. Each image simultaneously depicts anomaly maps of surface temperature, sea level pressure, 500 - mb geopotential heights, and percentages of reference period precipitation. Monthly, seasonal, and annual composites are available, in either cylindrical equidistant or Northern and Southern Hemisphere polar projections. Temperature maps are available from 1854 to 1991, precipitation maps from 1851 to 1989, sea level pressure maps from 1899 to 1991, and 500 -mb height maps from 1946 to 1991. All images exist as GIP (Graphics Interchange Format) files (1 024 x 822 pixels, 256 color) and can be displayed on many different computer platforms.

40|$|The {{spectacular}} {{progress in}} information technology in recent decades has not always reached Third World countries which need access to scientific and technical information (STI) which is vital to their agricultural and rural development. The use of electronic systems which access information sources directly and the dissemination of this information are particularly difficult, both technically and financially, for these countries. Now CD-ROM (<b>Compact</b> <b>Disc</b> <b>Read-Only</b> Memory) technology offers an attractive solution: the hardware is simple and relatively cheap, and, unlike other systems, {{does not depend on}} telecommunication networks which in developing countries are frequently inadequate, over-crowded and sometimes simply do not work. CD-ROM, allows several databases (the equivalent of a 20 -volume encyclopaedia) to be stored on one disc. It is sturdy, easily transportable and reliable, resistant to heat, damp, dust, magnetic fields and power cuts. CD-ROM is therefore an obvious means through which CTA can fulfil its mission, and its raison d'etre: to facilitate ACP countries' access to STI. CTA took part in CAB International's pilot evaluation scheme in 1986 and, encouraged by the very positive results, launched its own CD-ROM project in 1989 which is implemented by the Netherlands' Royal Tropical Institute/ Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen (KIT). In two years 21 selected agricultural information services in ACP countries have benefited from the project (see table). CTA has provided personal computers, disc drives and printers, as well as the principal databases currently available on CD-ROM. The hardware comes with a word-processing program which allows other uses such as the updating of catalogues, indexes, etc. CTA also funds two-week local training courses for the potential users. These courses are run by experts from KIT. During the two years this scheme has been running the value of CTA's support programme has been confirmed. The programme will be extended in the future.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{definition}} of the information society lays emphasis upon spectacular technological innovation and the transformative effects of new information and communication technologies. The key idea is that breakthroughs in information processing, storage, and transmission {{have led to the}} application of information technology in virtually all, public and private, sectors of society (Webster, 1995). By the 1990 s, to admire and indeed enthuse over new ICTs had become highly fashionable and popular. Such technological enthusiasm has become so pervasive that it has seeped not only into political and policy discourses, but also into the whole spectrum of the media and fora of public communication (Preston, 2001). In addition, discourses of the information society are often dominated and shaped by male commentators (e. g., Castells, 2000; Gates, 1995; Kelly, 1999; Negroponte, 1995). For example, when compiling a collection of the dominant players of international information-society discourse, Cawley and Trench (2004) were hard-pressed to find female commentators, succeeding only in finding 3 {{out of a total of}} 18 critics. 1 We argue that the focus on the artefact, and thus technological celebration, takes precedence over the largely ignored field of technological uses and consumption issues. Hence, we present a study that analyses the individual user experiences to challenge the stereotypical user traditions represented by the information-society discourse. We wish to present a counternarrative that shifts the emphasis from technical expertise, and technological and transformative benefits of artefacts to more individual-user-focused narratives. As a result, this brought about a dual-narrative process through which the respondents described their experiences. We found that when people described their uses, consumption patterns, and domestication 2 experiences of ICTs, they tended to do so by employing contrasting frames of reference. These frames of reference we have termed the objective lens (or narratives) and subjective lens (or narratives). Through what we term objective narratives, we found that some respondents would describe their use through official and technical frames of reference. For example, they employed primarily dominant information-society jargon to frame how they made sense of technologies and their use experiences. Through subjective narratives, we found that respondents would describe their use and experiences from primarily a personal perspective to explain how the technology fitted their lives, the role it played in their everyday routines and habits, and the associated meaning and significance of the artefact. While these contrasting narratives are not mutually exclusive or contradictory, it became clear from the interviews that a pattern of use narratives was emerging. We found that such narratives slightly reinforced traditional gender roles in which men tend to talk about technologies in highly technical terms of reference, while women portray themselves as technologically helpless or ignorant (Gill & Grint, 1995; Gray, 1992; Lie, 1995). Although we did not look for or find stable gender categories, the emergent gender narratives seem to renew the existing gender roles that link masculinity and technology (Vehviläinen, 2002). With the development of computer technologies, we have witnessed a shift from IT to ICTs. This has resulted in a re{{definition of the}} computer as an artefact: from a mere computational device to the newly emergent multimedia-enhanced computers, or what Paul Mayer (1999, p. 1) calls a “meta-medium. ” Today, the conceptualisation of the computer is more problematic. It may be thought of as the Web or Internet, computer games, CD-ROMs (<b>compact</b> <b>disc</b> <b>read-only</b> memory), reference works, e-mail, and a diverse range of applications for displaying and manipulating text, images, graphics, music, databases, and the like. Spilker and Sørenson (2000, p. 270) argue that computers are no longer “primarily about programming, systems, control and calculation,” but instead “a gateway to communication and cultural activities. ” The shift in identity has opened up or unlocked the conceptualisation of the computer. Therefore, it is possible for wider audiences and previously excluded groups (such as the elderly and women) to translate the computer into something meaningful in their everyday lives. As a result, we were not solely focused on the computer as a separate technology, but instead on the wide range of information and communication technologies that are available in the domestic setting. ...|$|E
