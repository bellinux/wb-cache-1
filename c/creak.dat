5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels <b>creak</b> backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 2000, {{a patrol}} from 1 R IRISH left their base in Waterloo to visit Jordanian peacekeepers {{attached}} to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and based at Masiaka. Over lunch, they were informed that the West Side Boys had begun to disarm, despite their initial reluctance, and the company commander—Major Alan Marshall—decided to take the patrol to investigate en route back to their base. The patrol turned off the main road onto a dirt track {{that led to the}} village of Magbeni, where the West Side Boys were based. As they approached the base, they were surrounded by a large group of West Side Boys, who used an anti-aircraft gun mounted on a Bedford truck to block the patrol's route. Marshall dismounted his vehicle, then resisted an attempt to grab his rifle and was beaten. He {{and the rest of the}} patrol were then forced into canoes at the bank of Rokel <b>Creak</b> and transported to Gberi Bana, a village on the other side of the river, just upstream from the point of the initial confrontation.|$|E

25|$|That morning {{observers}} on the 16th {{floor of}} the M Bank Building in Buffalo watched as a gray wall covered the city; it appeared white as it came closer. A blast of wind hit the building that caused the floor to move and the glass window to <b>creak,</b> and then the wall of white enveloped the building. It was 11:10 am.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{problems}} are {{also associated with}} storm water management, with large amounts of sediment being deposited on Coffee <b>Creak,</b> {{on the western side}} of the Conservation Area. This deposition damages native vegetation and habitat. These impacts also mean that there are indirect considerations involving development upstream of the Conservation Area. For example, development upstream and adjacent to Coffee Creek, on the Conservation Area's western side, could detrimentally effect the Conservation Area and its associated reserves. Local water courses are particularly sensitive to pollution and sedimentation.|$|E
25|$|Although Hatch had {{suggested}} that Mason might get as many as 1,400 released Union prisoners, a mix-up with the parole camp books and suspicion of bribery from other steamboat captains caused the Union officer {{in charge of the}} loading, Captain George Williams, to place every man at the parole camp on board Sultana, believing the number to be less than 1,500. Although Sultana had a legal capacity of only 376, by the time she backed away from Vicksburg on the night of April 24, 1865, she was severely overcrowded with 1,978 paroled prisoners, 22 guards from the 58th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, 70 paying cabin passengers, and 85 crew members. Many of the paroled prisoners had been weakened by their incarceration in the Confederate prison camps and associated illnesses but had managed to gain some strength while waiting at the parole camp to be officially released. The men were packed into every available space, and the overflow was so severe that in some places, the decks began to <b>creak</b> and sag and had to be supported with heavy wooden beams.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{time the}} Sunball {{sent her to}} bring him a pair of sandals, and as the girl carried these in her hand she began to lament, saying: 'As <b>creaks</b> the leather so <b>creaks</b> my heart after my little mother.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Something {{outside or}} inside this {{singular}} girl suddenly <b>creaked.</b> Louis, {{who was looking}} at her (which I was not), says she <b>creaked</b> when she curtseyed. Curious. Was it her shoes, her stays, or her bones? Louis thinks it was her stays. Most extraordinary! ...|$|R
500|$|As {{part of a}} tribute, a {{reporter}} for The Daily Sentinel interviewed locals and visitors about their first experience crossing the bridge. Many recalled how nervous they felt as the bridge would <b>creak</b> and sway under load. One stated, [...] "A lot of people {{lost a lot of}} mirrors on that bridge". Drivers with wide vehicles had to fold in their side mirrors to safely cross, as the bridge deck was only [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|An {{excellent}} set-piece {{early in}} the film showcases Robson's underrated directorial skill. Robson creates a dynamic sense of menace from a physical object: a massive giant hook hanging from upon an enormous chain, pendulumlike, inches above the deck. ... hook remains unattended and unsecured. ... In a tightly directed, genuinely exciting scene, the monstrous hook sways {{back and forth in}} a direct path toward the camera, making one wonder how cinematographer, Nicholas Musuraca, kept his camera (and head) intact during the shooting. ... The lighting is also used to great advantage, the shadows and fog accenting the terror. [...] Half the time the swinging hook is so hidden in the darkness that aside from the <b>creak</b> of its sway, there is no telling which direction it will take.|$|E
2500|$|Mill <b>Creak</b> {{is a major}} {{perennial}} tributary, its watershed drains {{large portions}} of agricultural land in the Lowhill, southern Heidelberg and Washington Townships. [...] Mill creek does not enter the preserve but forms its geographic western boundary and joins with the Jordan Creek {{just short of the}} preserve. [...] The creek, whose swift waters eroded the valley in which it flows, separates the preserve from the more westerly State Game Lands 205. [...] Mill creek also provides a perennial source of water which helps to maintain the thicket of deciduous trees (principally oak and maple) which grow on the preserve's north-western boundary.|$|E

2500|$|A nearby Victorian {{gasometer}} {{has been}} {{a feature of the}} view from the ground since the 1800s. A movement to preserve iconic gasometers across Britain has emerged in recent years with the one visible from The Oval often cited as a landmark example. The skeletal but decorative structure is a landmark in the area and has become part of The Oval's history and allure. The famed cricket commentator Henry Blofeld once said in a broadcast, [...] "As the bowler runs in, it’s so quiet you can hear the <b>creak</b> of the gasometer." [...] When plans to demolish the aging structure were announced in 2013, he stated: “In comparison, pulling down the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace would be child’s play.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Sperm whales {{can produce}} three {{specific}} vocalisations: creaks, codas, and slow clicks. A <b>creak</b> is a rapid series of high-frequency clicks that sounds somewhat like a creaky door hinge. It is typically used when homing in on prey. A coda {{is a short}} pattern of 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations to identify one another (like a signature whistle), {{but it is still}} unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates. Slow clicks are heard only in the presence of males (it is not certain whether females occasionally make them). [...] Males make a lot of slow clicks in breeding grounds (74% of the time), both near the surface and at depth, which suggests they are primarily mating signals. [...] Outside breeding grounds, slow clicks are rarely heard, and usually near the surface.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs Williams {{insisted that}} there should be no {{graveyard}} at the church site, and a contemporary local tendency to fear of the subject may have some bearing on this decision. Arabella Elizabeth Tetley, a Beckwithshaw schoolmaster's wife, died of puerperal fever at age 23 years and was buried at Woodhouse Cemetery on Friday 17 April 1888. However gravedigger Fred Posey thought he saw [...] "an upheaval of the earth which he had placed upon the coffin and heard a <b>creak</b> which led him to believe that the buried woman was alive and trying to wrench the lid away." [...] He raised the alarm, saying that he had heard [...] "rattling" [...] in the coffin, and a [...] "knocking such as I never heard afore in a grave" [...] in 42 years of gravedigging. There was an exhumation and an inquest which ruled that there had been no disturbance within the coffin, so that the verdict was [...] "natural causes." ...|$|E

60|$|All waited. Then wheels {{were heard}} from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their {{carriage}} began to move, <b>creaking</b> and swaying.

2500|$|Nonoalco Tlatelolco {{was located}} on Paseo de la Reforma Norte #668, {{covering}} {{an area of}} about two km2. It had 102 buildings with seven medical facilities, twenty-two schools and about 500 small businesses, serving the 80,000 people who lived there. Constructed under the presidency of Adolfo López Mateos, it was considered the most important complex {{of its kind in}} the country. In the Conjunto Urbano, two of the three modules of the building called [...] "Nuevo León", at thirteen stories tall, completely collapsed, while the other one was severely damaged. In other buildings, dozens of people terrified by the event jumped from high windows to their death, trying to escape. People became trapped in stairwells, elevators and their apartments without any way to contact the outside world. At the collapsed building, lines of 50–100 men passed rubble by hand and buckets, trying to reach victims. During these rescue efforts, a nearby building, called Oaxaca, began to <b>creak</b> noisily, causing everyone to run and abandon the site temporarily, but it did not collapse.|$|E
2500|$|After his {{political}} career ended, Orville Hungerford began focusing his energies on establishing the Watertown & Rome Railroad. On April 17, 1832, the New York legislature incorporated the Watertown & Rome Railroad, naming Hungerford {{as one of its}} commissioners charged with promoting the line. Although, the initial act called for track to be laid within three years and the line to be completed within five years, a shortage of capital forced the promoters to seek extensions of the charter in 1837, 1845, and 1847 at which point Orville was elected its first president. He {{played a key role in}} raising the necessary capital. [...] Unfortunately, he never got to see a train complete a journey because he died shortly before the inaugural run on May 29, 1851, covering the 53-mile stretch between Rome to the hamlet of Pierrepont Manor (originally called Bear <b>Creak).</b> The Hon. William C. Pierrepont, who owned the property where the railroad initially ended, followed Orville as president. At 11:00p.m. on September 5, 1851, the first train steamed into the temporary passenger station on Stone Street in Watertown. The railroad named its fifth engine, the Orville Hungerford, in his honor. Delivered to the railroad, on September 19, 1851, this engine, built by William Fairbanks in Taunton, Massachusetts, was twenty-one and a half tons in weight.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kermode, in The Observer, labeled Pan's Labyrinth as {{the best}} film of 2006, {{describing}} it as [...] "an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters". Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film [...] "works on so many levels {{that it seems to}} change shape even as you watch it", and Jim Emerson called the film [...] "a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children". Roger Ebert reviewed the film after his surgery and put it on his Great Movies list on 27 August 2007; when he compiled his belated top ten films of 2006, Pan's Labyrinth was #1, with him stating [...] "But even in a good year I'm unable to see everything. And I'm still not finished with my 2006 discoveries. I'm still looking at more 2007 movies, too, and that list will run as usual in late December. Nothing I am likely to see, however, is likely to change my conviction that the year's best film was Pan's Labyrinth." [...] The New Yorkers Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it [...] "discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small, supercharged noises: the <b>creak</b> of the Captain's leather gloves... the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter...." ...|$|E
