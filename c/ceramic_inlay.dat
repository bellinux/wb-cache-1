40|$|Purpose: Ceramic materials, first {{introduced}} in restorative dentistry {{in the late}} 18 th century, offer {{a wide range of}} possibilities and exhibit esthetic properties. The last systematic reviews on the subject of <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> were published in 2003. All articles published up to 2001 were surveyed regarding the longevity, esthetic qualities, and postoperative discomfort {{associated with the use of}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> compared to other restorative materials. The present review aimed to establish the current state of the art. Materials and Methods: Using methods identical to those of previous reviews, the literature from 2001 up to and including 2009 was assessed. The scientific and methodologic qualities of all articles describing the use of <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> were established. Articles comparing the results of <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> to other types of inlays were then used to answer the hypotheses that there were no differences in longevity, postoperative sensitivity, or color match. Results: Three articles comparing the results of ceramic to other materials were analyzed further. No new reliable evidence was found to update the answer to the hypothesis that there was no difference in longevity, at least in the first year postoperative. The evidence found regarding postoperative discomfort backs the previous conclusion that there was no difference. New evidence found on color matching suggests that there is no significant difference in color match over assessment periods of up to 57 months.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of cavity depth, ceramic thickness, and resin bases with different elastic modulus on von Mises stress patterns of ceramic inlays. Tridimensional geometric models were developed with SolidWorks image software. The differences between the models were: depth of pulpal wall, ceramic thickness, and presence of composite bases with different thickness and elastic modulus. The geometric models were constrained at the proximal surfaces and base of maxillary bone. A load of 100 N was applied. The stress distribution pattern was analyzed with von Mises stress diagrams. The maximum von Mises stress values ranged from 176 MPa to 263 MPa and varied among the 3 D-models. The highest von Mises stress value was found on models with 1 -mm-thick composite resin base and 1 -mm-thick <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay.</b> Intermediate values (249 - 250 MPa) occurred on models with 2 -mm-thick composite resin base and 1 -mm-thick <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay</b> and 1 -mm-thick composite resin base and 2 -mm-thick <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay.</b> The lowest values were observed on models restored exclusively with <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay</b> (176 MPa to 182 MPa).

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{resistance}} of fracture of mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> and composite fillings in premolars and to compare fracture modes between the groups. Material and methods. Twenty seven extracted intact human premolars were selected and divided into three groups: I – intact teeth (control group), II – MOD cavities restored with indirect <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> (Finesse, Dentsply Ceramco, USA), III – MOD cavities restored with direct com-posite fillings (Filtek P 60, 3 M ESPE, USA). The fracture resistance (N) was assessed under axial compressive loading with a metal cylinder 3. 2 mm in diameter at a cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/ min in a universal testing machine. The data were analyzed with ANOVA and t-test (pd£ 0. 05). Fracture modes were recorded based on the degree of tooth structure and restoration damage. Results. The mean force applied to cause failure for group I was 1. 218 kN ± 0. 223, for group II – 1. 407 kN ± 0. 374 and for group III – 0. 941 kN ± 0. 258. T-test showed significant difference between groups I and III (p= 0. 027), and groups II and III (p= 0. 008).

Materials and methodsNinety freshly extracted intact maxillary first premolars were divided into nine groups of 10. One group was an unprepared control. Eight groups of teeth were prepared to create different widths and depths of mesial occlusal distal cavities. Subsequently, teeth were restored with either condensable composite resin or <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay.</b> Specimens were then subjected to axial loading with a 4. 82 -mm diameter steel ball in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5  mm/minute. Loads were applied against tooth structure, and the steel ball did not contact restorative material. Data were analyzed with multiple analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc testing. ResultsMean fracture load of teeth restored with Surefil and a 3 -mm cavity width was greater than in groups with a 2 -mm cavity width (P =  0. 0315).

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{clinical}} survival and long-term costs of extensive composite restorations to <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> and onlays. The hypothesis was that <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> and onlays {{can be more}} tooth substance saving and long-term economic for the patient than composite restorations. Methods: The dental literature, predominantly since 1990, was reviewed for prospective clinical studies of longevity of ceramic inlays/onlays and direct composite restorations in permanent posterior teeth. Only studies lasting at least 1, 5 years and with 30 restorations at baseline were accepted, and retrospective studies, case studies and studies performed at universities were excluded. Results: A total of 20 studies met the established inclusion criteria. Failure rates varied from 4 - 30 % in observation times of 1, 5 years to 18 years for composite restorations, and from 0 - 19 % during 2 - 10 years of follow-up for ceramic restorations. The most common reasons for failure were secondary caries (57 %) for composite fillings and material fracture (64 %) for <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> and onlays. The initial cost ratio of a typical 3 -surface composite filling {{to that of a}} similar sized ceramic restoration was found to be 1 : 4, 4. Conclusions: Bulk fracture and secondary caries are the main causes for failures of ceramic inlays/onlays and composite resin restorations, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the marginal adaptation of CEREC <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays,</b> CEREC composite inlays and direct composite restorations in unbeveled proximal slot cavities under artificial aging conditions. Two groups of each restoration type were prepared (n = 6), one group with a self-etch adhesive, the other group with H(3) PO(4) enamel etching before the self-etch adhesive application. Replicas were generated before and after long-term thermo-mechanical loading under dentinal fluid simulation and margins were evaluated at x 200 magnification in the scanning electron miscroscope (SEM). Statistically, significant differences were found before and after loading with respect to the percentages of "continuous margins", the direct composite filling with H(3) PO(4) enamel etching giving the lowest percentages of "continuous margins" after loading (p < 0. 05). The highest percentage of "continuous margin" was attained by composite inlays without H(3) PO(4) enamel etching.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{different}} restorative systems for class II cavities with regard to their marginal adaptation in enamel and dentin. To achieve a reduction of polymerisation shrinkage ceramic and composite inserts as well as ceramic and composite inlays in combination with a low viscous luting material were used. The good results which have been shown with <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay</b> restorations is often attributed to the benefits of their coefficient of thermal expansion and their high modulus of elasticity. The potential of composite material as a substitute for ceramic should be analysed. Methods: In 48 extracted human molars extended modcavities were prepared with a cervical margin located in enamel and dentin. The teeth were filled with directly placed composite fillings, directly placed composite fillings with prefabricated composite inserts, directly placed composite fillings with prefabricated ceramic inserts, directly fabricated composite inlays, ceramic CAD/CIM inlays and CAD/CIM inlays machined from experimentell Polymer Ceramic blocks (n = 8). Replicas of the teeth were made and evaluated at 200 x magnification according to predefined criteria before thermocyling, after thermocycling and after occlusal loading. The interface was investigated between tooth and composite as well as the interface between inlay and composite. Results: In cervical enamel the directly placed composite filling only showed significantly (p &# 61500; 0, 05) more gaps than all other groups. After loading more irregularities were found in the group composite filling only in comparison to all other groups. In dentin the marginal adaptation showed more irregularities than in enamel. Significant differences were found after loading. Composite inserts were inferior to ceramic inserts. With exception of CAD/CIM Polymer Ceramic, inlays showed fewer gaps than other groups. The adhesive bond between Polymer <b>Ceramic</b> <b>inlay</b> and composite resin based cement showed shortcommings. Conclusions: Composite fillings only show more irregularities and gaps than the inlay technique. The use of inserts is able to reduce the effects of polymerisation shrinkage.

40|$|Thixoforming or semi-solid-metal forming is a {{steadily}} growing {{alternative production}} technique to conventional {{processes such as}} casting or forging. The main advantages of this technique are the feasibility of production of complex part geometries in combination with a high dimensional accuracy (near net shape). Unlike for alloys with a low melting point - e. g. aluminum - the thixoforming of steel alloys causes still many technological problems that make an industrial application of this technique more difficult. For example, {{it is hard to}} find tool materials that withstand the thermal and thermo-shock stresses. Furthermore, the conduction of the whole process requires a high accuracy and reproducibility. In order to overcome these problems the thixoforging process chain is subject of research work at the IFUM. This paper gives an overview about the progress of setting-up a production line that shows the principle feasibility to establish the thixoforming technology for mass-production of industrial relevant parts. The thixotropic behavior of steel can only be obtained in a rather narrow temperature window at a temperature level between the solidus and liquidus temperature. In the introduced production line a computerized process control of the inductive heating process allows the precise setting of the desired temperature. This control system was developed on the basis of simulation and experimental work. In order to avoid oxidation and premature cooling of the parts the handling is done using ceramic transport containers with an inert gas atmosphere inside. Due to the low heat conductivity of the ceramic it is assured that the loss of temperature of the billet will be tolerable. The billet is placed automatically in a previously closed die and formed immediately. The path of the forming force is optimized in order to obtain a good die filling behavior and a pore-free microstructure. After the forming step the die opens and the thixoforged part is ejected and taken away also automatically. The die consists of a <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay</b> that is armored with steel rings to enable the necessary mechanical rigidity. The die is fed with hot slugs in closed state and can be opened completely to eject the part. The tool concept allows the controlling of its heat balance by means of auxiliary heating and cooling devices. This is an important feature in order to avoid thermal cracking of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay</b> of the die. All steps of the production chain are carried out and controlled automatically. This is a necessary requirement to achieve reproducible and predictable results...|$|E
40|$|Patients with a {{severely}} degenerated temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{may benefit from}} an alloplastic TMJ replacement. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop a safe and properly functioning TMJ prosthesis. The design was based on imitation of anterior condylar translation by an inferiorly located centre of rotation, unrestricted mandibular movements by a double articulation, correct fit to the skull by a self-adjusting skull part consisting of two connected parts, and stable fixation by bone screws that are rigidly connected to the prosthesis parts. The prosthesis consists of a titanium skull part with <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlay,</b> a titanium mandibular part,with a ceramic spherical head, and an intervening polyethylene disc. Titanium-alloy bone screws are used for fixation. All parts are available in a number of different shapes. In vitro laboratory and in vivo animal tests showed a low wear rate, the possibility of a close fit to the skull, a stable fixation, sufficient mechanical strength, appropriate choice of materials and proper functioning, Thereafter the step to first patient application was made. First patient application was carried out without adverse events. In conclusion, the presented TMJ prosthesis passed the pre-clinical tests and has progressed to clinical application. The fit to the skull. the expected lifetime of the device and the reliability of the implantation procedure require further evaluation in well-designed clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) {{is a relatively}} new, but highly efficient imaging method applied first in dentistry in 1998. However, {{the quality of the}} obtained slices depends among other things on artifacts generated by dental restorations as well as orthodontic and prosthetic appliances. The aim {{of the study was to}} quantify the artifacts produced by standard prosthetic inlays in CBCT images. The material consisted of 17 standard prosthetic inlays mounted in dental roots embedded in resin. The samples were examined by means of a large field of view CBCT unit, Galileos (Sirona, Germany), at 85 kV and 14 mAs. The analysis was performed using Able 3 DDoctor software for data in the CT raster space as well as by means of Materialise Magics software for generated vector models (STL). The masks generated in the raster space included the area of the inlays together with image artifacts. The region of interest (ROI) of the raster space is a set of voxels from a selected range of Hounsfield units (109 - 3071). <b>Ceramic</b> <b>inlay</b> with zirconium dioxide (Cera Post) as well as epoxy resin inlay including silica fibers enriched with zirconium (Easy Post) produced the most intense artifacts. The smallest image distortions were created by titanium inlays, both passive (Harald Nordin) and active (Flexi Flange). Inlays containing zirconium generated the strongest artifacts, thus leading to the greatest distortions in the CBCT images. Carbon fiber inlay did not considerably affect the image quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of buccal and lingual wall thickness on the fatigue resistance of molars restored with CAD/CAM <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays.</b> Forty human third molars were selected and divided into 4 groups, according to the remaining surrounding wall thickness chosen for inlay preparation (n = 10) : G 1, 2. 0 mm; G 2, 1. 5 mm; G 3, 1. 0 mm; G 4, 0. 5 mm. All inlays were made from feldspathic ceramic blocks by a CAD/CAM system, and cemented adhesively. After 1 week stored in distilled water at 37 °C, the specimens were subjected to fatigue testing under the following protocol: 5 Hz; pre-load of 200 N for 5, 000 cycles, followed by increasing loads of 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400 N for 30, 000 cycles each. The specimens were cycled until failure or completion of 185, 000 cycles. The survival rate of the groups was compared using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves (p > 0. 05). All specimens withstood the fatigue protocol (185, 000 cycles), representing a 100 % survival rate. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no difference between groups. It can be concluded that the remaining tooth wall thickness did not influence the fatigue resistance of molars restored with CAD/CAM <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{popularity}} of all-ceramic restorations {{has increased in}} recent years. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>inlays,</b> onlays, veneers and complete crowns have gained more demands [1]. Today, they are being used extensively in both anterior and posterior tooth restorations because they replicate natural tooth color, and exhibit long term color stability and wear resistance [2]. There are several types of dental ceramics currently used in dentistry [3] and the clinical success and the longevity of these dental prostheses can be affected by multiple factors including the luting cement and the cementation procedure [1].|$|R
40|$|Ten IPS/Empress {{pressed glass}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>inlays</b> were {{cemented}} in box-shaped, non-beveled, Class II, posterior cavities. They were evaluated clinically according to modified US Public Health Service criteria after 1. 5 years in vivo. In addition, quantitative marginal {{analysis was performed}} immediately after placement of the inlays and at the 1. 5 -year recall. Clinical evaluation revealed that the inlays performed well after 1. 5 years; all inlays received scores of Alfa or Beta for all criteria evaluated.
