40|$|This study {{asks whether}} and how the {{features}} that define a language variety co-vary within the communities and speakers said to be representative of it. Of particular interest {{is the relationship between}} multiple variable in a setting known to promote contact-induced language change. The central idea that emerges here is that less salient linguistic variables are more likely to co-vary, that is, to be uniformly influenced by the <b>contact</b> <b>setting,</b> than are variables of higher salience. This claim is supported by an analysis of five variables in the speech of four Spanish-speaking adults, two of whom have lived their entire lives in the <b>contact</b> <b>setting</b> and two who are recent arrivals to it. The variables are (1) filled pauses, (2) the presence vs. absence of subject pronouns, (3) subject pronoun position (i. e., pre- vs. post-verbal), (4) general subject position (the pre- or post-verbal position of non-pronominal subjects, e. g. lexical NPs, clauses, etc.), and (5) coda /s/ weakening, examined in terms of rates of deletion as well two acoustic parameters. It is only with respect to the last of these features, which is highly salient sociolinguistically, that strong regionally delineated continuity in the Spanish of the U. S. born speakers is clearly observed. The four lower salience features have shifted in parallel, increasing in similarity to the use of analogous features in English. These results indicate that in a setting characterized by language contact, the fate of socio-linguistic variables is mediated by salience. Low salience features are more susceptible to the influence of the <b>contact</b> <b>setting</b> {{and are more likely to}} be uniformly reshaped by it. High salience features, in contrast, are differentiated by speakers’ greater awareness of their social signaling potential and are more likely to unfold along autonomous and individuated trajectories...|$|R

50|$|Many {{alternative}} solutions, {{particularly those}} based upon an AC Switch Disconnect design which use bridge contacts, have been modified and rated for DC operation. These types of product have a switching speed that is {{directly linked to}} the operator speed, therefore slow operation of the handle results in slow contact separation of the contacts which can produce arcing times of 100ms or more. Additionally in these switches, the contact surface is also the surface upon which electrical arcs tend to form; therefore any surface damage or sooting caused by arcing {{is likely to have}} a detrimental effect on the isolators contact resistance and its longevity.TRUE DC Solar Isolators use a rotary knife contact mechanism so when the unit is operated, the handle movement gives a double make/break per <b>contact</b> <b>set.</b> As DC load switching creates electrical arcing, the design is such that this only occurs on the corners of the switching parts meaning that the main contact is made on an area where no arcing has occurred. The rotary contact mechanism methodology used in TRUE DC solar isolators means that when the isolator is operated, a self-cleaning action occurs on the arcing points and contact surfaces thereby producing good high-vibration resistant contact integrity, with reduced contact resistance. This contact system ensures that power loss per pole is kept as low as possible, and consistent {{over the life of the}} product, unlike conventional style isolators where entrapment of contaminants, and then subsequent compression on lateral operation, can lead to variable and increasing contact resistance, and hence per pole losses.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{obstacle}} problem with obstacles whose Laplacians {{are not necessarily}} Hölder continuous. We show that the free boundary at a regular point is C¹ if the Laplacian of the obstacle is negative and Dini continuous. We also show that this condition is sharp by giving a method to construct a counter-example when we weaken the requirement on the Laplacian of the obstacle by allowing it to have any modulus of continuity which is not Dini. In the course of proving optimal regularity we also improve some of the perturbation theory due to Caffarelli (1981). Since our methods depend on comparison principles and regularity theory, and not on linearity, our stability results apply to a large class of obstacle problems with nonlinear elliptic operators. In the case of obstacles where the Laplacian is negative and has sufficiently small oscillation, we establish measure-theoretic analogues of the alternative proven by Caffarelli (1977). Specifically, if the Laplacian is continuous, then at a free boundary point either the <b>contact</b> <b>set</b> has density zero, or the free boundary is a Reifenberg vanishing set and the <b>contact</b> <b>set</b> has density equal to one half in a neighborhood of the point.
