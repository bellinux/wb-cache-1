40|$|The {{very high}} {{incidence}} of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Golestan Province in northeastern Iran was suggested by studies in the 1970 s as partly due to opium use, which is not uncommon in this area, but based on limited numbers. From December 2003 to June 2007, we administered a validated structured questionnaire to 300 ESCC cases and 571 controls, matched on neighbourhood of residence, age (± 2 years), and sex. We used conditional logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) adjusted for potential confounders. Compared with those who used neither tobacco nor opium, risk of ESCC was increased in those who used tobacco only (OR, 95 % CI: 1. 70, 1. 05 - 2. 73), in those who used opium only (2. 12, 1. 21 - 3. 74), and in those who used both tobacco and opium (2. 35, 1. 50 - 3. 67). All forms of tobacco use (cigarettes, hookah, and nass) were associated with higher ESCC risk. Similarly, use of both <b>crude</b> <b>opium</b> {{and other forms of}} opium were associated with higher risk. Alcohol consumption was seen in only 2 % of the cases and 2 % of the controls, and was not associated with ESCC risk. © 2008 Cancer Research...|$|E
50|$|During the 1800s, pharmacists {{specialized}} in the raising, preparation and compounding of crude drugs. <b>Crude</b> drugs, like <b>opium,</b> are from natural sources and usually contain several chemical compounds. The compounding pharmacist often extracted these crude drugs using water or alcohol to form extracts, concoctions and decoctions.|$|R

50|$|A poppy is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} subfamily Papaveroideae of the family Papaveraceae. Poppies are herbaceous plants, often grown for their colorful flowers. One species of poppy, Papaver somniferum, {{is the source of}} the <b>crude</b> drug <b>opium</b> which contains powerful medicinal alkaloids such as morphine and has been used since ancient times as an analgesic and narcotic medicinal and recreational drug. It also produces edible seeds. Following the trench warfare which took place in the poppy fields of Flanders during World War I, poppies have become a symbol of remembrance of soldiers who have died during wartime.|$|R
40|$|Background: Today opium {{dependence}} {{is widely}} prevalent in certain states of India, especially Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh (MP) etc. In {{rural areas of}} western Rajasthan <b>crude</b> <b>opium</b> is consumed with a social acceptance by a notable proportion (8. 0 %) of adult male population. Later on they become addicted to it. Objective: to observe the changes in some liver and lung function parameters in opium addicted subjects of Barmer city of Western Rajasthan. Methods: The present {{study was conducted in}} district hospital of Barmer, Rajasthan. Total fifty (50) adult male subjects with age ranged from 30 to 50 years were participated in this study. Among them 25 were opium addicted and were considered as study group (Group B) and another 25 apparently healthy adult male of same age group were designated as control group (Group A). Opium addicts were consuming about 5 – 11 gm/day opium for > 2 years. Then liver function tests were evaluated by estimating serum aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and lung function tests by measuring FVC, FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC%, PEF, FEF 25 - 75 % of both the groups. Results: In this study AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase levels were found significantly (p<. 05) higher in group B as compared to those of group A. Again, FVC, FEV 1, FEV 1 / FVC were significantly (p<. 05) lower in group B as compared to those of group A. PEF (L/sec) and FEF 25 - 75 % were also significantly (p< 0. 001) lower in group B as compared to those of group A. Conclusion: it is concluded that chronic long term use of opium, increases the risk of hepatic and pulmonary damage...|$|E
