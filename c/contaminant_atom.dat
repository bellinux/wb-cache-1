40|$|In this work, {{we discuss}} the {{characteristics}} of particular island-type features with an amorphous core that are developed during the low temperature epitaxial growth of Ge and GeSn layers by means of chemical vapor deposition with Ge 2 H 6. Although further investigations are needed to unambiguously identify the origin of these features, we suggest that they are originated by the formation of clusters of H and/or <b>contaminants</b> <b>atoms</b> during growth. These would initially cause the formation of pits with crystalline rough facets over them, resulting in ring-shaped islands. Then, when an excess surface energy is overcome, an amorphous phase would nucleate inside the pits and fill them. Reducing the pressure and/or increasing the growth temperature can be effective ways to prevent the formation of these features, likely due to a reduction of the surface passivation from H and/or <b>contaminant</b> <b>atoms.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Strong dipole-exchange {{interactions}} due to spontaneously produced contaminant {{states can}} trigger rapid dephasing in many-body Rydberg ensembles [E. Goldschmidt et al., PRL 116, 113001 (2016) ]. Such broadening has serious implications for many proposals to coherently use Rydberg interactions, particularly Rydberg dressing proposals. The dephasing arises as a runaway process where {{the production of}} the first <b>contaminant</b> <b>atoms</b> facilitates the creation of more <b>contaminant</b> <b>atoms.</b> Here we study the time dependence of this process with stroboscopic approaches. Using a pump-probe technique, we create an excess "pump" Rydberg population and probe its effect with a different "probe" Rydberg transition. We observe a reduced resonant pumping rate and an enhancement of the excitation {{on both sides of the}} transition as atoms are added to the pump state. We also observe a timescale for population growth significantly shorter than predicted by homogeneous mean-field models, as expected from a clustered growth mechanism where high-order correlations dominate the dynamics. These results support earlier works and confirm that the time scale for the onset of dephasing is reduced by a factor which scales as the inverse of the atom number. In addition, we discuss several approaches to minimize these effects of spontaneous broadening, including stroboscopic techniques and operating at cryogenic temperatures. It is challenging to avoid the unwanted broadening effects, but under some conditions they can be mitigated. Comment: 12 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|We study {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{the competing}} blockade and anti-blockade effects induced by spontaneously generated <b>contaminant</b> Rydberg <b>atoms</b> in driven Rydberg systems. These <b>contaminant</b> <b>atoms</b> provide {{a source of}} strong dipole-dipole interactions and {{play a crucial role}} in the system's behavior. We study this problem theoretically using two different approaches. The first is a cumulant expansion approximation, in which we ignore third-order and higher connected correlations. Using this approach for the case of resonant drive, a many-body blockade radius picture arises, and we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results. We further predict that as the atomic density is increased, the Rydberg population's dependence on Rabi frequency will transition from quadratic to linear dependence at lower Rabi frequencies. We study this behavior experimentally by observing this crossover at two different atomic densities. We confirm that the larger density system has a smaller crossover Rabi frequency than the smaller density system. The second theoretical approach is a set of phenomenological inhomogeneous rate equations. We compare the results of our rate equation model to the experimental observations in [E. A. Goldschmidt, et al., PRL 116, 113001 (2016) ] and find that these rate equations provide quantitatively good scaling behavior of the steady-state Rydberg population for both resonant and off-resonant drive.

40|$|Radio-frequency-generated plasma {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be a promising means of cleaning the interior surfaces of a Penning-Malmberg trap that is used in experiments on the confinement of antimatter. {Such a trap was reported in Modified Penning-Malmberg Trap for Storing Antiprotons (MFS- 31780), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 3 (March 2005), page 66. } Cleaning of the interior surfaces is necessary to minimize numbers of <b>contaminant</b> <b>atoms</b> and molecules, which reduce confinement times by engaging in matter/antimatter-annihilation reactions with confined antimatter particles. A modified Penning-Malmberg trap like the one described in the cited prior article includes several collinear ring electrodes (some of which are segmented) inside a tubular vacuum chamber, as illustrated in Figure 1. During operation of the trap, a small cloud of charged antiparticles (e. g., antiprotons or positrons) is confined to a spheroidal central region {{by means of a}} magnetic field in combination with DC and radiofrequency (RF) electric fields applied via the electrodes. In the present developmental method of cleaning by use of RF-generated plasma, one evacuates the vacuum chamber, backfills the chamber with hydrogen at a suitable low pressure, and uses an RF-signal generator and baluns to apply RF voltages to the ring electrodes. Each ring is excited in the polarity opposite that of the adjacent ring. The electric field generated by the RF signal creates a discharge in the low-pressure gas. The RF power and gas pressure are adjusted so that the plasma generated in the discharge (see Figure 2) physically and chemically attacks any solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminant layers on the electrode surfaces. The products of the physical and chemical cleaning reactions are gaseous and are removed by the vacuum pumps...|$|R

40|$|As {{advances}} {{continue to}} be made in laser technology there is an increasing demand for materials that have high thresholds for laser-induced damage. Laser damage occurs when light is absorbed, creating defects in the crystal lattice. These defects can lead to the emission of atoms, ions and molecules from the sample. One specific field where laser damage is of serious concern is semiconductor lithography, which is beginning to use light at a wavelength of 157 nm. CaF 2 is a candidate material for use in this new generation of lithography. In order to prevent unnecessary damage of optical components, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms for laser damage and the factors that serve to enhance it. In this research, we study various aspects of laser interactions with CaF 2, including impurity absorbance and various forms of damage caused by incident laser light. Ultraviolet (UV) laser light at 266 nm with both femtosecond (fs) and nanosecond (ns) pulse widths is used to induce ion and neutral particle emission from cleaved samples of CaF 2. The resulting mass spectra show significant differences suggesting that different mechanisms for desorption occur following excitation using the different pulse durations. Following irradiation by ns pulses at 266 nm, multiple single-photon absorption from defect states is likely responsible for ion emission whereas the fs case is driven by a multi-photon absorption process. This idea is further supported by the measurements made of the transmission and reflection of fs laser pulses at 266 nm, the results of which reveal a non-linear absorption process in effect at high incident intensities. In addition, the kinetic energy profiles of desorbed Ca and K <b>contaminant</b> <b>atoms</b> are different indicating that a different mechanism is responsible for their emission as well. Overall, these results show that purity {{plays a key role in}} the desorption of atoms from CaF 2 when using ns pulses. On the other hand, once the irradiance reaches high levels, like that of the fs case, significant desorption is possible due to multi-photon absorption by the intrinsic material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Chlorophenols {{are typical}} {{priority}} pollutants listed by USEPA (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency). The removal of chlorophenol could {{be carried out}} by a combination of electrochemical reduction and oxidation method. Results showed that it was feasible to degrade <b>contaminants</b> containing chlorine <b>atoms</b> by electrochemical reduction to form phenol, which was further degraded on the anode by electrochemical oxidation. Chlorophenol removal rate was more than 90 % by the combined electro-chemical reduction and oxidation at current of 6 mA and pH 6.

40|$|Among {{the many}} uses of resonantly {{enhanced}} multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy, secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS) is both {{one of the}} most demanding and {{one of the most}} important. Recently, we have demonstrated that the selectivity of REMPI, and thus the sensitivity of SNMS, can be greatly enhanced by using resonant excitation schemes involving multiple resonant processes. Of particular interest is the use of autoionizing resonances, resonances with energies in excess of the ionization potential of the atom, in the REMPI process. The use of autoionizing resonances can reduce the laser intensity required to saturate the ionization process by more than an order of magnitude. This reduction can strongly reduce non-resonant ionization of background constituents, enhancing the signal to noise of the SNMS measurement. Although this approach to laser ionization SNMS is generally applicable, the three-colour ionization method has been demonstrated using two widely disparate yet important systems. Iron impurity atoms form deep level traps in Si, changing bulk electrical properties even at concentrations approaching 1 p. p. t. In this case, normal mass spectrometry of impurity atoms is complicated by the isobaric interference of ^(56) $Fe and ^(28) Si_ 2 molecule. The required mass resolution of greater than 10 ^ 4 exceeds the capabilities of most mass spectrometers. Even for instruments with sufficient mass resolution, the concomitant reduction in useful yield limits detection sensitivity in the near-surface region to 1 p. p. m. REMPI has now been successfully used to separately ionize the impurity atoms of interest. Three-colour REMPI dramatically reduces the residual non-resonant ionization of the isobarically interfering ion, allowing SNMS measurements at levels below 100 p. p. t. This result is accomplished without significant reduction in the fraction of <b>contaminant</b> <b>atoms</b> ionized and, therefore, in useful yield. Mass spectrometric analysis for Os and Re has long been recognized as an important analytical goal in geochemistry. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of these elements must be determined in order to utilize the radioactive decay of ^(187) Re to ^(187) Os (t_(1 / 2) = 4. 23 x 10 ^(10) years) as a tracer of geochemical processes. Three problems have limited the analysis of Os and Re. First, the concentrations of Os and Re in naturally occurring samples are extremely low, ranging from 1 p. p. b. to 60 p. p. m. Second, the high-ionization potentials (IP) of Os (8. 7 eV) and Re (7. 9 eV) have precluded the use of thermal ionization and limited the sensitivity of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurement to parts per million. Finally, the ^(187) Re^(187) Os mass difference is less than 1 p. p. m., making conventional mass analysis (without complex chemical separation) impossible. We have demonstrated the ability of three-colour resonant SNMS to detect and separate Os and Re in Ni samples at the 4 p. p. b. level. In situ analysis of Os in iron meteorites demonstrates an elemental selectivity of Os over Re of greater than 10 ^ 3 without prior chemical separation. Measurements on a suite of samples with Os concentration varying from 10 per thousand down to 100 p. p. b. show a linear correlation between concentration and signal with a precision of better than ± 13 % and a useful yield in excess of 1 %. These results demonstrate the potential for three-colour resonant ionization to detect and selectively ionize most high IP elements, including all of the Pt group elements, with good sensitivity, accuracy, and precision...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{dispersive}} X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) is {{a well-established}} and {{powerful tool for}} nondestructive elemental analysis of virtually any material. It is widely used for environmental, industrial, pharmaceutical, forensic, and scientific research applications to measure the concentration of elemental constituents or <b>contaminants.</b> The fluorescing <b>atoms</b> can be excited by energetic electrons, ions, or photons. A particular EDXRF method, monochromatic microbeam X-ray fluorescence (MÃŽÂ¼EDXRF), {{has proven to be}} remarkably powerful in measurement of trace element concentrations and distributions in a large variety of important medical, environmental, and industrial applications. When used with state-of-the-art doubly curved crystal (DCC) X-ray optics, this technique enables high-sensitivity, compact, low-power, safe, reliable, and rugged analyzers for insitu, online measurements in industrial process, clinical, and field settings. This new optic-enabled MÃŽÂ¼EDXRF technique is known as high-definition X-Ray fluorescence (HD XRF). Selected applications of HD XRF are described in this paper including air particulate analysis, analysis of body fluid contamination at ppb levels, elemental mapping of brain tissue and bone samples, as well as analysis of toxins in toys and other consumer products...|$|R
30|$|The {{chemical}} {{sensitivity of}} positrons {{has been demonstrated}} in metals and semiconductor systems [16, 17]. Following the procedure outlined in [18], we have reproduced the measured annihilation peak shapes with a linear combination of Doppler spectra of the semiconductor/oxide interface and the Ge signal of a sample saturated of defects. The obtained fits are shown in Fig. 4. As discussed in Ref. [2], {{the results of this}} latter analysis to the data of Fig. 4 show an increment in the germanium component from (22 ± 10)% to (47 ± 8)% after the annealing. The indetermination of this component is associated with the spread of the experimental data, especially at high momentum. In particular, in order to better reproduce the measured Doppler spectra on the whole momentum scale, we have employed, instead of the annihilation peak shape characteristics of annihilation into bulk germanium, the shape measured from a thick (in the microns range) layer of germanium grown on silicon. The abrupt junction between germanium and silicon promotes the formation of misfit dislocations at the interface and threading dislocation that run across the whole germanium layer with an estimated density of about 109 cm− 2. Positrons are trapped at defect sites causing a substantial reduction of the diffusion length and a slight increase of the S parameter. This experimental finding can be explained by postulating positron annihilation at vacancies associated with dislocations, or at negatively charged centers associated with dislocations, given that the deposited Ge layer was free of <b>contaminants</b> or dopant <b>atoms,</b> which are known to produce positron trapping defects [1]. The decomposition of the annihilation spectra into two terms (interface and “germanium defects”) gives an acceptable fit (χ 2 /[degrees of freedom] values of 1.5 in the as-grown sample and 1.2 in the annealed sample) and conveys the idea of a prevalent decoration of positron trapping centers with germanium atoms (as already pointed out by Rummukainen et al. [19] in bulk SiGe layers), mainly associated with Si vacancies.|$|R
