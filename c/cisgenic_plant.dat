40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the discussions that identified food and feed safety aspects of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plant</b> varieties in comparison to conventional varieties {{on the one hand and}} transgenic plant varieties on the other hand. It was concluded that on the basis of the general characteristics of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plant</b> varieties, there is, from a food and feed safety perspective, no scientific basis for a general reduction of requirements for cisgenic crop plant varieties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{implication}} of molecular biology in crop improvement {{is now more}} than three decades old. Not surpris-ingly, technology has moved on, {{and there are a number}} of new techniques that may or may not come under the geneti-cally modified (GM) banner and, therefore, GM regulations. In cisgenic technology, cisgenes from crossable plants are used and it is a single procedure of gene introduction whereby the problem of linkage drag of other genes is overcome. The gene used in cisgenic approach is similar compared with classical breeding and <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plant</b> should be treated equally as classically bred plant and differently from transgenic plants. Therefore, it offers a sturdy reference to treat cis-genic plants similarly as classically bred plants, by exemption of cisgenesis from the current GMO legislations. This re-view covers the implications of cisgenesis towards the sustainable development in the genetic improvement of crops and considers the prospects for the technology...|$|E
30|$|Moreover, {{there is}} no {{scientific}} consensus on the safety of cisgenic plants. For example, the GMO panel of the European Food and Safety Authority [41] concluded in 2012 that the risks associated with cisgenic and traditionally bred plants are the same, while transgenic plants may result in novel risks. This conclusion was gene based, meaning that because the genes are known to be safe, the cisgenic approach was also considered safe. However, even if the inserted gene is known, {{this does not mean that}} uncertainties associated with the transformation process are known. Hence, in contrast to the conclusion of the EFSA, it is argued that, in terms of food and environmental safety, cisgenic approaches cannot be regarded as equivalent to conventional breeding. Neither can the safety of the products resulting from traditional breeding and cisgenic technologies be considered as similar, based on the unknown behaviour and effects of the genes in the transformation process and their functioning within the mechanisms of the host plant [42 – 44]. Furthermore, the issues reaching beyond the safety of the <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plant</b> seem to get little attention from researchers in the field of these emerging breeding techniques. For them, it seems that the ability of cisgenic plants to get more public acceptance is a common ground to pursue cisgenic approaches and advocate for a less strict regulation [2]. Although the ‘more natural’ approach of cisgenic compared to transgenic may affect the view of consumers to this technique to some degree, cisgenic breeding remains a genetic modification, which remains controversial, and consumers still favour, for example, labelling of such a technique [14].|$|E
50|$|The Dutch {{government}} has proposed to exclude <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> from the European GMO Regulation, {{in view of}} the safety of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> compared to classically bred plants, and their contribution to durable food production.|$|R
50|$|While some genetically {{modified}} plants are {{developed by the}} introduction of a gene originating from distant, sexually incompatible species into the host genome, <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> contain genes that have been isolated either directly from the host species or from sexually compatible species. The new genes are introduced using recombinant DNA methods and gene transfer. Some scientists hope that the approval process of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> might be simpler than that of proper transgenics, but it remains to be seen.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{discussed}} important concerns in {{the debate about the}} development of LBR GM potato in Europe, which go beyond the regulatory status of cisgenic LBR potato and consumer acceptance of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> Although we recognize the importance of clarifying the regulation of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants,</b> we argue that this debate is currently too narrowly focused and fails to recognize the broader issues that are persistently addressed within society about GM approaches in general and that, therefore, it is important to broaden the scope of the debate on <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> Although the importance to proactively engage in ‘post-research’ issues by researchers involved in the development of LBR GM potato is emphasized and arguably contributes to the recognition of broader concerns, these are often phrased in the sense of ‘educating’ or ‘informing’ public, rather than listening and acting upon their concerns (e.g. [71]). By discussing concerns around the (technical) solution offered, the problem phrasing of the late blight potato disease, the durability of this solution, and patenting and ownership, we hope to contribute to a recognition of the complex socio-ecological, legal and political dimensions in which this technological development is entangled and stimulate discussion that takes this broader view into account. Importantly, we recognize that more concerns can be identified related to the development of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> and that we touch upon questions and concerns that would benefit from deeper reflection and further investigation. While concerns mentioned in this paper are specifically formulated around the case of LBR GM potato, we do not consider them to be exclusive to this particular technological development. Rather, we believe that these issues can be found across different agricultural biotechnological developments and approaches—such as CRISPR/Cas 9 and synthetic biology—and are therefore important concerns to reflect upon and respond to. Thus, in order to develop truly responsible governance for agricultural biotechnology, the scope of the debate on cisgenic approaches in Europe should be broadened to include other significant concerns raised by stakeholders within the agricultural sector, and the public in general.|$|R
30|$|In {{the debate}} about GM {{regulation}} in Europe and specifically the difference between ‘cisgenic’ and ‘transgenic’ approaches, {{it is argued that}} exempting cisgenic plants from GMO regulations may herald a new future for agricultural biotechnology [14]. Currently, no distinction between cisgenic and transgenic approaches is made within European GMO regulation and this has become a highly controversial issue. Proponents of deregulation argue that a <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plant</b> can have the exact same properties and is as safe as a plants obtained by traditional introgression breeding [7, 15 – 17]. It is therefore considered inconsistent that plants with the same properties are differently regulated. Furthermore, it is questioned whether cisgenic plants fall under the definition of a GMO, as this definition states that a “GMO means an organism […] in which the genetic material has been altered {{in a way that does}} not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination” [18]. As cisgenic potatoes do not have a novel combination of genetic material compared to conventionally bred plants, it is argued that they should therefore not fall under the GMO legislation [15]. In most jurisdictions, for example in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and the European GMO legislation, there are both process- and product-related criteria, though the focus in the EU has been on process criteria (e.g. [9]). Those in favour of a strict regulation indeed point to the process criteria to argue that the same technique is applied with cisgenic and transgenic approaches and that therefore cisgenic should fall under the GMO regulation. Another argument stresses that one of the reasons for current regulation of GMOs is the traceability and labelling of the GMO products so as to guarantee consumers’ right to know which products contain GMO. If cisgenics is exempted from GMO regulation, consumers would not be able to actively choose products that they know are not genetically modified [14].|$|E
25|$|<b>Cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> {{are made}} using genes {{found within the}} same species or a closely related one, where {{conventional}} plant breeding can occur. Some breeders and scientists argue that cisgenic modification is useful for plants {{that are difficult to}} crossbreed by conventional means (such as potatoes), and that <b>plants</b> in the <b>cisgenic</b> category should not require the same regulatory scrutiny as transgenics.|$|R
30|$|The {{assumption}} that <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> will alleviate the reluctant attitude of consumers raised concerns {{among some of}} the Norwegian stakeholders about the effect this may have on the consumers’ trust in their farming practice, their products, and the agriculture sector in general. This prevented these stakeholders to fully embrace this technological shift as the solution for late blight. Their concerns go beyond ambiguities on the regulatory status of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> or safety issues, to include their relationship with consumers and the potential damage that a lack of transparency, communication and research of alternatives may cause. Moreover, some stakeholders were concerned that a loss of trust from the public could result in a decrease of subsidies for the agriculture sector. For years, the Norwegian agriculture sector receives one of the highest governmental support levels among the OECD countries [45, 46]. Some of the stakeholders emphasized that the current financial support from the government stems from the trust in quality of domestic agricultural products. These subsidies constitute a large share of the income of Norwegian farmers and thus an important reason for them to carefully assess the potential implications that different methods for plant breeding may have on their trustworthiness.|$|R
5000|$|The EPA regulates {{substances}} with pesticide characteristics, {{looking at}} potential threats {{to human health}} or the environment. They claim not to regulate the genetically modified plants, but the pesticides produced by the plants or properties that change the usage of applied pesticides [...] This includes; plants engineered to produce resistance to herbicides (e.g. Roundup Ready), plants that produce their own pesticides (e.g. BT) and virus resistant plants. Authority to regulate the pesticide properties in genetically modified organisms was granted in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The EPA published regulations in 1994 and begun acting on them in 1995. In 1994 they proposed the exemption of three categories of genetically modified plants under their regulation. These were plants where the genetic material originated in sexually compatible <b>plants</b> (<b>cisgenic),</b> <b>plants</b> that used physical barriers to prevent the target pest from attaching itself, and plants expressing viral coat proteins to protect against virus infection. In 2001, rules regarding exemption of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> had been finalised. The other two proposed exemptions were still under review in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Cisgenesis is genetic {{modification}} to transfer beneficial alleles from crossable species into a recipient plant. The donor genes transferred by cisgenesis {{are the same}} as those used in traditional breeding. It can avoid linkage drag, enhance the use of existing gene alleles. This approach combines traditional breeding techniques with modern biotechnology and dramatically speeds up the breeding process. This allows plant genomes to be modified while remaining plants within the gene pool. Therefore, <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> should not be assessed as transgenics for environmental impacts...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two ways}} for genetic {{improvement}} in classical plant breeding: crossing and mutation. Plant varieties can also be improved through genetic modification; however, the present GMO regulations are based on risk assessments with the transgenes coming from non-crossable species. Nowadays, DNA sequence information of crop plants facilitates the isolation of cisgenes, which are genes from crop plants themselves or from crossable species. The increasing number of these isolated genes, {{and the development of}} transformation protocols that do not leave marker genes behind, provide an opportunity to improve plant breeding while remaining within the gene pool of the classical breeder. Compared with induced translocation and introgression breeding, cisgenesis is an improvement for gene transfer from crossable plants: it is a one-step gene transfer without linkage drag of other genes, whereas induced translocation and introgression breeding are multiple step gene transfer methods with linkage drag. The similarity of the genes used in cisgenesis compared with classical breeding is a compelling argument to treat <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> as classically bred plants. In the case of the classical breeding method induced translocation breeding, the insertion site of the genes is a priori unknown, as it is in cisgenesis. This provides another argument to treat <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> as classically bred plants, by exempting cisgenesis of plants from the GMO legislations...|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{there is}} {{relatively}} limited information available about current perception of European public on <b>cisgenic</b> and transgenic <b>plants</b> {{to get a}} comprehensive and accurate representation of consumers’ preference and public acceptance. More empirical studies and surveys are required to reveal and document the support base from public, and assess whether a further development of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> is safer, desirable, acceptable and can be marketable. Additionally, the debates on cisgenic approaches would benefit from including broader issues mentioned by different stakeholders within the potato and agricultural industry—both {{on the level of}} cisgenic approaches as well as the more general level of GMOs. Failing to acknowledge these broader issues and relying on a technical fix to overcome the safety and consumer concerns with cisgenic GM approaches potentially sustains a scattered and under-communicated discussion and severely complicates constructive and responsible developments within agricultural biotechnology.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{modification}} of plants {{is achieved by}} adding a specific gene or genes to a plant, or by knocking down a gene with RNAi, to produce a desirable phenotype. The plants resulting from adding a gene are {{often referred to as}} transgenic plants. If for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter, then they are called <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> Sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plant's genome is not altered.|$|R
30|$|In current {{debates on}} {{emerging}} technologies for plant breeding in Europe, much {{attention has been}} given to the regulatory status of these techniques and their public acceptance. At present, both genetically modified <b>plants</b> with <b>cisgenic</b> approaches—using genes from crossable species—as well as transgenic approaches—using genes from different species—fall under GMO regulation in the EU and both are mandatorily labelled as GMOs. Researchers involved in the early development of <b>cisgenic</b> GM <b>plants</b> convey the message that the potential use and acceptance of cisgenic approaches will be seriously hindered if GMO regulations are not adjusted. Although the similar treatment and labelling of transgenic and <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> may be a legitimate concern for the marketability of a <b>cisgenic</b> GM <b>plant,</b> there are concerns around their commercialization that reach beyond the current focus on (de)regulation. In this paper, we will use the development of the cisgenic GM potato that aims to overcome ‘late blight’—the most devastating potato disease worldwide—as a case to argue {{that it is important to}} recognize, reflect and respond to broader concerns than the dominant focus on the regulatory ‘burden’ and consumer acceptance. Based on insights we gained from discussing this case with diverse stakeholders within the agricultural sector and potato production in Norway during a series of workshops, we elaborate on additional issues such as the (technical) solution offered; different understandings of the late blight problem; the durability of the potato plant resistance; and patenting and ownership. Hence, this paper contributes to empirical knowledge on stakeholder perspectives on emerging plant breeding technologies, underscoring the importance to broaden the scope of the debate on the opportunities and challenges of agricultural biotechnologies, such as <b>cisgenic</b> GM <b>plants.</b> The paper offers policy-relevant input to ongoing efforts to broaden the scope of risk assessments of agricultural biotechnologies. We aim to contribute to the recognition of the complex socio-ecological, legal and political dimensions in which these technological developments are entangled as a means to acknowledge, discuss and respond to these concerns and thereby contribute to more comprehensive and responsible developments within agricultural biotechnology.|$|R
30|$|Another concern {{related to}} the {{patentability}} of cisgenic crops concerns the traceability of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants.</b> This becomes extra complicated when traditional breeding becomes capable of developing and commercializing a variety with for example resistance to late blight, and both LBR potato via traditional breeding as well as GM co-exist. It then becomes difficult, if not impossible, to check whether a <b>plant</b> is <b>cisgenic</b> in retrospect and to keep control of where the patentable plant ends up, whether it crosses with other species and the assessment thereof. Moreover, there is uncertainty about the legal and economic consequences for farmers for unintended contamination through gene flow, {{as well as for}} the patent holder to potentially argue that his patent was breached.|$|R
40|$|A major {{bottleneck}} of crop breeding is {{the narrow}} genetic base of cultivated species. It {{is a must}} to introgress new beneficial alleles from wild germp lasm. Due to crossing barrier and linkage drag, conventional breeding isnpt effective in use of these beneficial alleles. The rap id development of genomics enables the isolation {{of a number of}} plant genes in an easyway. Cisgenesis is a genetic modification app roach to quickly transfer beneficial alleles from crossable species into elite cultivars. This app roach will not only speed up breeding process but also avoid linkage drag. As the origins of target genes by cisgenesis and conventional breeding are the same, cultivars released by these two app roaches are same in safety. If regulators could treat <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> the same as conventionally bred p lants, cisgenesis will become an effective tool of crop improvement in use of wild germplasm...|$|R
30|$|Reflection on the {{dominant}} approach {{in research and}} governance of agriculture reveals the different values on which the approach is based, and may lead to different practices, evaluations and perspectives on <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> [55]. Risk assessment of GM crops is however, typically narrowly framed, where technological benefits and risks are compared to current dominating production systems (most commonly conventional agriculture). This may cause a tunnel vision, where only particular problems, tactics and solutions are discussed. Contrary to this approach, we {{argue that it is}} crucial to critically reflect on whether the solution that is offered is responding to the societal need that it is supposed to address. Moreover, the true origins of the problem should be identified, different future visions explored and alternative approaches and solutions investigated. 1 Exploring alternative approaches includes considerations of their benefits, adverse effects, uncertainties, ambiguity, existing knowledge gaps and the changes required for large-scale implementation of this alternative [56].|$|R
30|$|Some of the {{stakeholders}} {{questioned the}} durability of the GM approach, and emphasized that farmers and consumers may be left with the misconception that this approach is {{the solution to the}} late blight problem. As phrased by Mullins [71]: “Demonstrating durability of generated resistance is key to underpinning grower confidence”. Hence, a lack of transparency about the uncertainties associated with such a statement, as well as the conditions that this approach hinges on might result in a backlash against trust that farmers and public place on the researchers driving this technology. It may also limit the ability to open up for a broader and more inclusive discussion about how to address the uncertainties and limitations of this proposed solution, as these uncertainties and limitations are to a large extent unknown. Therefore, candidness and transparency about the uncertainties, knowledge gaps and limitations of using GM approaches to develop durable LBR potato varieties should be stimulated throughout the different levels of research and development of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
30|$|Irrespective of the {{potential}} opportunities that new biotechnological approaches such as CRISPR/Cas 9, cisgenic or synthetic biology could bring about, GMOs currently remain controversial. When it comes to <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants,</b> there are other concerns that are hindering a successful commercialization than the current focus on the (de)regulation. These concerns include issues such as corporate control over seed markets and the food chain, consumers’ and farmers’ right to know and choose, the coexistence of different agricultural production systems, intellectual property rights, power relations, scientific uncertainties, ambiguities and values underlying the knowledge development and concerns about the human domination of nature [27 – 29]. The persistent controversies in views and debates on GMOs in general contain polarized arguments that sustain permanent different viewpoints and disagreement about the facts and values and their interwoven nature [30]. These controversies that surround agricultural biotechnologies and the aim to develop truly “responsible governance of agricultural biotechnology” [29] give little reason to assume that clarifying the regulatory status of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> and exempting them from GMO regulations are sufficient to assure their marketability and/or public acceptance towards this technology. Moreover, new European legislation on GMOs allows Member States to restrict the cultivation of GMOs on their own territory based on socio-economic impacts, environmental or agricultural policy objectives, or with the aim to avoid the unintended presence of GMOs in other products (Directive 2015 / 412). This reflects the increased international recognition and significance to consider {{a broader range of}} issues beyond the environmental and human safety-related aspects—such as sustainability, social utility and ethical justifiability—when assessing the use of agricultural biotechnologies [31, 32]. Furthermore, the recognition to consider a broader assessment frame has been accompanied with a shift in the relationship between science and society, going from ‘science and society’ to ‘science in and with society’ (e.g. [33, 34]), or ‘science with, and for society’ (European funding program Horizon 2020). This has resulted in an increase of attention on addressing societal needs, anticipating impacts, assessing alternatives, and conducting public outreach of scientific work. These approaches aim for more transparency in research processes and outcomes, and rely on a participatory and inclusive process (e.g. [35 – 37]). This shift has changed how research, research-based policies, technological developments and technology assessments are developed and performed.|$|R
30|$|For {{some of the}} Norwegian stakeholders, {{the concern}} with {{patenting}} is predominantly about the power and potential monopoly of biotech companies that obtain patents over plant varieties and the influence this can have on the seed and food prices, the power relations within the sector and the independent research on the safety of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> and further uses, such as breeding by other research institutions (see also [73]). Entry of the patent system into for example the potato sector, contributes to the concentration and reduction {{of the diversity of}} companies and the possibilities for strategic use, which may lead to lack of clarity in the market and to monopolistic behaviour [74]. Patenting has the potential to increase the control of a few corporations over seeds and crops, thereby increasing farmer dependency and a reduction of biodiversity [27, 75 – 77]. The potential effects and implications for stakeholders and the uncertainty that patenting involves creates uneasiness among Norwegian stakeholders in the sector. Even though experimenting with patent regimes is ongoing, it seems that the fundamental principle of patenting is receiving significant resistance.|$|R
30|$|As cisgenic {{crops are}} {{considered}} GM products, {{they have to}} get through regulatory processes to get approval. Currently the costs for complying with regulatory processes can cost millions of euros for each application and typically takes years to complete [78, 79]. This burden of high costs to comply with regulatory processes is used as an argument in favour of exempting <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> from GM regulation, so that small and medium-sized enterprises can compete with the bigger, usually multinational corporations that are currently dominating the market (e.g. [8, 71, 80]). Therefore, in theory, easing regulation could benefit small enterprises. In practice however, it is questionable whether this will actually benefit small- and medium-sized enterprises, as they may easily be overruled by larger companies due to the larger capacity of these companies to develop new GM varieties. As patenting generates revenues for more research and enables seeking for the costly approvals of other inventions, it can cause a “Matthew effect” [81] in which the larger firms and institutes will get larger, while the small firms and research institutes are unable to keep up with this development and grow ever smaller.|$|R
30|$|The {{shift from}} {{transgenic}} to cisgenic approaches {{in the development}} of LBR GM potato was based on the availability of resistance (R) genes in wild potato species. The assumption was that this approach would be ethically more acceptable to the public as these genes are from crossable species instead of different species [21]. However, past and present debates on this topic, and the difficulty to decide on regulation for it, have shown that there are additional concerns that reach beyond the regulatory questions. Indeed, when the development of cisgenic technologies is considered to be “a result of taking the opinions and concerns of consumers seriously” [40] and is aimed to respond to consumer concerns, it fails to recognize the broader issues that are persistently addressed within society about GM approaches in general. During the workshops, it became clear that most of the Norwegian stakeholders in the potato and agriculture sector consider it as a reasonable assumption that <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> will decrease consumer concerns to some degree. Still, they highlighted that it is too simplistic to think that this technical fix is sufficient to alleviate all concerns associated with GM crops.|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the apple}} (Malus × domestica) growers are facing serious disease {{problems}} with apple scab which {{is caused by the}} fungus Venturia inaequalis. Developing a resistant variety in apple through classical breeding is very slow and inefficient. So, we aim at improving existing apple varieties through a new concept called “cisgenesis” which saves time and effort compared to classical breeding. Malus floribunda proved to be a good source of natural scab resistance genes. The genes HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2, consisting of promoter, coding and terminator sequences in their natural configuration, were isolated from Malus floribunda and cloned into the binary vector pMF 1. Apple cv. ‘Gala’ was transformed with pMF 1 containing HcrVf 1 and HcrVf 2, individually or in combination. pMF 1 can be used to obtain marker-free plants by recombinase-based excision of a fragment carrying undesired gene sequences, such as antibiotic-selection marker genes, leaving behind only the gene(s) -of-interest and one recombination site. Using this vector it is therefore possible to stack several genes by retransformation using the same selection procedure. In order to obtain durable resistance, we have the intention to combine different resistance genes from Malus either by stacking them one by one or by introducing them all together in one T-DNA. Performance of all different types of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> will be evaluated by monitoring scab resistance levels phenotypically and by determining gene expression profiles through quantitative RT-PC...|$|R

30|$|The {{limited amount}} of {{empirical}} research on consumer’s acceptance of GM food indicates different perceptions of consumers towards cisgenic and transgenic plants; this arguably demonstrates that the acceptance of cisgenic approaches is not straightforward. A study in 2010 demonstrates a more reluctant than tolerant attitude towards GM food in Europe [47], as does a study in 2017 under Norwegian consumers [48]. Research by Lusk and Rozan [49] indicates a higher acceptance of cisgenic than transgenic approaches for GM food, based on nationwide surveys in the US and France. Their research demonstrates {{a significant difference between}} these nations, with a twice as high acceptance level in the US. Moreover, European citizens perceive a lack of knowledge on GM approaches, hindering them to make a well-informed decision about their willingness to consume GM products [50]. Although Delwaide et al. claim that the different perceptions on transgenic and <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> confirm the hypothesis that public will be more tolerant to the latter than the former, it is not yet clear what the conditions for acceptance of a GM application are. Indeed, a research performed by Mielby et al. [51] indicates that more knowledge of different GM approaches does not lead to consumers developing an attitude based on differences between methods (i.e. transgenic or cisgenic). Rather, consumers consider the purposes of GM applications as important, such as a medical application or food application. Furthermore, consumers choose to depend on people they consider experts and trustworthy to make informed decisions. This gives trust {{an important role in the}} view people develop of GM food [52 – 54].|$|R
30|$|Researchers {{involved}} {{in the development of}} cisgenic GM ‘late blight resistant’ (LBR) potato actively engage in these policy discussions, conveying a message that burdensome GMO regulations prevent the commercialization of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> and that their future use and acceptance will be seriously hindered if GMO regulations fail to differentiate between cisgenic and transgenic organisms [8, 10, 15, 17, 19 – 21]. Indeed, the need for a re-evaluation of the current GMO regulation is also wanted because of new genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas 9 and synthetic biology that were not existing when the current regulation was established. The rise of these techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas 9 —which is currently considered as the most precise and site-specific genome editing technique and is used to delete, insert or replace gene sequences [22, 23]—are described as promising developments for improving crop traits and increasing the use of plant genetic resources in pre-breeding and breeding work [24, 25]. Combining cisgenic approaches with new genome editing techniques could enable more efficient use of genetic resources and possibly more precise crop breeding. For instance, using CRISPR/cas 9 to introduce cisgenes into a plant could potentially build trust in the precision and safety of cisgenic approaches and thereby “tackle some objections to the application of biotechnologies in agriculture” [24]. Furthermore, synthetic biology approaches have the potential for designing disease resistance in crops and could enable the construction of novel, resilient immune response networks in plants [26]. A synthetic biology approach could potentially be used to construct synthetic R genes or multi-R-gene constructs to improve late blight resistance. This could complement current potato breeding approaches that exploit naturally occurring R genes found in wild potato species.|$|R
40|$|Both {{cisgenesis}} and transgenesis are {{plant breeding}} techniques {{that can be}} used to introduce new genes into plant genomes. However, transgenesis uses gene(s) from a non-plant organism or from a donor plant that is sexually incompatible with the recipient plant while cisgenesis involves the introduction of gene(s) from a crossable [...] sexually compatible [...] plant. Traditional breeding techniques could possibly achieve the same results as those from cisgenesis, but would require a much larger timeframe. Cisgenesis allows plant breeders to enhance an existing cultivar more quickly and with little to no genetic drag. The current regulation in the European Union (EU) on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) treats <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> the same as transgenic plants and both are mandatorily labeled as GMOs. This study estimates European consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice labeled as GM, cisgenic, with environmental benefits (which cisgenesis could provide), or any combination of these three attributes. Data were collected from 3, 002 participants through an online survey administered in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom in 2013. Censored regression models were used to model consumers' WTP in each country. Model estimates highlight significant differences in WTP across countries. In all five countries, consumers are willing-to-pay a premium to avoid purchasing rice labeled as GM. In all countries except Spain, consumers have a significantly higher WTP to avoid consuming rice labeled as GM compared to rice labeled as cisgenic, suggesting that inserting genes from the plant's own gene pool is more acceptable to consumers. Additionally, French consumers are willing-to-pay a premium for rice labeled as having environmental benefits compared to conventional rice. These findings suggest that not all GMOs are the same in consumers' eyes and thus, from a consumer preference perspective, the differences between transgenic and cisgenic products are recommended to be reflected in GMO labeling and trade policies...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{regulation}} on {{organic farming}} {{does not allow}} the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which are subject to Directive 2001 / 18 /EC. Mutagenesis using irradiation or chemicals is genetic modification, but the organisms obtained through these techniques {{are not subject to}} the provisions of the GMO directive. Such mutants can therefore be used in organic agriculture. Derived from its basic principles, organic farming can only use natural substances to control disease and crops should be resilient, which, in the case of disease resistance, means that durable (horizontal) resistance is preferred to vertical (single gene) resistance. Cisgenesis can achieve such a durable resistance by introducing multiple resistance genes in one step. These multiple-resistant plants only contain natural genes that can also be introduced by breeding. In case <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> are not subject to the provisions of the GMO legislation, they can even be legally used in organic agriculture. In case they are not exempted from the GMO regulation, the question is: why obstruct a cisgenic potato crop that can hardly be distinguished from a potato crop that is the result of conventional breeding? Among the reasons why organic agriculture does not allow the use of GMOs it is mentioned that genetic engineering is unpredictable, it causes genome disruption and it is unnatural. However, our knowledge of plant genome evolution and breeding has increased dramatically. We now know that breeding is more unpredictable and causes more genome disruption than genetic engineering. Recent field trials have shown the efficacy of cisgenic late blight–resistant potatoes carrying multiple resistance genes. Large-scale growing of such durably resistant potatoes would not only be environmentally beneficial by it would strongly reducing the need for fungicide sprays in conventional potato cultivation and it would also reduce the disease pressure in organic potato cultivation...|$|R
30|$|Motivated {{by these}} thoughts, and {{particularly}} the call for broadening risk assessments of GMOs through participatory processes, we organized {{a series of three}} workshops with the aim to identify stakeholder perspectives on biotechnological developments within agriculture—such as cisgenic LBR GM potato. In these workshops, stakeholders involved in the potato production and the agriculture sector in Norway discussed concerns and questions related to sustainability, ethical and social considerations raised by the potential cultivation of cisgenic LBR GM potato in Norway. Two workshops focused on sustainability aspects and used the Problem Formulation Option Assessment method as a way to stimulate discussion (see [38] for more details on the use of this method and specific outcomes). The third workshop focused on social and ethical aspects and used the Ethical Matrix {{as a starting point for}} discussion (see [39] for more details on this workshop and the use of the Ethical Matrix during their workshop). An interesting data set was produced from the three workshops which when analysed thematically highlight a number of important issues raised by the stakeholders, namely: the (technical) solution offered; the problem phrasing of the potato disease; the durability of the resistance of the GM potato; and patenting and ownership. By drawing on questions, opinions, concerns and uncertainties that this diverse group of stakeholders shared or raised on these issues, we argue for a broader recognition of, and reflection on the implications arising from the cultivation of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants,</b> and <b>cisgenic</b> LBR potato within Europe in particular. The stakeholders participating included potato breeders, seed potato retailers, seed potato and potato producers, representatives from the potato processing industry, agricultural advisors, regulators and representatives of environmental, agricultural and consumer interests and researchers within the fields of crop plants and plant pathogens, and social, economic and ethical issues related to GMOs. The main intention with these stakeholder discussions was to explore the diversity of views among the participants in the workshops, rather than reaching any form of consensus or arrive at representative conclusions. Consequently, the participants did not always agree with each other about arguments, questions, concerns and claims made during the discussions and we recognize that many more concerns and questions than we address can be identified and would benefit from further research and reflection.|$|R
30|$|The {{regulatory}} {{status and}} public acceptance of emerging technologies for plant breeding have been considerably debated among scholars, policymakers, innovators and non-profit organizations, though {{there has been}} little public debate on the topic [1, 2]. Recent developments within biotechnology, such as cisgenic approaches—the genetic modification (GM) of a recipient organism with genes from a crossable, sexually compatible, variety of the same or closely related species [3]—bring to the fore the debate on the applicability of current genetically modified organisms (GMO) regulation and whether exemptions should be made for new plant breeding techniques [4 – 9]. Cisgenic GM potato that is resistant to ‘late blight’ is one example of a product developed using emerging plant breeding technologies, and serves as a good illustration of the complex socio-ecological, legal and political dimensions in which these agricultural biotechnologies are entangled. As to date, potato production is significantly plagued by late blight which is the most devastating potato disease worldwide. A fungus-like organism called Phytophthora infestans causes the disease. It is estimated to result in an annual global loss of 7  billion Euros [10] and present control measures in conventional potato production involve excessive use of fungicides. Improving host plant resistance, and thereby reducing the need for fungicides, is considered to be the most sustainable way to control late blight [11, 12]. Traditional introgression breeding for late blight resistance is challenging, mainly because the potatoes are genetically complex and reproduce vegetatively. New plant breeding techniques such as cisgenic approaches hold promises. It is possible to use the cisgenic approach to improve late blight resistance in potato cultivars because the genes that make potatoes resistant to late blight—so-called resistance (R) genes—originate from wild potato species found in South and Central America [13]. Therefore, in recent years, the use of genetic modification to develop a late blight resistant potato has shifted from a transgenic approach—a genetic modification of a recipient organism with genes from an unrelated organism—to a cisgenic approach. This shift is driven by the potential that if successful, <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> will be more accepted by public as the inserted gene is from crossable species and the product is thereby more similar to traditionally bred plants.|$|R
40|$|Cisgenesis {{represents}} {{a step toward}} {{a new generation of}} GM crops. The lack of selectable genes (e. g. antibiotic or herbicide resistance) in the final product {{and the fact that the}} inserted gene(s) derive from organisms sexually compatible with the target crop should rise less environmental concerns and increase consumer's acceptance. Here we report the generation of a <b>cisgenic</b> apple <b>plant</b> by inserting the endogenous apple scab resistance gene HcrVf 2 under the control of its own regulatory sequences into the scab susceptible apple cultivar Gala. A previously developed method based on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation combined with a positive and negative selection system and a chemically inducible recombination machinery allowed the generation of apple cv. Gala carrying the scab resistance gene HcrVf 2 under its native regulatory sequences and no foreign genes. Three cisgenic lines were chosen for detailed investigation and were shown to carry a single T-DNA insertion and express the target gene HcrVf 2. This is the first report of the generation of a true cisgenic plan...|$|R
40|$|Modern potato {{breeding}} requires over 100, 000 seedlings per new variety. Main {{reasons are}} (1) {{the increasing number}} of traits that have to be combined in this tetraploid vegetatively propagated crop, and (2) an increasing number of traits (e. g., resistance to biotic stress) originates from wild species. Pre-breeding by introgression or induced translocation is an expensive way of transferring single traits (such as R-genes, coding for resistance to biotic stress) to the cultivated plant. The most important obstacle is simultaneous transfer of undesired neighbouring alien alleles as linkage drag. Stacking several genes from different wild sources is increasing this linkage drag problem tremendously. Biotechnology has enabled transformation of alien genes into the plant. Initially, transgenes were originating mainly from microorganisms, viruses or non-crossable plant species, or they were chimeric. Moreover, selection markers coding for antibiotic resistance or herbicide resistance were needed. Transgenes are a new gene source for plant breeding and, therefore, additional regulations like the EU Directive 2001 / 18 /EC were developed. Because of a strong opposition against genetic modification of plants in Europe, the application of this Directive is strict, very expensive, hampering the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops and the use of this technology by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Currently, GM crops are almost the exclusive domain of multinationals. Meanwhile, not only transgenes but also natural genes from the plant species itself or from crossable plant species, called cisgenes, are available and the alien selection genes can be avoided in the end product. This opens the way for cisgenic crops without alien genes. The existing EU directive for GM organisms is not designed for this new development. The cisgenes belong to the existing breeders¿ gene pool. The use of this classical gene pool has been regulated already in agreements regarding breeders¿ rights. We are proposing a step by step approach starting with a crop and gene specific derogation and monitoring towards a general exemption of <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> from the Directive. Two examples, i. e. development of cisgenic potato for resistance to Phytophthora infestans and cisgenic apple for resistance to Venturia inaequalis are discussed shortly for illustration of the importance of cisgenesis as a new tool for traditional plant breeding. Cisgenesis is simplifying introgression and induced translocation breeding tremendously and is highly recommended for SMEs and developing countrie...|$|R
30|$|A {{major issue}} in the debate about GM {{technology}} is the intellectual property rights for plant varieties. The genetic modification of organisms is currently a patentable practice. However, patenting plant traits has given reasons for concerns by {{a broad range of}} the Norwegian stakeholders. Within the development of cisgenic crops, proponents emphasize that because the inserted gene stems from a crossable and/or sexually compatible variety; the obtained crop is in theory not different from a potentially traditionally bred crop. Thus for them, the similarity between cisgenic and conventional crops makes the product of cisgenic approaches closer to traditionally bred plant varieties, thereby arguing for easing the regulation of cisgenic crops. Despite this argued similarity, cisgenic crops are considered to be sufficiently different to be patentable. Although patent laws and requirements differ among nations, in general patents are granted if inventions are “new, involve an inventive step and are susceptible of industrial application” (Article 52, EPC 2016). What can be patented when it concerns biological inventions is the ‘biological material’—in this case the plant—possessing specific trait(s) {{as a result of the}} invention, or a process that enables a plant to be produced possessing specific trait(s) as a result of the invention (Article 8, DIRECTIVE 98 / 44 /EC), for example the trait to be resistant to late blight. Nevertheless, if a biotechnological product fulfils these criteria and can obtain a patent, one could argue that it is reasonable to have an elaborated regulatory (safety) assessment in place to assess the risks, need and desire of this novel trait in the crop before it is released on the market. Therefore, a paradox emerges in the arguments in favour of deregulation of cisgenic crops, namely that the claim for novelty that is required to obtain a patent is the same reason why deregulation or easing the regulation of this method seems questionable, and arguably irresponsible. Indeed, if it is questioned whether <b>cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> should fall under the (strict) GMO regulation, it simultaneously raises questions whether it still fulfils the criteria to be patentable. This illustrates that this discussion is not only about whether an elaborated safety assessment should be in place. It also touches upon the perceived ambiguity whether cisgenic approaches should be a patentable practice, thereby questioning the criteria of the ‘inventive step’.|$|R
40|$|From 2006 through 2015, a {{research}} project on Durable Resistance in potato against Phytophthora (DuRPh) was carried out at Wageningen University and Research Centre. Its objective {{was to develop a}} proof of principle for durable resistance against late blight by cisgenesis. This public-funded project aimed at stimulating research on genetic modification and public debate on innovative genetic techniques. It was decided to clone and transfer late blight resistance (R) genes of crossable wild potato species (cisgenes) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation without non-potato genes. A stack of multiple R genes were planned to be inserted into established varieties, thereby creating a dynamic variety in which the composition of the stacks may vary over space and time. <b>Cisgenic</b> <b>plants</b> were selected based on the expression of all inserted R genes and trueness-to-type. Within the project, 13 R genes from wild potato species were genetically mapped and three of them were cloned. Four varieties were transformed with one to three R genes. This was initially done using kanamycin resistance provided by a selectable marker gene of synthetic origin in order to quickly test the performance and stability of the introduced R genes and stacked R gene combinations. Once the functioning thereof was confirmed, marker-free transformations were conducted; thus, true cisgenic events were selected. The results about the different R genes, their chromosomal location, their specificity, the background dependence, the maximum size of a stack, its regeneration time and associated somaclonal variation frequency and its stability were studied. After selection and characterisation in the laboratory, the best cisgenic events were assessed in field trials for late blight resistance. This showed that inserted R genes were capable of turning a susceptible variety into a resistant one. Maximising longevity of the resistance was assured through resistance management research. It was shown that stacking of multiple R genes and monitoring how to deploy these stacks spatially and temporally could reduce fungicide use by over 80 %. Communications through media and field demonstrations were manifold to allow public and policymakers to decide if cisgenesis is an acceptable tool to make potato farming more sustainable. Future deployment of the DuRPh strategy will depend largely on its status as a genetically modified crop or its exemption thereof. Worldwide near eradication of late blight would increase global annual potato production by close to 80 million tons, thereby contributing considerably to the needed additional global future food supply. </p...|$|R
