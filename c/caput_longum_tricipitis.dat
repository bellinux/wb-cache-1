Rheological and colorimetric characteristics were determined on the muscles <b>Caput</b> <b>longum</b> <b>tricipitis</b> brachii (CL), longissimus dorsi (LD), psoas maior (PM) anconeus (PA), supraspinatus (SS) after storage at - 20 °C for 120 d. Statistical analysis considered live weight as covariate and sex, muscle and interaction as fixed factor (GLM procedure, SAS). Results showed that females have darker meat than castrated males. LD muscle showed the lowest value of a* and b* and was chracacterized by the greater lightness with the lowest chroma and the highest hue value. On the other hand, PA was the darkest muscle and showed the worst rheological traits. PM exhibited the lowest hardness and chewiness value.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the structural and qualitative variations induced by two cooking procedures (electric griddle and microwave oven) 6 buffalo males of 17 {{months of age}} were slaughtered. On <b>Caput</b> <b>longum</b> <b>tricipitis</b> brachii (CLoTB), Gluteobiceps (Gb), Longissimus dorsi (LD), Semimembranosus (Sm) and Semitendinosus (St) muscles morphometric characteristics of FG, FOG and SO fiber types and some quality indicators (rheological and colour characteristics) were measured. The results showed that Semitendinosus has {{a higher percentage of}} FG and FOG fibers, CLoTB has an even distribution of the three fibre types, whereas the LD has a high percentage of FG. With both cooking procedure the cross sectional area (CSA) value of CLoTB, LD and Sm decreases by about 60 % whereas cooking on electric griddle causes a decrease in CSA value of St and Gb muscles of an additional 10 and 6 % respectively, compared to microwave cooking.

New strategies aiming {{to improve the quality}} of buffalo meat have to be applied particularly to face the problem of lipid peroxidation, one of the most important causes of meat food deterioration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the lipid oxidation of buffalo meat (muscles <b>Caput</b> <b>longum</b> <b>tricipitis</b> brachii, Longissimus dorsi and Semimembranosus), coming from animals fed with two different amount of vitamin E (600 IU/die and 1500 IU/die for 102 - 123 days) considering, as markers for lipid oxidation, the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) by HPLC-UV and TBA test. Moreover it was evaluated, by HPLC-DAD, vitamin E concentration in the meat samples. Muscles coming from animals with vitamin E supplementation were in mean 2 times more enriched of vitamin E than control (p < 0. 05). Meat from buffalo fed with 600 IU/die vitamin E had significant lower MDA concentration in comparison with control (in mean - 53 %, n= 4). Both for MDA and vitamin E concentrations not significant differences were found between the supplementation of 600 IU/die and 1500 IU/die.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to characterize two pig ancient autochthonous genetic types (AAGT) [Casertana (CT) and Calabrese (CA) ] at H-FABP (Heart- Fatty Acid Binding Protein) loci {{as well as to}} evaluate the associations of qualitative and quantitative meat traits. H-FABP is a candidate DNA segment coding protein (gene) for intramuscular fat depot (IMF). The identification of haplotypes suitable for IMF may represent a valid tool for molecular assisted selection (MAS) to improve meat qualitative traits functional to human well being and welfare. Genotyping was performed on 150 pigs (100 CT and 50 CA) reared at ConSDABI Experimental Farm by PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction – Restriction Fragment Lenght Polymorphism) method. Three diallelic point mutations were investigated: one located in a 700 bp sequence in the 5 ’upstream region (HinfI restriction site) and two in a 850 bp sequence, about 300 bp apart, located in intron 2 (HaeIII and MspI restriction sites, respectively) of the H-FABP DNA segment; in total, these mutations map in a region of about 7. 000 bp and may define a three locus haplotype. Some qualitative characteristics (colour and rheological traits) were detected on Psoas Major, Longissimus dorsi, <b>Caput</b> <b>longum</b> <b>tricipitis</b> brachii and Supraspinatus muscles of 59 CT and 50 CA. Experimental data were analyzed using carcass weight as covariate (SAS package) and the significance of comparisons between the estimated mean values was tested by Student’s t test. 27 possible haplotypes taking into account the diallelic polymorphism of each locus were calculated. The results, in the limits of the observation field, showed some haplotypes ‘AAGT- exclusive’ [3 in Casertana (HHDdAA; HHDDAa; HHddaa) and 2 in Calabrese (hhddAA; hhddaa) ] and a different incidence of the common haplotypes: in CT the most frequent was HHddAa (38 %) while in CA was HhddAa (22 %). The relation between genetic structure of H-FABP loci and quanti-qualitative characteristics of meat evidenced the association between H-FABP loci and fatty traits. CA carriers of HhddAa haplotype evidenced a significant higher backfat weight (19. 11 kg) in comparison with carriers of HHddaa haplotype which showed the lower fatness (6. 35 kg); furthermore, the former haplotype also affected the fatness in other cuts (jowl and belly). Animals with the hhddAA haplotype evidenced a higher thickness of backfat at shoulder level (79. 41 mm), while HhddAa showed the lowest value in the Calabrese AAGT. A different chromatic behavior of meat was observed in relation to both muscle type and haplotype. In Casertana, meat of HHDdAA carriers was lighter as consequence of the highest lightness value (43. 44; P< 0. 05) while in Calabrese the HHDdAa haplotype was associated with a higher lightness value (45. 84; P< 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction: Actually, the {{productive}} rules of "Vitellone Bianco dell'Appennino Centrale" ban {{the use of}} maize silage in the four months before slaughtering due to the possible negative effects on meat quality, particularly on meat colour and water holding capacity. The studies on this argument are conflicting and conducted on foreign breed. So {{there is a lack}} on Chianina beef, one of the most diffuse breed for meat production in Italy, for this important topic. Aim: To compare the effect of maize silage or hay in diet during the last four month of fattening on some meat physicalchemical quality characteristics of Chianina beef. Materials and methods: 90 Chianina beef fed with hay (Group 1) or maize silage (Group 2) were slaughtered at an average age of 19 months. After the normal ageing for this meat, different for each muscles, samples of three different muscles (<b>caput</b> <b>longum</b> triceps brachii, longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus), were analysed in order to asses the main meat quality characteristics: pH, colour before and after 48 h of storage to evaluate meat shelf-life, tenderness (expressed as shear force), water holding capacity (evaluated as drip loss, cooking loss and M/T), chemical composition (dry matter, crude protein, ether extract and ash). The variance analysis was used to assess statistical differences. Results and discussion: pH values were normal and similar between muscles and groups. The use of maize silage induced small variation, detectable only instrumentally, in meat colour (L*), drip loss and ether extract of longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus muscles. No differences are shown for the quality of <b>caput</b> <b>longum</b> triceps brachii. Nevertheless, the differences are very low and the final consumer doesn't note any variation. Conclusion: From the results of this study, it seems possible to use maize silage in Chianina diet even during the last four month of fattening, without any significant change in meat quality, when there is any economic advantage for breeders...|$|R
40|$|The {{tenderness}} {{characteristics of}} 15 primal cuts of beef {{of three different}} age groups were assessed, and the most reliable cut to predict carcass tenderness was determined. Fifteen wholesale cuts from each age group, representing the full variation in fatness, were aged, cooked and underwent sensory evaluation, shear force resistance and proximate analysis. Collagen content and solubility was determined. Percentage fat {{was used as a}} covariant during statistical analyses. Tenderness, residue and collagen solubility of all cuts decreased significantly with animal age. Collagen solubility was the largest discriminant between the three age groups, while animal age had no significant effect on collagen content. Tenderness of primal cuts from the same carcass varied considerably, with collagen content and shear force resistance as the largest discriminants between the cuts.

40|$|Changes in {{recruitment}} {{threshold of}} individual motor {{units of the}} human biceps (<b>caput</b> <b>longum),</b> a multifunctional muscle, were investigated during different tasks, i. e., isometric flexion of the elbow, isometric supination of the forearm, and isometric exorotation of the humerus of the 110 ° flexed semiprone horizontal arm. The activity of 17 motor units was recorded by means of fine wire electrodes. Some units were found that could be recruited only by one force, e. g., flexion. In such cases recruitment did not depend on other forces. Most units, however, were recruited when a linear combination of exerted forces exceeded a certain threshold. The contribution of a force to this combination could be different for different motor units. Units with a high threshold for flexion tended to show a lower threshold while simultaneously exerting force in another direction. Units with a low threshold for flexion were more difficult to recruit under this condition. The findings {{support the view that}} movements are programmed “directionally”...|$|R

To evaluate the aptitude for conservation of Chianina beef, 54 o meat samples taken from the <b>caput</b> <b>longum</b> triceps brachii (180 samples), longissimus dorsi (180 samples) and semitendinosus (180 samples) were used and subjected to the following analyses: colour measured both before (Time 0 h) and after 48 h of storage under standard conditions at 4 °C (Time 48 h) and {{water holding capacity}} evaluated as drip loss. The analyses of the results allowed us to identify some differences between the three muscles analysed: meat derived from semitendinosus always appeared to be lighter and paler and had significantly less drip loss. Storage did not seem to have any negative effects on the colour; the significant increase in values for b* and H* showed that the beef tended to become slightly paler, an attractive for the Italian consumer. Drip loss, indicating the amount of liquid lost by the meat during refrigeration, was generally very small. These results showed the good aptitude of Chianina meat for domestic storage, since colour and drip loss are closely related to the appearance of the meat...|$|R

Research question: What is the inter-tester, and intra-tester reliability of ultrasonographic measurements of tendon thickess in supraspinatus and biceps brachii <b>caput</b> <b>longum</b> in a population with shoulder tendinopathy? Methods: A quantitative reliability study with a non-experimental design was performed. Ultrasonographic measurement of the tendon thickness in supraspinatus and biceps brachii was undertaken on participants with shoulder tendinopathy (N = 27). Analysis of inter-tester reliability was based on tendon thickness measurements from two raters. Intra-tester reliability analysis was performed on two sets of data from one rater. Intraclass correlation coefficients ICC 1, 1 and ICC 3, 1 was utilized for analysis of relative reliability. Within- subject standard deviation was utilized in analysis of absolute reliability. Results: Relative reliability for biceps brachii was very good in five of seven analyses (range ICC: 0, 81 - 0, 94), and good in two of seven (range ICC: 0, 64 - 0, 65).

Muscle wasting occurs due to genetic mutation as in muscular dystrophy, age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) {{as well as}} in chronic wasting disorders as in cancer cachexia. Food restriction reduces muscle mass underpinned by increased muscle protein break down. However the influence of dietary restriction on the morphometry and phenotype of forelimb muscles in a genetically modified myostatin null mice are not fully characterized. The effect of a five week dietary limitation on five anatomically and structurally different forelimb muscles was examined. C 57 /BL 6 wild type (Mstn+/+) and myostatin null (Mstn-/-) mice were either given a standard rodent normal daily diet ad libitum (ND) or 60 % food restriction (FR) for a 5 week period. M. triceps brachii Caput laterale (T. lateral), M. triceps brachii <b>Caput</b> <b>longum</b> (T. long), M. triceps brachii Caput mediale (T. medial), M. extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) and M. flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) were dissected, weighted and processed for immunohistochemistry. Muscle mass, fibers cross sectional areas (CSA) and myosin heavy chain types IIB, IIX, IIA and type I were analyzed. We provide evidence that caloric restriction results in muscle specific weight reduction with the fast myofibers being more prone to atrophy. We show that slow fibers are less liable to dietary restriction induced muscle atrophy. The effect of dietary restriction was more pronounced in Mstn-/- muscles to implicate the oxidative fibers compared to Mstn+/+. Furthermore, peripherally located myofibers are more susceptible to dietary induced reduction compared to deep fibers.

With SO diet, also the other trans isomers of octadecenoic acid increased, included trans- 10 C 18 : 1, while saturated and medium chain fatty acid levels decreased. The intramuscular lipid content of kids fed SO milk resulted lower than that of kids fed C milk (1. 58 g/ 100 g sample vs 1. 81 g/ 100 g sample).
