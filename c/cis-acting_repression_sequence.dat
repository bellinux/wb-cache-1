40|$|The small subunit of {{ribonucleotide}} reductase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RNR 2) was induced 3 - to 20 -fold by {{a variety}} of DNA-damaging agents. Induction of the RNR 2 transcript by {{at least one of these}} agents, methyl methanesulfonate, did not require protein synthesis. To identify sequences involved in the regulation of RNR 2, we introduced deletions upstream of the transcription start site. Sequences required for induction were contained within a 200 -base-pair region that could confer methyl methanesulfonate inducibility on the heterologous CYC 1 promoter. This region contained a <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> and at least two positive activation sites. One of these activation sites bound RAP 1, a protein known to associate with mating-type silencers and the upstream activation sequences of a number of genes. The behavior of deletions of the <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> suggests that induction of RNR 2 may occur, at least in part, through relief of repression...|$|R
40|$|The SIN 3 global {{regulatory}} factor affects expression of many yeast genes, including the phospholipid biosynthetic gene, INO 1. Mutations in the SIN 3 gene result in {{elevated levels of}} INO 1 expression under conditions that normally confer full repression of INO 1 transcription, indicating that SIN 3 is a negative regulator of INO 1. In this study, the INO 1 promoter was analyzed for sequences that {{play a role in}} responding to SIN 3 -mediated repression. Two distinct promoter elements, the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS 1) and the INO 1 upstream activation sequence (UASINO) both were found to be involved in enabling SIN 3 to repress INO 1 expression...|$|R

We have mapped a short repression motif to residues 150 – 170 within the N-terminal domain of CTCF. This motif is active in HeLa, HEK 293 and COS- 7 cell lines where it is both sufficient and necessary for silencing either an SV 40 -, or a CMV-enhancer. It also represses the basal activity of an SV 40 core promoter. Since this autonomous repression motif displays no sequence similarity to any other regulatory protein, it represents a yet unknown co-repressor recruiting motif...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{identified}} a bifunctional regulatory element located between nt 374 and 431 upstream of TATA box of porcine adenovirus (PAV) 3 E 1 A promoter. Deletion of the element dramatically reduced the steady-state level of E 1 A mRNA, but increased that of E 1 B, which lies immediately downstream of E 1 A. The mutant virus displayed defective replication at early times of infection, but replicated nearly {{as efficiently as}} wild-type PAV- 3 at late times of infection. This defect was complemented with coinfecting wild-type virus in a mixed infection. The {{results indicated that the}} upstream activation sequences (UAS) of E 1 A overlap the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequences</b> (URS) of E 1 B, although both transcription units are transcribed from different promoters...|$|R
40|$|Expression of the arginase (CAR 1) gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{induced by}} {{arginine}} or its analog homoarginine.

The objective of this work was to identify the cis-acting elements responsible for CAR 1 transcriptional activation and response to inducer. We identified three upstream activation sequences (UASs) that support transcriptional activation in a heterologous expression vector. Two of these UAS elements function in the absence of inducer, whereas the third functions only when inducer is present. One of the inducer-independent UAS elements exhibits significant homology to the Sp 1 factor-binding sites identified in simian virus 40 and various mammalian genes...|$|R
40|$|Transcription of {{the three}} unlinked, {{homologous}} STA 1 - 3 glucoamylase-encoding genes, involved in starch degradation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was previously shown to be down-regulated {{by the presence of}} STA 10, acting via three upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> regions that were identified in the STA 2 promoter. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a putative transcriptional activator gene, MSS 10 (multicopy suppressor of STA 10), which, when present in multiple copies, overcomes STA 10 repression. Deletion of MSS 10, located on chromosome XV, resulted in media-specific extinction of glucoamylase synthesis. The nucleotide sequence of MSS 10 is identical to three other genes from S. cerevisiae identified as: FUP 1, a gene that enhances iron-limited growth; PHD 2, a gene identified for its ability to induce pseudohyphal growth in diploid cells grown on nitrogen-limited media; and MSN 1, a gene encoding a transcriptional activator involved in invertase regulation.

40|$|Regulated {{expression}} of the inducible arginase (CAR 1) gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been shown to}} require three upstream activation sequences (UASs) and an upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence,</b> URS 1. Two of the UAS elements, UASC 1 and UASC 2, operate in an inducer-independent manner, while the third, UASI, is inducer dependent. UASC 1 and UASC 2 were previously shown to contain ABF- 1 binding sites that were required for normal transcription. In this work, we demonstrate that UASC 1 and UASC 2 also contain two and three sites, respectively, that are able to bind RAP 1 protein. RAP 1 binding to these sites, however, is significantly weaker than that to sites in TEF 2 and HMRE. The effects of mutating the sites individually or in combination suggest that at least three of them, two in UASC 1 and one in UASC 2, probably participate in CAR 1 expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of {{systemic acquired resistance}} (SAR) in plants involves the upregulation of many Pathogenesis-Related (PR) genes, which work in concert to confer resistance to {{a broad spectrum of}} pathogens. Because SAR is a costly process, SAR-associated transcription must be tightly regulated. Arabidopsis thaliana SNI 1 (for Suppressor of NPR 1, Inducible) is a negative regulator of SAR required to dampen the basal {{expression of}} PR genes. Whole genome transcriptional profiling showed that in the sni 1 mutant, Nonexpresser of PR genes (NPR 1) –dependent benzothiadiazole S-methylester–responsive genes were specifically derepressed. Interestingly, SNI 1 also repressed transcription when expressed in yeast, suggesting that it functions as an active transcriptional repressor through a highly conserved mechanism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that histone modification may be involved in SNI 1 -mediated <b>repression.</b> <b>Sequence</b> comparison with orthologs in other plant species and a saturating NAAIRS-scanning mutagenesis of SNI 1 identified regions in SNI 1 that are required for its activity. The structural similarity of SNI 1 to Armadillo repeat proteins implies that SNI 1 may form a scaffold for interaction with proteins that modulate transcription...|$|R
40|$|Some wild {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae form a {{pellicle}} {{on the surface}} of contaminated wines during the post-fermentation period of wine making. In this study, we found that both pellicle formation and FLO 11 expression by a wild pellicle-forming strain of S. cerevisiae isolated from contaminated wine were repressed in a glucose-containing medium. Substitution of the promoter region of FLO 11 in the cells with a constitutive promoter caused derepression of pellicle formation in the glucose-containing medium and wine. These findings indicate that glucose repression of the expression of the FLO 11 gene, but not the glucose repression of the expression of other glucose-repressed genes, is responsible for the glucose-dependent regulation of pellicle formation by the wild pellicle-forming yeast strain. Furthermore, we found that the wild pellicle-forming strain had the same deletion of the 111 -bp <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> in the FLO 11 promoter as the flor strains commercially used for making sherry-like wines. Based on the results obtained in this study, a new method that would prevent deleterious pellicle formation in wineries is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae COX 5 b gene is {{regulated}} {{at the level}} of transcription by both the carbon source and oxygen. To define the cis-acting elements that underlie this transcriptional control, deletion analysis of the upstream regulatory region of COX 5 b was performed. The results of the study suggest that at least four distinct regulatory sites are functional upstream of the COX 5 b transcriptional starts. One, which was precisely defined to a region of 20 base pairs, contains two TATA-like elements. Two upstream activating sequences (UAS 15 b and UAS 2 (5 b)) and an upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS 5 b) were also found. Each of the latter three elements was able either to activate (UAS 1 (5 b) and UAS 2 (5 b)) or to repress URS 5 b) the transcription of a heterologous yeast gene. Further analysis revealed that UAS 1 (5 b) is the site of carbon source control and may be composed of two distinct domains that act synergistically. URS 5 b mediates the aerobic repression of COX 5 b and contains two sequences that are highly conserved in other yeast genes negatively regulated by oxygen...|$|R
40|$|The SSA 1 gene, {{one of the}} heat-inducible HSP 70 {{genes in}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also {{displays}} a basal level of expression during logarithmic growth. Multiple sites related to the heat shock element (HSE) consensus sequence {{are present in the}} SSA 1 promoter region (Slater and Craig, Mol. Cell. Biol. 7 : 1906 - 1916, 1987). One of the HSEs, HSE 2, is important in the basal expression of SSA 1 as well as in heat-inducible expression. A promoter containing a mutant HSE 2 showed a fivefold-lower level of basal expression and altered kinetics of expression after heat shock. A series of deletion and point mutations led to identification of an upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS) which overlapped HSE 2. A promoter containing a mutation in the URS showed an increased level of basal expression. A URS-binding activity was detected in yeast whole-cell extracts by a gel electrophoresis DNA-binding assay. The results reported in this paper indicate that basal expression of the SSA 1 promoter is determined by both positive and negative elements and imply that the positively acting yeast heat shock factor HSF is responsible, at least in part, for the basal level of expression of SSA 1...|$|R
40|$|The PHR 1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the {{apoenzyme}} for the DNA {{repair enzyme}} photolyase. PHR 1 transcription is induced {{in response to}} 254 nm radiation {{and a variety of}} chemical damaging agents. We report here the identification of promoter elements required for PHR 1 expression. Transcription is regulated primarily through three sequence elements clustered within a 120 bp region immediately upstream of the translational start site. A 20 bp interrupted palindrome comprises UASPHR 1 and is responsible for 80 - 90 % of basal and induced expression. UASPHR 1 alone can activate transcription of a CYC 1 minimal promoter but does not confer damage responsiveness. In the intact PHR 1 promoter UAS function is dependent upon an upstream essential sequence (UES). URSPHR 1 contains a binding site for the damage-responsive repressor Prp; consistent with this role, deletion or specific mutations of the URS increase basal level expression and decrease the induction ratio. Deletion of URSPHR 1 also eliminates the requirement for UESPHR 1 for promoter activation, indicating that the UES attenuates Prp-mediated <b>repression.</b> <b>Sequences</b> within UASPHR 1 are similar to regulatory sequences found upstream of both damage responsive and nonresponsive genes involved in DNA repair and metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The {{extracellular}} proteases of Aspergillus nidulans {{are produced}} {{in response to}} limitation of carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur, {{even in the absence}} of exogenous protein. Mutations in the A. nidulans xprF and xprG genes have been shown to result in elevated levels of extracellular protease in response to carbon limitation. The xprF gene was isolated and sequence analysis indicates that it encodes a 615 -amino-acid protein, which represents a new type of fungal hexokinase or hexokinase-like protein. In addition to their catalytic role, hexokinases are thought to be involved in triggering carbon catabolite <b>repression.</b> <b>Sequence</b> analysis of the xprF 1 and xprF 2 alleles showed that both alleles contain nonsense mutations. No loss of glucose or fructose phosphorylating activity was detected in xprF 1 or xprF 2 mutants. There are two possible explanations for this observation: (1) the xprF gene may encode a minor hexokinase or (2) the xprF gene may encode a protein with no hexose phosphorylating activity. Genetic evidence suggests that the xprF and xprG genes are involved in the same regulatory pathway. Support for this hypothesis was provided by the identification of a new class of xprG(-) mutation that suppresses the xprF 1 mutation and results in a protease-deficient phenotype...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{and genetic}} studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{have demonstrated that}} histone deacetylases (HDACs) are required for transcriptional activation and repression, but the mechanism by which they activate transcription remains poorly understood. We show that two HDACs, RPD 3 and HOS 2, are required for the activation of DNA damage-inducible genes RNR 3 and HUG 1. Using mutants specific for the Rpd 3 L complex, we show that the complex is responsible for regulating RNR 3. Furthermore, unlike what was described for the GAL genes, Rpd 3 L regulates the activation of RNR 3 by deacetylating nucleosomes at the promoter, not at the open reading frame. Rpd 3 is recruited to the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> of RNR 3, which surprisingly does not require Tup 1 or Crt 1. Chromatin remodeling and TFIID recruitment are largely unaffected in the Δrpd 3 /Δhos 2 mutant, but the recruitment of RNA polymerase II is strongly reduced, arguing that Rpd 3 and Hos 2 regulate later stages in the assembly of the preinitiation complex or facilitate multiple rounds of polymerase recruitment. Furthermore, the histone H 4 acetyltransferase Esa 1 {{is required for the}} activation of RNR 3 and HUG 1. Thus, reduced or unregulated constitutive histone H 4 acetylation is detrimental to promoter activity, suggesting that HDAC-dependent mechanisms are in place to reset promoters to allow high levels of transcription...|$|R
40|$|The allantoin-degradative pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{consists}} of several genes whose expression is highly {{induced by the}} presence of allophanic acid. Induced expression requires a functional DAL 81 gene product. Analysis of these genes has demonstrated the presence of three cis-acting elements in the upstream regions: (i) an upstream activation sequence (UAS) required for transcriptional activation in an inducer-independent fashion, (ii) an upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS) that mediates inhibition of this transcriptional activation, and (iii) an upstream induction sequence (UIS) needed for a response to inducer. The UIS element mediates inhibition of URS-mediated function when inducer is present. We cloned and characterized the DAL 81 gene and identified the element with which it was associated. The gene was found to encode a rare 3. 2 -kilobase-pair mRNA. The amount of DAL 81 -specific RNA responded neither to induction nor to nitrogen catabolite repression. Deletion of the DAL 81 gene resulted in loss of induction but did not significantly affect basal level expression of the DAL 7 and DUR 1, 2 genes or the UAS and URS functions present in plasmid constructions. These data suggest that (i) transcriptional activation of the DAL genes and their responses to inducer are mediated by different factors and cis-acting sequences and (ii) the UIS functions only when a wild-type DAL 81 gene product is available...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of histone methylation {{have emerged as}} an important issue since the identification of histone demethylases. We studied the regulatory function of Rph 1 /KDM 4 (lysine demethylase), a histone H 3 K 36 demethylase, on transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overexpression of Rph 1 reduced the expression of PHR 1 and increased UV sensitivity. The catalytically deficient mutant (H 235 A) of Rph 1 diminished the repressive transcriptional effect on PHR 1 expression, which indicates that histone demethylase activity contributes to transcriptional repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that Rph 1 was associated at the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> of PHR 1 through zinc-finger domains and was dissociated after UV irradiation. Notably, overexpression of Rph 1 and H 3 K 36 A mutant reduced histone acetylation at the URS, which implies a crosstalk between histone demethylation and acetylation at the PHR 1 promoter. In addition, the crucial checkpoint protein Rad 53 acted as an upstream regulator of Rph 1 and dominated the phosphorylation of Rph 1 that was required for efficient PHR 1 expression and the dissociation of Rph 1. The release of Rph 1 from chromatin also required the phosphorylation at S 652. Our study demonstrates that the histone demethylase Rph 1 {{is associated with a}} specific chromatin locus and modulates histone modifications to repress a DNA damage responsive gene under control of damage checkpoint signaling...|$|R

Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of this sequence identified bases required for catabolite repression. Two mutations increased both the 2 -fold symmetry of the operator and the repression ratio. Although many mutations reduced the repression ratio 3 - to 11 -fold, some also caused a 2 -fold or greater increase in amylase production.

40|$|Glucose {{repression}} is {{a global}} transcriptional regulatory mechanism commonly observed in micro-organisms for the repression of enzymes that are not essential for glucose metabolism. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mig 1 p, a homologue of Wilms' tumour protein, {{is a global}} repressor protein dedicated to glucose repression. Mig 1 p represses genes either by binding directly to the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> of structural genes or by indirectly repressing a transcriptional activator, such as Ga 14 p. In addition, some genes are repressed by both of the above mechanisms. This raises a fundamental question regarding the physiological relevance of the varied mechanisms of repression that exist involving Mig 1 p. We address this issue by comparing two well-known glucose-repression systems, that is, SUC 2 and GAL gene expression systems, which encompass all the above three mechanisms. We demonstrate using steady-state analysis that these mechanisms lead to a hierarchical glucose repression profile of different family of genes. This switch over from one carbon source to another is well-calibrated {{as a function of}} glucose concentration through this hierarchical transcriptional response. The mechanisms prevailing in this repression system can achieve amplification and sensitivity, as observed in the well-characterized MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade system, albeit through a different structure. A critical feature of repression predicted by our steady-state model for the mutant strain of S. cerevisiae lacking Gal 80 p agrees well with the data reported here as well as that available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The human {{cytomegalovirus}} major immediate-early protein IE 86 is pivotal for coordinated {{regulation of}} viral gene expression throughout infection. A relatively promiscuous transactivator of viral {{early and late}} gene transcription, IE 86 also acts during infection to negatively regulate its own promoter via direct binding to a 14 -bp palindromic IE 86 -binding site, the cis <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (crs), located between the major immediate-early promoter (MIEP) TATA box {{and the start of}} transcription. Although such autoregulation does not involve changes in the binding of basal transcription factors to the MIEP in vitro, it does appear to involve selective inhibition of RNA polymerase II recruitment. However, how this occurs is unclear. We show that autorepression by IE 86 at late times of infection correlates with changes in chromatin structure around the MIEP during the course of infection and that this is likely to result from physical and functional interactions between IE 86 and chromatin remodeling enzymes normally associated with transcriptional repression of cellular promoters. Firstly, we show that IE 86 -mediated autorepression is inhibited by histone deacetylase inhibitors. We also show that IE 86 interacts, in vitro and in vivo, with the histone deacetylase HDAC 1 and histone methyltransferases G 9 a and Suvar(3 - 9) H 1 and that coexpression of these chromatin remodeling enzymes with IE 86 increases autorepression of the MIEP. Finally, we show that mutation of the crs {{in the context of the}} virus abrogates the transcriptionally repressive chromatin phenotype normally found around th...|$|R

Here {{we describe the}} isolation of the entire MGT 1 gene and its promoter by sequence directed chromosome integration and walking. The MGT 1 promoter was fused to a lacZ reporter gene to study how MGT 1 expression is controlled. MGT 1 is not induced by alkylating agents, nor is it induced by other DNA damaging agents such as UV light. However, deletion analysis defined an upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence,</b> whose removal dramatically increased basal level gene expression. The polypeptide deduced from the complete MGT 1 sequence contained 18 more N-terminal amino acids than that previously determined; the role of these 18 amino acids, which harbored a potential nuclear localization signal, was explored. The MGT 1 gene was also cloned under the GAL 1 promoter, so that MTase levels could be manipulated, and we examined MGT 1 function in a MTase deficient yeast strain (mgt 1). The extent of resistance to both alkylation-induced mutation and cell killing directly correlated with MTase levels. Finally we show that mgt 1 S. cerevisiae has a higher rate of spontaneous mutation than wild type cells, indicating that there is an endogenous source of DNA alkylation damage in these eukaryotic cells and that one of the in vivo roles of MGT 1 is to limit spontaneous mutations...|$|R
40|$|Depending on {{promoter}} context, YY 1 can activate or repress transcription, {{or provide}} {{a site for}} transcription initiation. To investigate whether the ability of YY 1 to induce DNA bending influenced its ability to activate and repress transcription, simple synthetic promoters were constructed in which the YY 1 binding site was inserted between the TATA box and either the NF 1 or AP 1 recognition sequences. In transient transfections of COS cells, the NF 1 YY 1 TATA and NF 1 RYY 1 TATA promoters exhibited a dramatic 15 - 20 -fold increase in correctly initiated transcription. These promoters exhibited even larger 60 - 80 -fold increases in transcription in HeLa cells. Neither multiple copies of the YY 1 binding site alone, nor placement of a YY 1 site upstream of the NF 1 site activated transcription. Deletion of 4 bp between the NF 1 and YY 1 sites, which changes the phase of the DNA bends, abolished the 16 -fold activation of transcription by NF 1 YY 1 TATA. Insertion of the YY 1 site between the AP 1 site and the TATA box decreased transcription approximately 3 -fold. Replacing the YY 1 binding site with an intrinsic DNA bending sequence mimicked this transcription <b>repression.</b> <b>Sequences</b> of similar length which do not bend DNA fail to repress AP 1 -mediated transcription. Gel mobility shift assays were used to show that binding of YY 1 to its recognition sequence did not repress binding of AP 1 to its recognition sequences.

This work provides {{evidence for the}} involvement of distinct types of cis-acting elements in the induction process. The first element {{was found to have}} the properties of an upstream activation sequence (UAS). This element was localized to a 16 -base-pair (bp) DNA fragment containing a short 5 -bp sequence that occurred repeatedly in the upstream region of DAL 7. When present in two or more copies, the 16 -bp fragment supported high-level beta-galactosidase production in a CYC 1 -lacZ expression vector; there was, however, no response to the allantoin pathway inducer. The second element had the properties of a negatively acting element or upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (URS). This element was localized to a 16 -bp DNA fragment containing an 8 -bp sequence that was repeated four times in the upstream region of DAL 7. A fragment containing the 8 -bp repeated sequence placed adjacent to the UAS-containing fragment mediated inhibition of the ability of the UAS to support lacZ expression regardless of whether inducer was present. A third element, designated an upstream induction sequence (UIS), was required for response to inducer. The UIS was localized to a small DNA fragment containing an approximately 10 -bp sequence that was repeated twice in the upstream region of DAL 7. When a fragment containing the 10 -bp repeated sequence was placed adjacent to these UAS and URS elements, the construction (UIS-UAS-URS) supported normal oxalurate-mediated induction of beta-galactosidase synthesis. These data are consistent with the suggestion that multiple, cis-acting elements participate in the induction process...|$|R
40|$|Systems {{biology is}} an {{emergent}} {{field in the}} biological sciences that has enabled biologists to quantitatively study gene circuits and networks by integrating mathematical modeling, bioinformatics, and biological approaches. Here, we use mathematical modeling and single- cell fluorescence microscopy to reveal a novel gene circuitry in CMV, a global pathogen and major health concern in infants and immunocompromised individuals. This gene circuitry produces acceleration while limiting amplification of output protein levels {{in the presence of}} transactivators. IE 2 (Immediate-Early 2), CMV's essential viral transactivator, drives this accelerator circuit by autoregulating itself via cooperative binding to the cis <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> (crs), a 12 base-pair (bp) sequence located just upstream of the Major Immediate-Early promoter (MIEP) 's Initiator site. IE 2 acceleration produces a viral replication fitness advantage, and mutation of the crs sequence eliminates IE 2 acceleration and produces amplification of IE 2 protein in response to transactivators, severely limiting CMV's replication ability. The [Delta]crs mutant virus exhibits lowered transcriptional strength due to its inability to efficiently localize to sub-nuclear PML bodies, where CMV immediate-early transcription typically occurs. The low transcriptional strength in the [Delta]crs mutant virus results in slower IE 2 expression and a severe fitness cost. To further understand the mechanism behind the IE 2 accelerator circuit, IE 2 's interaction with the crs sequence was studied using gel filtration chromatography and electron microscopy. IE 2 self-multimerizes into a ring -like structure in the presence of crs DNA, using multiple IE 2 subunits.

40|$|Although key genetic {{regulators}} {{of early}} meiotic transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{have been well}} characterized, the activation of meiotic genes is still poorly {{understood in terms of}} cis-acting DNA elements and their associated factors. I report here that induction of HSP 82 is regulated by the early meiotic IME 1 -IME 2 transcriptional cascade. Vegetative repression and meiotic induction depend on interactions of the promoter-proximal heat shock element (HSE) with a nearby bipartite repression element, composed of the ubiquitous early meiotic motif, URS 1 (upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> 1), and a novel ancillary repression element. The ancillary repression element is required for efficient vegetative repression, is spatially separable from URS 1, and continues to facilitate repression during sporulation. In contrast, URS 1 also functions as a vegetative repression element but is converted early in meiosis into an HSE-dependent activation element. An early step in this transformation may be the antagonism of URS 1 -mediated repression by IME 1. The HSE also nonspecifically supports a second major mode of meiotic activation that does not require URS 1 but does require expression of IME 2 and concurrent starvation. Interestingly, increased rather than decreased URS 1 -mediated vegetative transcription can be artificially achieved by introducing rare point mutations into URS 1 or by deleting the UME 6 gene. These lesions offer insight into mechanisms of URS-dependent repression and activation. Experiments suggest that URS 1 -bound factors functionally modulate heat shock factor during vegetative transcription and early meiotic induction but not during heat shock. The loss of repression and activation observed when the IME 2 activation element, T 4 C, is substituted for the HSE suggests specific requirements for URS 1 -upstream activation sequence interactions...|$|R

The {{role of the}} CRS upstream of the US 3 transcription start site {{in the context of}} the viral genome was determined by comparing the levels of transcription from these two enhancer-containing promoters in recombinant viruses with a wild-type or mutant CRS. Upstream of the CRS of the US 3 promoter was either the endogenous enhancer (R 2) or silencer (R 1). The downstream US 3 gene was replaced with the indicator gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Infected permissive human fibroblast cells or nonpermissive, undifferentiated monocytic THP- 1 cells were analyzed for expression from the US 3 promoter containing either the wild-type or mutant CRS. With the wild-type CRS, the maximum level of transcription in permissive cells was detected within 4 to 6 h after infection and then declined. With the mutant CRS and the R 2 enhancer upstream, expression from the US 3 promoter continued to increase throughout the viral replication cycle to levels 20 - to 40 -fold higher than for the wild type. In nonpermissive or permissive monocytic THP- 1 cells, expression from the US 3 promoter was also significantly higher when the CRS was mutated. Less expression was obtained when only the R 1 element was present, but expression was higher when the CRS was mutated. Thus, the CRS in the enhancer-containing US 3 promoter appears to allow for a short burst of US 3 gene expression followed by repression at early and late times after infection. Overexpression of US 3 may be detrimental to viral replication, and its level of expression must be stringently controlled. The role of the CRS and the viral IE 86 protein in controlling enhancer-containing promoters is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Expression of the GAL {{genes of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae is induced during growth on {{galactose}} by a well-characterized regulatory mechanism that relieves Gal 80 p inhibition of the Gal 4 p transcriptional activator. Growth on glucose overrides induction by galactose. Glucose repression acts at three levels to reduce GAL 1 expression: (i) {{it reduces the}} level of functional inducer in the cell; (ii) it lowers cellular levels of Gal 4 p by repressing GAL 4 transcription; and (iii) it inhibits Gal 4 p function through a repression element in the GAL 1 promoter. We quantified the amount of repression provided by each mechanism by assaying strains with none, one, two, or {{all three of the}} repression mechanisms intact. In a strain lacking all three repression mechanisms, there was almost no glucose repression of GAL 1 expression, suggesting that these are the major, possibly the only, mechanisms of glucose repression acting upon the GAL genes. The mechanism of repression that acts to reduce Gal 4 p levels in the cell is established slowly (hours after glucose addition), probably because Gal 4 p is stable. By contrast, the repression acting through the upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> element in the GAL 1 promoter is established rapidly (within minutes of glucose addition). Thus, these three mechanisms of repression collaborate to repress GAL 1 expression rapidly and stringently. The Mig 1 p repressor is responsible for most (possibly all) of these repression mechanisms. We show that for GAL 1 expression, mig 1 mutations are epistatic to snf 1 mutations, indicating that Mig 1 p acts after the Snf 1 p protein kinase in the glucose repression pathway, which suggests that Snf 1 p is an inhibitor of Mig 1 p...|$|R

Within the distal UAS (UAS 1), in vivo footprinting studies with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) identified two sequences similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN 4 (- 800 to - 792) - and TUF/RAP 1 (- 790 to - 778) -binding sites and two sequences which partially overlap a repeated sequence (- 778 to - 771 and - 720 to - 713) similar to the CAR 1 upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> of S. cerevisiae. Oligonucleotides carrying the TUF/RAP 1 -like-binding site and adjacent downstream nucleotides restored full transcriptional activity of a UAS 1 -deleted promoter. Within the proximal UAS (UAS 2), a directly repeated decameric sequence (- 146 to - 137 and - 136 to - 127) was protected against DMS in vivo. Sequences identical to the ABF 1 -binding site of S. cerevisiae (- 121 to - 109) or similar to the GCN 4 -binding site (- 113 to - 105) were not clearly protected from DMS in vivo. An oligomer (- 150 to - 106) carrying these three sequences, inserted into a UAS 2 -deleted promoter, increased the transcriptional activity. The results from footprints under different physiological conditions suggested that protein binding to both UASs was constitutive. Deletion of both UASs greatly reduced XPR 2 expression without abolishing its regulation. Our results strongly suggest that these UASs are targets for transcriptional factors required for assisting specific regulatory proteins...|$|R
40|$|The GAL 4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (encoding the {{activator}} of transcription of the GAL genes) {{is poorly}} expressed and is repressed during growth on glucose. To determine {{the basis for}} its weak expression and to identify DNA sequences recognized by proteins that activate transcription of a gene that itself encodes an activator of transcription, we have analyzed GAL 4 promoter structure. We show that the GAL 4 promoter is about 90 -fold weaker than the strong GAL 1 promoter and at least 7 -fold weaker than the feeble URA 3 promoter and that this low level of GAL 4 expression is primarily due to a weak promoter. By deletion mapping, the GAL 4 promoter {{can be divided into}} three functional regions. Two of these regions contain positive elements; a distal region termed the UASGAL 4 (upstream activation sequence) contains redundant elements that increase promoter function, and a central region termed the UESGAL 4 (upstream essential sequence) is essential for even basal levels of GAL 4 expression. The third element, an upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence,</b> mediates glucose <b>repression</b> of GAL 4 expression and is located between the UES and the transcriptional start site. The UASGAL 4 is unusual because it is not interchangable with UAS elements in other yeast promoters; it does not function as a UAS element when inserted in a CYC 1 promoter, and a normally strong UAS functions poorly in place of UASGAL 4 in the GAL 4 promoter. Similarly, the UES element of GAL 4 does not function as a TATA element in a test promoter, and consensus TATA elements do not function in place of UES elements in the GAL 4 promoter. These results suggest that GAL 4 contains a weak TATA-less promoter and that the proteins regulating expression of this regulatory gene may be novel and context specific...|$|R
40|$|During RNA {{interference}} (RNAi), long dsRNA {{is processed}} to approximately 21 nt duplexes, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which silence genes through a mRNA degradation pathway. Small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) and micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21 nt RNAs that are processed from endogenously encoded hairpin-structured precursors, and function to silence genes via translational repression. Here {{we report that}} synthetic hairpin RNAs that mimic siRNAs and miRNA precursor molecules can target a gene for silencing, and the mechanism of silencing appears to be through mRNA degradation and not translational <b>repression.</b> The <b>sequence</b> and structural configuration of these RNAs are important, and even slight modification in structure can affect the silencing activity of the hairpins. Furthermore, these RNAs are active when expressed by DNA vectors containing polymerase III promoters, opening the possibility for new approaches in stable RNAi-based loss of function studies...|$|R
40|$|In Bacillus subtilis, carbon catabolite {{repression}} (CCR) of many genes is mediated at <b>cis-acting</b> carbon <b>repression</b> elements (cre) by the catabolite repressor protein CcpA. Mutations in transcription-repair coupling factor (mfd) partially relieve CCR at cre sites located downstream of transcriptional start sites by abolishing the Mfd-mediated displacement of RNA polymerase stalled at cre sites which act as transcriptional roadblocks. Although the acsA cre is centered 44. 5 bp downstream of the acsA transcriptional start site, CCR of acsA expression is {{not affected by}} an mfd mutation. When the acsA cre is centered 161. 5 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site for the unregulated tms promoter, CCR is partially relieved by the mfd mutation. Since CCR mediated at an acsA cre centered 44. 5 bp downstream of the tms start site is not affected by the mfd mutation, the inability of Mfd to modulate CCR of acsA expression most likely results from {{the location of the}} acsA cre. Higher levels of CCR were found to occur at cre sites flanked by A+T-rich sequences than at cre sites bordered by G and C nucleotides. This suggests that nucleotides adjacent to the proposed 14 -bp cre consensus sequence participate {{in the formation of the}} CcpA {{catabolite repression}} complex at cre sites. Examination of CCR of acsA expression revealed that this regulation required the Crh and seryl-phosphorylated form of the HPr proteins but not glucose kinase...|$|R
40|$|In Bacillus subtilis, CcpA-dependent carbon catabolite {{repression}} (CCR) mediated at several <b>cis-acting</b> carbon <b>repression</b> elements (cre) requires the seryl-phosphorylated form {{of both the}} HPr (ptsH) and Crh (crh) proteins. During growth in minimal medium, the ptsH 1 mutation, which prevents seryl phosphorylation of HPr, partially relieves CCR of several genes regulated by CCR. Examination of the CCR of the histidine utilization (hut) enzymes in cells grown in minimal medium showed that neither the ptsH 1 nor the crh mutation individually had any affect on hut CCR but that hut CCR was abolished in a ptsH 1 crh double mutant. In contrast, the ptsH 1 mutation completely relieved hut CCR in cells grown in Luria-Bertani medium. The ptsH 1 crh double mutant exhibited several growth defects in glucose minimal medium, including reduced rates of growth and growth inhibition by high levels of glycerol or histidine. CCR is partially relieved in B. subtilis mutants which synthesize low levels of active glutamine synthetase (glnA). In addition, these glnA mutants grow more slowly than wild-type cells in glucose minimal medium. The defects in growth and CCR seen in these mutants are suppressed by mutational inactivation of TnrA, a global nitrogen regulatory protein. The inappropriate expression of TnrA-regulated genes in this class of glnA mutants may deplete intracellular pools of carbon metabolites and thereby result in {{the reduction of the}} growth rate and partial relief of CCR...|$|R
40|$|The NDT 80 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes {{a global}} {{activator}} of transcription of middle sporulation-specific genes, is first expressed after the activation of early meiotic genes but prior to activation of middle sporulation-specific genes. Both upstream <b>repression</b> <b>sequence</b> 1 (URS 1) and mid-sporulation element (MSE) sites {{are present in}} the promoter region of the NDT 80 gene; these elements have been shown previously to contribute to the regulation of expression of early and middle sporulation-specific genes, respectively, by mediating repression in growing cells and activation at specific times during sporulation. In this study, we have shown that the overlapping windows of URS 1 - and MSE-mediated repression and activation are responsible for the distinctive premiddle expression pattern of the NDT 80 gene. Our data suggest that a Sum 1 -associated repression complex bound at the NDT 80 MSE sites prevents Ime 1 tethered at the NDT 80 URS 1 sites from activating transcription of the NDT 80 gene at the time that Ime 1 -dependent activation of early URS 1 -regulated meiotic genes is occurring. We propose that a decrease in the efficiency of Sum 1 -mediated repression as cells progress through the early events of the sporulation program allows the previously inactive Ime 1 tethered at the URS 1 NDT 80 sites to promote a low level of expression of the NDT 80 gene. This initial phase of URS 1 -dependent NDT 80 expression is followed by Ndt 80 -dependent upregulation of its own expression, which requires the MSENDT 80 sites and occurs concomitantly with Ndt 80 -dependent activation of a set of middle MSE-regulated sporulation-specific genes. Mutation of IME 2 prevents expression of NDT 80 in sporulating cells. We show in this study that NDT 80 is expressed and that middle genes are activated in cells of an Δime 2 /Δime 2 Δsum 1 /Δsum 1 strain in sporulation medium. This suggests that Ime 2 activates expression of NDT 80 by eliminating Sum 1 -mediated repression...|$|R

50|$|CRISPRi can sterically repress {{transcription}} in {{two ways}} - by blocking transcriptional initiation or elongation. This is accomplished by designing sgRNA complementary to the promoter or exonic sequences, respectively. The level of transcriptional <b>repression</b> for exonic <b>sequences</b> is strand-specific. sgRNA complementary to the non-template strand more strongly represses transcription compared to sgRNA complementary to the template strand. One hypothesis to explain this effect is from the activity of helicase, which unwinds the RNA:DNA heteroduplex ahead of RNA pol II when the sgRNA is complementary to exons of the template strand. In prokaryotes, this steric inhibition can repress transcription of the target gene by almost 99.9%. Whereas in human cells, up to 90% repression was observed.|$|R
40|$|The VirB protein of Shigella flexneri is a {{positive}} regulator of the major virulence operons of this enteroinvasive intracellular pathogen. VirB resembles no other transcription factor but is strongly homologous to plasmid partition proteins. We found that the binding of the VirB protein to the promoter region of the icsB virulence gene induced hypersensitivity to cleavage by DNase I over a region to which the H-NS repressor protein binds and completely abolished the protection of this sequence from DNase I by H-NS. In the absence of H-NS, the VirB protein had no additive effect {{on the ability of}} the icsB promoter to form an open transcription complex, indicating that VirB is not involved in the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the promoter or in open complex formation. Similarly, VirB did not stimulate promoter function in an in vitro transcription assay but acted as an antagonist of H-NS-mediated <b>repression.</b> A <b>sequence</b> located upstream of the icsB promoter and related to cis-acting elements involved in plasmid partitioning was required for promoter derepression by VirB.
