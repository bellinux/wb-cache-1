We determined relative efficacy by comparing peak expiratory flow rates and incidents of emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and ventilatory failure of the study and during the 12 months before enrollment. Peak expiratory flow rates improved significantly in both groups.

DATA SOURCES: Mediciaid claims for 2007 and 2008 linked with Department of Public Health (DPH) service records. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted time series for all buprenorphine users and a longitudinal cohort analysis of 2, 049 individuals who began buprenorphine treatment in 2007. Outcome measures included use of relapse-related services, health care expenditures per person, and buprenorphine expenditures. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We used ICD- 9 codes and National Drug Codes to identify individuals with opioid dependence who filled prescriptions for buprenorphine. Medicaid and DPH data were linked with individual identifiers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Individuals using doses 3 ̆e 24 mg decreased from 16. 5 to 4. 1 percent. Relapses increased temporarily for some users but returned to previous levels within 3 months. Buprenorphine expenditures decreased but total expenditures did not change significantly.

In this paper, a novel mesh adjustable finite-element algorithm is proposed to optimize the magnetic gear dimensions in order to maximize the torque output for a given amount of PMs. With the proposed mesh adjustable finite-element algorithm, the coordinates of mesh nodes are moved according to dimensional changes, without compromising the mesh quality. The merit is that no re-mesh is required during the process of optimization, which can significantly reduce the computing time while retaining the robustness of the algorithm. By combining the proposed approach with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a reliable convergence to the finding of global optimum is achieved.

This study examines whether polyethylene glycol (PEG) facilitates central penetration of Mg after TBI, increasing neuroprotection while simultaneously reducing the dose requirements for Mg. Methods: Rats were exposed to diffuse TBI and administered intravenous MgCl₂ either alone (254 μmol/kg or 25. 4 μmol/kg) or in combination with PEG (1 g/kg PEG) at 30 -min postinjury. Vehicle-treated (saline or PEG) and sham animals served as controls. All animals were subsequently assessed for blood-brain barrier permeability and edema at 5 h, and functional outcome for 1 week postinjury. Results: Optimal dose (254 μmol/kg) MgCl₂ or Mg PEG significantly improved all outcome parameters compared to vehicle or PEG controls. Intravenous administration of 10 % MgCl₂ alone (25. 4 μmol/kg) had no beneficial effect on any of the outcome parameters, whereas 10 % Mg in PEG had the same beneficial effects as optimal dose Mg administration.

The refilling of the wood cavities with a consolidant, which confers robustness and stability, is an interesting strategy for the conservation methods of waterlogged archaeological objects. To this purpose, using different impregnation methods, waterlogged archaeological woods were consolidated by using aqueous mixtures of poly(ethylene) glycols with different molecular weights (PEG 400 and PEG 4000) as well as mixtures of these pure polymers. Of course the effectiveness of these treatments depends on the amount of polymers entrapped within the wood pores. In this work we proved that the DSC technique is suitable for the investigation of the selective consolidation of waterlogged archaeological woods by using PEGs polymer mixtures. The amount of each polymer (PEG 400 and PEG 4000) entrapped into the pores was quantitatively determined.
