While <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> booms can be an opportunity to diversify the economy if managed properly, it remains an empirical question whether this has effectively been the case. Using a panel of 78 resource-dependent countries over 1970 - 2012 we tackle this question thanks to cointegration analysis, dynamic macro-panel estimators, as well as analyses of diversification outcomes during selected <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> boom and bust episodes. While our econometric results evidence a stable and significant impact of <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> booms on export concentration through a more concentrated mix of already exported products, this relationship includes both an increase in export concentration during <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> booms {{and an increase in}} export diversification during <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> drops.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examined}} the equality of export and import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index in Nigeria. The source of data employed {{in this study is}} secondary data obtained from the Central bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin 2010. The statistical tool used in analyzing the data was the Permutation method for Hotelling T-Squared and Descriptive statistics. The result of the analysis showed that there exists a significant difference between monthly export and import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index in Nigeria with a test statistic value of 58. 31 and a p-value of 0. 00 for 10, 000 permutations. Also, it was observed that across the years import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index has been greater than export <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index. Hence, we conclude that export and import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index in Nigeria are not equal and that import <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index has always been lager than export <b>commodities</b> <b>price</b> index. We advocate for more studies within the context of price statistics in Nigeria since the significance of price statistics in the economy of any nation cannot be overemphasized because they constitute a very useful tool for policy making, economic planning, analysis and monitoring. Also, price signals have been found to enhance better understanding of the degree of economic stability in any nation...|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As <b>commodity</b> <b>prices</b> fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies.

5|$|Following World War I, Belgium possessed two {{colonies in}} Africa—the Belgian Congo, {{which it had}} {{controlled}} since its annexation of the Congo Free State in 1908, and Ruanda-Urundi, a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations. The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, {{making it one of}} the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time. The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The Great Depression led to a collapse of <b>commodity</b> <b>prices,</b> undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment.

40|$|Using local projections, {{this paper}} investigates effects of <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> shocks on inflation. We {{estimate}} impulse {{responses of the}} consumer price indexes (CPIs) to a <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> shock, based on a monthly panel consisting of 120 countries. Our results from the local projections suggest that the CPIs are almost fully adjusted within a year {{in response to a}} <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> shock and thus effects of <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> shocks are transitory. We then explore the possibility that the responses of the CPIs may be dependent on the inflation regimes. Based on the smooth transition autoregressive models that use the past inflation rate as a transition variable, we find that <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> shocks have more persistent effects on inflation in the low inflation regime than in the high inflation regime. Our analysis also shows that, in the high inflation regime, there are (i) stabilizing roles of the exchange rate on consumer prices; and (ii) large differences in price responses between developed and developing countries. However, these effects are not detected in the low inflation regime. Our findings suggest that business cycle factors may {{play an important role in}} understanding effects of <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> shocks on the CPIs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a theoretical derivation of <b>commodity</b> beta (stock <b>price</b> sensitivity to <b>commodity</b> <b>price)</b> using a contingent-claim model. The model incorporates operating leverage, financial leverage, costly financial distress, and mean reverting commodity prices; and highlights {{the important role}} played by the speed of reversion of the <b>commodity</b> <b>price.</b> It is used to identify theoretically the main determinants of commodity beta. Commodity beta is predicted to be an increasing function of the operating and financial leverage of the firm, and a decreasing function of the company's tax rate and the level, volatility and speed of reversion of the <b>commodity</b> <b>price.</b> Empirical tests with a sample of gold mining firms provide support for these predictions, particularly the new implications of the model (the effect of the <b>commodity</b> <b>price's</b> speed of reversion and the company's tax rate). ...|$|R

5|$|Farm incomes {{have fallen}} {{over the years}} as a result of cheap food {{policies}} in the United Kingdom, the lowering of world <b>commodity</b> <b>prices</b> and the removal of production-based subsidies. Particularly hard hit have been the incomes of hill farms in Wales which averaged £15,000 in 2014, as against £23,000 for lowland livestock farms and £59,000 for dairy farms. The labour force has been dwindling for many years as a result of increased mechanisation and changes in farming practices. Fewer farmers are needed today because they are able to produce more food from their land. Hay is no longer the main source of winter feed for livestock and has largely been replaced by silage, particularly baled silage wrapped in film that can be handled mechanically. This has reduced the manpower needed on farms, and there has been an increase of use by farmers of specialised contractors who provide services in silage making, harvesting and fencing. Another problem facing Welsh farmers is their distance from the main distribution centres used by supermarkets which are mostly located near centres of population in England.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, <b>commodity</b> <b>prices</b> for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of {{manufacturing}} a nickel from 3.46 cents in fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 cents in fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily made of steel) still costs less than its face value to produce as of 2013. In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act (CMOCA), directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation declared that there is no material that would reduce the one-cent coin's manufacturing cost to below one cent, so it was removed from consideration. The report requested additional time to study the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expected demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Around Playford, much {{activity}} was occurring. Legislation {{provided for the}} tools {{that he was to}} inherit later as Premier: aggressive economic initiatives, a malapportioned electoral system and a staid internal party organisation. The state had been persistently in deficit in recent times, and as an agriculture-dominant state, had been at the mercy of <b>commodity</b> <b>prices,</b> so a strategy of industrialisation was initiated under the guidance of senior politicians, public servants and industrialists. The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party's country faction. There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857, but it was now to dramatically increase. In 1936, legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of country areas. In addition, the 46 multimember districts were replaced with 39 single-member districts—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Over the next three decades, Adelaide's population grew until it had triple the population of the country, but the distribution of seats in the legislature gave rural voters a disproportionate influence by a factor of six. The desired long-term effect was to lock the opposition Labor Party out of power; the unexpected short-term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the 1938 election. Although he played no part in its development or implementation, the electoral system gerrymander was later christened the 'Playmander', {{as a result of its}} benefit to Playford, and his failure to take action towards reforming it.|$|E

Using market-based measures of <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> exposure, there is robust evidence that commodity stocks with high <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> exposures have higher turnover and {{a larger number of}} institutional investors, in particular mutual fund investors, than commodity stocks with low exposures. We conduct cross-sectional analysis that condition on the source of the exposure, the type of investor, and the performance of the underlying commodity. Overall, investors' revealed preferences for high exposure stocks appear to reflect a desire to gain exposure to the underlying commodity through an exposed equity security. They are not consistent with an attraction to exposure because of its transparency. ...|$|R

40|$|Poor {{countries}} are more volatile than rich countries, {{and we know}} this volatility impedes their growth. We also know that <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> volatility is a key source of those shocks. This paper explores <b>commodity</b> and manufactures <b>price</b> {{over the past three}} centuries to answer three questions: Has <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> volatility increased over time? The answer is no: there is little evidence of trend since 1700. Have commodities always shown greater price volatility than manufactures? The answer is yes. Higher <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> volatility is not the modern product of asymmetric industrial organizations - oligopolistic manufacturing versus competitive commodity markets - that only appeared with the industrial revolution. It was a fact of life deep into the 18 th century. Does world market integration breed more or less <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> volatility? The answer is less. Three centuries of history shows unambiguously that economic isolation caused by war or autarkic policy has been associated with much greater <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> volatility, while world market integration associated with peace and pro-global policy has been associated with less <b>commodity</b> <b>price</b> volatility. Given specialization and comparative advantage, globalization has been good for growth in poor countries at least by diminishing price volatility. But comparative advantage has never been constant. Globalization increased poor country specialization in commodities when the world went open after the early 19 th century; but it did not do so after the 1970 s as the Third World shifted to labor-intensive manufactures. Whether price volatility or specialization dominates terms of trade and thus aggregate volatility in poor countries is thus conditional on the century. ...|$|R
