District <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is widely used but its performance is rarely reported. The system performance compared with the individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> determines its future application. Performance assessment of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> is conducted by comparing with individual <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in subtropical areas. Characteristics of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are summarized after quantitative energy performance analysis. Measures to handle the additional peak electricity load due to developing a new area and using district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are assessed. Application of ice storage systems in the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is evaluated under different tariffs and design strategies. The performance of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> integrated with PHES is analyzed. The operation costs of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> with and without combined cooling, heating and power system are compared. Comments and suggestions are summarized for the application of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in the subtropical area. Information or data used in the system design at planning and design stages are often very different from that when the system is in operation. Such difference is taken as uncertainty. Uncertainty exists widely in the design process of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> It will affect the design options but is not sufficiently investigated yet. To ensure that the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> perform well in operation eventually, uncertainty-based optimal design methods are proposed. The performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using the proposed methods is compared with that using the conventional design method. An optimal design method concerning uncertainty is developed based on mini-max regret theory. It achieves the optimal design considering uncertainty. Without the needs of probability distribution assumptions and introducing new models, this method can determine the uncertainty-based optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> very effectively. By comparing the regrets of each design option, the uncertainty-based optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can be identified, which is associated with the minimum maximum regret. The method is demonstrated {{in the design of the}} chiller plant and chilled water system of a building. By quantifying the uncertainty at planning and design stages, an uncertainty-based optimal design method is proposed and its application steps are introduced. Uncertainties in the outdoor weather, building design/construction and indoor conditions are concerned. Strategies to deal with the variables containing uncertainties are introduced. Based on the peak cooling load distribution, the capacity of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be determined with quantified risks. Based on the distribution of the annual energy consumption or cost, the configuration of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be selected with quantified confidence. The uncertainty-based optimal method is implemented in a district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and an individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> in Hong Kong respectively. By using the uncertainty-based optimal design method, stake holders can make decisions with quantified confidence. The components or sub-systems in a <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> cannot be always available due to failures or maintenance. A robust optimal design method considering both uncertainty and reliability is proposed. The robust optimal design can maintain the good performance under uncertainty or failures of components in the <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Steps to realize the robust optimal design method are presented. The availability risk cost is introduced to account for the losses caused by the unmet cooling load. By taking the total annual cost including the capital cost, operation cost and availability risk cost as the objective, the robust optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can be achieved. The proposed method is demonstrated in both the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using the robust optimal design is compared with that using the conventional design method, uncertainty-based design method and reliability-based design method. The impacts of uncertainty on the design of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are compared. The influential factors for cooling loads of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are identified. Similarities and differences are summarized. Then the impacts of both uncertainty and reliability on the design of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are also assessed and compared.

40|$|A {{district}} <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> supplies <b>cooling</b> to a {{group of}} buildings in a district. It has been widely used for its high energy and economic performance, especially in Asian and European countries. It is supposed that a district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can achieve good performance when used in the subtropical area like Hong Kong, where the cooling is required throughout the year and the building density is very high. This study aims to quantitatively assess the performance of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> in a new development area in Hong Kong. By modeling the buildings and <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> of the new district based on the current plan, the performance of district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is compared with the conventional <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> which refers to individual in-building <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> Three cases with different chilled water systems are simulated and analyzed.

40|$|Uncertainty exists {{widely in}} the design of {{district}} <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> Due to failures or improper maintenance of components or subsystems, the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> may malfunction or work with reduced performance. In the conventional design method of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems,</b> both aspects are often ignored or considered roughly. To ensure that district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> achieve the expected performance as closely as possible, a robust optimization method is proposed in this paper. This approach relies on quantifying the uncertainty at the design stage and the reliability of the <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> in operation. By taking the total annual cost (including the capital cost, operation cost and availability risk cost) as the objective, the robust optimal design of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be obtained. Uncertainties in weather, building design/construction and indoor conditions are considered and reliabilities of major equipment in the systems are dealt with as well.
