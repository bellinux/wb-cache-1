50|$|The {{small hive beetle}} can be a {{destructive}} pest of honey bee colonies, causing damage to <b>comb,</b> stored <b>honey</b> and pollen.

The beetles can also be a pest of stored <b>combs,</b> and <b>honey</b> (in the <b>comb)</b> awaiting extraction. Beetle larvae may tunnel through <b>combs</b> of <b>honey,</b> feeding and defecating, causing discoloration and fermentation of the honey.|$|R
50|$|Many insects, notably {{honey bees}} and some wasps, collect and store liquid for use {{at a later}} date. However, these insects store their food within their nest or in <b>combs.</b> <b>Honey</b> ants are unique in using their own bodies as living storage, used later by their fellow ants when food is {{otherwise}} scarce. When the liquid stored inside a honeypot ant is needed, the worker ants stroke the antennae of the honeypot ant, causing the honeypot ant to regurgitate the stored liquid from its crop.|$|R

5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the honey extractor almost all honey produced was in the form of <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b> Today, most honey is produced for extraction but <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> remains popular among consumers both for eating 'as is' and for combining with extracted honey to make chunk honey. Hobbyists and sideliners can develop their beekeeping skills by producing <b>comb</b> <b>honey,</b> which takes more rigorous attention to beekeeping than the production of extracted honey. Because of the more demanding labor involved, <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> has greater retail value than extracted honey. ($17/pound compared to $6.50/pound US). [...] <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> production is more suitable for areas with an intense prolonged honeyflow from eucalyptus, alfalfa, alsike, and yellow clover. Wooded areas are not as suitable for <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> production, as bees tend to collect more propolis, making the harvesting of <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> more difficult. This problem has been largely circumvented with the adoption of specialized frames, such as the Ross Round frame, which prevent accumulation of propolis on saleable units.|$|E
50|$|Taylor made {{significant}} contributions to beekeeping. He owned three hundred hives of bees and, from 1970, produced mostly <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b> He explained his management techniques in several books, including The <b>Comb</b> <b>Honey</b> Book and The Joys of Beekeeping.|$|E
50|$|<b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> {{production}} requires many of {{the same}} techniques that are required for the production of extracted honey. In addition, the colony must be very strong and have comb building traits. Honeycomb for direct consumption as <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> is always created the same year it is harvested.|$|E

50|$|Populous {{honey bee}} colonies are usually reduced to single hive bodies at the {{beginning}} of the honey flow when one or more <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> supers are added. <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> can either be produced in wooden sections, shallow frames, or Ross Rounds. The successful production of <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> requires that the hive remain crowded without inducing swarming. Young prolific queens help rapid colony population expansion with less likelihood of swarming. Caucasian honey bees are often preferred for their tendency to keep a constricted brood nest and for their production of white wax cappings, making more attractive honey combs.|$|E

The so-called cut comb are sections of sealed <b>honey</b> <b>comb</b> that are cut out of the frame. If the cut comb is to be consumed not crushed only the purest beeswax foundation may be used.|$|R

50|$|Unlike the Langstroth hive, {{the honey}} is usually {{extracted}} by crushing and straining rather than centrifuging because a top bar {{does not have}} wire reinforcement. There is a laterally oriented extractor available, made by Swienty, {{but these are not}} overly popular in the US. Because the bees have to rebuild their <b>comb</b> after <b>honey</b> is harvested, a top-bar hive yields a beeswax harvest in addition to honey.|$|R
50|$|The 19th century {{saw this}} {{revolution}} in beekeeping practice completed through {{the perfection of}} the movable comb hive by the American Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth. Langstroth {{was the first person}} to make practical use of Huber's earlier discovery that there was a specific spatial measurement between the wax combs, later called the bee space, which bees do not block with wax, but keep as a free passage. Having determined this bee space (between 5 and 8 mm, or 1/4 to 3/8"), Langstroth then designed a series of wooden frames within a rectangular hive box, carefully maintaining the correct space between successive frames, and found that the bees would build parallel honeycombs in the box without bonding them to each other or to the hive walls. This enables the beekeeper to slide any frame out of the hive for inspection, without harming the bees or the comb, protecting the eggs, larvae and pupae contained within the cells. It also meant that <b>combs</b> containing <b>honey</b> could be gently removed and the honey extracted without destroying the <b>comb.</b> The emptied <b>honey</b> <b>combs</b> could then be returned to the bees intact for refilling. Langstroth's book, The Hive and Honey-bee, published in 1853, described his rediscovery of the bee space and the development of his patent movable comb hive.|$|R
