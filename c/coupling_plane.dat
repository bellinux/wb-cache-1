40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel {{design for}} {{coplanar}} waveguide antenna is developed which, {{consists of two}} U-shaped slots. The antenna is named Clip. The antenna is designed at central frequency of 2. 4 GHZ with input impedance of 50 Ω. The antenna dimensions represent 72 % size reduction than conventional microstrip rectangular patch antenna. The measured antenna bandwidth is about 11 % while its gain is about 17 dB which; are fairly acceptable in all wireless communication systems. The antenna configuration has bi-directional radiation pattern, while Unidirectional radiation pattern is achieved by using λo/ 4 reflector with metal plate. A 2 x 2 multi-element sub array is implemented to widen the applications area. The mutual coupling between adjacent elements is low. For more reduction in the mutual <b>coupling</b> orthogonal <b>plane</b> <b>coupling</b> between adjacent elements is introduced.
