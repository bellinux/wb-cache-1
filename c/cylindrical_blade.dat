5000|$|A {{trephine}} ( [...] ; from Greek trypanon, meaning {{an instrument}} for boring) is a surgical instrument with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blade.</b> It can be of one of several dimensions and designs depending on what {{it is going to}} be used for. They may be specially designed for obtaining a cylindrically shaped core of bone that can be used for tests and bone studies, cutting holes in bones (i.e., the skull) or for cutting out a round piece of the cornea for eye surgery.|$|E
50|$|The main form of {{ring saw}} uses a ring or wire {{that is like}} a flat disk. The non-cutting side of the blade is behind of the cutting edge, so limits {{the depth of the}} cuts that may be made. Wire-saws are coated with an {{abrasive}} on all sides and so may cut in any direction. With the ring behind the cutting edge, cuts in the main direction will treat the blade (in mechanical terms) as an arch, which is stiffer than a sideways force on a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blade.</b> This geometry also gives a vertical cut in thick materials, although the cut must be kept straight and unlike a bandsaw, curves cannot be sawn if the material is thick. They may be used for mineralogy and slabbing.|$|E
50|$|Juncus rugulosus is a {{perennial}} herb growing in thick tufts from a horizontal rhizome. The stem is erect {{and green and}} has a distinctive wrinkled, rippled surface. It reaches a maximum height near 70 centimeters. There are few leaves, those growing at the base lacking blades and appearing as sheaths around the stem, and those further up the stem having <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R

The water jet is directed towards the cylindrical runner by nozzle. The water enters the runner at an angle of about 45/120 degrees,transmitting some of the water's kinetic energy to the active <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been made of the Langley full-scale tunnel and outdoors to investigate some of the characteristics of vortex noise generated on a rotating-blade system. Acoustic measurements were made at several microphone positions for two different blade sections with several tip shapes and spoiler configurations. The blades were operated only at zero lift at each radial station, both for operating in their own wake and for operating with the wake blown downstream. Rotors with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades</b> generally created more noise throughout the noise spectrum than the rotor with NACA 0012 blades. Blowing the shed wake from the rotor with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades</b> did not have an appreciable effect on the frequency-amplitude spectrum. The tip shape changes had very little effect on the frequency-amplitude spectrum of the noise. Spoilers applied to the rotor with NACA 0012 blades increased the amplitude of the spectrum and decreased the number of harmonics of blade passage frequency...|$|R

The core part of blade screw is stainless steel material with wide tooth, thin wall and other characteristics, and its processing method {{is different from the}} cylindrical surface spiral groove processing. Usually, its machining process is based on a certain forming technology to produce spiral leaf firstly, then welding leaves on the shaft. The <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blade</b> screw in test equipment adopts triangle method to calculate the blank dimensions.

40|$|SUMMARY Radial flow {{develops}} {{in the bottom}} of separated boundary layer over rotating blades. Therefore, the effective blade lift and drag for the local blade stations {{are not the same as}} for non-rotating airfoils. Nevertheless, wind turbines design is still based on blade-element momentum (BEM) theory, deriving the local lift and drag by 2 D measurements. Results obtained are accurate at and about design conditions, but in stalled ones the aerodynamic forces are under-predicted. In this work, full- 3 D CFD-RANS simulations are carried out throughout different flow conditions for both a simple <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blade</b> and a more realistic geometry, by varying angle of attack and Reynolds number in a rotating framework. In order to analyse the output data, an ad-hoc post-processing tool has been developed, allowing one to evaluate within the computational domain of all of the terms in a modified form of Prandtl’s boundary layer equations. The early results for a simple blade geometry are presented, confirming that 3 D loads on a rotating blade are higher than those for a non-rotating one, mostly for inboard sections and separated flow conditions. Then, the well-known NASA/NREL Phase VI wind turbine was considered. The main findings of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blade</b> study were confirmed, even if new complexities were introduced by the more realistic rotor model. A more detailed analysis is needed, to explain some discordance found especially for the NREL case. Different flow situations (Reynolds number, angle of attack and rotational speed) will be studied for the simpler geometry whereas pitched operation will be explored with the NREL rotor. The planned development includes the implementation of a correction law of the pure 2 D airfoil characteristics, to be used in a BEM based design code...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for use in}} the design of a wake adapted pumpjet mounted on the aft end of a body of revolution is presented. To this end, a pumpjet is designed for the Akron airship. The propulsor mass flow is selected to minimize kinetic energy losses through the duct and in the discharge jet. The shaft speed and disk size are selected to satisfy specified limits of cavitation performance and to provide acceptable blade loading. The streamtubes which pass through a propulsor mounted on a tapered afterbody follow essentially conical surfaces. A method is provided for defining these surfaces as a function of shroud geometry, rotor head distribution, and the energy distribution of the ingested mass flow. The three-dimensional effects to which the conical flow subjects the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blade</b> design sections are described and a technique is presented which permits incorporation of these effects in the blade design procedure...|$|E

Poncelet was familiar with this work and started looking for ways to improve the design.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been conducted to investigate the broadband noise generated by a rotating-blade system. Tests were made with circular and NACA 0012 rotor-blade sections. The blades were operated only with zero lift at each radial station. Tests were made both with zero axial velocity, so that the blades operated in their own turbulent wake, and with a small axial velocity imposed by the wind tunnel to blow the wake of one blade away before {{the passage of the}} next blade. The rotor with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades</b> generally radiated more noise throughout the noise spectrum than did the rotor with airfoil blades. Blowing the blade wake away from the rotor with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades</b> did not have any appreciable effect on the amplitude frequency spectrum, and the predominant noise was broadband, either with tunnel wind on or off. For the rotor with airfoil blades, however, blowing the blade wake away changed the character of the noise spectrum completely in that broadband noise was eliminated or diminished to such an extent as to be indistinguishable. The broadband noise of the airfoil-bladed rotor with zero axial velocity is apparently caused by lift fluctuations due to velocity components of the turbulence normal to the plane of rotation...|$|R
40|$|This paper restricts {{itself to}} radial {{impellers}} with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades</b> since, as Prasil has shown, the flow about an arbitrarily curved {{surface of revolution}} may be reduced to this normal form we have chosen by a relatively simple conformal transformation. This method starts from the simple hypotheses of the older centrifugal impeller theory by first assuming an impeller with {{an infinite number of}} blades. How the flow is then modified is then investigated. For the computation of flow for a finite number of blades, the approximation method as developed by Munk, Prandtl and Birnbaum, or Glauert is found suitable. The essential idea of this method is to replace the wing by a vortex sheet and compute the flow as the field of these vortices. The shape of the blades is then obtained from the condition that the flow must be along the surface of the blade...|$|R
40|$|The High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is a 100 MWth light-water {{research}} reactor {{designed and built}} in the 1960 s primarily {{for the production of}} transuranic isotopes. The HFIR is equipped with two concentric <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blade</b> assemblies, known as control cylinders, that are used to control reactor power. These control cylinders, which become highly radioactive from neutron exposure, are periodically replaced as part of the normal operation of the reactor. The highly radioactive region of the control cylinders is composed of europium oxide in an aluminum matrix. The spent HFIR control cylinders have historically been emplaced in the ORNL Waste Area Grouping (WAG) 6. The control cylinders pose a potential radiological hazard due to the long lived radiotoxic europium isotopes {sup 152 }Eu, {sup 154 }Eu, and {sup 155 }Eu. In a 1991 health evaluation of WAG 6 (ERD 1991) it was shown that these cylinders were a major component of the total radioactivity in WAG 6 and posed a potential exposure hazard to the public in some of the postulated assessment scenarios. These health evaluations, though preliminary and conservative in nature, illustrate the incentive to investigate methods for permanent destruction of the europium radionuclides. When the cost of removing the control cylinders from WAG 6, performing chemical separations and irradiating the material in HFIR are factored in, the option of leaving the control cylinders in place for decay must be considered. Other options, such as construction of an engineered barrier around the disposal silos to reduce the chance of migration, should also be analyzed...|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} razor (electric shaver) {{consists of}} a set of oscillating or rotating blades, which are held behind a perforated metal screen which prevents them from coming into contact with the skin and behaves much like the second blade in a pair of scissors. When the razor is held against the skin, the whiskers poke through the holes in the screen and are sliced by the moving blades. In some designs the blades are a rotating cylinder. In others they are one or more rotating disks or a set of oscillating blades. Each design has an optimum motion over the skin for the best shave and manufacturers provide guidance on this. Generally, circular or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades</b> (rotary-type shaver) move in a circular motion and oscillating blades (foil-type shaver) move left and right. Hitachi has produced foil-type shavers with a rotary blade that operates similarly to the blade assembly of a reel-type lawn mower. The first electric razor was built by Jacob Schick in 1928.|$|R

40|$|A typical {{centrifugal}} impeller characterised by a low flow coefficient and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades</b> is optimised {{by means of}} an intelligent automatic search program. The procedure consists of a Feasible Sequential Quadratic Programming (FSQP) algorithm [6] coupled to a Lazy Learning (LL) interpolator [1] to speed-up the process. The program is able to handle geometrical constraints to reduce the computational effort devoted to the analysis of non-physical configurations. The objective function evaluator is an in-house developed structured CFD code. The LL approximator is called each time the stored database can provide a sufficiently accurate performance estimate for a given geometry, thus reducing the effective CFD computations. The impeller is represented by 25 geometrical parameters describing the vane in the meridional and s-q planes, the blade thickness and the leading edge shape. The optimisation is carried out on the impeller design point maximising the polytropic efficiency with more or less constant flow coefficient and polytropic head. As a preliminary test the optimisation algorithm takes into account only eight geometrical parameters describing the impeller in the meridional plane. The optimisation, carried out on a cluster of eight PCs, is self-learning and leads to a geometry presenting an increased design point efficiency. The program is completely general and can be applied to any component which can be described by a finite number of geometrical parameters and computed by any numerical instrument to provide performance indices. The work presented in this paper has been developed inside the METHOD EC funded project for the implementation of new technologies for optimisation of centrifugal compressors...|$|R

50|$|Continuous-flow VADs {{are smaller}} and {{have proven to}} be more durable than pulsatile VADs. They {{normally}} use either a centrifugal pump or an axial flow pump. Both types have a central rotor containing permanent magnets. Controlled electric currents running through coils contained in the pump housing apply forces to the magnets, which in turn cause the rotors to spin. In the centrifugal pumps, the rotors are shaped to accelerate the blood circumferentially and thereby cause it to move toward the outer rim of the pump, whereas in the axial flow pumps the rotors are more or less <b>cylindrical</b> with <b>blades</b> that are helical, causing the blood to be accelerated {{in the direction of the}} rotor's axis.|$|R

The {{equations of motion}} for laminated piezoelectric shell structures with embedded passive electric networks are directly formulated and solved using a finite element methodology. The modal damping and frequencies of the piezoelectric shell are calculated from the poles of the system. Experimental and numerical results are presented for the modal damping and frequency of composite beams with a resistively shunted piezoceramic patch. The modal damping and frequency of plates, cylindrical shells and <b>cylindrical</b> composite <b>blades</b> with piezoelectric-resistor layers are predicted. Both analytical and experimental studies illustrate a unique dependence of modal damping and frequencies on the shunting resistance and show the effect of structural shape and curvature on piezoelectric damping...|$|R
40|$|The present article {{proposes a}} novel {{methodology}} to evaluate secondary flows {{generated by the}} annulus boundary layers in complex cascades. Unlike two-dimensional (2 D) linear cascades, where the reference flow is commonly defined as that measured at midspan, {{the problem of the}} reference flowdefinition for annular or complex 3 D linear cascades does not have a general solution up to the present time. The proposed approach supports secondary flow analysis whenever exit streamwise vorticity produced by inlet endwall boundary layers is of interest. The idea is to compute the reference flow by applying slip boundary conditions at the endwalls in a viscous 3 D numerical simulation, in which uniform total pressure is prescribed at the inlet. Thus the reference flow keeps the 3 D nature of the actual flow except for the contribution of the endwall boundary layer vorticity. The resulting secondary field is then derived by projecting the 3 D flow field (obtained from both an experiment and a fully viscous simulation) along the local reference flowdirection; this approach can be proficiently applied to any complex geometry. This method allows the representation of secondary velocity vectors with a better estimation of the vortex extension, since it offers the opportunity to visualize also the region of the vortices, which can be approximated as a potential type. Furthermore, a proficient evaluation of the secondary vorticity and deviation angle effectively induced by the annulus boundary layer is possible. The approach was preliminarily verified against experimental data in linear cascades characterized by <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades,</b> not reported for the sake of brevity, showing a very good agreement with the standard methodology based only on the experimental midspan flow field. This article presents secondary flows obtained by the application of the proposed methodology on two annular cascades with cylindrical and 3 D-designed blades, stressing the differences with other definitions. Both numerical and experimental results are considered...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{internal}} passage and downstream flow field effects produced by the application of 3 D design techniques on linear turbine cascades. In particular, the two design techniques generally called “lean” and “lean compound” (or “bowing”), have been applied to the same profile.

An extensive experimental campaign was originally performed on <b>cylindrical</b> straight <b>blades</b> in the transonic wind tunnel of LFM (Laboratorio di Fluidodinamica della Macchine) of the Politecnico di Milano. The large data base available has been then used as set of test cases in order to validate the set up of a CFD tool. Subsequently a leaned cascade has been investigated by means of both methods. Finally the effects of blade bowing have been analysed only with a computational approach. The contemporary application of the two tools allows to get deeply inside of the effects produced by the three different blade design techniques...|$|R
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} or CFD isan importanttool thatis used {{at various stages}} {{in the design of}} highly complex turbomachinery such as compressorand turbine stages that are used in land and air based power generation units. The ability of CFD to predict the performance characteristics of a specific blade design is challenged by the need to use various turbulence models to simulate turbulent flows as well as transition models to simulate laminar to turbulent transition that can be observed in various turbomachinery designs. Moreover, CFD is based on numerically solving highly complex differential equations, which {{through the use of a}} grid to discretize the geometry introduces numerical errors. Allthese factors combine to challenge CFD?s role as a predictor of blade performance. It has been generallyfound that CFD in its current state of the art is best used to compare between various design points and not as a pure predictor of performances. In this study the capability of CFD, and turbulence modeling, in turbomachinery based geometry is assessed. Three different blade designs are tested, that include an advanced two-stage turbine blade design, a three stage 2 D or cylindrical design and finally a three stage bowed stator and rotor design. Allcases were experimentally tested at the Texas A&Muniversity Turbomachinery Performance and Flow Research Laboratory (TPFL). In all cases CFD provided good insights into fundamental turbomachinery flow physics, showing the expected improvement from using 2 D <b>cylindrical</b> <b>blades</b> to 3 D bowed blade designs in abating the secondary flow effects which are dominant loss generators. However, comparing experimentally measured performance results to numerically predicted shows a clear deficiency, where the CFD overpredicts performance when compared to experimentallyobtained data, largely underestimating the various loss mechanisms. In a relative sense, CFD as a tool allows the user to calculate the impact a new feature or change can have on a baseline design. CFD will also provide insight into what are the dominant physics that explain why a change can provide an increase or decrease in performance. Additionally,as part of this study, one of the main factors that affect the performance of modern turbomachinery is transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Transition is an influential phenomena especially in high pressure turbines, and is sensitive to factors such asupstream incidentwake frequency and turbulence intensity. A model experimentally developed, is implemented into a CFD solver and compared to various test results showing greater capability in modeling the effects of reduced frequency on the transition point and transitional flow physics. This model is compared to industry standard models showing favorable prediction performance due to its abilityto account for upstream wake effects which most current model are unable to account for...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the geotechnical problems and failure mechanisms of stone structures of Sakakini palace (1897 a fter c entury) entails a comprehensive study on the mechanical behaviour of the stones and other construction materials. In addition to micro analysis, geological and geomorphologic interests, several investigations on stone deterioration and engineering geology were performed, First phase included more sophisticated techniques, which provided additional information on particular aspects of site deterioration and it included laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBs), electron probe micro analysis, micro XRD and XRF analyses, scanning electron microscope analysis coupled with EDX probing, transmission electron microscopy and grain size distribution analysis, permeability and pore size distribution of stone, mortars, core binders and other construction materials. Second phase included the determination of mechanical properties of building stones, such as compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, and shear strength. To arrive at reliable values for these properties, a suitable number of samples should be extracted, prepared for testing, and properly tested. The test results are then analyzed to establish the investigated stone properties. The testing program includes extracting seven cylindrical cores from the basement stone walls of Sakakini’s mansion in down townCairo. The cores are extracted using rotary <b>cylindrical</b> diamond <b>blade</b> coring machine. The {{top and bottom surfaces}} of every core were prepared to be flat circular surfaces perpendicular to the vertical axis of the core. Because the palace is museum and attractive places for the tourists, core sampling could be carried out only at a limited number of locations under official permission. For the purpose, cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 42 - 44 mm and height of 90 - 100 mm, prepared by the use of a core drilling machine and some collected blocks from the archaeological site under investtigation were taken to determine the bulk structure, physical, short and long-term mechanical properties of the stone and other construction materials in the laboratory. A number of specimens prepared from these blocks were employed for testing. Furthermore, limitation due to the number of blocks was overcome by the determination of the in situ characteristics of the stones by Schmidt hammer tests, geo-tomographic investigations and rock mass classification on some stone rock structures where testing has been permitted. The objectives of the study are to provide a characterization of micro structures and the mechanical properties of the stones of Sakakini’s Mansion; describe the required testing plan; describe the test results and conclude the values of the basic mechanical properties of the building stones. The following sections provide detailed descriptions of the steps taken to achieve the objectives of the study. The purpose of the present research is to provide recommendations regarding the strengthening and the safety of architectural heritage under long and short-term loading. For this purpose, a set of experimental tests and of advanced numerical analyses are to be carried out. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Bupivacaine (Marcaine®), {{homologue}} of mepivacaine, chemically {{related to}} lidocaine, {{is used as}} a local anesthetic for local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, retrobulbar block, symphathetic block, and caudal and epidural anesthesia. The aim of this investigation was to determine and to compare clinical parameters of the local anesthetic effects of bupivacaine applied with and without a vasoconstrictor. Methods. This investigation included a total of 30 randomly selected patients, who ranged in age from 30 − 60 years, with partial or total anodontia in the molar region of the mandible. These patients with total or partial edentulous molar part of the mandible, scheduled for dental implantation placement, were asked to participate in the study. In {{the first phase of the}} investigation, the patients were subjected to local anesthesia with 3. 5 cm 3 of 0. 5 % bupivacaine with a vasoconstrictor (adrenalin, 1 : 200 000) in the right side of the mandible. After administering local anesthesia, the placement of <b>blade,</b> <b>cylindrical,</b> transdental (B. C. T.) implants was performed. In the second stage of the investigation, in 7 − 10 days period after the first oral surgery, the patients were subjected to local anesthesia with 3. 5 cm 3 of 0. 5 % bupivacaine, but without a vasoconstrictor, in the left side of the mandible. After administering local anesthesia, the placement of B. C. T. implants was performed. During the performance of both oral surgery procedures, the following clinical parameters of the local anesthetic effects were monitored: latent period, duration and the potency of anesthesia, and the evaluation of the postoperative pain level. Results. The latent period under local anesthesia with 3. 5 cm 3 of 0. 5 % bupivacaine and vasoconstrictor was statistically significantly shorter than without vasoconstrictor. The duration of local anesthesia was longer without vasoconstrictor. There was no difference in the potency of anesthesia with or without a vasoconstrictor, while the lowest level of postoperative pain was found after administering bupivacaine without a vasoconstrictor use. Conclusion. The results of this investigation show that bupivacaine without a vasoconstrictor is efficient when used for local anesthesia in placing dental implants since it provides better blood circulation required for good dental implant osseointegration. ...|$|R
