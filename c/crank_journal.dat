5000|$|Toyota {{never made}} a wide-valve angle [...] "7A-GE" [...] based on the 7A, but many enthusiasts have created one using a {{combination}} of 7A-FE parts (block and crank), 4A-GE parts (head, pistons) and custom connecting rods. The '7A-FE' has a smaller <b>crank</b> <b>journal,</b> and smaller wrist pins (press fit) so a few companies have made special rods to accommodate these builds. Likewise, an unofficial supercharged [...] "7A-GZE" [...] has also been built from 7A-FE parts (block, crank), 4A-GZE parts (head, pistons) and custom connecting rods.|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} of the cylinders is also unusual. The V4 has the rear bank of cylinders paired closely together, with the big ends of their connecting rods on the inner sides of the <b>crank</b> <b>journals.</b> The forward bank of cylinders is conversely set outboard of the rear bank, with the big end journals mounted on the outer sides of the <b>crank</b> <b>journals.</b> This design allows for a much narrower engine at the rear, which makes the bike slimmer where it contacts the rider, and allows an easier reach to the ground from the seat.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, the crankpins, {{also known}} as <b>crank</b> <b>journals</b> are the [...] of the big end bearings, {{at the ends of}} the connecting rods opposite to the pistons.|$|R
50|$|The now-oversquare {{modified}} engine used the 650 Bonneville twin-carb cylinder head having bigger valves, ports and carburettors than a standard Triumph 500, allowing for efficient air-fuel intake at racing speeds. The 650-size <b>crank</b> <b>journals</b> and main bearings were {{larger than a}} 500 which allowed for greater reliability.|$|R
5000|$|The FE and FT {{engines are}} Y-block designs - [...] {{so-called}} because the cylinder block casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, giving great rigidity {{and support to}} the crankshaft's bearings. In these engines, the casting extends 3.625 in below the crankshaft centerline, {{which is more than}} an inch below the bottom of the <b>crank</b> <b>journals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{introduced}} the new [...] "split-pin crankshaft" [...] in the 231. Using a crankpin that is 'split' and offset by 30° of rotation resulted in smooth, even firing every 120°. However, in 1978 Chevrolet introduced a 90° 200/229 V6, {{which had a}} compromise 'semi-even firing' design using a crankpin that was offset by only 18°. This resulted in cylinders firing at 108° and 132°, which {{had the advantage of}} reducing vibrations to a more acceptable level and did not require strengthening the crankshaft. In 1985, Chevrolet's 4.3 (later the Vortec 4300) changed it to a true even-firing V6 with a 30° offset, requiring larger <b>crank</b> <b>journals</b> to make them adequately strong.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the urgent}} {{problems}} {{in mechanical engineering}} is development of efficient inexpensive thick-layered coatings for repair worn-out large-sized parts. To solve these problems a comparatively new method of electro-plating with simultaneous mechanical impact of a tool upon coating under formation is promising enough. In this paper there are considered the peculiarities of plating through this method of thick-layer electro-mechanical iron plating on medium carbon steel 30 and 38 ChN 3 MA, and the composition, structure and properties of coatings obtained are analyzed. Coatings were applied upon <b>crank</b> main <b>journals</b> made of steel 38 ChN 3 MA and upon models imitating <b>crank</b> main <b>journals</b> made of steel 30. Micro-hardness of the coating obtained, roughness, a chemical composition and a structure were analyzed. The results of the investigations have shown that a more significant role in hardness increase is played not by a chemical composition of medium carbon steel upon which it is applied, but a preparation of the surface and the technology of coating and also an electrolyte composition. The structure of electro-mechanical plating is less defective, contains a value of detrimental impurities considerably lower of allowable values and has a satisfactory adhesion strength with a substrate...|$|R
50|$|The Lambert opposed {{cylinder}} motor had {{a number}} of features not usual in that form of gas engine in that era. For example, the oiler was of the precision variety, in which a ratchet actuated worm drive a worm gear carrying a spring actuated oil force pump successively over the oil leads to be supplied, the plunge spring being compressed by a circle of wedges, and the rise from each compression being regulated by an individual temper screw. Oil leads dropped oil on the crank wrist rod ends. The cranks had full disk arms and the <b>crank</b> shaft <b>journals</b> ran in bronze bearings.|$|R
5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and <b>crank</b> <b>journals.</b> Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{redesigned}} the crankshaft to a [...] "split-pin" [...] configuration {{to create}} an [...] "even-firing" [...] version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a 3.0 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from [...] "walking" [...] off the <b>crank</b> pin bearing <b>journal</b> and interfering with the adjacent big end. The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the <b>crank</b> pin bearing <b>journals,</b> the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the piston pin ends by 1.5 mm. The engine in this configuration became known to have [...] "off-centre bore spacing".|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, {{the engine}} {{continued}} in production from 1982 up to April 2000 {{for use in}} the Sapphire Saloon and Sierra vehicles, and Courier pick-ups. Late in its production life it was fitted with Lucas controlled electronic fuel injection designed by SAMCOR (South African Motor Corporation - now Ford SA) in co-operation with the University of Pretoria's engineering department. This conversion resulted in a power increase from [...] to [...] of the standard 3.0 version, and [...] for the fuel injection version, plus a useful boost to fuel economy. Only about 1,600 of the EFI variants were produced during 1992 and 1993. In October 1997, the 3.0L was enlarged to 3.4L by boring the cylinders [...]040 of an inch or 1mm to 94.6mm and a new crankshaft with a stroke of 80.0mm giving a displacement of 3375cc, this was done for the engine to be better suited to 4x4 vehicles where torque is needed. The 3.4 version produced [...] and 260 Nm. All 3.4 variants used the 38DGAS Weber carburetor with 29 mm venturis. Production tooling at the factory was scrapped and sold in 2000, {{to make way for the}} production of a new four cylinder OHC engine, the remaining old stock of 3.4 L Engines started to be sold as assembled crate engines, these engines had some differences from the 2.5 3.0 and 3.1 L Dagenham built engines such as: Ford Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 forged connecting rods, German made pistons with moly coating, [...]250" [...] smaller <b>crank</b> <b>journals</b> which reduced bearing speed, more aggressive camshaft timing and higher lift,larger 43mm inlet valves, shaft mounted rockers from Ford's Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 engine, unique cylinder head castings with extra oil galleries, solid pushrods with no oiling holes, unique exhaust manifold bolt pattern due to the head castings also being unique to the 3.4 litre engine and an improved inlet manifold with larger runners and an improved plenum chamber. From 1966 to 1998, the 3.0L was also used in industrial applications such as generator plants, airport vehicles, milk vans, jet boats (Hamilton jet) and even river barges.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an oil pan is attached with a gasketed bolted joint. Some crankcase designs fully surround the <b>crank's</b> main bearing <b>journals,</b> whereas many others form only one half, with a bearing cap forming the other. Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the oil pan itself (in which case the oil pan is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the oil pan is a casting in its own right). Both the crankcase and any rigid cast oil pan often have reinforcing ribs cast into them, as well as bosses which are drilled and tapped to receive mounting screws/bolts for various other engine parts.|$|R
40|$|The aim is {{to develop}} and improve a {{finishing}} process that allows reduced CO 2 emissions, through reduced use of carbon-based fuels, achieving improvement in fuel consumption. The improved microfinishing process will provide a reduction in surface friction on bearing surfaces and improve wear resistance of the components. The aim of this experimentation {{is to reduce the}} friction on the <b>crank</b> shaft <b>journals</b> using specified parameters and specially designed abrasive tape. The micro finishing development will focus on a novel polishing process using abrasive tape to achieve nanometre level surface finish. It was noticed that such a process can dramatically improve component tribological performance, which have great impacts on energy consumption and CO 2 emission. It is an urgent requirement to investigate the material removal mechanism of micro finishing process so that the quality of finishing surface can be improved consistently and effectively. Significant challenges include (a) detailed knowledge of nano-material removal, (b) understanding the tribological behaviours in relation to surface topography and surface compound created under micro finishing process, (c) the strategy of selection of micro finishing conditions for optimum surface, (d) the selection of suitable sensing techniques for process monitoring and control, (e) establishment of relationship between polished surface topography and CO 2 emissions...|$|R
50|$|Replacing the {{previous}} Buick Skylark was the Buick Skylark 350, {{available as a}} two-door hardtop coupe or four-door sedan with the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment. This 350-cubic-inch engine was a different design than the Chevy's 350 CID engine (4.000 in × 3.48 in) the Buick design had a longer stroke and smaller bore (3.80 X 3.85 in) allowing for lower-end torque, deep-skirt block construction, higher nickel-content cast iron, 3.0 in <b>crank</b> main <b>journals,</b> and 6.5 in connecting rods, the distributor was located {{in front of the}} engine (typical of Buick), the oil pump was external and mounted {{in the front of the}} engine, the rocker arm assembly had all rocker arms mounted on a single rod and were not adjustable. The Skylark Custom continued to be available, also using the 350-cubic-inch V8 as standard equipment and still available as a two-door convertible coupe, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door hardtop sedan, and four-door sedan. Buick Gran Sport models continued to be available as a separate series. The Buick Sport Wagon name was now used on a conventional four-door station wagon that no longer featured a raised roof with glass panels over the cargo area, or a longer wheelbase, as in the past. It now used the same 116 in wheelbase as the Buick Skylark four-door sedan and the now-discontinued Buick Special four-door Station Wagon. It became, in effect, a Buick Skylark four-door station wagon in all respects but the name..|$|R
