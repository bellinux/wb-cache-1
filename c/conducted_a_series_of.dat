Between 1914 and 1925, he <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> acoustic recordings of his works. The introduction of the moving-coil microphone in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from The Dream of Gerontius.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, Barrowclough {{was advised}} that his {{division}} was {{to participate in}} the Solomon Islands campaign. It would eventually participate in three major amphibious operations.

The American Medical Association <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> studies in 1948, {{followed by a}} Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had {{a negative effect on}} patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E

5|$|In 2002 and 2003, NATO <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> {{tests with}} the {{intention}} of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7×28mm cartridge and the 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm cartridge, citing superior performance in testing, but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff {{directed}} {{that the}} main objective of the Allied forces in the South Pacific and Southwest Pacific area commands was to capture the major Japanese base at Rabaul on the eastern tip of New Britain.

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to developing a}} suitable barrier, the SAM Laboratories also had {{to assist in the}} design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as K-25. Libby helped with the engineers from Kellex to produce a workable design for a pilot plant. Libby <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Krueger became {{commander}} of IX Corps on 31 January 1940.

On 27 June, Krueger became {{commander of}} the VIII Corps. On 16 May 1941, {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant general, in command of the Third Army. He also became commander of the Southern Defense Command on 16 July 1941. Krueger asked for—and got—Colonel Dwight D. Eisenhower assigned to him as his chief of staff.|$|E
5|$|Starting May 1946, the S-50 plant {{buildings}} were utilised, {{not as a}} production facility, but by the United States Army Air Forces' Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project. Fairchild Aircraft <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> experiments there involving beryllium. Workers also fabricated blocks of enriched uranium and graphite. NEPA operated until May 1951, when it was superseded by the joint Atomic Energy Commission-United States Air Force Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project.

5|$|The three {{ships were}} built between 1929 and 1936 by the Deutsche Werke and Reichsmarinewerft in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, respectively. They saw heavy service with the German Navy. All three vessels served on {{non-intervention}} patrols during the Spanish Civil War. While on patrol, Deutschland {{was attacked by}} Republican bombers, and in response, Admiral Scheer bombarded the port of Almería. In 1937, Admiral Graf Spee represented Germany at the Coronation Review for Britain's King George VI. For {{the rest of their}} peacetime careers, the ships <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic and visited numerous foreign ports in goodwill tours.|$|E
5|$|Aboard his flagship, , Pohl <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> short {{operations}} {{into the}} North Sea {{over the course}} of 1915. None of these operations ventured outside of {{the southern end of the}} North Sea, and the fleet never encountered any British forces. Pohl became seriously ill from liver cancer on 8 January 1916 and was taken to a hospital ship. He was subsequently moved to Berlin for surgery. He was relieved of command due to his poor health on 23 January; his replacement as fleet commander was Reinhard Scheer. Pohl died a month later, on 23 February. Shortly before his death, he was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle with oak leaves and swords for his command of the fleet. In 1920, Pohl's widow Ella published some of his papers in an effort to defend his reputation from postwar criticisms.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Review, Admiral Graf Spee returned to Spain for a fourth non-intervention patrol. Following fleet manoeuvres and a brief visit to Sweden, the ship conducted a fifth and final patrol in February 1938. In 1938, KzS Hans Langsdorff took command of the vessel; she <b>conducted</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> goodwill visits to various foreign ports throughout the year. These included cruises into the Atlantic, where she stopped in Tangier and Vigo. She also participated in extensive fleet manoeuvres in German waters. She was part of the celebrations for the reintegration of the port of Memel into Germany, and a fleet review in honour of Admiral Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Between 18 April and 17 May 1939, she conducted another cruise into the Atlantic, stopping in the ports of Ceuta and Lisbon. On 21 August 1939, Admiral Graf Spee departed Wilhelmshaven, bound for the South Atlantic.|$|E
