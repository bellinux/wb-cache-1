He had been out half an hour earlier, and {{had gone to the}} Admiralty Pier, only to find that neither the French packet nor any privately <b>chartered</b> <b>vessel</b> could put out of Dover yet. The storm was then at its fullest, and the tide was on the turn.

60|$|But of {{this work}} the great number of mountaineers who were {{arriving}} made little account. As fast as the ship's company, {{with the assistance of}} the priests and fighting-men, placed the cases on the quay, the engineers opened them and laid the contents ready for portage. The mountaineers seemed to come in a continuous stream; each in turn shouldered his burden and passed out, the captain of his section giving him as he passed his instruction where to go and in what route. The method had been already prepared in my office ready for such a distribution when the arms should arrive, and descriptions and quantities had been noted by the captains. The whole affair was treated by all as a matter of the utmost secrecy. Hardly a word was spoken beyond the necessary directions, and these were given in whispers. All night long the stream of men went and came, and towards dawn the bulk of the imported material was lessened by half. On the following night the remainder was removed, after my own men had stored in the Castle the rifles and ammunition reserved for its defence if necessary. It was advisable to keep a reserve supply in case it should ever be required. The following night Rooke went away secretly in the <b>chartered</b> <b>vessel.</b> He had to bring back with him the purchased cannon and heavy ammunition, which had been in the meantime stored on one of the Greek islands. The second morning, having had secret word that the steamer was on the way, I had given the signal for the assembling of the mountaineers.|$|E
