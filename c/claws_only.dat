She was much wasted; her clear-cut, aquiline features had been of the type which becomes indescribably witch-like in old age, and, though Naomi Clark was barely sixty, {{she looked as if}} she might be a hundred. Her hair streamed over the pillow in white, uncared-for tresses, and the hands that plucked at the bed-clothes were like wrinkled <b>claws.</b> <b>Only</b> her eyes were unchanged; they were as blue and brilliant as ever, but now filled with such agonized terror and appeal that Mr. Leonard's gentle heart almost stood still with the horror of them. They were the eyes of a creature driven wild with torture, hounded by furies, clutched by unutterable fear.|$|E

Clawed lobsters have full claws on the first three pereiopods. Males, unlike those of nephropoid lobsters, have an extra lobe on the second pleopod, which is assumed to have some function in reproduction. Reef lobsters have a shallow cervical groove while clawed lobsters have a deep cervical groove.|$|E

[...] "it had hung its own self on by the teeth....it jumped at the Go-Devil when it saw it was about to be run down, trying to bite it to death." [...] This description bears a striking similarity to the billy-bumbler of The Dark Tower series, which is also described with yellow or gold ringed eyes, with sharp teeth and similar to a woodchuck and a raccoon. In The Waste Lands - Jake dreams of running after Oy the Billy Bumbler who heads to the train tracks ready to leap up and fight Blaine the Mono head on, as it's barreling down the track.|$|E
5000|$|He {{appears to}} have ties with Russian authorities, {{arranging}} Omega Red's transfer to a regular Russian prison to set a trap for Wolverine. After Wolverine temporarily subdues Omega Red, he is captured by Wild Child, who reveals that Romulus made Logan and several villains battle each other, his agenda being vaguely described as him needing a successor. Moments after Wolverine uses the Muramasa blade to kill Omega Red, Romulus reveals {{himself in front of}} him, prepared for battle with four claws already extended (the three between the knuckles of his fingers and one extending from behind his thumb). Wolverine attacks Romulus but is easily overpowered since he is only using the sword at this point. Romulus slashes and attacks Wolverine from the shadows as he reveals his plans. Telling Wolverine that everything has led up to this moment. Romulus is what Wolverine will become. Pushing Wolverine to the breaking point, he drops the sword and pops his claws, much to Romulus' amusement. However, Wolverine fights back and gains the upper hand and slashes at Romulus' hand, shattering {{what turned out to be}} a clawed gauntlet. Seeing that Romulus' claws are fake, Wolverine taunts him saying, [...] "You're not what I'm gonna become... I'm what you've always wanted to be". Hearing this, Romulus blindly attacks Wolverine with his remaining <b>claws</b> <b>only</b> to be slashed open by Wolverine. Seemingly beaten, Romulus tells Wolverine that although he is at the top of the food chain, by making Daken in his own image, he has set the stage for a confrontation between Wolverine and his son. Only the most ruthless will survive. Only the one most like Romulus. Wolverine defeats Romulus, but leaves him alive saying that he will return when he is ready to finish the job. As Wolverine turns his back, Romulus seizes the opportunity to knock Wolverine unconscious with his own sword. Romulus then leaves, but not before telling Wolverine to keep the Muramasa blade: he will need it. After his confrontation with Wolverine he coordinates a successful assassination in Tokyo from what seems to be his base of operations, a European-style castle. It is here that Romulus first begins to doubt his own understanding of Wolverine's actions.|$|E

I {{did not have a}} lizard’s tail or <b>claws,</b> <b>only</b> scales. I wore a jumpsuit I had sewn all over in sequins, transforming my surface. Sometimes my appearance was likened to a fish, or mermaid. The creature appeared indeterminate, but a fantasy of being lizard occupied my thoughts. As lizard I worked my part-time job at a café. Went to classes at university. Walked around the city. Every day for three months it was my dress, both costume, and uniform. It was washed once a week and repaired as required. It was not used to sleep in, but was worn everywhere else. At night it hung on two coat-hooks {{on the back of my}} bedroom door. The wearing of it cast coloured reflections over my everyday routine. Inhabiting an idea of a creature very different from human serves as a catalyst for becoming-other, a process that entails a deterritorialisation of the self, which is the undoing of both subjectivity and signification. The desire to become-other engages Derrida’s (2006) claim that ‘the human is the animal at unease with itself. ’...|$|E

He seizes the nearest sleeper, crushes his [...] "bone case" [...] with a bite, tears him limb from limb, and swallows him. Then he creeps to the couch of Beowulf and stretches out a <b>claw,</b> <b>only</b> to find it clutched in a grip of steel. A sudden terror strikes the monster's heart. He roars, struggles, tries to jerk his arm free; but Beowulf leaps {{to his feet and}} grapples his enemy bare handed. To and fro they surge. Tables are overturned; golden benches ripped from their fastenings; the whole building quakes, and only its iron bands keep it from falling to pieces. Beowulf's companions are on their feet now, hacking vainly at the monster with swords and battle-axes, adding their shouts to the crashing of furniture and the howling [...] "war song" [...] of Grendel. Outside in the town the Danes stand shivering at the uproar. Slowly the monster struggles to the door, dragging Beowulf, whose fingers crack with the strain, but who never relaxes his first grip. Suddenly a wide wound opens in the monster's side; the sinews snap; the whole arm is wrenched off at the shoulder; and Grendel escapes shrieking across the moor, and plunges into the sea to die.|$|R

Their eyes were large and their jaws were toothless. Their vertebral columns consisted of ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, six hip vertebrae, and about thirty-five tail vertebrae. Their tails were relatively stiff and probably used for balance. They had long slender arms and hands, with immobile forearm bones and limited opposability between the first finger and the other two. As in other ornithomimids but unusually among theropods, the three fingers were roughly the same length, and the <b>claws</b> were <b>only</b> slightly curved; Henry Fairfield Osborn, describing a skeleton of S. altus in 1917, compared the arm to that of a sloth.
