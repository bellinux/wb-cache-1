5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. <b>Charging</b> <b>ports</b> are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated <b>charging</b> <b>ports</b> can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, the <b>charging</b> <b>ports</b> should be labeled as such.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes and}} {{increasing}} limits including allowing 1.5A on <b>charging</b> <b>ports</b> for unconfigured devices, allowing High Speed communication while having a current up to 1.5A and allowing a maximum current of 5A.|$|E
5|$|Some devices, when {{plugged into}} <b>charging</b> <b>ports,</b> draw even more power (10watts at 2.1amperes) than the Battery Charging Specification allows — The iPad {{is one such}} device. Barnes & Noble NOOK Color devices also require a special charger that runs at 1.9amperes.|$|E
25|$|In all markets the <b>charge</b> <b>port</b> {{is located}} behind {{a door in}} the left taillight. During <b>charging,</b> the <b>charge</b> <b>port</b> pulses green. The {{frequency}} at which the <b>charge</b> <b>port's</b> light pulses slows down as the charge level approaches full. When charging is complete, the light stops pulsing and is solid green.|$|R
5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the <b>charging</b> <b>port,</b> which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory <b>port</b> from the <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> transparently.|$|R

5|$|Per {{the base}} specification, any device {{attached}} to an SDP must initially be a low-power device, with high-power mode contingent on later USB configuration by the host. <b>Charging</b> <b>ports,</b> however, can immediately supply between 0.5 and 1.5A of current. The charging port may apply current limiting or shut down completely, but must not apply limiting below 0.5A, and must not shut down below 1.5A or before the voltage drops to 2V.|$|E

500|$|From the outset, Caesars Palace {{has been}} {{oriented}} towards attracting the high rollers, {{and like many}} of the other top Las Vegas casinos attracts the elite of the elite who stop in on weekends with {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} at their disposal. The modern casino facilities include table games such as Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, Baccarat, Spanish 21, Mini-Baccarat, Pai Gow and Pai Gow poker. Caesars Palace's [...] 24-hour poker room currently lies in heart of the gaming floor between The Colosseum and the Race & Sports Book, where racing and sports bets are put on. It moved there in June 2014, when Pure Nightclub underwent an expansion and annexed its space. As of December 2015 it contains 16 tables with free Wi-Fi and USB <b>charging</b> <b>ports.</b> There are a large number of traditional reel-type slot machines, video reels machine, video poker games, video blackjack or keno, in which participants can play from 1¢ to $500.|$|E
2500|$|BS 8546 {{applies to}} travel {{adaptors}} having {{at least one}} plug or socket-outlet portion compatible with BS 1363 plugs and socket-outlets. It {{was first published in}} April 2016 to provide a standard for travel adaptors suitable for the connection of a non-BS 1363 plug, or to a non-BS 1363 socket-outlet. [...] It provides for an overall rating of 250V ac, minimum current rating of 5A, and a maximum of 13A. Adaptors with BS 1363 plug pins must incorporate a BS 1362 fuse. [...] BS 8546 travel adaptors may also include USB <b>charging</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Several fleet {{improvements}} {{have been}} introduced over the system's history. The first large order of air conditioned buses began service in 1966. [...] "Kneeling buses" [...] were introduced in 1976, and wheelchair lifts began appearing in 1980. Also in the 1980s, stop-request cords ("bell cords") were replaced by yellow tape strips. However, buses ordered after 2008 feature cords rather than tape strips due to the latter's higher maintenance cost. Articulated buses were introduced in 1996, and have since become prominent in the Bronx and Manhattan. Low-floor buses, designed to speed boarding and alighting and improve riding conditions for elderly and disabled passengers, were first tested in 1997 and have made {{up most of the}} new non-express buses ordered since the early 2000s. Most post-2000 orders also feature stop-request buttons located on grab bars. Beginning in 2016, new orders along with buses built after 2011 will be built/retrofitted with Wi-Fi connectivity and USB <b>charging</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|E
