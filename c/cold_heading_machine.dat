The physical model was a Drop Weight Test with a guided pocket-die set capable of approximating industrial <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> conditions. The {{results show that}} the test is sensitive to the critical parameters for <b>cold</b> <b>heading.</b> These include surface quality, residual element level, nitrogen content, microstructure, decarburization, and specimen geometry. The test is capable of assessing the fracture behavior of <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> materials. One goal {{of the study was to}} reveal differences in fracture behavior with varying steel sources. Accordingly, the matrix of test materials consisted of grade 1038 steels from three different steel sources. Material preparation and conditioning of test materials approximated industrial procedures for <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> materials. These procedures included hot rolling, controlled rod cooling, descaling, straightening, lime coating and lubricating, and wire drawing. Spheroidization of test specimens was performed in an industrial batch furnace using an industrial heat treatment cycle. A finite element program (FEM) enabled the simulation of upsetting in <b>cold</b> <b>heading.</b> The inputs required to model the <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> process include flow stress behavior and friction conditions representative of <b>cold</b> <b>heading.</b> These inputs were obtained using the CANMET Cam Plastometer and the Friction Ring Test. The Cockcroft and Latham fracture constants for an as-rolled and a spheroidize annealed 1038 material were computed by FEM modeling and the critical values were calibrated using the Drop Weight Test.

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. A {{large number}} of NGAS high {{efficiency}} coolers (HEC) have been manufactured for six different space payload designs using a linear configuration <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> that is integrally mounted to the compressor. One of the payloads has been in orbital operation since 2005 and a second since 2009.

For that purpose we have developed both one and two stage HEC coolers that incorporate coaxial <b>cold</b> <b>heads</b> that are integrally mounted to the compressor. The single thermal and mechanical mounting interface of this integral configuration eases integration with a payload and reduces its complexity compared to a split <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> version that requires two warm interfaces rather than one.

In the previous research, a novel cryogenic CO 2 capture system based on FPSCs has been exploited.

40|$|In this work, the {{mechanism}} of void and microcrack formation along the adiabatic shear bands (ASB) was studied for processing dual phase steel by <b>cold</b> <b>heading.</b> Experimental investigation along with finite element simulation has confirmed that this mechanism depends on two types of instabilities, namely geometrical and thermal instabilities. The geometric instability occurs {{in the presence of}} second phase particles (inclusions) and in relation to the material flow orientation, whilst the thermal softening arises due to the localized plastic deformation inside the ASB. Progressive deformation was observed to cause the elongation of voids in the direction of shearing that formed microcracks in the ASB of the <b>cold</b> <b>headed</b> specimen.

40|$|The {{advantage}} of cryocooler {{is the small}} size of its <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> due to this it can be mounted on top of a Dewar, thus reducing overall size of the liquefier setup making it possible to use it in demanding sites and laboratories where the consumption of liquid nitrogen is not in higher quantities. So the dewar which is mostly used to store liquid cryogen, here is used for production and storage purposes. A cryocooler based Nitrogen liquefaction system was designed and developed which can be an ideal solution to the liquid nitrogen usage in laboratories. This setup uses a Cryomech Single stage Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler to provide cooling and condensation of nitrogen at 80 K with the refrigeration capacity of 266 W (Rated) at 80 K and a dewar specially fabricated with wider neck than usual dewar to accommodate <b>cold</b> <b>head.</b> The Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler consist of compressor package, Helium Flex lines and <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> which is {{the heart and soul of}} this setup. The <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> is mounted into the top of the dewar and it extends down into the neck of the dewar for the purpose of cooling the nitrogen entering the dewar to 80 K (- 193 ºC) at 0. 5 bar gauge pressure which is the operating pressure for this dewar. The nitrogen gas liquefies on contact with the <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> heat exchanger. The liquefied nitrogen drips off the heat exchanger down into the dewar. This process would typically lower the pressure inside the dewar, but the regulator allows more nitrogen gas to enter the dewar to maintain the pressure at the preset level. The flow rate of the nitrogen gas into the dewar is controlled by the rate of liquefaction inside the dewar. In the experimental dewar maximum liquefaction rate of 74 Ltr/day and in the main dewar liquefaction rate of 64 Ltr/day were achieved. The difference in liquefaction rate was due to the high radiation load coming on cryogen reservoir of main dewar...|$|R
40|$|As low {{temperature}} cryocoolers become more frequently used to cool superconducting magnets, it becomes increasingly {{apparent that the}} connection between the cooler and the magnet has an effect on the design and performance of the magnet. In general, the use of small coolers can be considered in two different temperature ranges; (1) from 3. 8 to 4. 8 K for magnet fabricated with LTS conductor and (2) from 18 to 35 K for magnets fabricated using HTS conductor. In general, both temperature ranges call for the use of a two-stage cooler. The best method for connecting a cooler to the magnet depends on a number of factors. The factors include: (1) whether the cooler must be used to cool down the magnet from room temperature, (2) whether the magnet must have one or more reservoirs of liquid cryogen to keep the magnet cold during a loss of cooling, and (3) constraints on the distance from the cooler <b>cold</b> <b>heads</b> and the magnet and its shield.
