We argue that {{the development of}} sustainability indicators in science-based initiatives works across the science/policy interface where social and natural scientists as well as stakeholders and policy-makers both translate concepts and ideas to each other and thus make value judgments about the selection of indicators and related sub-classes. This explains why pure scientific indicator initiatives based on simple ‘knowledge transfer’ models are unlikely to succeed. Instead, sustainability indicator development requires a ‘knowledge transaction model’ which spans the boundary between the scientific and the political domains...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} interpretive {{study is}} to look into SDG implementation in Sweden from a governance for sustainable development perspective. This research is {{to be seen as}} a first attempt at mapping the state of governance for sustainable development in relation to SDG implementation in Sweden – further research is both necessary and welcomed in order to get a complete picture of the situation. Seven key components of governance for sustainable development developed by Gibson et al. (2005) are used as a theoretical framework for the study. Those key components are; policy integration; shared sustainability objectives; sustainability based criteria for planning and approval of significant undertakings; specified rules for managing trade-offs and compromises; widely <b>accepted</b> <b>indicators</b> of needs for action and progress towards sustainability; information and incentives for practical implementation, and; programmes for system innovation. Previous research as well as reports from organizations such as the OECD and the European Commission have been used to evaluate the state of these components in Sweden, primarily from an environmental sustainability perspective. Conclusions reached include that the main components relevant for Swedish implementation of the SDGs are: policy integration, shared sustainability objectives and widely <b>accepted</b> <b>indicators</b> for needs for action and progress towards sustainable development. Another conclusion drawn is that the level of fulfillment in some of these key components does not necessarily correspond with the likelihood of successful SDG implementation. Further research is being suggested for   a governance-related mapping of the social and economic pillars of sustainable development. Together with the environmental pillar they are essential for the holistic approach that sustainable development deserves. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of a {{peak in the}} angular power spectrum of {{the cosmic microwave background}} appear to suggest that geometry of the universe is close to being flat. But if other <b>accepted</b> <b>indicators</b> of cosmological parameters are also correct then the best fit model is marginally closed, with the peak in the spectrum at larger scales than in a flat universe. Such observations can be reconciled with a flat universe if the fine structure constant had a lower value at earlier times, which would delay the recombination of electrons and protons and also act to suppress secondary oscillations as observed. We discuss evidence for a few percent increase in the fine structure constant between the time of recombination and the present. Comment: 12 Page...|$|R

This paper investigates loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity, and analyzes their implications on willingness to pay and willingness to accept measures in a reference pivoted choice experiment in a freight transport framework. The results suggest a significant model fit improvement when preferences are treated as asymmetric, proving both loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity. The implications on willingness to pay and willingness to <b>accept</b> <b>indicators</b> are particular relevant showing a remarkable difference between symmetric and asymmetric model specifications. Not accounting for loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity, when present, produces misleading results and might affect significantly the policy decisions.

Testing the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) over 76 stock indices using 17 well <b>accepted</b> <b>indicators</b> (e. g. runs test), results show that most indices exhibit some type(s) of inefficiency and that indicators differ from each other in terms of statistical power and/or the type of inefficiency detected. A principal components analysis (PCA) demonstrates that indicators group along orthogonal dimensions, and hence a market can be inefficient by exhibiting short-term memory, long-term memory and/or calendar effects, which are all distinct sources of inefficiency. This research provides a clearer picture of the extent and nature of market inefficiency, helps explain conflicting previous findings, and suggests a new framework for studying market efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A vast {{majority}} of communications in a network occurs between pairs of nodes, each such interaction is termed a call. The job of call control algorithm is to decide which {{of a set of}} <b>calls</b> to <b>accept</b> in the network so as to maximize a certain objective, viz., the number of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls</b> or the profit associated with the <b>accepted</b> <b>calls.</b> When a <b>call</b> is <b>accepted</b> it uses up some network resources, like bandwidth, along the path through which it is routed. Thus, the call control algorithm needs to make intelligent trade-offs between resource constraints and profits. In this paper, we investigate two variants of call control problems on ring networks; in the first, the algorithm is allowed to determine the route connecting the end nodes of a call, while in the second, the route is specified as part of the input. For the first variant, we show an efficient algorithm that achieves the objective of routing and maximizing the nrnber of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls</b> within an additive constant of at most 3 to an optimal algorithm. This yields by-product. For the fixed path variant, we derive a 2 -approximation for maximizing the profits (which could be arbitrary) of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls...</b>|$|R

30|$|This section {{contains}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} computational complexity of the previously discussed adaptive filters. In practice, the actual computational load of an algorithm is determined by many platform-specific factors, such as the instruction set, the number of clock cycles for a particular arithmetic operation, pipelining, and caching abilities of the processor. Furthermore, especially with growing amount of data to be processed, the memory access pattern may significantly impact how well the processor exploits its capabilities or waits for new data from external memory. Nevertheless, the number of FLoating Point Operations (FLOPs) is still a commonly <b>accepted</b> <b>indicator</b> for the computational complexity of an algorithm on modern platforms, where the different arithmetic operations require similar execution time in principle. Operations counted as FLOPs will be real-valued multiplications (RMULs), additions (RADDs), and divisions (RDIVs).|$|R
