Additionally, enrolling an addict in a drug court program costs much less than incarcerating one in prison. According to the Bureau of Prisons, the fee to cover the average cost of incarceration for Federal inmates in 2006 was $24,440.

40|$|The {{courts have}} {{implemented}} numerous approaches {{to reduce the}} probability of recidivism among people apprehended for or convicted of driving while intoxicated. Although traditional punitive sanctions, such as fines and incarceration, are commonly used, they have not eliminated drinking and driving in the United States. Consequently, the court system has developed additional sanctioning procedures that show promise. For example, rehabilitative programs (e. g., alcohol education and alcoholism treatment) can reduce recidivism, at least marginally. These programs {{appear to be more}} effective when combined with license suspension. In addition to license suspension, several alternative methods for limiting driving opportunities of offenders have proven effective, including impounding offenders ’ vehicles or license plates, installing ignition interlocks, and requiring electronic home monitoring or house arrest.

40|$|A {{publication}} {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an abstract that begins "Today's hearing is on the appointment and oversight of guardians. As people age, they often reach a point when {{they are no longer}} capable of handling their own finances or have difficulty making other decisions for themselves. To ensure that federal cash payments received by incapacitated adults are used in their best interest, the Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal agencies assign a responsible third party or fiduciary to oversee these benefits. SSA and VA can designate spouses, other family members, friends, and organizations to serve as fiduciaries. Similarly, when state courts determine that adults are incapacitated, they have the authority to grant other persons or entities [...] guardians [...] the authority and responsibility to make financial and other decisions for them. Incapacitated adults are vulnerable to financial exploitation by fiduciaries and guardians, so these arrangements are not without risk. In 2010, we identified hundreds of allegations of abuse, neglect, and exploitation by guardians in 45 states and the District of Columbia between 1990 and 2010. At that time, we reviewed 20 of these cases and found that guardians had stolen or otherwise improperly obtained $ 5. 4 million from 158 incapacitated victims, many of whom were older adults. To protect against financial exploitation, state courts as well as federal agencies are responsible for screening prospective guardians and federal fiduciaries, respectively, to make sure suitable individuals are appointed. They are also responsible for monitoring the performance of those they appoint. This statement today is based on our recent report on this topic. It will cover (1) SSA and VA procedures for screening prospective federal fiduciaries, and state court procedures for screening prospective guardians; (2) SSA and VA monitoring of federal fiduciary performance, and state <b>court</b> <b>monitoring</b> of guardian performance; (3) information sharing between SSA and VA fiduciary programs and between each of these programs and state courts; and (4) federal support for improving state courts' oversight of guardianships. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{past thirty}} years have been marked by an {{increased}} federalization of child welfare law, which, like other areas of family law, traditionally remained within the sole purview of state legislatures. Despite increased oversight by the federal government, outcomes for foster children remain unacceptably poor The {{number of children in}} foster care has more than doubled over the past twenty-five years and reports of suspected maltreatment have skyrocketed. Children continue to stay too long in care and have too many placements. Case workers assigned to work with families and attorneys representing parents and children are overwhelmed and rarely provide meaningful assistance. State courts face pressures to move cases through a busy docket rather than spend the time needed to make informed decisions about individual children. Many child welfare systems are or have been subject to <b>court</b> <b>monitoring</b> after evidence that the systems violated the constitutional and statutory rights offamilies.

Then, it discusses the unintended consequences of this growth, primarily its impact on stifling much needed innovative approaches and rigorous debate in the area.

40|$|AGL Energy Pty Ltd {{owns and}} {{operates}} the Camden Gas Project in the Southern Sydney Macarthur region and are currently extracting water and methane from the underlying Illawarra Coal Measures. Within the Macarthur region are two groundwater monitoring sites located at Menangle Park and Denham Court. At each site has four monitoring bores established to monitor the groundwater levels and allow water quality testing. These monitoring bores enable the characterisation of the local groundwater system and an assessment of impacts from coal seam gas extraction on the groundwater system. The Menangle Park monitoring bores are within 100 metres of active production bores whereas Denham Court is ~ 15 km outside the current Camden Gas Project. Both Menangle Park and Denham <b>Court</b> <b>monitoring</b> bores record the groundwater levels of the geological units such as alluvium, the Wianamatta Group and the Hawkesbury Sandstone. Groundwater level hydrographs assess and compare the recharge/drawdown characteristics. In addition, water samples {{were taken from the}} Menangle Park monitoring bores (MPMB 01, MPMB 02, MPMB 03 and MPMB 04), the nearby production bore (MP 17) and the Nepean River. The samples were measured for major ions, elements, radioisotopes and stable isotopes. The techniques involved AMS, CRDS, EA-IRMS, IC and ICPMS. The results characterised the Hawkesbury Sandstone at Menangle Park into an ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ level separated hydrogeologically by a 12 metre thick shale layer. The ‘upper’ level was dated at 600 BP whereas the ‘lower’ level was dated between 14, 500 - 16, 000 BP. The hydrogeochemistry of the coal seam water was significantly different to the Hawkesbury Sandstone however, the age calculations were unrepresentative and unreliable. The water quality was assessed in the Hawkesbury Sandstone and was found to be relatively fresh whereas the Bulli Coal Seam was saline. Interpretation of these results suggests no or negligible hydraulic connection between beneficial aquifers and the coal seam aquifer. Based on this the author concluded that there is negligible impact from coal seam gas extraction on the Hawkesbury Sandstone. However, the data available did not enable the author to make an assessment for the likelihood of long term impacts from coal seam gas extraction...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the experience}} of nine European countries in developing ways of evaluating judicial activity {{within the context of}} courts and responsible authorities, whether ministries or judicial councils. Recognising that the judicial and executive branches bring very different traditions and expectations to evaluation, a theoretical base is developed by elaborating the notions of authority and accountability. These are not the exclusive domains of judges and managers respectively, since each can be seen to be authoritative and accountable in different ways. Both are authorised by and accountable to a sovereign people, and yet these people are conceived in multiple and often contradictory guises, as taxpayers, citizens and parties before the court. Practices in each of the countries under discussion revealed some common problems and uncommon successes. Conflict results when managers apply quantitative output measures, and in response judges insist on legal principles such as judicial independence as a shield against a misconceived accountability. Attempts to refine the measures without reconceptualising the task lead to ritualism that fails to achieve any improvements in either performance or understanding. Complaints mechanisms, opinion polls and ombudsman schemes give some insights into common perceptions of poor judicial performance, including delay and impartiality compromised by close relations between judges and lawyers representing particular parties. However, such methods offer limited scope for improving performance. Initiatives that demonstrated such improvements were characterised by successful collaboration between judges, managers and the public. Court users, parliaments or groups representing popular or outside interests had, on occasion, been able to act as circuit breakers in the zero-sum games between judges and managers. Open communication between key players in the courts and justice systems contributed to innovative approaches to evaluation. The study draws attention to effective responses to concerns expressed by a <b>court</b> <b>monitoring</b> group over judicial impartiality in the Netherlands. Gains were made in collaboration at national and district levels in Demark, when parliamentary guidelines gave direction to judges, auditors and executive managers to identify improved ways of operating for particular district courts. In a Finnish local initiative judges took the lead to work with lawyers and managers to identify areas for improvement in important areas including consistency in sentencing and better written judgments. In each of these cases, far from monitoring and evaluating for their own sake, successful initiatives identify and improve crucial areas of judicial activit...|$|E
