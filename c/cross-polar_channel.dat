30|$|In a dual-polarized system {{subject to}} {{probabilistic}} coexistence of {{primary and secondary}} networks, relocating a cognitive terminal from the copolar channel to the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>channel</b> increases its probability of transmission while keeping intact the transmission capacity of the primary network.|$|E
30|$|Lemma 4 {{indicates}} that, if {{the desired}} throughput remains limited, then the outage is guaranteed on the primary system without summoning up {{the diversity of}} polarization on the secondary terminal. Therefore, the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>channel</b> can be kept available for other terminals that may require higher data rates. This {{can be observed in}} Figure 2.|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{expressions}} for the interferometric {{coherence of}} homogeneous-volume-over-ground models (RVoG and OVoG) {{for the case}} of dominant specular scattering and considering a single-tx interferometer are derived. The analysis of {{the positions of the}} coherences on the complex plane, {{as a function of the}} polarization channel, yields important differences for the single-tx and the alternate-tx acquisition modes when the ground return is dominated by the double-bounce contributions. An additional volume decorrelation term appears when the interferometer is operated in a single-tx mode. This feature makes more difficult the parameter inversion from PolInSAR observables, since the topographic phase is not represented anymore by the crossing between the line formed by the coherences and the unit circumference. The effect of this bistatic volume decorrelation is even more noticeable for the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>channel</b> in the oriented volume case, since the phase of the coherence with an infinite ground-to-volume ratio does not correspond to the topographic phase, as observed for the copolar channels. Additionally, a preliminary study of the influence of the bistatic volume decorrelation as a function of the bistatic angle has been carried out. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the FENNEC experiment (6 to 30 June 2011) an effort has been dedicated to characterize Saharan dust plumes transported towards southern Europe. Hence, a multi instrumented field campaign has been conducted. Ground based nitrogen Raman LIDAR (GBNRL) has been deployed in southern Spain close to Marbella, simultaneously with airborne lidar (AL) performing measurements over both the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the western Africa (from 2 to 23 June). The GBNRL was equipped with co-polar and <b>cross-polar</b> <b>channels</b> to perform continuous measurements of the dust aerosols trapped in the troposphere. It was developed by LSCE {{with the support of the}} LEOSPHERE Company. The French FALCON 20 research aircraft operated by SAFIRE (Service des Avions Francais InstrumentÃ©s pour la Recherche en Environnement) carried the AL Leandre Nouvelle Generation (LNG) as well as a dropsonde releasing system and radiometers. A major, one week long, dust event has been sampled over Spain from 25 June to 1 July with high optical depth (> 0. 5 at 355 nm) and particular depolarization ratios (15 to 25 %). Backtrajectory studies suggest that the dust particles observed were from dust uplifts that occurred in Southern Morocco and Northern Mauritania. The event has been also documented 3 days before by the AL flying over Mauritania. AERONET sunphotometer measurements of aerosol properties, along the dust plume transport path appear to be coherent with both the lidar and the backtrajectory analysis. These analysis exhibit a likely major contribution from the Western Sahara sources to the Southern Europe. Such a contribution may impact the visibility and then the airtrafic, modify the tropospheric chemistry, and add nutrients to both the Mediterranean Sea and the continental surfaces. It can also affect the health of European populations. We will present strategy of the experiment and the case study built from measurements performed at the end of June...|$|R
