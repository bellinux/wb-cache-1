5|$|In March 2012, Taylor {{was charged}} with <b>cocaine</b> {{trafficking}} after undercover narcotics agents purchased a large quantity of <b>cocaine</b> and crack <b>cocaine</b> from him {{over a period of}} several months. He was federally indicted on <b>cocaine</b> trafficking charges in June 2012. Taylor plead guilty in August 2012 and was sentenced to 50 months in prison, followed by three years' supervised release. Taylor was Federal Inmate number 56437-056, and was released on September 12, 2015.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February 2015, Hunt {{was arrested}} and charged with four counts for the supply of <b>cocaine</b> for {{personal}} use or to on-supply <b>cocaine</b> to friends and colleagues between June and December 2014.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 {{expression}} {{has been}} shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to <b>cocaine.</b> Prenatal <b>cocaine</b> exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both GABA neuron migration from the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in the dorsal forebrain. This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that <b>cocaine</b> exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation. Therefore, in models of prenatal <b>cocaine</b> exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E
5|$|A 1980 US {{indictment}} {{said that}} Francisco Rafael was {{under investigation by}} the DEA for alleged <b>cocaine</b> and heroin distribution in the San Diego area. The DEA had identified him as one of the <b>cocaine</b> suppliers and set up an undercover operation to arrest him and his associates by purchasing multi-ton shipments of <b>cocaine.</b> He admitted to have worked with drug distributor Ramón Torresillos-Rendón, and that he used him as a mediator for a drug transaction with an undercover federal agent. In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces of <b>cocaine</b> to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond and promising to appear at every court session. Nonetheless, he fled to Mexico shortly afterwards and did not appear in court on 8 October 1980.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} hotel, policemen Lobo and Lele kill three {{drug dealers and}} collect a guitar case {{containing}} <b>cocaine,</b> which they must deliver to drug lord Tashi. Charlie and his men invade the jockey's hotel room and take all his possessions. The ensuing chase leads to the hotel car park where Lobo and Lele are placing the guitar case in their van. Charlie and his men seize the van {{to escape from the}} jockey's men and realise they had stolen a police vehicle, whilst also discovering the <b>cocaine,</b> which Charlie steals to sell. The policemen, upon returning, discover that the <b>cocaine</b> is missing and set out to find Charlie.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cocaine,</b> {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. <b>Cocaine</b> and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. Like <b>cocaine,</b> substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, but by different mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, his <b>cocaine</b> {{addiction}} intensified. Jennings {{claimed to have}} spent $1,500 a day on his habit, draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt up to $2.5million. Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional tours to earn the funds, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated. Jennings decided to quit his addictions, leased {{a home in the}} Phoenix area, and spent a month detoxing himself, intending to start using <b>cocaine</b> again in a more controlled fashion afterward. In 1984, he quit <b>cocaine.</b> Jennings claimed that his son Shooter was his main inspiration to quit permanently.|$|E
5|$|He {{was sacked}} by Charlton and banned {{for six months}} by The Football Association in November 1997 for testing {{positive}} for <b>cocaine</b> and cannabis. He denied the charge, claiming that a cigarette he smoked had been laced with the <b>cocaine.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} {{marijuana}} and <b>cocaine.</b> He {{has said that}} in <b>cocaine</b> he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals with on a regular basis. In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to <b>cocaine.</b> In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack <b>cocaine</b> in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{psychological}} trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on <b>cocaine.</b> Within two years, she was spending $500 per night on <b>cocaine.</b> Her drug use resulted in delusions and caused her to become schizophrenic, and subsequently distrustful of those around her, fearing that people were coming to take away her drugs.|$|E
5|$|The Ashaninkas were {{pressured}} to begin growing coca as <b>cocaine</b> trafficking increased in Peru {{by the early}} 1980s. Gagnon {{said that he would}} leave the mission if the people entered the <b>cocaine</b> trade, and no one chose to change their way of life. As the trade grew in the area, though, Gagnon talked to a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent and {{sent a letter to the}} Peruvian security police base commander in Mazamari in 1983. Gagnon was told, and heeded the advice of two drug traffickers, not make any further overtures about the <b>cocaine</b> trade.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2017, Zeta-Jones has {{commenced}} filming for <b>Cocaine</b> Godmother, {{a television}} biopic {{on the drug}} lord Griselda Blanco, which will premiere in 2018 on Lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of <b>cocaine</b> on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of <b>cocaine</b> possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the <b>cocaine</b> alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. <b>Cocaine</b> and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|During an {{interview}} in late 2007, Birch revealed {{that he had been}} using drugs since he was 15, using <b>cocaine,</b> crack, and heroin, and mixing it with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Gygax, newly single, took {{advantage}} {{of his time on}} the West Coast, renting an immense mansion, increasing his <b>cocaine</b> use, and spending time with several young starlets.|$|E
5|$|Houston is a {{significant}} hub for trafficking of <b>cocaine,</b> cannabis, heroin, MDMA, and methamphetamine due to its size and proximity to major illegal drug exporting nations. Houston {{is one of the}} country's largest hubs for human trafficking.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 in New York and in 2010 in Washington, the U.S. Department of Justice {{released}} an indictment against Treviño Morales for conspiracy to manufacture and distribute <b>cocaine</b> into the United States from Mexico and Guatemala. There was a bounty {{for him in}} Mexico set at $30 million MXN (US$2.3 million) and another one in the U.S. at US$5 million ($62.4 million MXN). Los Zetas {{are responsible for the}} smuggling of multiple tons of <b>cocaine,</b> marijuana, and heroin into the United States from Mexico annually. He was also considered one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords.|$|E

5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and <b>cocaine,</b> {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the <b>cocaine</b> made them distrustful.|$|E
5|$|These {{industrialization}} measures proved largely unsuccessful {{given that}} coca remained illegal in most nations outside Bolivia, thus depriving the growers {{of an international}} market. Campaigning against this, in 2012 Bolivia withdrew from the UN 1961 Convention which had called for global criminalisation of coca, and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to declassify coca as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticised Bolivia, asserting that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to Bolivia to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of <b>cocaine</b> seizures in Bolivia increased under Morales' government, as they sought to encourage coca growers to report and oppose <b>cocaine</b> producers and traffickers. However, high levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in <b>cocaine</b> remained a continuing problem for Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|Two male {{passengers}} were arrested at North Shore Hospital after a nurse informed police that 46-year-old Antonio Zuluaga had swallowed containers filled with <b>cocaine.</b> Zuluaga, {{who had a}} fractured spine, broken ribs and a dislocated hip, was the second passenger {{to be found in}} possession of <b>cocaine</b> packages, after doctors operating on Jose Figueroa on the day after the crash to stop internal bleeding had also discovered packets of cocaine.They pleaded guilty to second-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance. Figueroa was sentenced to seven years to life in prison, and Zuluaga was sentenced to six years to life.|$|E
5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs are linked to more deaths in several countries. <b>Cocaine</b> and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, <b>cocaine</b> and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack <b>cocaine.</b> A task force was formed and was partially successful at reducing gang activity {{by a combination of}} removing gang-related graffiti and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting.|$|E
5|$|Caleb Swanigan, born April 18, 1997, {{grew up in}} an {{unstable}} home due to his father, Carl Swanigan Sr., who had a crack <b>cocaine</b> addiction.

5|$|His earlier {{books as}} Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his {{doctoral}} {{expertise in the}} field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, <b>cocaine</b> addiction, the common cold, and AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.|$|E
5|$|However, Julia {{had long}} indulged in a self-destructive {{lifestyle}} of excessive drug consumption, {{and it had}} begun to affect her work. François Truffaut, one of French cinema's most iconic directors and a star of Close Encounters, blamed her for that film's budget difficulties, and she was eventually fired during post-production because of her <b>cocaine</b> dependence.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Tommy Vercetti (Ray Liotta), a loyal {{former member}} of the Forelli Family, is {{released}} from prison after serving a fifteen-year sentence. His former boss, Sonny Forelli (Tom Sizemore), ostensibly promotes Tommy to a caporegime and sends him to Vice City to act as the Forelli's buyer in a <b>cocaine</b> deal and to also do other ground work for the Forellis. When Tommy and his bodyguards arrive in Vice City crooked lawyer Ken Rosenberg (William Fichtner) takes them in his car to the docks; the site of the deal.
