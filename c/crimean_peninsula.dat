5|$|The Crimean War {{lasted from}} October 1853 until 1 April 1856 and was fought between the Russian Empire and an {{alliance}} of the United Kingdom, France, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire. The majority of the conflict {{took place on the}} <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula</b> in the Black Sea and Turkey.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Manstein was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 11th Army after its previous commander, Colonel-General Eugen Ritter von Schobert, perished when his plane landed in a Soviet minefield. The 11th Army was tasked with invading the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> capturing Sevastopol, and pursuing enemy forces on the flank of Army Group South during its advance into the Soviet Union. Hitler's intention was to prevent the Red Army from using airbases there, and {{to cut off the}} Soviet supply of oil from the Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|She {{was twelve}} {{at the time}} of the February Revolution of 1917, during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II. The {{subsequent}} October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. While in high school, Rand confirmed that she was an atheist and valued reason above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.|$|E
50|$|The village {{lies on the}} {{northern}} portion of <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula's</b> Arabat Spit, though neither Strilkove nor the neighboring village of Shchaslyvtseve are claimed {{as part of the}} Crimean Autonomous Republic. It is located 8 kilometres {{to the north of the}} border of the Crimean Republic, between the Azov Sea to the east, and Lake Sivash in the west; and is 32 km far from the town of Henichesk.|$|R
50|$|Like other Jewish {{groups in}} the Crimea, Krymchak culture, {{everyday}} life, and language had strong Crimean Tatar influences. The Crimean Tatar language became dominant between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries for political reasons, it being {{the language of the}} <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula's</b> Tatar political majority. Tatar was the common language used between different ethnic groups residing on the peninsula, and it also became the common language between the different Jewish groups living in the Crimea.|$|R
50|$|Crimean Campaigns of 1687 and 1689: Two {{attempts}} were made to reach Perekop and bottle up the <b>Crimeans</b> inside their <b>peninsula.</b> They failed because of the difficulty of moving large numbers of men and horses across the steppe.|$|R
5|$|The Army {{was ordered}} formed on 14 August 1941 in the Crimea {{based on the}} 9th Rifle Corps and other units as the 51st Independent Army under Colonel General F.I. Kuznetsov, {{with the task of}} {{guarding}} the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Pavel Batov was appointed as his deputy. Professor John Erickson in The Road to Stalingrad describes Stalin's rationale for the formation of the Army during a 12 August session within the Stavka war room: Stalin and the Stavka had concluded from the German moves underway at the time that a strike on the Crimea (along with an attack on Bryansk) was likely, and thus the formation of an Independent Army in the Crimea had been decided upon. Thus Kuznetsov was summoned, and after a discussion, he was sent south to take up his new command.|$|E
5|$|In September 1854, the Anglo-French {{army that}} had been at Varna was ferried across the Black Sea and landed on the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> They then fought {{their way to the}} main Russian naval base on the peninsula, the city of Sevastopol, which they placed under siege. The Russian {{garrison}} eventually withdrew from the city in early September 1855, freeing the French and British fleets for other tasks. A discussion ensued over what target should be attacked next; the French and British high commands considered driving from the Crimea to Kherson and launching major campaigns in Bessarabia or the Caucasus. Instead, at the urging of French commanders, they settled on a smaller-scale operation to seize the Russian fort at Kinburn, which protected the mouth of the Dneiper. The British argued that to seize Kinburn without advancing to Nikolaev would only serve to warn the Russians of the threat to the port. Fox Maule-Ramsay, then the British Secretary of State for War, suggested that without a plan to exploit the capture of the fortress, the only purpose of the operation would be to give the fleets something to do.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May, Bär was {{transferred}} from IV./JG51 on the Moscow front to take command of I. Gruppe of Gordon Gollob's Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG77) flying wing. Bär replaced Herbert Ihlefeld {{who had been}} transferred. JG77 was tasked with supporting the hard fighting in the Crimean Campaign over the Kerch Strait on the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Led by the flying aces (Experten) Gollob and Bär, JG77 took over the air space above Kerch-Taman as Gollob and Bär shot down two and three LaGG-3s respectively, raising Bär's victory total to 93. Mutual animosity between the two men, Gollob, a disciplinarian pro-Nazi, and Bär, an anti-authoritarian, ensured an intense rivalry. On 19 May 1942, Bär claimed five further aerial victories—including a Polikarpov R-5 {{in the morning and}} four I-16s in one afternoon mission: his victory total now stood at 103. He was the 9th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. That same day, Inspector of Fighters (General der Jagdflieger) Adolf Galland arrived to inspect Bär's I./JG77 and JG77 surpassed 2,000 victories.|$|E
5000|$|The Krymchak {{language}} ( [...] , Qrımçah tılyı) (also called Judeo-Crimean Tatar, Krimchak, Chagatai, Dzhagatay) is a moribund Turkic {{language spoken}} in Crimea by the Krymchak people. The Krymchak community {{was composed of}} Jewish immigrants who arrived from all over Europe and Asia and who continuously added to the Krymchak population. The Krymchak language, as well as culture and daily life, was very similar to <b>Crimean</b> Tatar, the <b>peninsula's</b> majority population, {{with the addition of}} a significant Hebrew influence.|$|R
5000|$|Having {{signed the}} Eternal Peace Treaty with Poland in 1686, Russia {{became a member}} of the anti-Turkish {{coalition}} ("Holy League" [...] — Austria, the Republic of Venice and Poland), which was pushing the Turks south after their failure at Vienna in 1683 (the major result of this war was the conquest by Austria of most of Hungary from Turkish rule). Russia's role in 1687 was to send a force south to Perekop to bottle up the <b>Crimeans</b> inside their <b>peninsula.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1921 the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created. This {{republic}} was {{dissolved in}} 1945, and the Crimea became an oblast {{first of the}} Russian SSR (1945-1954) and then the Ukrainian SSR (1954-1991). Since 1991 the territory was covered by the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol City within independent Ukraine. During the 2014 <b>Crimean</b> crisis, the <b>peninsula</b> {{was taken over by}} pro-Russian forces and a referendum on whether to join Russia was held. Shortly after the result in favour of joining Russia was announced, Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation as two federal subjects: the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol.|$|R
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} EEU and the European Union (EU) {{occurred}} as both {{have sought to}} deepen their ties with several former Soviet republics. The EU has signed free trade agreements with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. However, separatists in all three countries back closer ties with Russia. Russia and the EU both pressured Ukraine to join their respective economic blocs {{to the exclusion of}} the other, which ultimately led to Ukraine being torn in two, with the EU supporting the unwilling departure of the elected president, and Russia then annexing the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula</b> (following a referendum) and supporting separatists in Eastern Ukraine. In response, some member states of the European Union have sought to find alternatives to Russian gas, while others have voiced their support for the construction of the South Stream pipeline which circumvents Ukraine. Later the already started construction of the pipeline, under US sanctions on Russia and pressure on EU, the project was abandoned. Analysts believe Russia backs the Eurasian Economic Union in order to limit western influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|When Russia {{invaded the}} Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian {{dominance}} in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Russian Entente. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarities}} between the Hellenistic wall paintings at Delos and the First Style of Pompeii, Joyce contends that the differences in Delian and Pompeian mosaics are the deliberate product of artistic preference rather than the result of ignorance of each other's traditions. These differences include the widespread use of opus signinum at Pompeii, with only four known examples at Delos; the use of opus sectile at Pompeii and its complete absence at Delos; the prevalent use of polychrome patterns and intricate, three-dimensional figured designs in Delian mosaics versus two-dimensional designs at Pompeii, which at best utilize two colors. Complex three-dimensional figured mosaics using polychrome designs to achieve the illusion of light and shadow weren't produced at Pompeii until the Pompeian Second Style of wall painting (80-20 BC) and are considered an adoption from Hellenistic art trends. While lead strips were used in Hellenistic mosaics of Delos, Athens, and Pella (Greece), Pergamon (Turkey), Callatis (Romania), Alexandria (Egypt), and Chersonesus (the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula),</b> they are absent in Western Mediterranean mosaics of Malta, Sicily, and the Italian peninsula. Westgate affirms that Hellenistic mosaics can be divided into two broad categories: eastern and western, based on their different styles and production techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Before the Hellenistic period, Greek colonies {{had been}} {{established}} {{on the coast of}} the <b>Crimean</b> and Taman <b>peninsulas.</b> The Bosporan Kingdom was a multi-ethnic kingdom of Greek city states and local tribal peoples such as the Maeotians, Thracians, Crimean Scythians and Cimmerians under the Spartocid dynasty (438-110 BC). The Spartocids were a hellenized Thracian family from Panticapaeum. The Bosporans had long lasting trade contacts with the Scythian peoples of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, and Hellenistic influence {{can be seen in the}} Scythian settlements of the Crimea, such as in the Scythian Neapolis. Scythian pressure on the Bosporan kingdom under Paerisades V led to its eventual vassalage under the Pontic king Mithradates VI for protection, c. 107 BC. It later became a Roman client state. Other Scythians on the steppes of Central Asia came into contact with Hellenistic culture through the Greeks of Bactria. Many Scythian elites purchased Greek products and some Scythian art shows Greek influences. At least some Scythians seem to have become Hellenized, because we know of conflicts between the elites of the Scythian kingdom over the adoption of Greek ways. These Hellenized Scythians were known as the [...] "young Scythians". The peoples around Pontic Olbia, known as the Callipidae, were intermixed and Hellenized Greco-Scythians.The Greek colonies on the west coast of the Black sea, such as Istros, Tomi and Callatis traded with the Thracian Getae who occupied modern-day Dobruja. From the 6th century BC on, the multiethnic people in this region gradually intermixed with each other, creating a Greco-Getic populace. Numismatic evidence shows that Hellenic influence penetrated further inland. Getae in Wallachia and Moldavia coined Getic tetradrachms, Getic imitations of Macedonian coinage.|$|R
25|$|Beginning on February 26, pro-Russian forces {{gradually}} {{took control}} of the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula.</b> Russia claimed that the uniformed men were local self-defense forces, but they are generally claimed in Western media to be Russian military personnel without insignia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula</b> {{comprises}} {{many smaller}} peninsulas, {{such as the}} mentioned Kerch peninsula, Heracles Peninsula, Tarkhankut Peninsula and many others. Crimea also possesses lots of headlands such as Cape Priboiny, Cape Tarkhankut, Sarych, Cape Fonar, Kazantyp, Cape Akburun, and many others.|$|E
25|$|On 16 September 2015 the Ukrainian {{parliament}} {{voted for}} the law that sets 20 February 2014 as the official date of the Russian temporary occupation of <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula.</b> On 7 October 2015 the President of Ukraine signed the law into force.|$|E
25|$|Before the Ottomans, the Seljuq {{sultan of}} Rûm, Alaeddin Keykubad I, {{had formed a}} Black Sea fleet based in Sinop, which, {{under the command of}} Amir Chupan, had conquered parts of the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula</b> and Sugdak on the Sea of Azov between 1220 and 1237.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture in {{the region}} {{includes}} cereals, vegetable-growing, gardening, and wine-making, particularly in the Yalta and Massandra regions. Livestock production includes cattle breeding, poultry keeping, and sheep breeding. Other products produced on the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> include salt, porphyry, limestone, and ironstone (found around Kerch) since ancient times.|$|E
25|$|Agrippa was {{appointed}} {{governor of the}} eastern provinces a second time in 17 BC, where his just and prudent administration won him the respect and good-will of the provincials, especially from the Jewish population. Agrippa also restored effective Roman control over the Cimmerian Chersonnese (<b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula)</b> during his governorship.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Chersonesus {{was listed}} as a World Heritage Site. as Ancient City of Tauric Chersonese and its Chora. During the 2014 Crimean crisis the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula</b> was annexed by Russia, but UNESCO has {{maintained}} that {{it will continue to}} recognize Crimea and its heritage sites as belonging to Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|After the 1917 {{revolution}} Gurwitsch {{fell upon}} hard times {{and accepted the}} chair of Histology at Taurida University, the chief seat of learning of the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> where he spent seven happy years. Here in 1923 he first observed biophotons or ultra-weak biological photon emissions; weak electromagnetic waves which were detected in the ultra-violet range of the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|The 2014 Crimean {{crisis is}} an ongoing {{international}} crisis principally involving Russia and Ukraine. Most developments apply to the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> formerly a multi-ethnic region of Ukraine composed of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the administratively separate municipality of Sevastopol; both are populated by an ethnic Russian majority and a minority of both ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars.|$|E
25|$|Seljuq {{sultan of}} Rûm Kayqubad I conquered Alaiye (Alanya) {{and formed a}} naval arsenal there. Alanya became the homeport of the Seljuk fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. Kayqubad I later formed a fleet in the Black Sea based in Sinope (Sinop), which, {{under the command of}} Amir Chupan, conquered parts of the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula</b> and Sugdak on the Sea of Azov (1220–1237).|$|E
25|$|Tsar Nicholas {{died with}} his {{philosophy}} in dispute. One year earlier, Russia had {{become involved in}} the Crimean War, a conflict fought primarily in the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula.</b> Since playing {{a major role in the}} defeat of Napoleon, Russia had been regarded as militarily invincible, but, once pitted against a coalition of the great powers of Europe, the reverses it suffered on land and sea exposed the weakness of Tsar Nicholas' regime.|$|E
25|$|Built between 1835 and 1855, the Malakoff Tower, a {{monument}} constructed in Tunisian / Arabic style, {{used to be}} an observatory and now is a cultural centre and a place for popular gatherings. It is located at Arsenal da Marinha Square. It has been registered as an Historical Patrimony and was named after a similar monument on the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula,</b> off the Black Sea, used as a defence centre for Sebastopol.|$|E
25|$|In the 9th century CE, Byzantium {{established}} the Cherson theme {{to defend against}} incursions by the Rus' Khaganate. The <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula</b> from this time was contested between Byzantium, Rus' and Khazaria. The area remained the site of overlapping interests and contact between the early medieval Slavic, Turkic and Greek spheres. It became a center of slave trade. Slavs were sold to Byzantium and other places in Anatolia and the Middle-East during this period.|$|E
25|$|From Sinope {{he took a}} sea {{route to}} the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> {{arriving}} in the Golden Horde realm. He went to the port town of Azov, where {{he met with the}} emir of the Khan, then to the large and rich city of Majar. He left Majar to meet with Uzbeg Khan's travelling court (Orda), which was at the time near Beshtau mountain. From there he made a journey to Bolghar, which became the northernmost point he reached, and noted its unusually (for a subtropics dweller) short nights in summer. Then he returned to the Khan's court and with it moved to Astrakhan.|$|E
25|$|After the {{annexation}} of the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> by Russia in 2014 the Obama administration imposed sanctions, {{to which the}} US Department of Treasury added new prohibitions in September 2014, coinciding with EU sanctions. Sanctions consist of access restriction to the EU and US capital markets. After announcement of the sanctions, {{and by the end}} of July, Sberbank's market value had dropped the most market value among the world’s major lenders plus investors moved $22 billion from Sberbank’s market capitalization. Still, during the following year Sberbank’s share price grew back 89%. Sberbank together with other Russian banks filed claims with the highest EU court to lift the punitive economic measures.|$|E
25|$|Although Sinop {{served as}} a primary trade center in the Black Sea, the wrecks were located west of the trade route {{predicted}} by the prevalence of Sinopian ceramics on the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula.</b> On wrecks A-C, mounds of distinctive carrot-shaped shipping jars, called amphorae, were found. They were of a style associated with Sinop and retained much of their original stacking pattern on the sea floor. The jars may have carried a variety of archetypal Black Sea products such as olive oil, honey, wine or fish sauce but the contents are presently unknown because no artifacts were recovered from any of these wreck sites in 2000.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War the {{peninsula}} was invaded by Nazi Germany and Romanian troops in summer 1941 across the Isthmus of Perekop. Following {{the capture of}} Sevastopol on 4 July 1942, Crimea was occupied until German and Romanian forces were expelled in an offensive by Soviet forces ending in May 1944. On 25 June 1946, it was downgraded to the Crimean Oblast, and the Crimean Tatars were deported for alleged collaboration with the Nazi forces. A {{total of more than}} 230,000 people – about a fifth of the total population of the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> at that time – were deported, mainly to Uzbekistan. 14,300 Greeks, 12,075 Bulgarians, and about 10,000 Armenians were also expelled.|$|E
25|$|Following Russia's {{loss of the}} {{traditionally}} popular resorts of the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> (transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 by Nikita Khrushchev), Sochi emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country. In 1961, Soviet officials decided to expand the city limits by forming a Greater Sochi which extended for 140 kilometers from the southern parts of Tuapse to Adler. In July 2005, Russia submitted a successful bid for hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city, spending around $51 billion in the process. Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the Georgian, separatist Abkhazian, and separatist South Ossetian governing authorities.|$|E
25|$|By late 1920, Makhno had halted General Wrangel's White Army advance into Ukraine {{from the}} southwest, {{capturing}} 4,000 prisoners and stores of munitions, and preventing the White Army from gaining {{control of the}} all-important Ukrainian grain harvest. Upon the signing of a truce in the Polish–Soviet War further west, additional Red Army were freed to also participate in the southern campaign that pursued Wrangel and {{the remainder of his}} forces down the <b>Crimean</b> <b>peninsula.</b> To the end, Makhno and the anarchists maintained their main political structures, refusing demands to join the Red Army, to hold Bolshevik-supervised elections, or accept Bolshevik-appointed political commissars. The Red Army temporarily accepted these conditions, but within a few days ceased to provide the Makhnovists with basic supplies, such as cereals and coal.|$|E
25|$|Some studies {{indicate}} that the Black Death that devastated Europe in the late 1340s may have traveled from China to Europe along the trade routes of the Mongol Empire. In 1347, the Genoese possessor of Caffa, a great trade emporium on the <b>Crimean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> came under siege by an army of Mongol warriors {{under the command of}} Janibeg. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, transferring the plague via their ships into the south of Europe, whence it rapidly spread. The total number of deaths worldwide from the pandemic is estimated at 75 million people, with an estimated 20 million deaths in Europe alone.|$|E
