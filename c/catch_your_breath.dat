2500|$|In {{the midst}} of this turmoil, which also {{included}} Clinton pledging government-level support to Japan {{in the wake of the}} devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Clinton reiterated in a mid-March CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer during her post-revolution visit to Cairo's Tahrir Square that she had no interest in becoming Secretary of Defense or vice president or of running for president again. She also explicitly said for the first time that she did not want to serve a second term as Secretary of State if President Obama is re-elected in 2012. She stressed how much she regarded her current position: [...] "Because I have the best job I could ever have. This is a moment in history where it is almost hard to <b>catch</b> <b>your</b> <b>breath.</b> There are both the tragedies and disasters that we have seen from Haiti to Japan and there are the extraordinary opportunities and challenges that we see right here in Egypt and in the rest of the region." [...] But reportedly she was weary at times from constant travelling, still not part of Obama's inner circle, and looking forward to a time of less stress and the chances to write, teach, or work for international women's rights. She was not bound by her statements, and Blitzer for one suspected she would change her mind. In any case, she remained popular with the American public; her Gallup Poll favorability rating rose to 66percent (against 31percent unfavorable), her highest mark ever save for a period during the Lewinsky scandal thirteen years earlier. Her favorability was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than those for Obama, Biden, or Gates, and reflected in part the high ratings that secretaries of state sometimes get.|$|E

5000|$|Hussein {{has been}} called a [...] "delicious blend of Kipling and the Arabian Nights." [...] As the New York Times {{reviewer}} wrote, [...] "...there is barely a moment to <b>catch</b> <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> before Hussein dives into another adventure." [...] Years later, [...] "examining humanity through the friendship of two men" [...] would become a hallmark of O'Brian's well-known Aubrey-Maturin series of novels. In Hussein there is an early indication of this technique as O'Brian creates a [...] "witty duel" [...] between Hussein and Yussuf, ostensibly about a cheetah's collar, but also about opium and the handling of cheetahs. The author demonstrates in this scene why the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that, [...] "O'Brian's books are novels of manners...," [...] despite their use of adventure. The reviewer states, ...O'Brian's favorite writer was Jane Austen, and the books can best be thought of as companion volumes to her novels, with formal differences in rank replacing the differences in social position that intrigued her, and the complicated friendships of men replacing the complicated negotiations of courtship.|$|E
5000|$|Steve Rose from The Guardian {{wrote about}} one of the movie's major criticisms: that The Adventures of Tintin, much like The Polar Express, crossed into the uncanny valley, thereby {{rendering}} Tintin [...] "too human and not human at all". Manohla Dargis, one of the chief critics of the New York Times, called the movie [...] "a marvel of gee-wizardry and a night's entertainment that can feel like a lifetime". The simplicity of the comic strip, she wrote, is a crucial part of the success of Tintin, who is [...] "an avatar for armchair adventurers". Dargis noted that Tintin's appearance in the film [...] "resembled Hergé's creation, yet was eerily different as if, like Pinocchio, his transformation into human form had been prematurely interrupted". Another major fault in the film, Dargis points out, is how it is so wildly overworked; she writes that there is [...] "hardly a moment of downtime, a chance to <b>catch</b> <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> or contemplate the tension between the animated Expressionism and the photo-realist flourishes". Nevertheless, she singles out some of the [...] "interludes of cinematic delight", approving of the visual imagination employed within the movie's numerous exciting scenes.|$|E
