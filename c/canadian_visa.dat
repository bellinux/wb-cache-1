50|$|A <b>Canadian</b> <b>visa</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} to obtain for citizens of Russia.

500|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Vick was mentored by former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy. The {{prospect}} of his return to professional football {{was the subject of}} much conjecture as his suspension and incarceration continued. In 2007, ESPN's John Clayton said few general managers were in a strong enough position to consider taking a chance on Vick, and even then most NFL owners would be concerned about a fan and media backlash. There was also no chance of Vick resurrecting his career in the Canadian Football League, he said. Following a furor in 2007 over Ricky Williams playing there while serving a suspension, the CFL banned players currently suspended by the NFL. In any case, Clayton said it would be nearly impossible for a convicted felon to get a <b>Canadian</b> work <b>visa.</b> He did think, however, that Vick would be [...] "unstoppable" [...] if he decided to play in the Arena Football League.|$|R
50|$|For Canadians, TN status {{does not}} involve a <b>visa.</b> <b>Canadian</b> {{professionals}} are admitted into the United States in TN-1 status at the border. Canadian citizens {{are not required to}} obtain a visa, but instead receive TN status with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at their Port of Entry (most commonly it is done upon entry to the United States from Canada, but entry in TN status is permitted at any port of entry, such as an airport with United States border preclearance). It must be noted that the TN status will only be granted if the period of stay is temporary. There is no appeal recourse if one is refused TN status.|$|R
