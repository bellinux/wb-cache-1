5|$|A {{pedestrian}} safety project {{aimed to}} reduce jaywalking will install a dune-style fence in the median of MD 528, {{with the first}} phase to take place between 41st Street/Convention Center Drive and MD 90. <b>Construction</b> <b>on</b> the first phase was expected to begin in January 2017 and be finished by Memorial Day of that year, but was delayed after the only bid came in over the $4.5 million budget. <b>Construction</b> <b>on</b> the first phase, which will run between 26th Street and MD 90, will begin in October 2017 and be completed in May 2018. Future phases will build the fence between 9th Street and 26th Street and between MD 90 and the Delaware border.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} began in 1975 {{in the two}} states. Due to a chronic lack of funding, {{construction}} in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to restart construction, and by 1983, both states had completed <b>construction</b> <b>on</b> the freeway. The three-level diamond interchange with concurrent highways U.S. Route 250 (US250) and West Virginia Route 2 (WV2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was thought to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia's Interstate Highway System at the time of <b>construction.</b> <b>On</b> average, between 25,500 and 37,840vehicles use the highway daily.|$|E
5|$|<b>Construction</b> <b>on</b> Intimidator began {{during the}} summer of 2009 with land {{clearing}} and footings being constructed. Track pieces first began to arrive at Carowinds on August 7, 2009. About 3 weeks later, Intimidator was officially announced on August 26, 2009 by Carowinds. Along with the announcement, Carowinds reached a licensing agreement with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. to utilize the Dale Earnhardt brand as part of the ride. One of Earnhardt's sons, Kerry Earnhardt, was on-hand for the press conference announcing the attraction and endorsed the ride on behalf of the family. The first supports and track for Intimidator were installed on September 1, 2009. The lift hill was erected on October 1, 2009 and was completed on October 13, 2009. In order to install the last lift piece, 3 cranes were required. <b>Construction</b> <b>on</b> the roller coaster layout continued through November and December with the final track piece installed on December 21, 2009. <b>Construction</b> <b>on</b> the station, mechanics, and landscaping of Intimidator took place during the months of January and February. On February 4, 2010, testing of Intimidator commenced with the new roller coaster officially opening to the public on March 27, 2010.|$|E

The line opened in two phases in 2004, beginning with a 12-station stretch from the Warehouse District / Hennepin Avenue station through the Fort Snelling station in June. In December, five more stations were opened, continuing service south of Fort Snelling to the Mall of America station. Two additional Blue Line stations opened in late 2009: a new northern terminus at Target Field and the American Boulevard station in Bloomington. <b>Construction</b> <b>on</b> the Green Line, which was initially designated as the Central Corridor, began in 2010. The line opened in its entirety in June 2014.|$|E

The Loews Hotels chain agreed to co-finance construction of the property with L'Enfant Plaza Corp., although details of the agreement were not provided. The hotel would occupy the top four floors and lobby of the 12-story building, with separate elevators for office tenants and hotel guests. The 378-room hotel, designed by Koubek, had a rooftop swimming pool, two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, and meeting rooms. The general contractor for the building was George Hyman Construction Co.

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} maximal–primary {{irreducible}} ideals in a commutative graded connected Noetherian algebra over a field is in principle {{equivalent to the}} study of the corresponding quotient algebras. Such algebras are Poincaré duality algebras. A prototype for such an algebra is the cohomology with field coefficients of a closed oriented manifold. Topological <b>constructions</b> <b>on</b> closed manifolds often lead to algebraic <b>constructions</b> <b>on</b> Poincaré duality algebras and therefore also on maximal–primary irreducible ideals. It is the purpose of this note to examine several of these and develop some of their basic properties...|$|R
