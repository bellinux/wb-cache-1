40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} {{invasive}} herbivore species may be lower in more diverse plant communities due to mechanisms of associational resistance. According to the “resource concentration hypothesis” {{the amount and}} accessibility of host plants is reduced in diverse plant communities, thus limiting the exploitation of resources by consumers. In addition, the “natural enemy hypothesis” suggests that richer plant assemblages provide natural enemies with more complementary resources and habitats, thus promoting top down regulation of herbivores. We tested these two hypotheses by comparing crown damage by the invasive Asian <b>chestnut</b> <b>gall</b> wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus) on chestnut trees (Castanea sativa) in pure and mixed stands in Italy. We estimated the defoliation on 70 chestnut trees in 15 mature stands sampled in the same region along a gradient of tree species richness ranging from one species (chestnut monocultures) to four species (mixtures of chestnut and three broadleaved species). Chestnut defoliation was significantly lower in stands with higher tree diversity. Damage on individual chestnut trees decreased with increasing height of neighboring, heterospecific trees.

Oriental <b>chestnut</b> <b>gall</b> wasp (DryocosmuskuriphilusYat su matsu) (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) is new {{invasive}} species in Europe and im portant pest on sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.). It is on quarantine species lists in Europe {{as well as}} in Croatia. The species originates from China and it was first introduced to Europe to Italy in 2002. It has also been recorded in Slovenia, France, Hungary and Switzerland. In May 2010. it was recorded in Croatia for the first time. Oriental <b>chestnut</b> <b>gall</b> wasp has one generation per year (Figure 1). Adult wasps (only females are known) emerge from galls from mid June until the end of July and lay eggs in the buds. The wasp overvinters as early larval instar in buds and cannot be detected without large magnification lense. In spring when new shoots and leaves emerge the galls develop on the leaf midveins (Figure 2) or shoots. The galls, 5 – 20 mm in diameter, contain one or usually several cham bers with white larvae, later pupae. Young galls are green, later rose-coloured and can be easily detected on sweet <b>chestnut</b> shoots. Old <b>galls</b> are brown, wood-like and remain attached to the tree up to two years (Figure 3). The spread of oriental gall wasp occurs mainly by transport of infected plant material (scions for grafting, plants for planting) into new areas. Lo cally, the wasps spreads by active flight or passive (aided by wind or human dispersal) transport. The galls disrupt twig growth and reduce fruiting. Various authors consi der it as a seroius pest on sweet chestnut trees. Several control measures against this pest have prooved themselves uneffective. Pruning of infested shoots can be done in small orchards but this method is uneffective in forests. Some parasitoid species, e. g. Torymus sinensis, can reduce populations of oriental <b>chestnut</b> <b>gall</b> wasp and this species has already been introduced as biological control agent in Japan, Korea and Italy. Oriental sweet <b>chestnut</b> <b>gall</b> wasp was first recorded in Croatia on 21 May 2010 in Lovran and after that in several other sweet chestnut forests (Table 1, Figure 5). According to the number of galls per shoot it can be estimated that on the localities Lovran, Samobor and Ozalj (single galls per leaf/shoot) the pest has recently been introduced. Localities in Zagreb had high infestation rates (numerous galls per leaf/shoot) and it can be estimated that the pest is here present since 2007 or 2008. The spread forecast for Croatia for the follo wing years is given. Intensive spread can be expected in all areas where sweet chestnut is grown, lower intensity in Istria, surroundings of Karlovac and Ba nija, and much higher intensity and quicker spread in Zagreb area, Hrvatsko zagorje and Samoborsko gorje.

40|$|The {{globally}} invasive <b>chestnut</b> <b>gall</b> wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus {{was recently}} reported in Italy and threatens European chestnut orchards and native forests. Of Chinese origin, this species has invaded Japan, Korea, the USA, Nepal and Europe {{and in each}} region it has been attacked by parasitoids exploiting oak gall wasps. Classical biological control using the parasitoid Torymus sinensis (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) successfully reduced infestation in Japan. Subsequent work in Japan and Korea showed this parasitoid to represent a poorly understood and biologically diverse species complex. Following its success in Japan, T. sinensis was released in Italy in 2005. A growing appreciation of the taxonomic and ecological complexity of the T. sinensis complex in Japan and Korea has stimulated ongoing DNA-based work on relationships and interbreeding of species in this group. Oak cynipid parasitoids provide potential for native augmentative or conservation biological control of D. kuriphilus in Europe. Exploitation of this potential requires improved understanding of the taxonomy of these parasitoids, particularly of morphologically highly conserved lineages such as Eurytoma and Eupelmus in which recognised species may contain many cryptic lineages. There is a growing need for a molecular survey of the communities centered on <b>chestnut</b> and oak <b>gall</b> wasps to: (1) ascertain the identity of T. sinensis lineages released in Italy (2) track the dispersal of T. sinensis in the native community, either in its original form or as hybrids with native species (3) identify possible biological control agents in the native parasitoid community...|$|R
40|$|The <b>chestnut</b> <b>gall</b> wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu (Hymenoptera, Cynipidae) is {{considered}} as a major pest of Castanea species worldwide. A three-year monitoring of the indigenous parasitoids of this pest was performed by collecting specimens inside the galls. Each specimen was processed by molecular analysis. DNA was analysed by amplification and sequencing of the COI gene, coding for cytochrome c oxydase subunit 1. Each sequence was compared with reference sequences from adults sampled in Sardinia and those present both in GenBank and Barcode of Life Database (BOLD). This procedure enabled us to identify all immature life stages, included larvae and pupae that cannot be identified otherwise.

In order to clarify whether it is reliable to apply this method for field experiments, greenish and brown galls were collected to examine in autumn from Mt. Aburayama. Fukuoka. The results are as follows : (1) Although the ratio of galls inhabited by live parasitoids is higher in greenish galls than in brown ones, greenish galls are not always parasitized and brown galls are frequently inhabited by parasitoids. (2) Gall color is not determined by any inhabiting species of parasitoid. (3) Greenish galls tend to be smaller in size and contain fewer emergence holes. (4) Galls withered rapidly after cynipid or parasitoid wasps had emerged because they injured the gall tissue on emergence.

Dryocosmus kuriphilus galls were collected between late May and August 2014 from 11 sites in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region of North-East Italy, differing in elevation and forest cover composition. The number of parasitoids that emerged was higher than the number of D. kuriphilus specimens that emerged for 5 out of 11 sites considered. The mean number of larval chambers per gall dissected was between 1. 5 and 2. 8 (for the 11 different sites). There were no fewer than 2 – 3 specimens of parasitoids emerging per 100 galls, in all sites. The parasitoids identified belonged to five different Chalcidoidea families (Torymidae, Eupelmidae, Eurytomidae, Pteromalidae and Eulophidae). Among them, Torymidae and Eupelmidae represented approximately 90 % of the total hymenopteran parasitoids. The most represented species were Torymus flavipes (Walker), Megastigmus dorsalis (Fabricius) and Eupelmus urozonus Dalman, all indigenous parasitoids of species causing oak galls.

We determined if abandoned galls could be colonized by C. parasitica and thereby act as an entry point {{and a source of}} pathogen inoculum. Moreover we assessed the identity and diversity of other gall-colonizing fungal species. A total of 1973 galls were randomly sampled from 200 chestnut trees in eight Swiss stands. In a stand C. parasitica was isolated from 0. 4 - 19. 2 % of the galls. The incidence of C. parasitica on the galls and the fungal diversity significantly increased with the residence time of D. kuriphilus in a stand. All but one C. parasitica cultures were virulent. The predominant fungus isolated from galls was Gnomoniopsis castanea whose abundance influenced negatively that of C. parasitica. This study shows that D. kuriphilus galls can be colonized by virulent strains of the chestnut blight fungus C. parasitica. This can have effects on the chestnut blight incidence even in chestnut stands where the disease is successfully controlled by hypovirulence.

40|$|Remote sensing {{and spatial}} {{analysis}} represent useful tools for modeling species’ dispersal, characterizing {{the spread of}} invasions and the invasability of a region, and thus allowing more accurate predictions for developing mitigation strategies. American chestnut, Castanea dentata, was historically a dominant forest species in North America, but occurs only sporadically today after its functional elimination by an exotic fungal pathogen in the early 1900 ’s. In recent decades Castanea resources have increased due to restoration efforts, commercial chestnut plantations, and horticultural uses. This resurgence is threatened by an additional exotic species, the globally invasive Asian <b>chestnut</b> <b>gall</b> wasp, Dryocosmus kuriphilus. The gall wasp was first discovered in Lexington, Kentucky (USA) in 2010. We used remotely sensed data and Geographic Information Systems to describe the local distribution of the Castanea hosts, and the occurrence and dispersal of the gall wasp. We tested the hypotheses that geomorphology, Castanea occurrence, and prevailing winds influence local proliferation.

Consequently, three main classes of oenological tannins, namely gallotannins, ellagitannins and condensed tannins, could be identified and separated. The global output of the electronic tongue is quite responsive to changes in the bitterness and astringency of model quinine and alum solutions and, once calibrated (correlation coefficients of 0. 976 (p< 0. 001) and 0. 996 (p< 0. 001) respectively) could quantify their concentrations with good precision.

After an apparent initial success, the two species seem to have locked in predator-prey cycles of decadal length. We have developed a spatially explicit mathematical model that describes the seasonal time evolution of the adult insect populations, and the competition for finding egg deposition sites. In a spatially homogeneous situation the model reduces to an iterated map for the egg density of the two species. While the map would suggest, for realistic parameters, that both species should become locally extinct (somewhat corroborating the hypothesis of biological control), the full model, for the same parameters, shows that the introduction of T. sinensis sparks a traveling wave of the parasitoid population that destroys the pest on its passage. Depending on the value of the diffusion coefficients of the two species, the pest can later be able to re-colonize the empty area left behind the wave. When this occurs the two populations do not seem to attain a state of spatial homogeneity, but produce an ever-changing pattern of traveling waves...|$|R

40|$|Communities {{of insect}} herbivores and their natural enemies are rich and ecologically crucial {{components}} of terrestrial biodiversity. Understanding {{the processes that}} promote their origin and maintenance is thus of considerable interest. One major proposed mechanism is ecological speciation through host-associated differentiation (HAD), the divergence of a polyphagous species first into ecological host races and eventually into more specialized daughter species. The rich chalcid parasitoid communities attacking cynipid oak gall wasp hosts are structured by multiple host traits, including food plant taxon, host gall phenology, and gall structure. Here, we ask whether the same traits structure genetic diversity within supposedly generalist parasitoid morphospecies. We use mitochondrial DNA sequences and microsatellite genotypes to quantify HAD for Megastigmus (Bootanomyia) dorsalis, a complex of two apparently generalist cryptic parasitoid species attacking oak galls. Ancient Balkan refugial populations showed phenological separation between the cryptic species, one primarily attacking spring galls, and the other mainly attacking autumn galls. The spring species also contained host races specializing on galls developing on different host- plant lineages (sections Cerris vs. Quercus) within the oak genus Quercus. These results indicate more significant host-associated structuring within oak gall parasitoid communities than previously thought and support ecological theory predicting the evolution of specialist lineages within generalist parasitoids. In contrast, UK populations of the autumn cryptic species associated with both native and recently invading oak gall wasps showed no evidence of population differentiation, implying rapid recruitment of native parasitoid populations onto invading hosts, and hence potential for natural biological control.

2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine.

The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine.

The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.In the vineyards, there is also a growing distinction being made between [...] "ripe" [...] and [...] "unripe" [...] tannins present in the grape. This [...] "physiological ripeness", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that [...] "riper" [...] tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as [...] "softer" [...] and less tannic. This process can be accelerated by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins.|$|R
