How can I make the MTA set faster or regulate the setting time?Q MTA is used widely in endodontic treatment as a pulp capping material, root-end filling material, and perforation repair. 1 Although MTA has many favorable properties, long setting time is a clinical disadvantage. To overcome this problem many studies were performed. Hydration accelerators, such as citric acid, lactic acid, calcium chloride, and <b>calcium</b> <b>lactate</b> <b>gluconate,</b> were added during the mixing of MTA. In our previous study, hydration accelerators improved the setting time but the compressive strength decreased. 2 In the cytotoxicity test, citric acid and <b>calcium</b> <b>lactate</b> <b>gluconate</b> showed favorable biocompatibility, while calcium chloride showed lower cell viability. 3 Therefore, addition {{of these kinds of}} hydration accelerators to MTA fastens the setting time of MTA. Recently, fast setting MTA like materials, such as Biodentine, was introduced. Biodentine showed fast setting time and higher compressive strength compared to MTA. In addition, Biodentine showed good pulp response comparabl...|$|R

In in vitro experiments, GACa and MSCa stimulated the growth of B. bifidum in synthetic VLM medium. However, these substances did not stimulate, rather inhibited in part, the growth of B. bifidum in the complex medium (GAM broth). When 2. 2 mg per mouse per day of GACa or MSCa was administered to mice, and feces were assessed for anaerobic bacteria on VLM medium and for facultative anaerobic bacteria on BTB-L agar, {{there was no difference}} among the 3 groups of mice administered with or without GACa or MSCa. Colony forming units (CFU) of B. bifidum in feces of the mice drinking 2. 2 mg of MSCa was 3. 5 × 105 organisms per g of feces, a value intermediate between those drinking 2. 2 mg GACa (6. 8 × 104) and controls (3. 3 × 106).

50|$|There are {{two factors}} {{that need to}} be or can be {{adjusted}} for successful Reverse Spherification; The amount of free calcium ion and density of the liquid to be made for spherification. The amount of free calcium ion needs to be sufficient in order to form a gel-like capsule reaction with Sodium Alginate. Milk based product such as cream, yogurt or milk already has a sufficient amount of calcium. However, conducting reverse spherification with a liquid containing deficiency in calcium ion concentration, calcium salt could be added to the liquid; for example, <b>calcium</b> <b>lactate</b> <b>gluconate</b> could be added to a liquid to produce a 2% concentration in the liquid creating an effective solution for conducting reverse spherification. Calcium ion from calcium lactate is responsible for providing a gelling process without increasing the pH of the food to be too high and the gel will not melt once heating. Secondly, the density of the liquid need to be adjusted in order to allow the sufficient surface tension to form a spherical shape of this desired method. Xanthan gum can be used in order to increase the viscosity of the liquid. Usually, the concentration of Xanthan Gum ranges between 0.2% and 0.5%.|$|R

However, a satisfactory method that achieves {{this has not been}} defined, and at present somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and selective intra-arterial stimulation testing with secretin have the greatest sensitivities. As secretin is now difficult to obtain, we decided to explore the use of <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconate</b> as a secretagogue. High extracellular calcium concentrations cause degranulation of neuroendocrine cells and subsequent release of hormone. METHODS: Two patients with biochemically proven gastrinomas were investigated pre-operatively. Under angiographic control <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconate</b> was injected into the arteries supplying the pancreas and duodenum, gastrin levels were then determined in hepatic vein samples obtained before and 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 seconds after each injection. One of the patients had also previously undergone selective intra-arterial stimulation testing with secretin. RESULTS: <b>Calcium</b> <b>gluconate</b> produced sharp peaks of gastrin which unequivocally localised the tumour to a specific vascular territory in each case. Furthermore, surgery confirmed the localisations of the gastrinomas. Calcium injection, unlike secretin, into vascular territories without gastrinomas caused no rise in gastrin, thereby demonstrating calcium's greater specificity.
