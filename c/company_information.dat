25|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} as an animated film bracketed with live-action sequences. The rest would involve {{a combination of}} computer-generated visuals and back-lit animation. Lisberger planned to finance the movie independently by approaching several computer companies but had little success. However, one <b>company,</b> <b>Information</b> International Inc., was receptive. He met with Richard Taylor, a representative, and they began talking about using live-action photography with back-lit animation {{in such a way}} that it could be integrated with computer graphics. At this point, Lisberger already had a script written and the film entirely storyboarded with some computer animation tests completed. He had spent approximately $300,000 developing Tron and had also secured $4–5 million in private backing before reaching a standstill. Lisberger and Kushner took their storyboards and samples of computer-generated films to Warner Bros., MGM, and Columbia Pictures– all of which turned them down.|$|E
