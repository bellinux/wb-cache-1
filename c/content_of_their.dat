5|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to review children's books seriously and with a distinctive set of criteria. Trimmer's reviews were carefully thought out; they influenced publishers and authors to alter the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> books, helped to define the new genre of children's literature, and greatly affected the sales of children's books. The Guardian also offered the first history of children's literature; establishing a list of landmark books, which scholars still use today.|$|E
5|$|The Guayaquil conference {{took place}} on 26 July 1822. They had two private meetings, on that day and the {{following}} one. As there were no witnesses or minutes, the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> discussions can only be inferred from their later actions and their letters to other people. Some likely topics of discussion {{may have been a}} request of reinforcements, and an offer to combine the armies into a single one, with San Martín ranked second to Bolívar.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} there little social stigma {{attached}} to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities, where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes and <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorised. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 {{to the end of}} 1682 – and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively merchants sometimes took {{matters into their own hands}} and stole illicit goods back while impounded.|$|E

5|$|When {{the game}} is ready for release, the {{publisher}} sends copies of {{the final version of}} the game to the ESRB, who reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are play tested for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> games, including the potential for fines up to US $1 million and a product recall, if deemed necessary. The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete; in 2008, in response to incidents where this practice inadvertently leaked information about games that had not yet been announced, the ESRB began to allow publishers to place embargoes on the release of ratings information until a game is officially announced.|$|E

25|$|Aquatic mammals seldom dive {{beyond their}} aerobic diving limit, which {{is related to}} the {{myoglobin}} oxygen stored. The muscle mass of aquatic mammals is relatively large, so the high myoglobin <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skeletal muscles provides a large reserve. Myoglobin-bound oxygen is only released in relatively hypoxic muscle tissue, so the peripheral vasoconstriction due to the diving reflex makes the muscles ischaemic and promotes early use of myoglobin bound oxygen.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008 five paper {{companies}} in Japan {{were accused of}} misleading customers about the recycled paper <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> products. Oji Paper, the largest paper company in Japan, admitted that its copy and print paper contained 5 to 10% recycled paper, instead of the 50% stated. The president of Oji Paper apologized to its customers, {{and the president of}} Nippon Pages, the second largest paper company in Japan, resigned to take responsibility. The Japanese Fair Trade Commission said it would investigate.|$|E
25|$|As the {{business}} of UK companies becomes increasingly globalised, {{and a growing number}} of overseas businesses operate in the UK, multiple proceedings in different countries with different laws can be engaged by one insolvency. In order to regulate this in the European Union, the Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 was passed. It is essentially a conflicts of laws measure, and generally leaves member states free to determine the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own insolvency proceedings and priorities. However, it ensures that one jurisdiction will be determined to be the primary jurisdiction, and all others are secondary.|$|E

Price and Pavelich have avoided putting the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> newspapers online because that would reduce readership of their printed newspapers, and therefore reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} print advertising. While ads can be placed on Web pages, they are not as effective for clients as print advertising. They have said that if they ever find an example of a newspaper that is making a profit on its website, they would copy that approach.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Railroad Administration is {{investigating}} multiple safety issues with crude oil shipments, {{which are the}} fastest-growing hazardous material shipments by rail. On July 29, the FRA requested American Petroleum Institute members provide data on <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> crude shipments and crude oil loading practices and proposed to do its own testing if the data were not made available. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration launched a 'Bakken blitz' of inspections of North Dakota oil trains in August 2013, citing ongoing concerns about improper identification of the chemical composition and flash point of flammable cargo.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 {{when the}} Ministry of Education started its {{independent}} school program, the school again reorganized. New regulations allowed schools access to private funding and subjected them to less government regulation in the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> curricula. Renamed ACS (Independent), in 1993 the school vacated the Barker Road campus {{and moved to}} Dover Road. After strong lobbying by alumni, the Barker Road site became {{the site of a}} second secondary school. At the same time, the Anglo-Chinese Primary School abandoned its Coleman Street premises (the old building now housing the National Archives of Singapore) to share premises with the new secondary school at Barker Road, now named ACS (Barker Road).|$|E

25|$|Aside from Pentagram and Black Sabbath, {{other groups}} from the 70s would heavily {{influence}} the genre's development. Blue Cheer is often hailed {{as one of}} the first stoner metal bands. Through the use of loud amplifiers and guitar feedback, their debut Vincebus Eruptum created a template for other artists to follow. Though lacking the pessimistic lyrical <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> contemporaries, Welsh heavy metal band Budgie would also produce heavy songs which were amongst the loudest of their day, stylistically influencing various doom metal acts. Early doom metal was also influenced by Japan's Flower Travellin' Band, particularly their albums Kirikyogen and Satori. Other notable groups include Sir Lord Baltimore, Buffalo, Bang, Necromandus, Lucifer's Friend, Jacula, Iron Claw and Leaf Hound.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{economic}} calamity facing {{the nation and}} his dim hopes for re-election, Hoover faced little opposition for re-nomination at the 1932 Republican National Convention. Some Republicans talked of nominating Coolidge, former Vice President Charles Dawes, or Senator Hiram Johnson, but all passed on the opportunity to challenge Hoover. Curtis was re-nominated as Hoover's running mate. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the third ballot of the 1932 Democratic National Convention, defeating the 1928 Democratic nominee, Al Smith. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner was nominated as Roosevelt's running mate. By 1932, the radio was in 12 million homes, changing the nature of presidential campaigns. No longer could presidents change the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> speeches for each audience; anyone with a radio could listen to every major speech.|$|E
25|$|At this period, {{glass was}} sold by weight, and the typical forms were rather heavy and solid with minimal decoration. Such was its {{success on the}} {{international}} market, however, that in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax by weight. Rather than drastically reduce the lead <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as Excise glasses. In 1780, the Government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation. English labour and capital then shifted to Dublin and Belfast, and new glassworks specialising in cut glass were installed in Cork and Waterford. In 1825, the tax was renewed, and gradually the industry declined until the mid-nineteenth century, when the tax was finally repealed.|$|E

25|$|Novelists {{come from}} a variety of {{backgrounds}} and social classes, and frequently this shapes the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> works. Public reception of a novelist's work, the literary criticism commenting on it, and the novelists' incorporation of their own experiences into works and characters can lead to the author's personal life and identity being associated with a novel's fictional content. For this reason, the environment within which a novelist works and the reception of their novels by both the public and publishers can be influenced by their demographics or identity; important among these culturally constructed identities are gender, sexual identity, social class, race or ethnicity, nationality, religion, and an association with place. Similarly, some novelists have creative identities derived from their focus on different genres of fiction, such as crime, romance or historical novels.|$|E
25|$|Biafra (1970–1978) was a {{group of}} Croatian artists that rebelled against the artistic, social and {{cultural}} conventions of the day, and engaged with real problems through their art. Individual members ranged in style from pop-art and minimalism to new figuration. The sculptors of the group used new materials in their work, such as polyester, plastic, jute, aluminum, and glass wool, while the painters engaged with imaginative, expressive, rich colors. The <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> art was expressionist, clear and direct. Exhibitions and activities were organized on the streets, presenting their ideas directly to the public. The group originally consisted of the young sculptors Branko Bunić, Stjepan Gračan, Ratko Petrić and Miro Vuco. Membership expanded over the years to include Ivan Lesiak, Zlatko Kauzlarić Atač, Rudolf Labaš, Vlado Jakelić, Stanko Jančić, Ratko Janjić-Jobo, Đurđica Zanoški-Gudlin, Emil Robert Tanay.|$|E
25|$|Crematogaster brevispinosa rochai is one {{subspecies}} of ant whose {{interaction with}} N. corniger has been studied. C. b. rochai lives {{in areas of}} caatinga in Brazil. No queens of the ant {{have been found in}} the nests but their larvae of all castes and sexes have been. Nests that contain C. b. rochai do not have a termite queen in either. It can therefore be concluded that both the ants and termites are members of polydomous colonies that each have multiple nest sites. The ants and termites are segregated within the nest and do not normally come into contact with each other. C. b. rochai plug channels at the boundary of the areas they occupy to cause this segregation. On occasions when the ants and termites do come into contact with each other (e.g. if the nest is broken into) they are rarely aggressive and tend to avoid each other instead. It has been hypothesised that the hydrocarbon <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cuticles may have changed to allow them to live together relatively peacefully.|$|E
