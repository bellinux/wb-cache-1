5|$|Japan's {{population}} {{is expected to}} drop to 95 million by 2050; demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> problem. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested {{as a solution to}} provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new Japanese citizens by naturalization (帰化) per year. According to the UNHCR, in 2012 Japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement, while the United States took in 76,000.|$|E
5|$|To <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{additional}} workload, Hergé {{approached a}} friend {{whom he had}} met through Van Melkebeke, Edgar P. Jacobs, to aid him as a cartoonist and colourist. Jacobs could only work on the project part time, and so in March 1942 Hergé also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him. In July 1942, Hergé then procured an agent, Bernard Thièry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained. With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Hergé adapted most of his previous Adventures of Tintin into 62-page colour versions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Current {{software}} {{projects have}} generally {{to deal with}} producing and managing large and complex software products. It is generally believed that apply-ing software development methods are useful in <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> complexity and for supporting quality. As such numerous object-oriented software development methods have been defined. Nevertheless, methods often provide a complexity by their own due to their large number of artifacts, method rules and their com-plicated processes. We think that automation of software development methods is a valuable support for the software engineer in <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> complexity and for improving quality. This paper presents a summary and {{a discussion of the}} ideas that were raised during the workshop on automating object-oriented software development methods. ...|$|R

25|$|To survive, {{selected}} microorganisms {{can assume}} forms that {{enable them to}} withstand freezing, complete desiccation, starvation, high levels of radiation exposure, and other physical or chemical challenges. These microorganisms may survive exposure to such conditions for weeks, months, years, or even centuries. Extremophiles are microbial life forms that thrive outside the ranges where life is commonly found. They excel at exploiting uncommon sources of energy. While all organisms are composed of nearly identical molecules, evolution has enabled such microbes to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> wide range of physical and chemical conditions. Characterization of the structure and metabolic diversity of microbial communities in such extreme environments is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{wide-body}} aircraft posed {{opportunities and challenges}} for aviation. In 1971, Aer Lingus took delivery of two new Boeing 747 aircraft; the first one arrived in March and, shortly afterwards, performed a flyover above O'Connell Street in Dublin on Saint Patrick's Day; a third Boeing 747 was delivered later that decade. To <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> a new £10 million passenger terminal capable of handling six million passengers per year, which became known as Terminal 1, was opened in June 1972. The growth which was anticipated at Dublin's airport (and provided for through heavy investment by the airport and Aer Lingus) during the 1970s did not materialise immediately.|$|E

25|$|During the Spanish {{colonial rule}} within 1565 to 1898, Filipinos {{never failed to}} find a way to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> regime. During the {{colonization}} of Spain, Christianity heavily influenced the lives of Filipinos which lead to religious pieces and performances throughout the country. The most important group of plays influenced by Spain is called komedya which varies between two themes: the secular and the religious. For example, a play called Tibag which talks about the search of Elena and Constantino for the Cross of Christ is still performed in some towns. Although this religious play is still performed, the most important religious piece to this day is called the sinakulo or commonly called the passion of Christ which is usually performed during the Lenten season.|$|E
25|$|While {{opposed to}} {{interfaith}} marriage in principle, {{officials of the}} major Reform rabbinical organisation, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), estimated in 2012 {{that about half of}} their rabbis partake in such ceremonies. The need to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon – 80% of all Reform-raised Jews in the United States wed between 2000 and 2013 were intermarried – led to the recognition of patrilineal descent: all children born to a couple in which a single member was Jewish, whether mother or father, was accepted as a Jew on condition that they received corresponding education and committed themselves as such. Conversely, offspring of a Jewish mother only are not accepted if they do not demonstrate affinity to the faith. A Jewish status is conferred unconditionally only on the children of two Jewish parents.|$|E
25|$|Dosage {{compensation}} {{is the process}} by which organisms equalize the expression of genes between members of different biological sexes. Across species, different sexes are often characterized by different types and numbers of sex chromosomes. In order to account for varying numbers of sex chromosomes, different organisms have acquired unique methods to equalize gene expression amongst the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of genes, different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> inequality. Replicating the actual gene is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the expression from each gene. For example, in humans, females (XX) silence the transcription of one X chromosome of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes.|$|E
