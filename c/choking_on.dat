5|$|Dot is {{introduced}} to EastEnders soon after its launch as the gossiping, chain smoking, Christian friend of Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Lou Beale (Anna Wing) {{who works with}} Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) at the Walford launderette. She has a difficult life with a criminal husband, Charlie, and their son Nick, who appeared in the first episode. Charlie comes and goes, always treating Dot badly and stealing from her, until he dies in a lorry accident. Nick is also a criminal; he is involved in drugs, robberies and murder, and tries to cheat Dot out of her money. He attempts to poison her to inherit her bingo winnings, but is unsuccessful. Despite Nick's deeds, Dot believes he can be redeemed. Dot also associates herself as Walford's Good Samaritan, often taking in residents when they are homeless. Amongst these include Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) and Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), who becomes addicted to drugs. Dot believes that she can help Donna change for the better, but comes home one day to find Donna dead in her lounge.

25|$|Dora Bloch, a 74-year-old Israeli {{who also}} held British citizenship, {{was taken to}} Mulago Hospital in Kampala after <b>choking</b> <b>on</b> a chicken bone. After the raid she was murdered by {{officers}} of the Ugandan army, as were some of her doctors and nurses, apparently for trying to intervene. In April 1987, Henry Kyemba, Uganda's Attorney general and Minister of Justice at the time, told the Uganda Human Rights Commission that Bloch had been dragged from her hospital bed and killed by two army officers on Amin's orders. Bloch was shot and her body was dumped {{in the trunk of}} a car that had Ugandan intelligence services number plates. Her remains were recovered near a sugar plantation 20miles (32km) east of Kampala in 1979, after the Ugandan–Tanzanian War ended Amin's rule. Amin also ordered the killing of hundreds of Kenyans living in Uganda in retaliation for Kenya's assistance to Israel in the raid.|$|E
25|$|Genie's father disliked {{children}} and wanted {{none of his}} own, finding them noisy, but around five years into their marriage his wife became pregnant. This child, an apparently healthy daughter, caught pneumonia after her father found her cries disturbing and placed her in the garage, and {{died at the age}} of ten weeks. Their second child, born approximately a year later, was a boy diagnosed with Rh incompatibility who died at two days of age, either from complications of Rh incompatibility or from <b>choking</b> <b>on</b> his own mucus. Three years later they had another son, who doctors described as healthy despite also having Rh incompatibility. His father forced his wife to keep him quiet, causing significant physical and linguistic developmental delays. When he reached the age of four his maternal grandmother took over his care for several months, and he made good progress with her before she eventually returned him to his parents.|$|E

25|$|Good fortune came to {{the rescue}} when Casanova, unhappy with his lot as a musician, saved the life of a Venetian nobleman of the Bragadin family, who had a stroke while riding with Casanova in a gondola after a wedding ball. They {{immediately}} stopped to have the senator bled. Then, at the senator's palace, a physician bled the senator again and applied an ointment of mercury to the senator's chest (mercury was an all-purpose but toxic remedy of the time). The mercury raised his temperature and induced a massive fever, and Bragadin appeared to be <b>choking</b> <b>on</b> his own swollen windpipe. A priest was called as death seemed to be approaching. However, despite protests from the attending physician, Casanova ordered the removal of the ointment and the washing of the senator's chest with cool water. The senator recovered from his illness with rest and a sensible diet. Because of his youth and his facile recitation of medical knowledge, the senator and his two bachelor friends thought Casanova wise beyond his years, and concluded that he must be in possession of occult knowledge. As they were cabalists themselves, the senator invited Casanova into his household and became a lifelong patron.|$|E
25|$|In early 1865 Pai Mārire leader Te Ua Haumēne {{sent two}} prophets, Kereopa Te Rau and Patara Raukatauri, to convert East Coast tribes. Kereopa, an ageing {{veteran of the}} Waikato wars, carried with him the head of Captain P.W.J. Lloyd, {{who had been killed}} in the Ahuahu attack of April 1864 in Taranaki. Kereopa had lost his family in the bloody British raid on Rangiaowhia the {{previous}} year and blamed much of the massacre of women and children on missionary complicity, so he and his followers sought utu, or revenge, against missionaries. In Whakatane he demanded that Ngāti Awa iwi hand over the local Roman Catholic priest; without waiting for a result the pair continued on to Opotiki, where they succeeded in winning the allegiance of local Māori from the Whakatohea iwi to the Pai Mārire creeds. German-born Lutheran missionary Carl Sylvius Volkner, who had lived in Opotiki for four years, was absent in Auckland and Patara, believing the cleric was acting as a government spy, wrote him a letter stating that missionaries would henceforth not be permitted to live among Māori and ordered him not to return. Ignoring warnings that his life was in danger, Volkner sailed back to Opotiki, arriving on 1 March. The schooner was looted and Volkner and another missionary, Thomas Grace, were taken captive. The following day Volkner was hanged, then beheaded. In a church service that followed, Kereopa swallowed Volkner's eyes—momentarily <b>choking</b> <b>on</b> one of them—and passed around a chalice containing the missionary's blood for it to be consumed by his congregation. Grace remained captive for two weeks before escaping.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{arrives in}} Salem in April 2012 and bumps into Abigail Deveraux who helps him track down his half-sister, Lexie Carver at the hospital. Cameron is {{shocked to learn}} that Lexie has an {{inoperable}} brain tumor. Cameron and Abby bump into one another again when he is working {{the bar at the}} Brady pub; he explains that he sometimes helps out when they are short staffed; as Cameron and Abby tease one another, they develop an attraction. Lexie's other half-brother, Chad DiMera and his girlfriend, Melanie decide to show Cameron around and he ends up on a double date with Abby where he saves her from <b>choking</b> <b>on</b> popcorn. Meanwhile, Lexie's health continues declining and Cameron promises {{to spend more time with}} his nephew Theo before and after Lexie is gone. Celeste notices the growing closeness between Cameron and Abby, and warns Cameron that she will only cause him trouble. Despite Celeste's warnings, the two begin seeing each other and share their first kiss in late May 2012. In June 2012, Abby comforts Cameron when Lexie passes away, much to Celeste's dismay. Instead of going back home, Cameron chooses to relocate to Salem permanently, mainly to stay close Theo and Abby, despite Celeste warning him against getting involved with her. However, Abby is afraid to get too serious with Cameron believing he will eventually leave town. In early July, Cameron assures her that he is staying in Salem for several reasons, but mainly so they can be together. Cameron supports Abby when her father Jack suddenly dies. During her grief, Abby struggles with her emotions and has trouble being intimate with him. Realizing Abby needs to get help before their relationship can go any further, Cameron breaks up with her. During the holidays, Cameron and Chad bond over their memories of Lexie. Cameron later rekindles his relationship with Abby but when she admits to him that she has feelings for her ex Chad, he gives her time to choose between them, just as they both compete for Abigail's affection. On 9 August 2013, after doing a test on Chad, Cameron finds out that Chad has a brain tumor, he requests Cameron to keep it a secret, to which he agrees. Just as Abigail makes up her choice and is about to choose Cameron, he breaks things off with her and pushes her to Chad's arms.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Homerun was mixed. Sanjuro of LoveHKFilm.com {{wrote that the}} film [...] "succeeds in delivering a relatively simple, intimate story that should prove moving {{for even the most}} jaded audience", while Nick England of the San Diego Asian Film Foundation described Homerun as [...] "a film with certain beauteous qualities that we can genuinely enjoy, but end up <b>choking</b> <b>on</b> when it is all over with".

500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers <b>choking</b> <b>on</b> the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E
