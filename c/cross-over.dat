5|$|A 30 Days of Night/The X-Files <b>cross-over</b> graphic {{novel was}} {{published}} by WildStorm in 2010. It follows Mulder and Scully to Alaska as they investigate a series of grisly murders that {{may be linked to}} vampires.|$|E
5|$|Just {{beyond the}} station, to the west, are {{a pair of}} relief lines to allow slower trains to be overtaken. There are also some <b>cross-over</b> points, {{allowing}} trains to terminate on the westbound relief line and then return eastwards.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective guardrail at sharp curves, in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite directions of travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent <b>cross-over</b> collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a <b>cross-over,</b> {{drove to the}} basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E
5|$|The linear {{component}} is active when the tissue pressure exceeds ambient pressure by a given amount {{specific to the}} tissue compartment. When the tissue pressure drops below this <b>cross-over</b> criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics. During gas uptake, tissue pressure never exceeds ambient, so it is always modelled by exponential kinetics. This results in a model with the desired asymmetrical characteristics of slower washout than uptake.|$|E
5|$|There are two diamond {{crossovers}} {{near this}} station: one {{is located at}} the eastern end, for eastbound trains, and the other {{is located at the}} western end, for westbound trains. Each switch allow trains to <b>cross-over</b> between the local and express tracks in the same direction. There is a punch box located at the eastern end of the Jamaica-bound platform, allowing trains to continue along the Queens Boulevard line to 179th Street or to switch to the IND Archer Avenue Line.|$|E

The series, which premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on October 20, 1999, has aired more than 800 episodes, and has been exported to various countries around the world. Two <b>cross-over</b> episodes with the anime adaptation of Toriko were aired. The first of these, which {{was also the first}} episode of Toriko, aired on April 3, 2011. A second special, which also crossed over with Dragon Ball Z, aired on April 7, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Jason Voorhees is {{the main}} {{character}} from the Friday the 13th series. He first appeared in Friday the 13th (1980) as the young son of camp cook-turned-murderer Mrs. Voorhees, {{in which he was}} portrayed by Ari Lehman. Created by Victor Miller, with contributions by Ron Kurz, Sean S. Cunningham, and Tom Savini, Jason was not originally intended to carry the series as the main antagonist. The character has subsequently been represented in various other media, including novels, video games, comic books, and a <b>cross-over</b> film with another iconic horror film character, Freddy Krueger.|$|E
5|$|The clarinet's {{place in}} the jazz {{ensemble}} was usurped by the saxophone, which projects a more powerful sound and uses a less complicated fingering system. The requirement for an increased speed of execution in modern jazz also did not favour the clarinet, but the clarinet did not entirely disappear. A few players such as Buddy DeFranco, Tony Scott, and Jimmy Giuffre emerged during the 1950s playing bebop or other styles. A little later, Eric Dolphy (on bass clarinet), Perry Robinson, John Carter, Theo Jörgensmann, and others used the clarinet in free jazz. The French composer and clarinetist Jean-Christian Michel initiated a jazz-classical <b>cross-over</b> on the clarinet with the drummer Kenny Clarke.|$|E
5|$|The deep-level {{station was}} opened by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS, later the Bakerloo line) on 1 December 1913 as the {{temporary}} terminus of its extension from Edgware Road. To enable the BS {{to continue its}} route to the north-west of Paddington, the station platforms were constructed in a tight curve. A <b>cross-over</b> between tracks and reversing tunnels were provide beyond the new station. Construction work continued beyond the station to extend the line further to Queen's Park where it met the mainline tracks of the London and North Western Railway. The extension opened in stages, with the first trains running to and from Warwick Avenue on 31 January 1915.|$|E
5|$|When {{paying a}} state visit to Britain, foreign {{heads of state}} are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are {{allocated}} a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated {{at the foot of}} the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane. A second corridor in the suite has Gothic-influenced <b>cross-over</b> vaulting. The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle LéopoldI, first King of the Belgians. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King EdwardVIII.|$|E

25|$|The SHELL and E SHELL {{interlockings}} {{were recently}} upgraded to allow Amtrak trains to <b>cross-over</b> {{the main line}} faster and in a more orderly fashion. As a result, the tracks in New Rochelle station were rearranged so that Amtrak boards only on the outbound Metro-North platform.|$|E
25|$|For these reasons, a <b>cross-over</b> {{clinical}} trial (a test method designed to eliminate variability bias from patients, staff, cleaning efficiency, outbreaks, etc.) evaluating antimicrobial copper alloys {{was carried out}} at Selly Oak Hospital over an 18-month period in 2007–2008 by the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust and Aston University.|$|E
25|$|A taekwondo student {{typically}} wears {{a uniform}} (dobok 도복), often white but sometimes black (or other colors), with a belt tied around the waist. White uniforms {{are considered the}} traditional color and are encouraged for use at formal ceremonies such as belt tests and promotions. Colored uniforms are often reserved for special teams (such as demonstration teams or leadership teams) or higher-level instructors. There {{are at least two}} major styles of dobok, with the most obvious differences being in the style of jacket: (1) the <b>cross-over</b> front jacket (ITF style), (2) the V-neck or Y-neck jackets (no <b>cross-over)</b> typically worn by Kukkiwon/WT practitioners. White uniforms in the Kukkiwon/WT tradition will typically be white throughout the jacket (black along the collars for dan grades), while ITF-style uniforms are trimmed with a black border along the bottom of the jacket (for dan grades).|$|E
25|$|Some doom metal bands {{were also}} {{influenced}} by the underground gothic rock and post-punk scene of the 1980s, showing similarities with the dark themes addressed through lyrics and the music atmosphere, both music styles deal with. A doom metal band like Mindrot was often described as a <b>cross-over</b> between death metal and gothic rock.|$|E
25|$|Australia has {{produced}} {{a wide variety of}} rock and popular music, from the internationally renowned work of AC/DC, INXS, Nick Cave, Savage Garden, the Seekers, or pop diva's Delta Goodrem, Kylie Minogue to the popular local content of John Farnham, Jimmy Barnes or Paul Kelly. Indigenous Australian music and Australian jazz have also had <b>cross-over</b> influence on this genre.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} RNC, Palin {{quickly became a}} {{favorite}} subject of satire and derision. According to Lara Spencer, host of the tabloid show The Insider, Palin {{was part of a}} big <b>cross-over</b> between politics and pop culture in the 2008 election. During the campaign Spencer conducted the only live broadcast interview with Palin's husband, Todd Palin.|$|E
25|$|Sport utility {{vehicles}} are off-road vehicles with four-wheel drive and true off-road capability. They most often feature high ground clearance and an upright, boxy body design. Sport Utilities are typically {{defined by a}} body on frame construction which offers more off-road capability but reduced on-road ride comfort and handling compared to a <b>cross-over</b> or car based utility vehicle.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, {{the play}} {{was turned into a}} film with the {{slightly}} extended title of The Spider's Web. Glynis Johns played the part of Clarissa with none of the actors from the stage production making the <b>cross-over</b> to the film. The screenplay, adapted from Christie's text, was by Eldon Howard and direction was by Godfrey Grayson.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Marvel {{released}} a 25-issue series called Darth Vader (2015), {{which focused on}} the title character {{in the aftermath of}} the destruction of the Death Star, as well as his life after learning about the existence of his son, the series happens parallel to the comic series Star Wars (2015) and has a <b>cross-over</b> with it titled Vader Down.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder and {{centerline}} rumble strips {{are used}} to reduce lane departure crashes. Centerline rumble strips are used on undivided highways to reduce <b>cross-over</b> incidents and resultant head-on collisions. Shoulder rumble strips are used primarily to reduce run-off-road collisions. They alert distracted or drowsy drivers that they are leaving the roadway or crossing the centerline of the road. In this application, they are narrower {{and outside of the}} wheelpaths.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} sciences, {{and more}} particularly in artificial intelligence these mean field type genetic algorithms {{are used as}} random search heuristics that mimic {{the process of evolution}} to generate useful solutions to complex optimization problems. These stochastic search algorithms belongs to the class of Evolutionary models. The idea is to propagate a population of feasible candidate solutions using mutation and selection mechanisms. The mean field interaction between the individuals is encapsulated in the selection and the <b>cross-over</b> mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s {{bands and}} artists {{appeared}} who functioned as <b>cross-over</b> acts between the indie rock and folk scenes. Their music often utilised traditional instruments, sometimes beside electronic music. London's nu-folk scene included artists like Laura Marling, Noah and the Whale, Mumford & Sons and Johnny Flynn {{and that in}} Scotland, centred on Glasgow and with a more Celtic tinge, included artists such as Findlay Napier and the Bar Room Mountaineers and Pearl and the Puppets.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} alleged, {{that reduces the}} {{effectiveness}} of cable barriers, is the installation below grade, especially around slopes or dips. Without any compensation for a slope in the median, a car can actually jump {{the top of a}} barrier, and therefore be exposed to a potential <b>cross-over</b> collision. Litigation has arisen in Arizona regarding the improper installation of cable barriers. One wrongful death suit resulted in a one million dollar settlement with the state. In Washington state, numerous letters were submitted to the state Department of Transportation complaining of cable barrier installation.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} arrival of {{affordable}} digital cameras, the development of more compact and affordable digital video cameras has made them more attractive and accessible to the birding community. <b>Cross-over,</b> non-linear digital models now exist that take high quality stills at acceptable resolutions, as well as being able to record and play audio and video. The ability to easily capture and reproduce not only the visual characteristics of a bird, but also its patterns of movement and its sound, has wide applications for birders in the field.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time Starlin was writing these graphic novels and tie-ins, the {{character}} also appeared in New Avengers #23-24 (Oct-Nov 2014), Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, #18-20 (Oct-Dec 2014), Legendary Star-Lord #4 (Dec 2014), a six-issue miniseries titled Thanos: A God Up There Listening (Dec 2014), Avengers vol. 5, #40-41 (Mar-Apr 2015), and Deadpool vol. 3, #45 ("#250") (Jun 2015).

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{original}} Smart Fortwo, a sporty Smart Roadster, a limited production of 2000 erstwhile concept Smart Crossblade and a supermini Smart Forfour were also offered. These have now been discontinued. There were also plans to introduce the French made <b>cross-over</b> based {{on the body of}} the ForFour and the AWD hardware of the Mercedes C-class with the name of Formore but industrialization of this was cancelled at the 11th hour (even as tooling was being installed in the assembly plant) due to unfavourable exchange rate swings and spending cutbacks driven by losses elsewhere within Smart.|$|E
25|$|The {{fictional world}} in which the Quest for Glory series takes place {{includes}} the town of Spielburg (based on German folklore), the desert city of Shapeir (based on the Arabia of One Thousand and One Nights), the jungle city of Tarna (based on African mythology, especially Egypt), the hamlet of Mordavia (based on Slavic mythology) and Silmaria (based on Greek mythology). Adventures, monsters and story of the games are usually drawn from legends of the respective mythology on which a title is based, although there are several <b>cross-over</b> exceptions, like the Eastern European Baba Yaga also appearing in the first game, which is distinctly German.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{incarnation of}} an organized football team in Kingston is the Kingston Granites which {{played in the}} predecessor league to the Canadian Football League, the Ontario Rugby Football Union, (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the Ottawa Rough Riders 8-0. Kingston also hosted the 10th Grey Cup on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston {{and the surrounding area}} in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and <b>cross-over</b> games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.|$|E
25|$|The {{fate of the}} Ukrainians was far {{different}} under the Austrian Empire where they found themselves in the pawn position of the Russian-Austrian power struggle for the Central and Southern Europe. Unlike in Russia, most of the elite that ruled Galicia were of Austrian or Polish descent, with the Ruthenians being almost exclusively kept in peasantry. During the 19th century, Russophilia was a common occurrence among the Slavic population, but the mass exodus of Ukrainian intellectuals escaping from Russian repression in Eastern Ukraine, {{as well as the}} intervention of Austrian authorities, caused the movement to be replaced by Ukrainophilia, which would then <b>cross-over</b> into the Russian Empire. With the start of World War I, all those supporting Russia were rounded up by Austrian forces and held in a concentration camp at Talerhof where many died.|$|E
25|$|Dani California debuted {{at number}} 24 and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 ({{remaining}} {{for two weeks}} at that position) and it's the 2nd song to debut at number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart after R.E.M. in 1994 and before Linkin Park in 2007, remaining at the location for 14 weeks. The song also managed to achieve 28,000 units of digital sales in the song's first week of release and debuted at number 16 on the Hot Digital Songs chart. In the UK, the song fared even better, finding itself at the number 2 spot for one week, and eventually remaining on that chart for over 15 weeks. It also stayed 12 weeks at number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song also became a <b>cross-over</b> hit to pop and adult contemporary radio peaking number 5 on the Adult Top 40 chart, their 1st Top 5 and Top 10 single on the chart beating Scar Tissue and Otherside both at #11. The song also hit number 25 on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.|$|E
