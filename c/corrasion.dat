50|$|Attrition {{occurs when}} waves cause loose pieces of rock debris (scree) {{to collide with}} each other, {{grinding}} and chipping each other, progressively becoming smaller, smoother and rounder. Scree also collides with {{the base of the}} cliff face, chipping small pieces of rock from the cliff or have a <b>corrasion</b> (abrasion) effect, similar to sandpapering.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corrasion</b> or {{otherwise}} known as abrasion occurs when waves break on cliff faces and slowly erode it. As the sea pounds cliff faces it also uses the scree from other wave actions to batter and break off pieces of rock from higher up the cliff face {{which can be used}} for this same wave action and attrition.|$|E
50|$|Helicoidal flow is a {{contributing}} factor {{to the formation of}} slip-off slopes and river cliffs in a meandering section of the river. The helicoidal motion of the flow aids the processes of hydraulic action and <b>corrasion</b> {{on the outside of the}} meander, and sweeps sediment across the floor of the meander towards the inside of the meander, forming point bar deposits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corrasion</b> is a geomorphological {{term for}} the process of {{mechanical}} erosion of the earth's surface caused when materials are transported across it by running water, waves, glaciers, wind or gravitational movement downslope. An example is the wearing away of rock on a river or seabed by the impact or grinding action of particles moving with the water. The resultant effect on the rock is called abrasion.|$|E
50|$|Bratschen are {{weathering}} {{products that}} {{occur as a}} result of frost and aeolian <b>corrasion</b> almost exclusively on the calc-schists of the Upper Slate Mantle (Obere Schieferhülle) in the High Tauern mountains of Austria. The term is German but is used untranslated in English sources. It may be the equivalent of the New Zealand climbers' term 'weet-bix' for a rock that disintegrates easily and so is difficult to climb on.|$|E
50|$|Andrews wrote three {{important}} {{papers on the}} theory of erosion, including <b>Corrasion</b> by gravity streams.

Andrews {{was president of the}} Royal Society of New South Wales in 1921; president of the Linnean Society of New South Wales in 1937 and president of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science (A.N.Z.A.A.S.) 1930-32. In 1928, he was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales and in 1931 he was awarded the Lyell Medal by the Geological Society of London.|$|E
5000|$|The “Roter Sand“ {{lighthouse}} (German transl. “red sand“) {{is located}} in the [...] "Outer-Weser" [...] waterway in the German Bight, southern North Sea. At the end of the 1950s the lighthouse had been badly damaged by corrosion, <b>corrasion,</b> and leaching of its concrete. To replace the old lighthouse, the “Alte Weser” was built in the years 1961-1964 not far from the former location. Simultaneously, the conditions for the ships' traffic in the [...] "Outer-Weser" [...] waterway were intended to be improved and the new lighthouse was planned to be established as an offshore part of the radar chain on the Weser between Bremen and the North Sea (Fig. 1).|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic {{action is}} the erosion {{that occurs when}} the motion of water against a rock surface {{produces}} mechanical weathering. Most generally, it {{is the ability of}} moving water (flowing or waves) to dislodge and transport rock particles. Within this rubric are a number of specific erosional processes, including abrasion, attrition, <b>corrasion,</b> saltation, and scouring (downcutting). Hydraulic action is distinguished from other types of water facilitated erosion, such as static erosion where water leaches salts and floats off organic material from unconsolidated sediments, and from chemical erosion more often called chemical weathering.It is a mechanical process, in which the moving water current flows against the banks and bed of a river, thereby removing rock particles.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic action {{takes place}} when {{air in a}} joint is {{suddenly}} compressed by a wave closing {{the entrance of the}} joint. This then cracks it. Wave pounding is when the sheer energy of the wave hitting the cliff or rock breaks pieces off. Abrasion or <b>corrasion</b> is caused by waves launching seaload at the cliff. It is the most effective and rapid form of shoreline erosion (not to be confused with corrosion). Corrosion is the dissolving of rock by carbonic acid in sea water. Limestone cliffs are particularly vulnerable to this kind of erosion. Attrition is where particles/seaload carried by the waves are worn down as they hit each other and the cliffs. This then makes the material easier to wash away. The material ends up as shingle and sand. Another significant source of erosion, particularly on carbonate coastlines, is the boring, scraping and grinding of organisms, a process termed bioerosion.|$|E
5000|$|A primary {{example of}} {{hydraulic}} {{action is a}} wave striking a cliff face which compresses the air in cracks of the rocks. This exerts pressure on the surrounding rock which can progressively crack, break, splinter and detach rock particles. This {{is followed by the}} decompression of the air as the wave retreats which can occur suddenly with explosive force which additionally weakens the rock. Cracks are gradually widened so each wave compresses more air, increasing the explosive force of its release. Thus, the effect intensifies in a 'positive feedback' system. Over time, as the cracks may grow they sometimes form a sea cave. The broken pieces that fall off produce two additional types of erosion, abrasion (sandpapering) and attrition. In <b>corrasion,</b> the newly formed chunks are thrown against the rock face. Attrition is a similar effect caused by eroded particles after they fall to the sea bed where they are subjected to further wave action. In coastal areas wave hydraulic action is often the most important form of erosion.Similarly, where hydraulic action is strong enough to loosen sediment along a stream bed and its banks; this will take rocks and particles from the banks and bed of the stream and add this to the stream's load. This process is the result of friction between the moving water and the static stream bed and banks. This friction increases with the speed of the water and the roughness of the bed. Once loosened the smaller particles are actually held in suspension by the force of the flowing water, these suspended particles can scour the sides and bottom of the stream. The scouring action produces distinctive markings on streams beds such as ripple marks, fluting, and crescent marks. The larger particles and even large rocks are scooted (dragged) along the bottom in a process known as traction which causes attrition, and are often [...] "bounced" [...] along in a process known as saltation where the force of the water temporarily lifts the rock particle which then crashes back into the bed dislodging other particles.|$|E
40|$|The taphonomic {{analysis}} {{conducted on}} ammonoid assemblages has proven useful for palaeobiological and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions in upper Middle-to-lower Upper Oxfordian epicontinental deposits of the Internal Prebetic (southern Spain). Taphonic populations close to type I indicate the proximity, even coincidence, of life areas for neritic ammonites (i. e. parautochthonous assemblages). The relationships among preservation mode, shell size, within-bed position, <b>corrasion,</b> fragmentation, and epibionts (encrustment included), with lumpy-oncolitic and condensed & bioclasts-rich lumpy-oncolitic limestones {{allows us to}} typify two taphofacies. Taphofacies I shows higher values of mean shell size, <b>corrasion,</b> epibionts and encrustments, {{as well as a}} high number of specimens in quasi-horizontal settlement. The opposite characteristics serve to identify Taphofacies II. Taphonomic features, taphofacies and lithofacies combine in coherence with progressing third-order transgressive-to-highstand system-tract conditions and the resulting ecostratigraphic trends, which are registered by fluctuations in ammonite assemblages. </p...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic land {{surfaces}} in South Victoria Land, all without a covering of vegetation, are actively formed by winds which often reach velocities {{of more than}} 100 km/h. Consequently, deflation and abrasion are essential factors {{in the process of}} slope formation. Water erosion, active only during the very short summer period, is limited to a few localities in South Victoria Land. Experiments in a wind tunnel proved that ventifacts in the Dry Valleys can be formed within a few decades or at the most, a few centuries. Yearly <b>corrasion</b> rates average around a maximum of a few millimeters. Considerable variability is caused by the different exposures of ventifacts within the micro relief end the varying resistance of the rocks. The importance of ice crystals (snow) for abrasion processes should not be overestimated...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} encompasses two studies: one developing {{virtual field}} trips for mobile devices for an innovative approach to lower-division geoscience education, {{and the other}} examining the role of rock strength in river erosion and landscape evolution. The education study involves the development of three virtual field trip modules (Geologic Time, Geologic Structures, and Hydrologic Processes, all free on iTunes and Google Play) that lead students down a virtual Colorado River through Grand Canyon by physically moving around their campus quad, football field or other location, using their GPS-equipped smart phone or tablet. As students reach each location in the scaled down and geo-referenced virtual Grand Canyon, an informative video appears with a themed geological question and an interactive touchscreen activity. The effectiveness of these three modules in terms of student engagement and learning was tested at five U. S. Colleges {{with a range of}} missions and student demographics. Results show that the virtual field trip modules are effective at increasing student interest across races and genders in the geosciences, do not detract from student learning, and have the potential to increase content comprehension. The second study is the examination of the relation between rock strength and topography in the Colorado Plateau. This work contributes empirical data to the age-old debate over the mechanisms and patterns of stream erosion through statistical relations between rock strength and stream power, river steepness, and valley width along the Green-Colorado River system. Estimates of an “effective” tensile strength were calculated for units too incompetent to test directly, such as the shales prevalent in the region. Results indicate bedrock strength is a first-order control on river erosion in this landscape, as suggested by John Wesley Powell in 1896 : “where the rocks are firm and stable, <b>corrasion</b> [sic] of the stream is slow; where the rocks are soft, <b>corrasion</b> [sic] is more rapid,” which is intuitive yet frequently overlooked...|$|E
40|$|For a {{brief period}} about a century ago, reputable {{scientists}} gave credence {{to the idea that}} wind was capable of regional planation. Among them was J. T. Jutson, whose publications exerted considerable influence both in Australia and overseas. He differentiated between deflation and <b>corrasion</b> (sand-blasting) and in 1914 attributed major as well as minor landscape features to their activity. He ascribed the westward migration of salinas and the shaping of associated rock platforms to the wind {{as well as to the}} extension of valleys that were incised into the lateritised Old Plateau and that coalesced to form the New Plateau of Western Australia. But local and overseas colleagues drew his attention to the primacy of rivers in shaping even desert landscapes, and by 1934 Jutson had realised that running water was almost solely responsible for the New Plateau.

40|$|Albeit {{under various}} names (footcave, slot, cliff-foot cave, shelter, notch) basal indents form in various lithological and climatic environments. But footcaves in {{crystalline}} limestone are especially well and widely developed, {{not only in}} marine environments, but also inland. In the humid tropics, footcaves and swamp slots are associated with surface and shallow groundwaters charged with chemicals and biota. The indents developed around the bases of widely separated karst towers are responsible for their conversion from cupolas or domical residuals. Even in mature tower karst landscapes, some arcuate footcaves are shaped by laterally corrading streams in flood that have transported and deposited exotic debris. Such <b>corrasion</b> is, however, particularly widespread in youthful karst where valley floors are narrow. Here, footcaves not only may have been initiated, but also occasionally maintained, enhanced, and modified by migrating streams, {{as well as by}} scarp-foot weathering and sapping. Microorganisms that colonize moist walls of footcaves may also have contributed. Roy Charles McDonald, C. Rowland Twidal...|$|E
40|$|Dominated by {{specific}} eco-hydrogeological backgrounds, a small watershed delineated {{by using the}} traditional method is always inauthentic in karst regions because it cannot accurately reflect the eco-hydrological process of the dual structure of the surface and subsurface. This study proposes a new method for the delineation of small watersheds based on digital elevation models (DEMs) and eco-hydrogeological principles in karst regions. This method is applied to {{one section of the}} tributary area (Sancha River) of the Yangtze River in China. By comparing the quantity, shape, superimposition, and characteristics of the internal hydrological process of a small watershed extracted by using the digital elevation model with that extracted by using the proposed method of this study, we conclude that the small karst watersheds extracted by the new method accurately reflect the hydrological process of the river basin. Furthermore, we propose that the minimum unit of the river basin in karst regions should be the watershed, whose exit is the corrosion and <b>corrasion</b> baselevel and a further division of watershed may cause a significant inconsistency with the true eco-hydrological process...|$|E
40|$|A tubiferous cirripede Tetraclitella judiciae sp. nov., {{previously}} {{known only}} from two isolated and incomplete shell wall plates identified as Tetraclitella sp. cf. T. purpurascens (Wood, 1815), is described {{from the early}} Miocene of Victoria, Australia; a further taxon, Tetraclitella purpurascens miocenica subsp. nov., occurs in the late Miocene-Pliocene of Victoria, and specimens from the early Miocene of New Zealand, previously recorded as Tetraclitella sp. cf. T. purpurascens (Wood, 1815) are redesignated as Tetraclitella nodicostata sp. nov. Tetraclitella is the first cirripede genus known to have had tubiferous walls. Incorporation of chitinous stringers within the shell wall of early tetraclitids (e. g. Epopella) may have facilitated {{the development of the}} tubiferous shell wall, which permitted sessile barnacles to maximise the shell strength to calcite ratio: in doing so, these chitinous stringers not only reduced the diversion of energy required to extract calcium carbonate from seawater, but improved the effectiveness of the shell wall in resisting predators. It is also argued here that the presence of chitin within the shell increased resistance to both <b>corrasion</b> and corrosion, the latter becoming an increasing problem for calcareous shelled organisms following a drop in the pH of seawater after the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePediments {{are very}} flat and smooth erosive surfaces, {{connected}} to higher relief by a scarp, that covers up totwo {{thirds of the}} Earth’s surface. A physical mechanism to explain their formation remains elusive. Commonlyaccepted hypotheses include: (1) the widening of an incised river network (lateral <b>corrasion</b> of Gilbert, 1877), (2) sheetflow erosion, (3) subsurface weathering and exhumation (Strudley et al, 2006) and (4) slope retreat, usuallyat the base of an escarpment (King, 1949), potentially helped by flexural isostatic rebound (Pelletier, 2010). Herewe explore the third hypothesis, which we believe applies mostly in regions characterised by intense rainfall wheredeep weathering profiles are commonly observed. In this study, using a new coupled model of groundwater flow and surface erosion, we highlight the criticalimpact of the geometry of the water table and of the unsaturated zone within a weathering profile to explain itsevolution through time. The model is calibrated and used to explain the formation of pediments as the product ofa dynamical balance between weathering front propagation and surface erosion. We also explore the effects ofabrupt changes in rainfall intensity and base level drop on the geometry of the predicted pediments...|$|E
40|$|Botanical {{studies of}} rock streams {{on the western}} half of Rich Mountain and on the north slope of Mt. Magazine in Arkansas {{question}} the common presumption that such streams require periglacial conditions to form, and are now inactive relict features in this area. Trees along {{the margins of the}} streams examined show abundant evidence of trauma resulting from Late Holocene movement, in the form of bent and tilted stems. Cross sections of trees demonstrate marked eccentric growth associated with tilting and cambial trauma associated with <b>corrasion</b> by rocks. That this damage is not the result of excessive snow loading is indicated by the lack of such stressed trees away from the stream margins. Stressed growth and shortened lifespan of trees on the Rich Mountain rock stream margins is shown by the small diameter (less than 15 cm) of most, while older and larger trees are found on higher slopes away from the stream. These rock streams are indicated to be moving, active features, not stabilized relicts of the Pleistocene. Further study would permit more testing of this hypothesis and the establishment of a chronology of movements in the last century...|$|E
40|$|Flow-parallel linear ridge–runnel (R–R) bedforms {{composed}} of mainly cohesive sediments {{have been investigated}} at an intertidal site located at Hills Flats in the Severn Estuary, UK. It is argued that the sequences of sand–mud laminae in the ridge sediments indicate strongly that R–R are depositional bedforms. Faint R–R topography scoured in the underlying soft bedrock and parallel rows of coarser particle now found {{at the base of}} ridges are evidence of secondary vortices that may have provided a catalyst for mud ridge growth. Bed shear stress remains below the erosion threshold for all but the most recent and weak surficial mud deposits which are removed by evorsion [mechanical erosion by turbulent flows that may also carry sand and/or gravel] during Spring tidal flow ca. 60 cm/s. Differences in flow characteristics between ridges and runnel are minor. <b>Corrasion</b> [to erode or be eroded by abrasion] by sparse coarse sediment largely prevents net deposition in the runnels. Over time a slight imbalance between mud deposition and erosion rates allows slow growth of the ridges suggesting that these mudflats may be especially sensitive to slight changes in the local hydrodynamic regime and/or sediment suppl...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 5065 {{specimens}} (5018 valves of bivalve and 47 gastropod shells) {{have been identified}} and classified into 27 species from 55 samples collected from raised glaciomarine and estuarine sediments, and glacial tills. The bivalves Hiatella arctica, Mya truncate, Astarte borealis, and Serripes groenlandicus {{are the most common}} species. Our samples record the dominance of infaunal suspension-feeders that are most abundant on soft substrates typically occurring in nearshore environments. The dominance of bivalves with respect to gastropods reflects an averaged record of the fossil assemblages inhabiting the high latitude nearshore environments. Six unique associations, which are comparable to the composition of modern communities inhabiting in fiords and on continental shelf from Canadian high arctic, and three distinctive taxa groups (deposit feeders, suspension-feeders, and rare taxa) are recognized by cluster analysis and Multidimensional Scaling conducted on presence-absence data. The trophic composition of paleocommunities in this study is as follows: suspension-feeders > deposit feeders > carnivores > browsers. The occurrence of Mya pseudoarenaria in fossil assemblages indicates an age of the fossils around early Holocene. Most of the samples are not substantially transported nor significantly reworked. Shell disarticulation and fragmentation can result from sea ice scouring of the seafloor and the development of permafrost in raised marine sediments. The degree of shell disarticulation for the four most common taxa is generally low which likely reflects high sedimentation rates and rapid burial in nearshore environments, especially those from glaciomarine silts and estuarine deposits. Four common species exhibit different preservation potential based the degree of fragmentation and disarticulation (Serripes < Mya < Hiatella < Astarte). Shells with high (or low) degree of fragmentation for single species (i. e. Hiatella) also correspond to different energy conditions of the associated sediments facies from which the shells are recovered. The general absence of strongly bioeroded or encrusted shells among samples suggests rapid burial of the shells with only limited exposure on the sediment surface, or the absence of grazing, boring or encrusting taxa in the environment that is dominated by infaunal habit of most of the taxa represented in the shell assemblages. Four taphofacies are recognized by cluster analysis on the basis of four taphonomic variables (fragmentation, <b>corrasion,</b> bioerosion, and encrustation) characterized by poor preservation, fair preservation, fair-good preservation, and fair preservation with poor <b>corrasion</b> respectively. Faunal succession and paleo-marine environments during the deglaciation in early Holocene are reconstructed from the seven sedimentation facies (glacial, beaches, shallow marine, proglacial, shallow marine or estuarine - pebbly sand and gravel with algal debris, shallow marine or estuarine - pebbly silt with algal debris, shallow marine or estuarine - interbedded silt and sand) ...|$|E
40|$|An annular {{laboratory}} flume {{was used}} to investigate the effect of mobile cockle shells on the erosion of a cohesive sediment bed. A standard clay bed was created and shells of differing sizes placed upon it. Flow in the flume was increased in increments and the onset of motion and transport pattern of the cockles was monitored. The release of bed material to the water column was monitored and compared to releases {{in the absence of}} shells (due only to the flow). The shells moved in traction; firstly as surface load (dragging) and then by rolling. The motion of the shells was found to be directly related to their motion settling rate in still water. The fluid induced stresses were unable to cause any detectable erosion of the bed. The addition of even single shells induced significant erosion. The erosion was found {{to be the result of}} abrasion rather than <b>corrasion,</b> as the shells never entered into saltation. There was a linear increase in erosion rate with increasing shell size, and an exponential increase in the suspended sediment concentration with time. The presence of large numbers of cockle shells in areas such as Southampton water and Lymington have suggested that the processes investigated here may be responsible for the erosion regimes in these areas...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT – Qualitative and {{quantitative}} taphonomic {{data for the}} freshwater mollusk shells from death assemblages found in straight and meandering fluvial channels of the Touro Passo Stream, southern Brazil, are here presented. A total of 245 gastropod and 485 bivalve shells were collected and analyzed. Complete valves, showing small chipped margins, dominated the studied shell material. The periostracum was present in {{the great majority of}} the mollusk shells, and the ligament was preserved in more than 50 % of the studied bivalves. Gastropod shells were intensively (50 % to 80 %) encrusted by periphyton and Potamolithus egg capsules. <b>Corrasion</b> {{is one of the main}} taphonomic signatures exhibited by the mollusk shells, and are represented by small to large pits and holes found in the internal and external shell surfaces. Some evidences indicate that these were acquired soon after death or even during life. Clearly, the presence/absence and the degree of taphonomic alteration of the shells were mediated by intrinsic factors. Some life habits make difficult the determination of post-mortem nature of some taphonomic signatures. In addition, taphonomic signatures do not vary predictably in shells from thanatocoenoses found in the straight or meandering channels. In part, this is due to the reworking of the Pleistocene mollusk shells from fossil-rich layers found in the sandstones of point bar deposits of the meandering channel. Some qualitative {{and quantitative}} data are very similar to those found in shells from muddy, organic rich marine bottoms, where acid conditions prevail. In fact, dissolution seems to be the main taphonomic process affecting the shells from the Touro Passo Stream assemblages...|$|E
40|$|The {{operator}} {{effect is}} a well-known analytical bias already quantified in some taphonomic studies. However, the influence of operator bias in the replicability on taphonomic studies has still not been considered. Here, we quantified {{for the first time}} this bias using different multivariate statistical techniques, testing if the operator effect is related to the replicability. We analyzed the results reported by 15 operators working on the same dataset. Each operator analyzed 30 bioclasts (bivalve shells) by site, from a total of five sites, considering the following taphonomic attributes: shell fragmentation, edge rounding, <b>corrasion,</b> bioerosion, and color alteration. The operator effect followed the same pattern reported in previous studies, characterized by a worse correspondence for those attributes having more than two levels of damage categories. However, the effect did not appear to have relation to replicability, because nearly all operators found differences among sites. The binary attribute bioerosion exhibited 83 % of correspondence among operators, but at the same time, it was the taphonomic attribute that showed the highest dispersion among operators (28 %). Therefore, we concluded that binary attributes, despite indicating a reduction of the operator effect diminishes replicability, result in different interpretations of concordant data. We found that a variance value of nearly 8 % among operators was enough to generate a different taphonomic interpretation, in a Q-mode cluster analysis. The results reported here showed that the statistical method employed influences the level of replicability and comparability of a study and that the availability of results may be a valid alternative to reduce bias...|$|E

Two steep interplain {{reaches of the}} channel have been eut up to 100 m through volcanogenic turbidites of probable La te Pleistocene age. Near-bottom observations with side-scan sonars and profllers across the upper channels (at 59 ° 242 ̆ 7 N, 18 ° 502 ̆ 7 W, 2 750 m depth) and at the lower interplain channel (around 56 ° 232 ̆ 7 N, 24 ° 252 ̆ 7 W, 3 340 m depth) defmed their structure and morphology. The upper channels, and a tributary to the lower channel, start as broad, shallow depressions that deepen and narrow downstream.

Several hundred bottom photographs show well-indurated rocks on channel walls and floors, with such flysch-like characteristics as cyclic graded bedding, clastic dikes, and syndepositional deformation.

Bedrock erosion in and around the channels bas proceeded by intense <b>corrasion</b> and fluid stressing, and is marked by such small-scale effects as rock polishing, fluting, pot-holing and ledge recession.

40|$|Within {{the coastal}} super system {{there are the}} two main systems of the cliff and the {{foreshore}} and thirdly, but at a lower hierarchical level, the coastline system. The forms of and processes shaping each of these physical features are analysed quantitatively. Instrumented sites {{have been set up}} for the measurement of rates of erosion of the shore platform, of other foreshore features, and of the cliff foot over a longer period than has so far been possible. A section of cliff has also been instrumented. An original technique for the analysis of coastline morphology is described. Bays that are fundamentally arcuate, triangular, or rectangular are associated with different extranous factors, the first particularly with a bare cliff foot or a sand or pebble beach, the second with a boulder beach or geological heterogeneity and the third with glacial deposits. The c 1 iff consists of any combination of the elements termed the sandstone scarp, the bevel, and the marine-activated cliff. The bevel results from protection of the cliff foot by talus cones and boulder beaches. It is concluded that bevelled cliffs are in dynamic equilibrium though relaxation time is long, leading to continuous changes in form. A cliff consisting of the marine-activated element only is probably a steady-state feature and is associated with a bare cliff foot or one which has a sand or pebble beach. The shore platform may include any combination of two elements, the ramp and the plane, the former being steeper than 2. 5 degrees and shaped by the <b>corrasion</b> of the overlying debris. The sub-horizonta 1 ity of the plane is a product of secondary erosive processes - mainly expansion and contraction of the shale due to wetting and drying in tidal and intertidal periods. The resistance of boulder beaches is increased if the boulders become imprisoned. Boulders partly embedded in the shore platform may remain perched when this feature is lowered. In the base of talus cones conglomerate can be formed in less than 200 years. Therefore the nature of the cliff foot is the principal regulator in the coast su rsystem but superficial deposits undergo erosion so this regulator and the supersystem continuously change. Measurements of erosion rates show that it is incorrect to hypothesise that some of the coastal landforms have been inherited from Pleistocene times...|$|E
40|$|The fourth {{wintering}} {{party of}} JARE made a survey {{trip to the}} Yamato (Queen Fabiola) Mountains. The fifth wintering party traversed the inland of Lutzow-Holm Bay south to 75 ° in Latitude, {{and on the way}} back to Syowa Station they visited the mountains for the geomorphological survey. A part of the results obtained in 1960 was already reported (YOSHIDA, 1961). In this parer the geomorphology of the mountains is described, based on the observations made in 1960 and in 1961. The Yamato Mountains consist of seven relatively small massifs and several nunataks and form an arcuate mountain chain which extends over 50 kilometers from north to south. These massifs and nunataks are composed of plutonics and metamorphics such as gneisses and granites, and strikes of their foliations are conformable to the arrangement of the massifs. The inland ice differs in its elevation on both sides of the mountain arc, being dammed up by the mountains and detected subglacial rises. This difference of ice levels continues in a form of rather gentle ice cliff south to the Belgica Mountains and suggests the existence of a great structural feature such as fault block mountains under the vast inland ice. A few reversed faults were found at the foot of the D Massif. These were presumably related to the development of the mountains. Shear zones and joint systems rather perpendicular to the strikes of foliations are also considered to have conditioned the formation of limbs of the massifs. It is quite possible to conceive that the courses of outlet glaciers which drain the inland ice through the mountains from ESE to NW were subsequent to depressions of tectonic origin. That is also suggested by the fact that the geological structures of the massifs slightly differ from each other. Therefore, the mountain is a kind of arcuate fault blocks. The mountains have been subjected to glacial erosion by inland ice and small detached ice masses. The glaciation of inland ice, however, has produced rather flat and gentle slopes, depositting morainic debris in some places. On the other hand, glacial erosion by outlet glaciers, cirque glaciers, or drift-snow ice has been acting so as to sculpture steep slopes and cirques. The massifs were once covered by the inland, ice nearly up to there summits, because erratic boulders and glacially polished surfaces are found at and near the summits. It has been often advocated that the formation of cirques in the Antarctic antedates the maximum ice flood period (TAYLOR, 1922; GOULD, 1940). In the Yamato Mountains, however, some cirques were gouged on surfaces eroded by former inland ice or outlets. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that at least some of them were formed after the retreat of inland ice, though it is impossible to discern preglacial features of the mountains. The former inland ice, at least by 400 meters on the east side and by 600 meters on the west side of the mountains higher than the present level, commenced to retreat at an unknown time and, then, were transformed into characteristic shapes of outlet glaciers in consequence of cropping out of bare rocks in the mountain region. As stated before, the tectonic depressions might be chosen as the courses of the outlets, and glacial <b>corrasion</b> of the outlets scooped out parts of rather flat surfaces formed by the inland ice, producing precipitous landforms discordant to them. During the shrinking period of the inland ice, ice masses composed of drifting snow and relics of inland ice; occupying locations on mountain slopes favourable to deposition of snow and ice, scoopad out cirques. The cirques have not so peculiar features as typical ones in temparate regions, though polished surfaces and ground moraines on their bottoms show that glacial scouring took part in the formation of the cirques. No bargschrund could be found anywhere. This fact appears to indicate that in the Antarctic nivation and sapping are rather weaker in the formation of cirques than glacial <b>corrasion.</b> Many types of cirque glaciers are found on the mountains. Three cirque glaciers an located at positions favourable to be nourished by drift snow and the accumulations are now exceeding over whole surfaces of the glaciers But two cirque glaciers composed of blue ice on almost flat surfaces show negative regimen The others have both accumulation and ablation areas, but two of them have shrinking ice tongues already detached from the inland ice. The regimen of each ice mass is affected by locations and features of ice masses in such a manner as mentioned above, and might have been changed also with the progress of lowering of the ice level. There are some vacant cirques, surrounded by ragged peaks, where the nourishments of ice have ceased in consequence of the lowering of the ice level. Small outlets have also been abandoned by ice. Most of the surfaces of the inland ice on the east side of the mountains are covered with drifted snow layer, but on the west-leeward-side there is a rather narrow blue ice area. In other words, snow accumulation exceeds on the windward side of the mountains and the leeward side is the ablation region. It is not clear whether stagnant stages existed during the shrinking period of the inland ice. The flat surfaces in two different heights, interrupted by steep cliffs, in the D Massifs have been developed apparently by glacial <b>corrasion</b> of the inland ice. Two cirques have been formed in the heights between these two surfaces, and they have slightly scooped out the steep cliffs and the lower flat surface. This fact is explained as follows. The inland ice had receded to some extent after the formation of the upper flat surface and, then, the recession had ceased for a short time. At this interval, cirque glaciers were formed by drifted snow onto the steep cliffs and the cirques were gouged. Then, the inland ice began to recede again and the lower flat surface exposed above the ice level. The cirque glaciers survived a little later after the recession of the inland ice, and slightly scoured the lower surface. Therefore, at least one stagnant stage existed during the shrinkingperiod. The characteristics of moraines which cover ridges of the mountains differ more or less according to their locations. Thin moraines which directly cover bed rocks are often found in the northern part of the mountains. Rather thick moraines with ice cores cover ridges of the massifs in the middle part. Patterned grounds have developed on them. The southernmost massif is covered with thin moraines with ice cores. The difference of the development of moraines would be due to the difference of the durations since they have been exposed above ice the level. The fact that landforms are more precipitous in the northern part than in the southern can be attributed to some extent to the difference of time elapsed since the regions have been exposed. It is concluded, therefore, that the deglacierization of the northern part of the mountains advanced slightly previous to the southern. It is quite difficult to verify whether the recession of the inland ice has been taking place in the recent decades or not. Difficulty is increased by the lack of lichen on exposed rock surfaces (SWITHINBANK, 1958). But many of the cirque glaciers appear rather inactive. Especially, two of them have receding ice tongues, and freshly polished roches moutonnees are exposed in front of the tongues. The striated bed rocks on bottoms of a glacial trough are also fresh. Dead ice under moraines which cover a ridge of the southernmost massif is now melting. Bare rocks which have rather fresh surfaces are found at several places on foots of the massifs and nunataks. Considering these facts, it is tentatively concluded that the recent ice recession is somewhat conspicuous in this area, apart from the ice budget of more extensive region inland of Prince Harald Land...|$|E
40|$|Ventifacts are phenoclasts {{fashioned}} by <b>corrasion</b> (abrasion by wind-carried particules). They are climate-sensitive sedimentary features testifying {{long periods}} without any vegetation in non-marine environments. Therefore, {{they can be}} used, with more confidence than aeolian dunes, to characterize desert conditions, under hot or cold palaeoclimate. However, long experience in studying Permian,Triassic and Quaternary ventifacts from various countries in Europe and Africa, shows that many clasts presented in the literature as ventifacts, are not, and conversely, that typical ventifacts often go unnoticed. That is why {{we set out to}} review critically the diagnostic properties used to distinguish them. Because, in the current nature, most of ventifacts are found in desert pavements (regs), thin gravel beds on outcrops are frequently supposed correspond to such deflation lags, and thus to be the best place to found ventifacts. The reality is often disappointing because such beds may be formed in more dynamic environments: on fluvial bars or on sea shore. Undisturbed paleoregs are very rare, and ventifacts are usually found scattered, at varied reworked states. As ventifacts are typical of hyper-arid climates, the sedimentary units were they formed are devoid of palaeosols. Nevertheless, in some cases, climate change could lead to incor-poration of ventifacts in soil profiles of semi-arid type. Surface features are not useful to recognize ventifacts, except a polarity resulting from the contrast between a smooth upper face and an irregular basal face. Ventifacts are often reputed to exhibit a polished aspect. On modern specimens, this is due to a varnish (coating) of variable chemical composition; on ancient ventifacts (and even other pebbles) enbedded in a clayey matrix, a true mechanical polish can occur, probably related to differential compaction. Mesoscale features, usually neglected, are very significant. While in water, gravels wear out almost exclusively by mutual friction, in air, sandblasting is able to reach the most depressed zones of their surface. Therefore, even if the outline of a ventifact shows reentrants, it is uniformly smooth, and whether pre-existent cavities appear, their wall is also smoothed. Shallow scour pits, initiated by removal of soft grains, formed on the same way; they may mutually interfere to produce a polygonal pattern. On the other hand, especially on ventifact edges, may appear large percussion scars, produced by the largest clasts rolled by sand-blast. At macroscale, general shape hardly allows distinguishing a ventifact from any other clast, especially if it is a first-cycle sedimentary element. What is characteristic is the occurrence of specific ridges limiting facets; some are sinuous, fading towards the base, others tend to follow the general outline. The number of ridges depends partly on the initial shape of the clast, but the classic dreikanter is the least typical shape, since it may have another origin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Corrasion</b> of a {{standard}} cohesive bed due to saltating gastropod shells of the species Littorina has been examined in a laboratory mini flume. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine the effects of shell size and number on bed erosion rate. The movement of shells by flows explain why intertidal, glacial clays in the Bay of Fundy (which are covered in places with Littorinid shells) suffer erosion because bed erosion rate increased up to 20 -fold with the introduction of a single shell to the flume (27 m? 2). The standard bed was made of potters clay which had an erosion threshold of 0. 19 Pa and a fluid-induced erosion rate Eo= 0. 072 (Uy?Ucrit) gm? 2 s? 1, where Uy is the azimuthal current speed at height y= 0. 10 m. Shells of seven differing sizes (ds) were used to define the process of erosion by shell impacts. The threshold for shell motion (Ugcrit) was linearly related to shell size in the form: Ugcrit= 9. 17 × 10 ? 3 ds? 0. 22 m s? 1. Motion began by intermittent rolling, followed by continuous rolling and then by saltation. The shell speed in saltation was 68 % that of Uy, thus 32 % of the horizontal shell momentum was transmitted to the bed. The length/height ratio of saltations was 6. 3, and was constant for all sizes, and the mean saltation frequency was 1. 7 s? 1. The shell erosion rate (Es) increased with shell diameter for both the rolling and saltating phases. During the rolling phase, Es was up to 5 times greater than Eo at the same current speed. During saltation, Es was up to 20 times greater than Eo at the same current speed. The effect of shell number (1 – 7) was examined for the 7 – 10 mm size class. During rolling, Es increased linearly with shell number. For the saltating phase, Es increased in an asymptotic fashion, suggesting that groups of saltating shells affect the erosion process differently than single shells. The ballistic momentum flux (T) of saltating shells is highly dependent on the area of impact (Ag), which in the case of the littorinids, is along the rounded outer lip of the aperture (measured to be 0. 5 % of the nominal cross-sectional area of the shell). T increased with shell mass (Mg) and current speed (Uy). Below 0. 29 m s? 1, T 0. 35 m s? 1, T>?o where ?o is the fluid-induced shear stress. The total erosion rate (Etot=Es+Eo) was compared to the excess total bed shear stress (?tot??crit) and found to be linearly related in the form: gm? 2 s? 1. Es appeared to be in linear continuity with Eo if the impact area was set to 0. 05 % of the estimated shell nominal cross-sectional area...|$|E
