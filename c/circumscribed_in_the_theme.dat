50|$|What genera were to {{be placed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Actinidiaceae before recent genetic and micromophological studies emerged was highly controversial. Before recent evidence, the genus Sladenia was often placed within the Actinidiaceae. Also, Saurauia was {{sometimes}} considered its own family. Thus, before more detailed studies started, two to four genera could be placed within the Actinidiaceae. Micromorphological characters have confirmed that Sladenia does not belong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Actinidiaceae. Furthermore, biological characteristics of the cells, and molecular evidence have confirmed the three genera currently <b>circumscribed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Actinidiaceae, Clematoclethra, Saurauia, and Actinidia, do indeed form a monophyletic group.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{theme park}} is {{becoming}} a more and more popular destination for tourists around <b>the</b> world. Moreover, <b>theme</b> parks provide visitors with various experiences. It is crucial to understand visitors’ experiences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> park since experience {{is an important factor}} that is related to tourist behavior. The experience economy is widely used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tourism setting to measure experience from four dimensions: education, entertainment, escapism and esthetic (4 Es). However, limited research has examined visitors’ experiences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> park setting. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to measure visitors’ experience <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> park applying 4 Es and investigate the relationship between experience, and satisfaction and revisit intention. Furthermore, the differences on the means of these variables and differences on the impact of experience on satisfaction and revisit intention were also tested. In this study, 486 visitors who have been to Disney parks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U. S. within the past twelve months took the online survey. Independent sample t-tests and multiple linear regression analysis were adopted. The results showed that experience has a significant impact on satisfaction and revisit intention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> park and differences existed between the groups.
