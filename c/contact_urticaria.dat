A wheal-and-flare response is a skin eruption that may follow injury or injection of an antigen. It is characterized by swelling and redness caused by a release of histamine. The reaction usually occurs in three stages, beginning {{with the appearance of}} an erythematous area at the site of injury, followed by development of a flare surrounding the site; finally a wheal forms at the site as fluid leaks under the skin from surrounding capillaries. CUS has been categorized as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction with IgE (a type of anti-body) playing a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Investigations dealing with CUS seem to suggest that a percentage of urticarias encompass a contact mechanism.|$|E

Disruption of {{epidermal}} barrier can facilitate penetration of iritants, allergens, microbes and other particulars to epidermis. It can result in inflammatory reaction. Diseases, which manifest mainly on the skin and are of allergic origin, are atopic dermatitis (AD), <b>contact</b> dermatitis, <b>urticaria</b> and angioedema. AD is highly pruritic chronic or chronic recurrent noninfectious inflammatory disease. Treatment should be comprehensive. The first would be the effort to identify and eliminate causative allergens. This also applies to other diseases. There is importace of hydration and overall skin care (emollients). Intensity of anti-inflammatory treatment (corticosteroids, topical imunomodulators, antibiotics) depends on the current state of dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is representative of the IV. type of immunopathological reaction. It takes effect after various lengths of time of skin contact with allergen. Local and general treatment depends on the extent and intensity of damaged skin and is to reduce the local inflammation.

The health status of beauty salons workers has rarely been assessed. The most numerous reports concern hairdressers.

Secondary variables were changes in pruritus, levels of histamine, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α collected by skin microdialysis and safety and tolerability of bilastine. At doses of 20 mg was highly effective (P < 0.0001) in reducing CTT. Up-dosing to 80 mg significantly (P < 0.04) increased its effectiveness. At this dose, 19 of 20 (95%) patients responded to treatment, with 12 of 20 (60%) becoming symptom free. Only one patient was refractory to treatment. Microdialysis levels of histamine, IL-6 and IL-8 assessed 1-3 h after cold challenge (4 °C) were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased following up-dosing with 80 mg bilastine.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{elucidate}} {{the relationship between}} seven occupational dermatoses (ODs) and 20 types of work in Greece. MethodsThis was a prevalence epidemiologic study of certain ODs among 4, 000 workers employed in 20 types of enterprise, in 104 companies, in 2006 – 2012, using data from company medical records, questionnaires, occupational medical, and special examinations. The χ 2 test was applied to reveal statistically significant relationships between types of enterprises and occurrence of ODs. ResultsA high percentage (39. 9 %) of employees {{included in the study}} population suffered from ODs. The highest prevalence rates were noted among hairdressers (of contact dermatitis: 30 %), cooks (of contact dermatitis: 29. 5 %), bitumen workers (of acne: 23. 5 %), car industry workers (of mechanical injury: 15 %), construction workers (of contact urticaria: 29. 5 %), industrial cleaning workers (of chemical burns: 13 %), and farmers (of malignant tumors: 5. 5 %). We observed several statistical significant correlations between ODs (acute and chronic <b>contact</b> dermatitis, <b>urticaria,</b> mechanical injury, acne, burns, skin cancer) and certain types of enterprises. There was no statistically significant correlation between gender and prevalence of ODs, except for dermatoses caused by mechanical injuries afflicting mainly men [χ 2 (1)  =  13. 40, p <  0. 001] and for chronic contact dermatitis [χ 2 (1)  =  5. 53, p =  0. 019] afflicting mainly women.

Objectives The {{aim was to}} test a recently proposed classification system of HE in clinical practice in a prospective multicentre study. Methods Patients were recruited from nine different tertiary referral centres. All patients underwent examination by specialists in dermatology and were checked using relevant allergy testing. Patients were classified {{into one of the}} six diagnostic subgroups of HE: allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, atopic HE, protein <b>contact</b> dermatitis/contact <b>urticaria,</b> hyperkeratotic endogenous eczema and vesicular endogenous eczema, respectively. An additional diagnosis was given if symptoms indicated that factors additional to the main diagnosis were of importance for the disease. Results Four hundred and twenty-seven patients were included, 379 (89 %) of the patients could be classified directly into one of the six diagnostic subgroups, with irritant and allergic contact dermatitis comprising 249 patients (58 %). For 32 (7 %) more than one of the six diagnostic subgroups had been formulated as a main diagnosis, and 16 (4 %) could not be classified. 38 % had one additional diagnosis and 26 % had two or more additional diagnoses. Eczema on feet was found in 30 % of the patients, statistically significantly more frequently associated with hyperkeratotic and vesicular endogenous eczema.
