25|$|In {{the later}} Republic, augury {{came under the}} {{supervision}} of the college of pontifices, a priestly-magistral office whose powers were increasingly woven into the cursus honorum. The office of pontifex maximus eventually became a de facto <b>consular</b> <b>office.</b> When the consul Lepidus died, his office as pontifex maximus passed to Augustus, who took priestly control over the State oracles (including the Sibylline books), and used his powers as censor to suppress unapproved oracles. Octavian's honorific title of Augustus indicated his achievements as expressions of divine will: where the impiety of the Late Republic had provoked heavenly disorder and wrath (ira deorum), his obedience to divine ordinance brought divine peace (pax deorum).|$|E

25|$|A visa most {{commonly}} {{takes the form}} of a sticker endorsed in the applicant's passport or other travel document. The visa, when required, was historically granted by an immigration official on a visitor's arrival at the frontiers of a country, but increasingly today a traveller wishing to enter another country must apply in advance for a visa, sometimes in person at a <b>consular</b> <b>office,</b> by mail or over the internet. The actual visa may still be a sticker or a stamp in the passport, or may take the form of a separate document or an electronic record of the authorization, which the applicant can print before leaving home and produce on entry to the host country. Some countries do not require visas for short visits.|$|E

60|$|We went {{straight}} to the Pritchard residence, where the consul dwelt. This house--to which I have before referred--is quite commodious. It has a wide verandah, glazed windows, and other appurtenances of a civilized mansion. Upon the lawn in front are palm-trees standing erect here and there, like sentinels. The <b>Consular</b> <b>Office,</b> a small building by itself, is inclosed by the same picket which fences in the lawn.|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the Consul's house, he was ushered through a large, dark, cool hall, {{at the end of}} which was a magnificent staircase leading to the suite of saloons, into a small apartment on the ground floor fitted up in the English style, which, although it offered the appearance of the library of an English gentleman, was, in fact, the <b>consular</b> <b>office.</b> Dwarf bookcases encircled the room, occasionally crowned by a marble bust, or bronze group. The ample table was covered with papers, and a vacant easy-chair was evidently the consular throne. A portrait of his Britannic majesty figured on the walls of one part of the chamber; and over the mantel was another portrait, which immediately engaged the attention of the traveller, and, indeed, monopolised his observation. He had a very ample opportunity of studying it, for nearly a quarter of an hour elapsed before he was disturbed. It was the full-length portrait of a young lady. She stood on a terrace in a garden, and by her side was a gazelle. Her form was of wonderful symmetry; but although her dress was not English, the expression of her countenance reminded the traveller of the beauties of his native land. The dazzling complexion, the large deep blue eye, the high white forehead, the clustering brown hair, were all northern, but northern of the highest order. She held in her small hand a branch of orange-blossom-the hand was fairer than the flower.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{days later}} we {{anchored}} in the great harbour at Boston, where Captain Seccombe went with his story and his prisoners to Commodore Bainbridge, who kept them pending news of Commodore Rodgers. They were sent, a few weeks later, to Newport, Rhode Island, to be interrogated by that commander; and, to the honour of the Republic, were released on a liberal parole; but whether, when the war ended, they returned to England or took oath as American citizens, I have not learned. I was luckier. The Commodore allowed Captain Seccombe to detain me while the French consul made inquiry into my story; and during the two months which the consul thought fit to take over it, I was a guest in the captain's house. And here I made my bow to Miss Amelia Seccombe, an accomplished young lady, [...] "who," [...] said her doating father, [...] "has acquired a considerable proficiency in French, and {{will be glad to}} swap ideas with you in that language." [...] Miss Seccombe and I did not hold our communications in French; and, observing her disposition to substitute the warmer language of the glances, I took the bull by the horns, told her my secret, and rhapsodised on Flora. Consequently no Nausicaa figures in this Odyssey of mine. Nay, the excellent girl flung herself into my cause, and bombarded her father and the <b>consular</b> <b>office</b> with such effect that on 2nd February 1814, I waved farewell to her from the deck of the barque Shawmut, bound from Boston to Bordeaux.|$|E

40|$|The {{consular}} {{activity as}} {{an important component of}} the states activity develops according to the stipulations of the Vienna Convention regarding the consular relations in 1963, of the European Convention regarding the consular functions adopted in 1967 by the European Council, of the bilateral conventions contracted in the consular field and of the inside legislation of the states by means of certain specialized institutions, namely the career or honorific <b>consular</b> <b>offices</b> and the <b>consular</b> sections in frame of the diplomatic missions. Even if there are essential differences regarding the exertion of the consular functions and the granting of the consular immunities and privileges between the career consulates and the honorific ones, the state practice relieved that both of them have important contributions to the development of the economical, commercial and cultural-scientific relations between the states. Besides, the reason of settling the career or honorific <b>consular</b> <b>offices</b> has been determined by the necessity to organize and develop economical and especially commercial relations between the states and to provide protection to the natural persons and the juridical entities of a state that were placed and developed activity on the territory of another state. The current study wants to accomplish an analysis of the juridical system applicable to the honorific <b>consular</b> <b>offices</b> in a treatment comparative to the status of the career <b>consular</b> <b>offices</b> and by reporting both to the international, national legislation and to other states incident in the field. <b>consular</b> <b>offices,</b> honorific consul, <b>consular</b> relations, consular immunities and privileges...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} a change {{had taken place in}} the <b>consular</b> <b>office.</b> Mr. Ferris, some months before, had {{suddenly}} thrown up his charge and gone home; and after the customary interval of ship-chandler, the California sculptor, Hoskins, had arrived out, with his commission in his pocket, and had set up his allegorical figure of The Pacific Slope in the room where Ferris had painted his too metaphysical conception of A Venetian Priest. Mrs. Elmore had never liked Ferris; she thought him cynical and opinionated, and she believed that he had not behaved quite well towards a young American lady,--a Miss Vervain, who had stayed awhile in Venice with her mother. She was glad to have him go; but she could not admire Mr. Hoskins, who, however good-hearted, was too hopelessly Western. He had had part of one foot shot away in the nine months' service, and walked with a limp that did him honor; and he knew as much of a consul's business as any of the authors or artists with whom it is the tradition to fill that office at Venice. Besides he was at least a fellow-American, and Elmore could not forbear telling him the trouble he was in: a young girl coming from their town in America as far as Genoa with friends, and expecting to be met there by the Elmores, with whom she was to pass some months; Mrs. Elmore utterly prostrated by one of her old attacks, and he unable to leave her, or to take her with him to Genoa; the friends with whom Miss Mayhew travelled unable to bring her to Venice; she, of course, unable to come alone. The case deepened and darkened in Elmore's view as he unfolded it.|$|E
