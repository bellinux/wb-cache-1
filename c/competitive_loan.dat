In discussion with other parties, M-Pesa was re-focused and launched with a different value proposition: sending remittances home across the country and making payments.|$|E

Gale and Hellwig (1985)also studied the credit rationing problem and studied the optimal form of the debt contract between borrowers and lenders.Furthermore, Williamson (1987) showed that the credit rationing arises if lenders suffer from monitoring costs.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, using firm-level {{cross-sectional}} {{data in the}} US, we report that {{interest rates on loans}} extended by inside banks are significantly lower than those on loans extended by outside banks for younger firms in concentrated loan markets, while such loan rate differences are not clearly observed in <b>competitive</b> <b>loan</b> markets. The analytical model presented in this paper predicts that an inside bank is more likely to quote rates lower than those of outside banks to capture a customer in order to gain time to establish exclusive access to the customer's private information, counting on the consequent future rent from informational advantages over rival banks, if the inside bank intends to acquire private information about the borrower's creditworthiness. In light of this prediction, we conclude that the above empirical finding is consistent with the hypothesis that increased competition discourages banks from collecting borrower-specific private information.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{examination of the}} existence of the inside bank premium arising from relationship banking, which is predicted in the extant theoretical models. These models predict that the contracted interest rate of a loan extended by an inside bank when there exist asymmetries between the inside bank and outside banks, such as the information advantage of the inside bank or the implicit insurance and other borrower-specific services exclusively provided by the inside bank, is higher than that without such asymmetries. Our statistical estimations are based on the dataset collected through the survey for small and medium-sized firms in Japan, which were designed to contain the questions about a firm's loan application process, and the agreed-upon loan terms that are crucial to our tests. Our estimations show that such an inside bank premium is 30 - 50 basis points on average for short-term loans. This is economically significant for the median short-term interest rate of 1. 9 %. The subsample regressions show that this premium is more likely to come from the implicit insurance and that this premium is more significant for smaller inside banks in more <b>competitive</b> <b>loan</b> markets...|$|E

This research investigated whether banks are successful in adapting to changes in the economy, by comparing the realised returns generated before and after the financial collapse, at an individual loan account level. Banks that have superior credit risk pricing models, driven by a pro-active credit risk department, will survive the onslaught of future economic downturns and come out stronger and more <b>competitive.</b> Individual <b>loan</b> data was collected from a credit provider to establish whether credit departments are pro-active in assessing credit risk and pricing for it accurately, in the context of a changing economic environment. Based on the results, banks are not successful in pricing through economic cycles.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a financial intermediation model integrating both loan and deposit markets {{to study the}} impacts of competition on bank risk-taking behavior under different coverage of deposit insurance. We find {{that the relationship between}} competition and bank risk-taking depends on the interactions of market structure between loan and deposit markets, deposit insurance, and depositors ’ risk aversion. With full deposit insurance coverage, an increase only in competition for deposit will trigger severe bank moral hazard problem and spill over to loan market because of the existence of bank’s role on financial intermediation. Thus there exists a positive relationship between competition and bank risk-taking. In contrast, an increase only in competition for loan could lower bank risk. There exists a negative relationship between competition and bank risk-taking. Without deposit insurance, in general, bank risk will be contained due to depositors ’ risk internalization. The risk could be even lower in monopolistic deposit market and <b>competitive</b> <b>loan</b> market than other loan and deposit market structure combinations due to no existence of any moral hazard problem. In the other loan and deposit market structure combinations, risk will be higher due to moral hazard either in loan market or in deposit market.

40|$|The {{troublesome}} debts of {{many developing}} countries have spawned much literature on why countries borrow, on what debt contributes to growth, on why countries repay, and {{on how to deal}} with existing debt. The author provides an analytical primer on the following aspects of sovereign debt : 1) the basic accounting concepts associated with debt and some data associated with external borrowing; 2) debt as a component of an optimizing model of borrowing in a <b>competitive</b> <b>loan</b> market, when the borrower faces an intertemporal budget constraint; 3) debt as a component of recent models of endogenous growth; 4) problems arising from sovereign risk, including problems of liquidity, enforcement, and revenue-raising to finance repayment; 5) incentives to repay; 6) options available to a creditor whose debtor is unwilling to meet current debt-service obligations; and 7) debt buybacks. The author concludes that in the absence of any efficiency cost imposed by outstanding debt, how much a buyback benefits the borrower depends on how much buying back debt reduces what is available for repayment later. The author also concludes that if there are efficiency losses associated with debt, debt forgiveness can benefit both a debtor nation and its creditors. Contrary to claims in the literature, this outcome does not require that a reduction in the face value of debt raise its market value, and the debtor benefits even though the buyback raises the market price of the debt.
