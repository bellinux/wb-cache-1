5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} view that the <b>Court</b> <b>should</b> {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause. He was often labeled an ‘activist’ because of his willingness to review legislation that arguably violated constitutional provisions. Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E

In February 2012 it quashed the {{decision}} of the appeal court to overturn the conviction, ruling that the <b>court</b> <b>should</b> not have asked France2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassing or {{tying the}} hands of the executive. The <b>court</b> <b>should</b> abstain from interfering where a {{judicial}} pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally falling within its purview. In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Divisional Court of England and Wales held that the applicant's true purpose for seeking the court's interpretation of a United Nations Security Council resolution was to limit the government's freedom in relation to {{the use of military force}} and to exercise diplomatic pressure in advance. Thus, the matter should be regarded as non-justiciable.|$|E
50|$|In theory, the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> {{always been}} {{impartial}} and independent from any interference. Judges were not elected through election, but {{the members of}} the Legislative Council were. Thus, the Legislative Council would be in a better position than the courts to determine what the society would need. The <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> recognise and appreciate that fact. Therefore, the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> let the legislature deal with public policy. And this would be the margin of appreciation doctrine.|$|R
50|$|United Gas Pipe Line Co. v.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> {{recognize}} that defense counsel’s role is pivotal in criminal cases and take specific steps to strengthen the defendant’s right to counsel. The article first examines the courts’ view of the criminal defendant’s role in four situations: when addressing questions of competency to stand trial, when addressing the propriety of excluding the defendant from various proceedings, when considering the allocation of decision-making authority between the defendant and counsel, and when discussing {{the responsibility of the}} pro se defendant. In each of these contexts, the courts generally ascribe a limited role to the represented defendant, relying on counsel to protect and enforce the defendant’s rights. The article then {{argues that the}} <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> take four steps to strengthen the defendant’s right to counsel. First, the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> recognize a constitutionally protected interest in continuity of representation. Second, the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> be more receptive to motions for substitute counsel. Third, <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> assure that the defendant is present at all discussions related to whether counsel will continue in the case. Finally, the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> recognize the unusual responsibility assumed by a pro se defendant and enforce rules disfavoring the decision to proceed pro se. These procedural changes would enhance the fairness of the criminal process by strengthening the defendant’s right to counsel...|$|R
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the <b>court</b> <b>should</b> not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{directed}} {{the circuit court}} for the District of New Jersey to grant Jackalow a new trial. The Court held that, while the trial <b>court</b> <b>should</b> determine {{the description of the}} boundaries of New York and Connecticut, the ascertainment of their actual boundaries, and the application of those boundaries to the crime in question, should have been a question of fact for the jury. Jackalow was not retried and was released.|$|E
5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this <b>court</b> <b>should</b> {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general haven of reform movements.|$|E
500|$|The Act was [...] "a {{compromise}} between two opposing jurisprudential approaches to arbitration...that the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> be {{kept out of}} arbitration altogether except to prevent abuses against the rules of natural justice, [...] that the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> retain a substantial measure of control over arbitrations to ensure that arbitral awards apply the law".|$|R
40|$|This comment {{addresses}} {{the concept of}} initial interest confusion in trade dress law and examines several different courts 2 ̆ 7 approaches to the doctrine. Through the discussion, it becomes evident that while being careful to avoid bypassing {{an analysis of the}} likelihood of confusion factors, <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> also use the doctrine to determine confusion of potential purchasers. Failing to account for certain factors, such as the sophistication of the relevant consumer group, may allow courts to skew the likelihood of confusion factors in an initial interest confusion analysis. In sum, the author argues that <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> conduct a thorough analysis of likelihood of consumer confusion by applying the accepted likelihood of confusion factors. <b>Courts</b> <b>should</b> also eliminate inappropriate use if the ultimate question in trade dress initial interest confusion analysis. Further, <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> insist on a survey universe of the appropriate target market...|$|R

5|$|Maintaining the castles proved challenging, {{and they}} rapidly fell into disrepair. The money {{given to the}} castle constables {{to enable them to}} {{maintain}} and garrison the castles had not been generous to start with, but the sums provided declined considerably during the 14th century. The constable of Conwy Castle had been provided with £190 a year in 1284, but this fell away to £40 a year by the 1390s; Harlech's funding fell similarly from £100 a year to only £20 by 1391. By 1321 a survey reported that Conwy was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers, and in the 1330s, Edward III was advised that none of the castles were in fit state to host the royal <b>court</b> <b>should</b> he visit the region. A 1343 survey showed that Beaumaris needed extensive work, with several of the towers in a ruinous conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia NAACP {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} 1956 to have the five barratry, champerty, and {{maintenance}} laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of the 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. A three-judge panel of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district <b>court</b> <b>should</b> have withheld judgment until state courts had considered the issue first.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{military}} tribunal provoked criticism from Edward Bates and Gideon Welles, who believed that a civil <b>court</b> <b>should</b> have presided; but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force {{at the time in}} the District of Columbia. (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan, the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict, and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson.|$|E
40|$|In South African {{constitutional}} jurisprudence, 2 ̆ 2 legal subsidiarity 2 ̆ 2 is {{a theory}} of the appropriate relationship between and hierarchy among various sources of law, particularly the Constitution, statutes, and the common law. Core tenets of the theory are that <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> avoid making a constitutional decision if a matter can be decided on a non-constitutional basis; that <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> ordinarily defer to legislation; and that <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> avoid any tendency to proliferate separate tracks or sub-systems of law (e. g., <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> not create parallel causes-of-action or remedies respectively grounded, respectively, on the Constitution itself, legislation, and/or the common law). This article generally shares the critical approach and larger jurisprudence of the author to whom it responds. However, the article questions the coherence of legal subsidiarity theory and its effectiveness in resolving the recurring problems {{to which it is}} addressed. A major concern posed is whether incautious application of subsidiarity theory may inappropriately authorize legislature to limit the scope of constitutional rights...|$|R

5|$|The {{work is not}} a law code {{issued by}} King Henry, but a {{compilation}} of already extant legislation that was still current during his reign. It is not a comprehensive listing of all laws that were in force during the early 11th century. It begins with Henry's Charter of Liberties, which he issued after his coronation, {{and this is the}} only actual legal document reproduced in the Leges. Some discussions of juridical matters then follow, then a long treatment of ecclesiastical issues. The rest of the treatise is concerned with non-ecclesiastical subjects, including cases of injury, theft, murder, and feuds. Procedural topics are included, such as how summonses to <b>court</b> <b>should</b> be formed, what notices need to be made before judicial procedures, how adjournments should be handled, and other such concerns. There is no strong organizational framework to the entirety of the Leges, which leads the author to repeat subjects as well as treating some subjects less than adequately.|$|E

This {{is not to say that}} the <b>courts</b> <b>should</b> not, where circumstances require, consider the need for development of the common law of New Zealand in relation to the reciprocal fiduciary obligations that the Crown and Maori owe to each other.
