The aim {{of this investigation was}} to identify any differences between variations of the clean, across a range of loads, in inexperienced female collegiate athletes. Sixteen healthy female collegiate athletes (age 19 ± 2. 3 years; height 166. 5 ± 3. 22 cm; body mass 62. 25 ± 4. 52 kg; 1 repetition maximum [1 RM] <b>power</b> <b>clean</b> 51. 5 ± 2. 65 kg) performed 3 repetitions of 3 variations (<b>power</b> <b>clean,</b> hang <b>power</b> <b>clean,</b> midthigh <b>power</b> <b>clean)</b> of the <b>power</b> <b>clean</b> at 60, 70, and 80 % of their predetermined 1 RM <b>power</b> <b>clean,</b> in a randomized and counterbalanced order.

25|$|Because a {{large share}} of air {{pollution}} is caused by combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. Most effective is the switch to <b>clean</b> <b>power</b> sources such as wind power, solar power, hydro power which don't cause air pollution. Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations), expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as string trimmers, chainsaws, and snowmobiles), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of hybrid vehicles), conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to electric vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Department of Energy’s 2008 report 20% Wind Energy by 2030 envisioned {{that wind}} power could supply 20% of all U.S. {{electric}} power, {{which included a}} contribution of 4% to the nation’s total electric power from offshore wind power. In order to achieve this, however, significant advances in cost, performance and reliability are needed, based on a 2011 report from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future. Obtaining 20% from wind requires about 305 GW of wind turbines, an increase of 16 GW/year after 2018, or an average increase of 14.6%/year, and transmission line improvements. Analysts estimate around 25 GW of added US wind power in 2016-18, depending on the <b>Clean</b> <b>Power</b> Plan and PTC extensions.

The {{aim of this}} study was to explore relationships between lower body muscle structure and one-repetition maximum (1 -RM) <b>power</b> <b>clean.</b> Design and Methods: 15 resistance trained subjects (13 males, 2 females) had three ultrasound images of their vastus lateralis (VL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) musculature taken at rest before participating in a 1 -RM <b>power</b> <b>clean</b> protocol on two occasions interspersed by 48 - 72 hours. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) demonstrated high within- and between-image reliability for the muscle structure measures (ICC ≥ 0. 81, p < 0. 001) and excellent between-session reliability for both the absolute and relative 1 -RM <b>power</b> <b>clean</b> measurements (ICC = 0. 96, p < 0. 001). Significant moderate relationships were found between VL muscle thickness and relative 1 -RM <b>power</b> <b>clean</b> (r = 0. 506, p = 0. 027), MG muscle thickness and absolute 1 -RM <b>power</b> <b>clean</b> (ρ = 0. 476, p = 0. 036) and MG pennation angle and relative 1 -RM <b>power</b> <b>clean</b> (ρ = 0. 543, p = 0. 018).
