5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>filter</b> (ripple only in passband), reverse <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>filter</b> (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E

50|$|<b>Chebyshev</b> <b>filters</b> are analog or digital filters {{having a}} steeper {{roll-off}} and more passband ripple (type I) or stopband ripple (type II) than Butterworth <b>filters.</b> <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>filters</b> have the property that they minimize the error between the idealized {{and the actual}} filter characteristic over {{the range of the}} filter, but with ripples in the passband.This type of filter is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev because its mathematical characteristics are derived from Chebyshev polynomials.|$|R

500|$|Synthesis methods allow {{better control}} of the precise filter {{response}}. [...] A common response function used by filter designers is the <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>filter</b> which trades steepness of the transition band for passband ripple. [...] However the Chebyshev response {{is not always the}} best choice for waffle-iron filters. [...] Low-pass waveguide filters do not pass frequencies {{all the way down to}} zero because of the waveguide cutoff effect. [...] A better choice is the Achieser-Zolotarev filter. [...] This filter is based on Zolotarev polynomials (which include the Chebyshev polynomials as a special case) discovered by Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. [...] The Zolotarev response has a stopband at low frequency, the cutoff of which can be controlled by the designer so it is not detrimental in a waveguide filter. [...] The advantage of the Zolotarev response is that it results in a filter with a better impedance match to the connecting waveguides compared to the <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>filter</b> or image-parameter filters.|$|E
500|$|Filter {{performance}} parameters, such as stopband {{rejection and}} rate of transition between passband and stopband, are improved by adding more components and thus increasing {{the length of the}} filter. [...] Where the components are repeated identically, the filter is an image parameter filter design, and performance is enhanced simply by adding more identical elements. [...] This approach is typically used in filter designs which use a large number of closely spaced elements such as the waffle-iron filter. [...] For designs where the elements are more widely spaced, better results can be obtained using a network synthesis filter design, such as the common <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>filter</b> and Butterworth filters. [...] In this approach the circuit elements do not all have the same value, and consequently the components are not all the same dimensions. [...] Furthermore, if the design is enhanced by adding more components then all the element values must be calculated again from scratch. [...] In general, there will be no common values between the two instances of the design. [...] Chebyshev waveguide filters are used where the filtering requirements are rigorous, such as satellite applications.|$|E
500|$|Theoretical work {{following}} the war included the commensurate line theory of Paul Richards. Commensurate lines are networks {{in which all}} the elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances. Richards' transformation allows any lumped element design to be taken [...] "as is" [...] and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation. [...] In 1955 K. Kuroda published the transformations known as Kuroda's identities. [...] These made Richard's work more usable in unbalanced and waveguide formats by eliminating the problematic series connected elements, but it was some time before Kuroda's Japanese work became widely known in the English speaking world. [...] Another theoretical development was the network synthesis filter approach of Wilhelm Cauer in which he used the Chebyshev approximation to determine element values. [...] Cauer's work was largely developed during World War II (Cauer was killed towards the end of it), but could not be widely published until hostilities ended. [...] While Cauer's work concerns lumped elements, it is of some importance to waveguide filters; the <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>filter,</b> a special case of Cauer's synthesis, is widely used as a prototype filter for waveguide designs.|$|E
