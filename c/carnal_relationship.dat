2500|$|In 1987, Mailer {{would appear}} in Jean-Luc Godard's {{experimental}} film version, shot in Switzerland, of Shakespeare's King Lear. [...] Originally, Mailer was to play the lead [...] "Don Learo" [...] in Godard's unscripted film alongside his daughter, Kate Mailer. [...] The film also featured a variable list of Hollywood stars like Woody Allen and Peter Sellers. However, tensions surfaced between Mailer and Godard early in the production when the french auteur insisted that Mailer play a character who had a <b>carnal</b> <b>relationship</b> with his own daughter. He left Switzerland after just one day of shooting with the filmmaker behind Breathless (1960).|$|E
60|$|I {{now come}} to Aphrodite Urania. This deity is to be {{carefully}} distinguished from the Cyprian or Pandemic Aphrodite: she is different, not only in attribute and function, but even in personality and origin. She {{is the daughter of}} Heaven (Uranus) and Light; her influence is heavenly: she is heavenly or spiritual love, as distinct from earthly or carnal love. If the personage in Shelley's Elegy is to be regarded, not as the Muse Urania, but as Aphrodite Urania, she here represents spiritual or intellectual aspiration, the love of abstract beauty, the divine element in poesy or art. As such, Aphrodite Urania would be no less appropriate than Urania or any other Muse to be designated as the mother of Adonais (Keats). But the more cogent argument in favour of Aphrodite Urania is to be based upon grounds of analogy or transfer, rather than upon any reasons of antecedent probability. The part assigned to Urania in Shelley's Elegy is very closely modelled upon the part assigned to Aphrodite in the Elegy of Bion upon Adonis (see the section in this volume, Bion and Moschus). What Aphrodite Cypris does in the Adonis, that Urania does in the Adonais. The resemblances are exceedingly close, in substance and in detail: the divergences are only such as the altered conditions naturally dictate. The Cyprian Aphrodite is the bride of Adonis, and as such she bewails him: the Uranian Aphrodite is the mother of Adonais, and she laments him accordingly. <b>Carnal</b> <b>relationship</b> and carnal love are transposed into spiritual relationship and spiritual love. The hands are the hands, in both poems, of Aphrodite: the voices are respectively those of Cypris and of Urania.|$|E
50|$|After {{many years}} without seeing each other, Rosario meets Milagros, her friend from {{childhood}} {{who works as}} a taxi driver using a car from her uncle's taxi company. Milagros starts driving her to the bank each morning where she works as a cleaner. Together, they spend lots of time going to restaurants and pubs, but Rosario gets worried about missing so much work and one day she is fired. Milagros admits later that she never had a driving licence, which, combined with her excessive kindness to Rosario, leads her to also be fired. After that, the two women find jobs as street cleaners. In that job, Rosario meets Morsa (Antonio de la Torre), with whom she starts a <b>carnal</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{theory that}} Jesus and Mary {{were in a}} <b>carnal</b> (physical) <b>relationship</b> is based on Baigent's {{interpretation}} of the Holy Kiss on the mouth (typically between males in early Christian times, thus signifying Mary's emancipation), and spiritual marriage, as given in the Gospel of Philip. The theory was perpetuated by authors Laurence Gardner and Margaret Starbird.|$|R
40|$|Sakaguchi Ango (1906 - 1955) was a Japanese {{author who}} {{prided himself on}} being a {{literary}} misfit. This is why many categorize his writing along with Dazai Osamu and Oda Sakunōsuke, {{as a part of}} the buraiha 1 literary group. As a misfit, his writings presented original ideas for his generation, one of which is the idea of nikutai bungaku. Nikutai bungaku is a literary approach that features carnal bodily desires. This class of literature was formed after World War II, when a few authors such as Tamura Taijirō wrote stories and essays about men finding salvation and freedom from their situations through sexual relations with women. Ango responded to the idea of Japanese people finding freedom and believed that through the body humans would find freedom. Ango took the concept of nikutai bungaku and applied it to other areas besides sexual encounters with women. I use two of his famous essays, ― Nihon bunka shikan and ― Darakuron‖ to explain how Ango made use of the techniques of nikutai bungaku. Ango desired for Japanese people to be free in spirit and life. His remedy was for each person to live according to his/her bodily desires, and through that lifestyle Ango imagined a healthier country. In Part II, I have translated three writings by Ango that show his idea of the ― flesh is not completely limited to a man and a woman‘s <b>carnal</b> <b>relationships.</b> By reading some of his works, one can see the oddity and originality of his concepts...|$|R
50|$|In 1875 Flashman {{returns to}} America with his wife, Elspeth. He meets George Armstrong Custer (whom Flashman had met during the US Civil War) and businesswoman Mrs. Arthur B. Candy, and later travels to Bismarck, North Dakota, {{to meet with}} Mrs. Candy and pursue a <b>carnal</b> <b>relationship.</b> However Mrs Candy is {{revealed}} to be Cleonie, the former slave girl, who is intent on revenge and at her connivance, he is kidnapped by Sioux and kept captive at Greasy Grass. He escapes {{just in time to}} see the defeat and death of Custer—possibly being the one who kills Custer—and to be partly scalped himself by his own illegitimate son from Cleonie, Frank Grouard, who by choice has been living as an Indian. The book ends with Flashman and his son travelling to Deadwood where Flashman meets another former acquaintance, Wild Bill Hickok prior to returning home.|$|E
40|$|This {{study in}} four parts {{examines}} the Cassandra scene in Aeschylus' Agamemnon, {{the first play}} in his sole extant trilogy entitled Oresteia. In the first part, a brief survey of Cassandra's language is given in which I try to argue that her deranged state affects her utterances and causes communication problems {{between her and the}} Chorus. The first part ends with a preliminary appraisal of her relationship with Apollo. The second part deals with her barbarian aspect. At the beginning, I deal with the general antithesis between Greeks and Orientals and incorporate some information on the oriental and/or primitive elements of Apolline worship. The rest is more focused on Agamemnon and specifically on the debt of Aeschylus to the tradition; and on the oriental and/or primitive elements of Cassandra, without forgetting the King, the Queen and Apollo, whose figure and relationships with his "servants" are briefly discussed. The third part examines the relationship between Agamemnon and Cassandra. Adopting a scene by scene analysis on the meaning of the presence (and sometimes absence) of the King, we {{come to the conclusion that}} the King, already overburdened with mistakes, commits another by having, unlike Apollo, a rather <b>carnal</b> <b>relationship</b> with Cassandra. As for the last part, following the same principle of analysis, we deal with the majestic figure of the Queen. Through her manipulation of language, and consequently of the other personages (namely the Elders and Agamemnon), we try to discover differences and possible similarities with Cassandra, on the basis of Clytaemnestra's and Cassandra's marginal status...|$|E
