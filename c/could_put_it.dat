2500|$|The Australian 'Humpty Dumpty' [...] {{had fallen}} from the wall and, in our disgust at its fragility, we {{wondered}} how even all the king's horse and all the king's men, let alone Sir Donald Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey, <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together again.|$|E
2500|$|Rawle {{explained}} that Silas has accepted {{he is to}} be in the secure psychiatric unit until he dies so he plans to manipulate the outside world from inside as a means of living out his murderous fantasies. Rawle revealed that Silas has a [...] "nagging feeling" [...] that he made a mistake in killing India and that he wishes he <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> right. He said that his character meant to murder Texas so he now wants to kill her as she is the [...] "one that got away". Hendrickse-Spendlove also commented that Silas initially intended to kill Texas so she is [...] "the final piece of the puzzle for him, and then his 'work' will be complete". Silas tells Texas another murder will soon occur which is an opportunity to [...] "play games". He is [...] "delighted" [...] to have an audience during the visits and begins to [...] "make lots of threats". Rawle {{explained that}} Silas sees that Texas has India's ring which is [...] "symbolic" [...] for Silas as he had previously taken it as a trophy. Texas taunts Silas with the ring and agrees to exchange it for information on Lynsey's murder. Rawle explained that Silas tells Texas that Will Savage (James Atherton) is responsible for Lynsey's murder which is because [...] "Silas knows that Texas and Will are close, so he points the finger of suspicion his way". He said that Silas would [...] "put quite a few people in the frame" [...] for the murder. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that Texas is [...] "manipulated" [...] by Silas when he makes her believe Will is responsible for Lynsey's murder. Silas escapes from hospital and goes to visit Texas. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained that Texas [...] "opens her front door, sees Silas and thinks, 'This is it - my life is over', to see him standing there with no police restraint, knowing that he murdered her sister India, is absolutely petrifying". Silas tells Texas that he now intends to complete what he began. Hendrickse-Spendlove would not reveal whether Texas survives the ordeal but said that Texas is [...] "never going to be safe again" [...] regardless of the outcome. In August 2012, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no current plans for Silas to return, but the door had been left open for him. On 20 January 2016, Silas is set to return to visit Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison after he was framed by Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) for the murders and attempted murders at Dee Valley Hospital. Silas left again after he killed Lindsey.|$|E

60|$|Dick paused again. It was {{impossible}} to soften the blow, and he <b>could</b> only <b>put</b> <b>it</b> bluntly.|$|R
60|$|He {{said that}} if they had given him another day he thought he <b>could</b> have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> straight.|$|R
60|$|And {{he would}} like to see the man, thought Sam, who <b>could</b> have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> more cleverly and pleasantly and tactfully than that.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twasn't so very big--a fellow <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in his pocket. But it had gold--I mean money--in it, and my dead wife's jewelry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!--is that so? AIN'T it bully! Why, Huck, {{if it was}} to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> off till--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I can't carry it," [...] said Rilla. [...] "I have {{to drive}} the horse and I'd be afraid I'd drop it. Is there a--a basket {{anywhere}} that I <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jethro, reflectively, [...] "I don't know as I <b>could</b> have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> {{as well as}} that--there's somethin' {{in being}} an orator." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{of course}} it can," [...] I agreed, with as much relief in my tone as I <b>could</b> <b>put</b> into <b>it.</b> After all, what simpler way of moving the Ballplatz than that? ...|$|R
60|$|Florentia. Well, I {{never would}} have given an evening {{to what we have}} just seen. If one <b>could</b> have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in between luncheon and tea, well enough. But one's evenings are too precious.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's our spare room--it hasn't {{been used}} since Parson Greenwood was here," [...] said Mrs. Rivers reflectively. [...] "Melinda <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to rights in an hour. At what time will he come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{it depends}} upon what you put it into. I daresay Mr. Petersfield <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out for you on mortgage, on good security, at {{four and a half}} or five per cent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know--I know," [...] said Sewell miserably. [...] "I was waiting--waiting--" [...] He stopped, {{and then}} added with a burst, [...] "I was waiting till I <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> to you in some {{favourable}} light." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh reader! {{now that}} I might tell [...] What Johnny and his horse are doing! [...] What they've {{been doing all}} this time, [...] Oh <b>could</b> I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into rhyme, [...] A most {{delightful}} tale pursuing! ...|$|R
60|$|Now, McCarthy was unversed in {{the virtues}} of social wisdom, and, though he felt somehow the error of her position, he <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into {{definite}} thought; so he steered wisely, if weakly, out of danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{he was up}} in {{the loft}} at the time, so that I <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands, and she promised to deliver it at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Godolphin {{would pay}} any sum for the {{privilege}} of using the fact as an advertisement. If he <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into Pinney's hands, and give him carte blanche, to work in all the romance he liked--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O! {{because of}} grandmamma, I suppose," [...] said Henrietta; [...] "but {{he really does}} wish it, and I should not at all wonder if the Busy Bee <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into his head to do it." ...|$|E
60|$|Think now. If {{you took}} your watch to pieces, you would {{probably}} spoil it for ever; you would have perhaps broken, and certainly mislaid, some of the bits; and not even a watchmaker <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together again. You would have analysed the watch wrongly. But if a watchmaker took it to pieces then any other watchmaker <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> together again to go as well as ever, because they both understand the works, how they fit into each other, and what the use {{and the power of}} each is. Its being put together again rightly would be a proof that it had been taken to pieces rightly.|$|E
6000|$|And yet, much as I {{felt this}} {{injustice}} and {{much as the}} city affected me, I <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into fiction. [...] "It is not my material," [...] I said. [...] "My dominion is the West." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} it over, Captain, many times. It seems to me, sometimes, that I {{have a sort of}} notion why it is; but it is not clear, even to myself. I <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into words." ...|$|R
6000|$|O Reader! {{now that}} I might tell [...] What Johnny and his Horse are doing! [...] What they've {{been doing all}} this time, [...] Oh <b>could</b> I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into rhyme, [...] 315 [...] A most {{delightful}} tale pursuing! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll have to {{have some}} place in which to store the biplane," [...] said Sam to Dr. Wallington. [...] "Do you think we <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the {{boathouse}} for the present--or in the shed of the gymnasium?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{that you}} may have done {{troubles}} me in the least," [...] she assured him. [...] "I do wish that you <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> all out of your mind and let me help you to make a fresh start." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just send {{somebody}} out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?' said the officer; 'he's in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have {{you got a}} coach 'us here, that you <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> up in, for five or ten minutes?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>could</b> I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> {{back when}} I didn't take it? Do believe me now, and {{be good to}} me again," [...] he said, so imploringly, that Emil slapped him on the back, and {{declared}} he would for one.|$|R
6000|$|... "I confide Betty's {{education}} {{entirely to}} you, Stephen," [...] she said, with another plaintive sigh. [...] "I feel sure I <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into better hands. You {{have always been}} a person who could be thoroughly depended on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I thought we'd {{gone over}} all that," [...] I replied, as patiently as I <b>could.</b> [...] "You're <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> on an old-fashioned, moral basis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And pray, Miss Venetia, what <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in {{your head}} to ask such an odd question?' exclaimed Mistress Pauncefort. 'A widow! Miss Venetia; I have never yet changed my name, and I shall not in a hurry, that I can tell you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{lived in}} false {{security}} {{and refused to}} think. You knew the reckoning must come, but were satisfied if you <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> off. Now you must bear the consequences, {{it is not my}} fault. However, this is not important. Will you sell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She felt {{quite happy}} and pleased with herself under this resolution, {{but it was}} late before she <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in practice. The lady at Kensington rather started on {{entering}} the room {{where she had been}} waiting nearly an hour. 'I thought--' she said, apologetically, 'Did my servant say Miss Sandbrook?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{hand was}} {{withdrawn}} as carelessly {{as it had}} come, leaving the cheque, blushing in all its naked beauty, upon the table. Philip took it as deliberately as he <b>could,</b> and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in his pocket. Then, rising, he said good-bye, adding, as he passed through the door: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{as to the}} place,' {{continued}} Mervyn, 'you <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into better {{hands to}} get your {{people out of their}} Old World ways. A young man like that, used to farming, and with steam and mechanics at his fingers' ends, will make us all look about us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “This {{would be}} a grand place for a hut,” he said to himself. “Of course we <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on the rock, for we might be swept away by a sudden flood, and besides {{there would be no}} shade. But just inside the edge of trees we should do splendidly.” ...|$|R
