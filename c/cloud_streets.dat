These were discovered in 1933 by two German glider pilots, Hans Deutschmann and Wolf Hirth, above the Krkonoše.They are periodic changes of atmospheric pressure, temperature and orthometric height in a current of air caused by vertical displacement, for example orographic lift when the wind blows over a mountain or mountain range. They can also be caused by the surface wind blowing over an escarpment or plateau, or even by upper winds deflected over a thermal updraft or <b>cloud</b> <b>street.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used source of lift is created by the sun's energy heating the ground which in turn heats the air above it. This warm air rises in columns known as thermals. Soaring pilots quickly become aware of land features which can generate thermals and their trigger points downwind, because thermals have a surface tension with the ground and roll until hitting a trigger point. When the thermal lifts, the first indicator are the swooping birds feeding on the insects being carried aloft, or dust devils or a change in wind direction as the air is pulled in below the thermal. As the thermal climbs, bigger soaring birds indicate the thermal. The thermal rises until it either forms into a cumulus cloud or hits an inversion layer, {{which is where the}} surrounding air is becoming warmer with height, and stops the thermal developing into a cloud. Also, nearly every glider contains an instrument known as a variometer (a very sensitive vertical speed indicator) which shows visually (and often audibly) the presence of lift and sink. Having located a thermal, a glider pilot will circle within the area of rising air to gain height. In the case of a <b>cloud</b> <b>street,</b> thermals can line up with the wind, creating rows of thermals and sinking air. A pilot can use a <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> to fly long straight-line distances by remaining in the row of rising air.|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} {{characteristics of}} surface layer turbulence for the near-shore <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> regions over the Atlantic Ocean were examined using 50 -m level data of airborne measurements of atmospheric turbulence spectra above the western Atlantic Ocean during cold air outbreaks. The present study, performed for the Mesoscale Air-Sea Exchange (MASEX) experiment, extends and completes the preliminary analyses of Chou and Yeh (1987). In the inertial subrange, a near 4 / 3 ratio was observed between velocity spectra normal to and those along the aircraft heading. A {{comparison of the}} turbulent kinetic energy budgets with those of Wyngaard and Cote (1971) and Caughey and Wyngaard (1979) data indicates that the turbulent kinetic energy in the surface layer is dissipated less in the MASEX data than in data obtained by the previous groups...|$|R
40|$|The joint {{frequency}} distribution technique {{was used to}} analyze buoyancy fluxes in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) for the <b>cloud</b> <b>street</b> regime noted during the Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment. It is found that for {{the lower half of}} the MABL, the buoyancy flux is mainly generated by the rising thermals and the sinking compensating ambient air, and is mainly consumed by the entrainment and detrainment of thermals, penetrative convection, and the entrainment from the MABL top. If the buoyancy flux is primarily driven by the temperature flux, these buoyancy-flux generating processes should be the same for the lower boundary layers over land and ocean. The results of the scale analysis of the buoyancy flux agree well with those obtained for mesoscale cellular convection during the Air-Mass Transformation Experiment...|$|R

Good agreement between the modeled and observed orientation angles, wavelengths and Reynolds numbers are found when the streets are assumed to derive their energy from the average shear and the lowest order sine terms of a Fourier expansion of the mean wind profile (or equivalently from the lowest order cosine terms of the mean shear profile). The modes associated with the cosine terms of the wind profile (or the sine terms of the wind shear profile) do not agree well with the observations. These results suggest that the boundary layer rolls observed during KonTur might have developed owing to a combined parallel/thermal instability originating primarily from the cosine terms of the ambient roll parallel wind shear...|$|R

5000|$|It {{is often}} {{possible}} to fly efficiently by merely slowing {{down in the}} rising air while flying straight ahead on course, instead of circling, then speeding up again when the air is no longer rising. This technique is known as 'dolphining'.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the observational, experimental, theoretical, and {{numerical}} studies of mesoscale shallow convection (MSC) in the atmosphere. Typically, MSC is 1 to 2 km deep, has a horizontal length scale of a few to a few tens of kilometers, and takes distinctive planforms: linear and hexagonal. The former is called a <b>cloud</b> <b>street,</b> roll, or band, while the latter is called mesoscale cellular convection (MCC), comprising three-dimensional cells. MSC is characterized by its shape, horizontal extent, convective depth, and aspect ratio. The latter is the ratio of the horizontal extent to that in the vertical. For cells the horizontal extent is their diameter, whereas for rolls it is their spacing. Rolls usually align along or at angles of up to 10 ° from the mean horizontal wind of the convective layer, with lengths from 20 to 200 km, widths from 2 to 10 km, and convective depths from 2 to 3 km. The typical value of aspect ratio ranges from 2 to 20. Rolls may occur over both water surface and land surfaces. Mesoscale convective cells may be divided into two types: open and closed. Open-cell circulation has downward motion and clear sky in the cell center, surrounded by cloud associated with upward motion. Closed cells have the opposite circulation. Both types of cell have diameters ranging from 10 to 40 km and aspect ratios of 5 to 50, and both occur in a convective layer with a depth of about 1 to 3 km. Both the magnitude and direction of horizontal wind in the convective layer change little with height. MSC results from a complex and incompletely understood mix of processes. These processes are outlined, and their interplay is examined through {{a review of the}}oretical and laboratory analyses and numerical modeling of MSC...|$|R
