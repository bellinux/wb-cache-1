25|$|This {{region is}} {{extremely}} poorly known and documented, especially the earlier periods. Archaeology has hardly made any progress, in part {{thanks to the}} <b>continuing</b> <b>state</b> of warfare which hinders research. Documentary history is also rather sparse, al-Idrisi, writing in 1154 is the first author to offer information about the region that provides any concrete detail. The Sicilian geographer describes the Tajuwa as pagans inhabiting the region adjacent to the Nile Valley kingdoms, who possessed two towns, the first and capital being Tajuwa and a second town lying six stages away from it called Samna, which was destroyed according to a traveler in the region, by {{the governor of the}} kingdom of Nuba. The bulk of the inhabitants were nomadic with large numbers of cattle and camels, but subject to raiding by their neighbors.|$|E
500|$|The {{time and}} {{duration}} of the activity is also taken into account when determining unreasonableness. Activities may be reasonable at one time but not at another; in Halsey v Esso Petroleum, filling oil tankers at 10am was held to be reasonable, but the same activity undertaken at 10pm was unreasonable. A private nuisance is normally a [...] "continuing state of affairs", not a one-off situation; there are exceptions, such as in De Keyser's Royal Hotel v Spicer, where piledriving at night was considered a nuisance. In such situations, the normal remedy is to grant an injunction limiting {{the time of the}} activity. Another exception was found in British Celanese v AH Hunt Ltd, where an electronics company stored foil strips on their property which blew onto adjoining land, causing the power supply to a nearby yarn manufacturers to be cut off. A similar incident had occurred 3 years earlier and the defendants had been warned to store their strips properly; it was held that even though the power cut was a one-off event, the method of storing the foil strips constituted a <b>continuing</b> <b>state</b> of affairs, and the defendants were liable.|$|E

Thus, Mormons believe that only mortals can {{be the subject of}} an eternal marriage ordinance; mortals may receive the ordinance for themselves or by proxy for dead people.|$|E
