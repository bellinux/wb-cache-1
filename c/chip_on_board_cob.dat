40|$|Summary form only given. In recent years, the {{application}} of <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> technology (<b>COB)</b> has become widespread. COB technology offers many advantages compared to conventional packaging techniques, such as the reduced weight and volume of electronic components and high flexibility. For consumer applications and especially for the harsh environmental conditions in automotive applications, a qualified investigation of reliability is necessary. COB technology with wire bonds includes die bonding, wire bonding and encapsulation of bare <b>chips</b> <b>on</b> printed circuit <b>boards</b> (PCBs). In order to obtain a correlation between process conditions and reliability, the bondability and solderability of different electroless metal finishes were investigated. In this paper, the bondability and solderability of palladium metal finishes with an optional gold flash and electroless plated Ni-Au metallizations are shown. The investigation of the bondability was performed in two steps. First, a detailed study was performed to determine the basic factors affecting bondability. This study includes surface investigations such as SEM, Auger spectroscopy and measurement of microhardness and microroughness. As the next step, bond process windows were determined {{for each type of}} metallization to obtain information on bondability before and after accelerated ageing tests. The feasibility of different surface investigation methods is shown and the results are compared to results from bond experiments...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of <b>Chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>Board</b> (<b>COB)</b> {{structures}} with LSI chips mounted on the substrate has attracted much attention. One of the main technical problems is that the internal electrical wires may disconnect during the heat cycle process due to {{the differences in the}} thermal expansion coefficients between component materials. In order to prevent thermal expansion deformation the wires are encased in resin. Until now, the relationship between the physical properties of the resin and the thermal residual stress in the wires has been seldom reported. In this work, the influence of resin physical properties on the thermal residual stress generated during the heat cycle process was theoretically analyzed via finite element analysis. The results show that the thermal residual stress generated in the wire during the heating process is larger than that during the cooling process. During heating the thermal residual stress was influenced by the storage modulus of the rubbery state (ER) ...|$|E

With increasing ultrasonic power the results indicate recrystallization of the grain structure and decreasing micro-hardness inside the bonded wedges contacts. The very fine grain structure in the interface region is the precondition of a closed interface, high bond strength and reliable bond contacts. The interface between the AlSi 1 wire and the Cu/Ni/Flash-Au metallization layer of the optimized bonds consists of a closed crystalline Au layer. Above this Au layer, a second zone consisting of intermetallic phases was analyzed and identified by electron diffraction as Au 8 Al 3. After a few milliseconds first spots of the 30 - 50 nm thick intermetallic phase are grown.

Visual stimuli designs based on <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> (<b>COB)</b> LEDs were {{used in this study}} to compare the influences of the radial with horizontal and concentric patterns in SSVEP. Circular rings with diameters 70 mm, 90 mm, 110 mm, and 130 mm with green COB LEDs were used for radial and concentric patterns while green strip COB LED of 18 mm width and length 16 cm was used for horizontal pattern. The visual flicker and the concentric patterns were generated and controlled precisely by a 32 -bit microcontroller platform. The SSVEP frequencies used were 7, 8, 9 and 10 Hz for a period of 30 seconds for each horizontal, radial and concentric circle visual stimulus. The study analysed the EEG recording from five participants comprising of five trials from each frequency and three different stimuli designs to identify the most responsive visual stimulus for evoking SSVEP. Furthermore, we also compared the influence of ring diameters in radial visual stimulus to identify the maximal response and minimal visual fatigue. The results indicated that radial stimulus gave significantly better response than concentric circles or horizontal stimuli for all the participants.

The chip includes a high performance 8 bit PIC based RISC with 4 Kx 14 EDAC protected on chip Instruction RAM and two banks of registers supporting 192 bytes each. The registers are implemented using temporal latch technology and are SEU immune. The architecture supports two master inter-integrated circuit (I 2 C) buses where one can be configured as an I 2 C slave. The chip implements a SPI Master core. The cores are integrated with the RISC processor using a Wishbone Bus Crossbar switch. Mini-PnP ASIC supports bootup from an external SPI based Non Volatile Memory (NVM). The reading of the “eXtensible Transducer Electronic Datasheet” (xTEDS) from the external SPI NVM is also supported for Plug and Play applications.

40|$|Asian {{industry}} and development is currently {{very focused on}} replacing extremely expensive Au wire with Cu or Pd-plated Cu in IC (mass production) packaging technologies (ball/wedge bonding). In contrast, Europe traditionally is researching and developing {{in the field of}} wedge/wedge bonding using heavy wire (> 100 m) for power electronic modules or standard (thin) wire (< 100 m, mostly 25 - 50 m) for chip-on-board (COB) applications. One primary failure mechanism limiting the lifetime of power modules is Al wedge lift-off due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the Al wedge and the chip (Si). This classical type of fatigue cracking can be reduced by using materials of higher strength and/or lower CTE. Key strategies include doping or alloying elements and/or optimizing bonding conditions to improve the microstructure. Cu-based wire or Cu-Al bimetal ribbons are another option, although these include changes to the chip structure and metallization. Al Si 1 has been the industry standard bonding material in wedge/wedge thin wire bonding for many years. Its thermal stability is limited at temperature above 100 °C due to recrystallization, grain growth and Si coagulation. For example, glob top material curing processes used in <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>board</b> (<b>COB)</b> applications (e. g. several hours at 160 °C) can decrease the strength of standard AlSi 1 wire to less than 60 % of its original value. Research and development is currently attempting to improve this situation by alloying and doping Al base material to increase high-temperature behavior or by using Al-coated Au or Cu wires. The presentation will give an overview of alternative wedge/wedge wire bonding materials and discuss the challenges to processing and reliability...|$|E
