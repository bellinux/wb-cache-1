5|$|Striding Edge is {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> dangerous part of the walk. Without an ice axe or crampons this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008.|$|E

Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.|$|E

2500|$|Phenylalkylamine {{calcium channel}} {{blockers}} are relatively selective for myocardium, reduce myocardial oxygen demand and reverse coronary vasospasm, {{and are often}} used to treat angina. [...] They have minimal vasodilatory effects compared with dihydropyridines and therefore cause less reflex tachycardia, making it appealing for treatment of angina, where tachycardia <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant contributor to the heart's need for oxygen. [...] Therefore, as vasodilation is minimal with the phenylalkylamines, the major mechanism of action is causing negative inotropy. Phenylalkylamines are thought to access calcium channels from the intracellular side, although the evidence is somewhat mixed.|$|E

The town lay, grim, stony, and unsheltered, up the side of a steep hill, and Adam did not go forward to it at present, for Seth had told him where to find Dinah. It was at a thatched cottage outside the town, a little way from the mill--an old cottage, standing sideways towards the road, {{with a little bit of}} potato-ground before it. Here Dinah lodged with an elderly couple; and if she and Hetty happened to be out, Adam could learn where they were gone, or when they would be at home again. Dinah might be out on some preaching errand, and perhaps she would have left Hetty at home. Adam could not help hoping this, and as he recognized the cottage by the roadside before him, there shone out in his face that involuntary smile which belongs to the expectation of a near joy.|$|E
