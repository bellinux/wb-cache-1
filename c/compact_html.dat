WML and HDML are stripped-down formats suitable for transmission across limited bandwidth, and wireless data connection called WAP. In Japan, DoCoMo defined the i-mode service based on i-mode HTML, {{which is an}} extension of <b>Compact</b> <b>HTML</b> (C-HTML), a simple subset of HTML.|$|E

The mobile Web {{can be considered a}} shadow of the World Wide Web, implemented using specialized markup languages and design techniques adapted for comparatively limited mobile phones and PDAs. Despite the growing importance and usage of the mobile Web, surprising little is known about it. This paper presents the results of a study of mobile Web content conducted in May and June of 2006. The study examines the content of over one-million mobile Web pages from around the world using a search-assisted crawling methodology to locate and study pages for three of the most popular mobile Web formats—WML 1. 0, WML 2. 0 /XHTML Mobile Profile (XHTML-MP) and <b>Compact</b> <b>HTML</b> (C-HTML). The objective is to study the relative characteristics of these mobile Web content formats, as well as compare them with a similar sampling of non-mobile (HTML) content. We found that WML is the dominant mobile Web content type, although regional differences do exist. We found that all three mobile content types studied were on the same order of magnitude for average page characteristics such as number of links (under 10) and number of images (around 1), but pages in the newest format, XHTML-MP, are 50 % larger on average than those in WML. Not surprisingly, all of these characteristics are much smaller than for HTML content pages gathered with the same methodology. In terms of specific features, only 7 % of pages used WML cards, but 50 % of XHTML-MP servers dynamically adapted the content served based on the user agent. Finally, we found less than 4 % of mobile pages contained ad objects, which is much less than for HTML pages. I...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{educational}} institutions (HEI) have since 1994 been frequent users and {{contributors to the}} World Wide Web where HTML and HTTP are two fundamental standards. After being in development for more than 20 years a new revised version of HTML {{is in the process}} of being standardized, known as HTML 5. This report gives a <b>compact</b> introduction to <b>HTML</b> 5 and discusses how the new revision may influence HEI, HEIs in Norway specifically. Emphisis is put on new standarized multimedia features, however other features with potential for HEIs are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Center for Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) Studies and Research (NPS CISR) invites {{experts in the}} field of INFOSEC to NPS to lecture on computer security. Other universities, government, and non-government organizations need similar lectures. Two problems arise: experienced security practitioners are few in number and cannot spend a considerable amount of time on the lecture circuit. Also, for many institutions a regular lecture series would be too costly. To solve these problems a method for mass distribution of the NPS security lectures must be designed. Multi media tools were used to capture INFOSEC lectures for cost effective mass dissemination. By using the appropriate equipment, computer technology, and software, a tool was developed which can distribute security lectures to an unlimited audience in multiple formats. The resulting product is a tutorial to give content providers a technique to take archived video tapes, digitize them, edit them, and export them. These lectures can be delivered in <b>HTML,</b> <b>compact</b> disk, and video taped formats. An analysis of the production process yields a set of recommendations for optimizing the user interface and balancing producer and user requirements such as memory conservation, increased product quality, and accelerated remote delivery[URL]...|$|R
