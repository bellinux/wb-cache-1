2500|$|In 1976, {{the company}} name was changed to Northern Telecom Limited, and {{management}} announced its intention to concentrate the company's efforts on digital technology. Northern Telecom was the first company in its industry to announce and to deliver a complete line of fully digital telecommunications products. The product line was branded [...] "Digital World" [...] and included the well known DMS-100, a fully digital <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> serving as many as 100,000 lines, which was a key contributor to the company's revenue for close to 15 years.|$|E

50|$|A marker {{is a type}} {{of special}} purpose control system that was used in {{electromechanical}} telephone <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches.</b> <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> are the large devices that telephone companies use to make the connections that support telephone calls. The switch makes voice connections between users, and to control equipment such as that used to detect dialed numbers.|$|R

50|$|Whitehorse {{converted}} from partial dial to full dial service on October 31, 1960. After this date, local communities' ring-down phones were replaced with local exchange service, using surplus <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> {{that could be}} acquired at a relatively low cost. The wire line facilities along the highway was changed from ring-down services to multi-party lines off dial exchanges as the communities along the line received <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches,</b> {{most of which were}} Ericsson Rurax switches that during the late 1970s were modified to enable direct dialing of long distance calls, though without automatic number identification. The more remote multi-party lines were switched from wire to Exicom radios, while the Ruraxes were mostly replaced in the mid-1980s with modern solid-state digital switches, though the last Rurax remained in service in Swift River until 1987.|$|R
50|$|This section {{describes}} how the original style, standalone, voicemail system worked with a corporate PBX. The principle is the same with <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> <b>Switches</b> (CO Switches) or Mobile Telephone <b>Switching</b> <b>Office</b> (MTSOs). More modern voice-mail systems work on the same principle, {{but some of the}} components may be shared with other systems, such as email systems.|$|R
50|$|This {{movie is}} noted for the {{physical}} tracing of the call to find Inga (Bancroft) before she dies. Throughout the movie, the call is traced by hand through several electro-mechanical telephone <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> {{which leads to the}} hotel where Inga was staying (originally the Hyatt House, now demolished) near the Seattle-Tacoma Airport.|$|R

5000|$|Direct Access Test Units (DATUs) {{are special}} PSTN phone numbers that {{terminate}} at the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> {{in a telephone}} company's local exchange that provide switchmen and telco technicians with a circuit for testing lines in various ways.|$|E
50|$|The SP-1 {{design was}} {{superseded}} by the DMS-100 <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> {{and other members}} of the DMS family of products (DMS: digital multiplex switch). DMS extended the technology by fully integrating switching and transmission. This was a major advance that changed the way systems were built.|$|E
50|$|The new company, Siemens Stromberg-Carlson, {{became the}} third largest vendor of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> in the United Statesâ€”with a {{combined}} installed base of 5 million access lines.

50|$|In {{telephone}} switches, time-slot interchange switches usually {{form the}} outer {{layer of the}} switching fabric at a <b>central</b> <b>office's</b> <b>switch.</b> They take data from time-multiplexed T-1 or E-1 lines that serve neighborhoods. The T-1 or E-1 lines serve the subscriber line interface cards (SLICs) in local neighborhoods. The SLICs serve as the outer space-division switches of a modern wired telephone system.|$|R
50|$|The 1AESS <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> {{incorporated}} higher processing capacities {{based on}} the 1A Processor in 1976. It was a plug compatible upgrade with a faster processor that incorporated the existing instruction set for programming compatibility, and used smaller remreed switches, fewer relays, and featured disk storage.|$|E

50|$|In 1990 Siemens {{purchased}} Stromberg Carlson {{and moved}} its EWSD production to the Lake Mary, Florida production facility in 1991. In {{the next few}} years Siemens slowly phased out the DCO as a line side <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch.</b> The DCO-CS was continued through the 1990s to support regional LD companies. The DCO-CS was small on port capacity (just under 10,000), but was robust on features, more than most other carrier switches.|$|E
50|$|The pair {{of wires}} from the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch</b> to a {{subscriber}}'s home {{is called a}} subscriber loop. It carries a direct current (DC) voltage at a nominal voltage of 48V when the receiver is on-hook, supplied by a power conversion system in the central office. This power conversion system is backed up with a bank of batteries, resulting in continuation of service during interruption of power to the customer supplied by their electrical utility.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>central</b> <b>office</b> {{was located}} at Wilcombâ€™s General Store, and that {{consisted}} of a small manual switchboard. Mr. Wilcomb would answer an incoming telephone call and connect it manually to the party being called between waiting on customers in the store. In 1914 it was relocated to a building at the junction of routes 121 and 121A, adjacent to the old Glidden Tavern, and there it remained for 44 years. A new building was constructed at 7 Derry Road (Route 102) in 1957 to house new <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switching</b> equipment.|$|R

50|$|A PBX user must {{be careful}} to order the correct type of trunk line from the local phone company and {{correctly}} install the telephone system at the PBX end - so that they match. Line equipment in most 20th-century <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switches</b> had to be specially rewired to create a ground start DDCO line. Crossbar switch did it with a paper sleeve on the Vertical Off Normal contact, 5ESS switch by translation, and DMS-100 by a slide switch on the line card, all according to what the customer ordered.|$|R
5000|$|The 68030 {{was used}} in many models of the Apple Macintosh II and Commodore Amiga series of {{personal}} computers, NeXT Cube, later Alpha Microsystems multiuser systems, and some descendants of the Atari ST line such as the Atari TT and the Atari Falcon. It was also used in Unix workstations such as the Sun Microsystems Sun-3x line of desktop workstations (the earlier [...] "sun3" [...] used a 68020), Laser printers and the Nortel Networks DMS-100 telephone <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch.</b> More recently, the 68030 core has also been adapted by Freescale into a microcontroller for embedded applications.|$|E
5000|$|SPC was {{introduced}} in electronic switching systems in the 1960s. The 101ESS PBX was a transitional switching system in the Bell System to provide expanded services to business customers that were otherwise still served by an electromechanical <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>switch.</b> Examples of SPC based 3rd generation switching systems include: Western Electric 1ESS switch, British GPO TXE (various manufacturers), Metaconta 11 (ITT Europe) and the AKE, ARE and pre-digital (1970s) versions of the AXE telephone exchange by Ericsson and Philips PRX were large-scale systems in the public switched telephone network. SPC enabled sophisticated calling features. As SPC exchanges evolved, reliability and versatility increased.|$|E
