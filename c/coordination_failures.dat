Because these patients do not utilize insurance or primary care, emergency medical providers often face problems of overutilization and financial loss, especially since many patients are unable {{to pay for their}} care (see below). ED overuse produces $38 billion in wasteful spending each year (i.e. care delivery and <b>coordination</b> <b>failures,</b> over-treatment, administrative complexity, pricing failures, and fraud), and unnecessarily drains departmental resources, reducing the quality of care across all patients. While overuse {{is not limited to the}} uninsured, the uninsured comprise a growing proportion of non-urgent ED visits - insurance coverage can help mitigate overutilization by improving access to alternative forms of care and lowering the need for emergency visits. A common misconception pegs frequent ED visitors as a major factor in wasteful spending. However, frequent ED users make up a small portion of those contributing to overutilization and are often insured.|$|E

5000|$|Coordination {{failure was}} another {{important}} new Keynesian concept developed as another potential explanation for recessions and unemployment. In recessions a factory can go idle {{even though there}} are people willing to work in it, and people willing to buy its production if they had jobs. In such a scenario, economic downturns appear {{to be the result of}} coordination failure: The invisible hand fails to coordinate the usual, optimal, flow of production and consumption. Russell Cooper and Andrew John's 1988 paper Coordinating <b>Coordination</b> <b>Failures</b> in Keynesian Models expressed a general form of coordination as models with multiple equilibria where agents could coordinate to improve (or at least not harm) each of their respective situations. Cooper and John based their work on earlier models including Peter Diamond's 1982 coconut model, which demonstrated a case of coordination failure involving search and matching theory. In Diamond's model producers are more likely to produce if they see others producing. The increase in possible trading partners increases the likelihood of a given producer finding someone to trade with. As in other cases of coordination failure, Diamond's model has multiple equilibria, and the welfare of one agent is dependent on the decisions of others. Diamond's model is an example of a [...] "thick-market externality" [...] that causes markets to function better when more people and firms participate in them. Other potential sources of coordination failure include self-fulfilling prophecies. If a firm anticipates a fall in demand, they might cut back on hiring. A lack of job vacancies might worry workers who then cut back on their consumption. This fall in demand meets the firm's expectations, but it is entirely due to the firm's own actions.|$|E
50|$|Proponents of GIP discuss {{several ways}} to {{mitigate}} risks. Governments can make sufficient choices about which industries or companies to support. Some instances of targeting the wrong firms or industries are inevitable because some degree of failure is inherent in GIP effort. Profit cannot measure success, but rather, success occurs {{with the creation of}} environmental and technological externalities. Governments can avoid using the wrong policy instruments when they experiment in select parts of the country before applying policy country-wide. Policy learning and lesson drawing from industrial policy and GIP can foster the adoption of correct policy instruments. Rent-seeking can be an issue, but the creation of rent attracts investors into risky green technology fields. Rent management can avoid the problem by dictating the correct amount of profit, offering profit incentives in an appropriate way, and withdrawing them when markets can function on their own. Governments must work with the private sector, and the two should have a mutual interest and understanding of the issues each seeks to address, although governments must avoid capture by the private sector. Independent monitoring of policy progress, strong institutions, consumer protection agencies, and a free press can deal with the risk of political capture. Furthermore, clear objectives, consistent monitoring, evaluation techniques, and exit strategies can strengthen policies. Policies can avoid trade disputes through the process of policy learning and if policies adhere to WTO rules. Policymakers can evade ineffective GIP through the creation of a transparent and accountable political coalition of actors, which includes public-private partnerships, business alliances, and civil society. A strong coalition also addresses <b>coordination</b> <b>failures.</b> The extra risks of GIP options could avoid future costs by increasing progress toward more ambitious cuts in emissions. As a result, GIP that is politically optimal may be economically optimal in the long-run, even if it experiences immediate inefficiencies.|$|E
