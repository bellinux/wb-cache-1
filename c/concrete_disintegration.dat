40|$|Abstract. Let G = exp g be a simply {{connected}} nilpotent Lie {{group and}} H = exp h be a closed connected subgroup of G. Given an irreducible unitary representation pi of G, we present an explicit {{disintegration of the}} restriction pi|H of pi to H, {{which is based on}} a precise description of the space of double classes HGupslopeB, where B is any closed connected subgroup of G, and the well known smooth disintegration of monomial representations of nilpotent Lie groups. As an application we get a <b>concrete</b> <b>disintegration</b> of tensor products of irreducible representations of G and a criterium for the irreducibility of these representations. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} problems of using of water jet {{technology for the}} removal of concrete surface layers. Realized experimental tests were focused on the possibility of using of water jet technology in the stage of concrete surface preparation for the repair of concrete structures. The contribution specifies some new possibilities in the use of water jet technology for the <b>concrete</b> <b>disintegration.</b> The circumstances of surface layers removal through various types of water jet were investigated on concrete samples with different characteristics of surface layers. In the paper, possibilities of high-speed water jet technology are extended to the application of so-called flat water jet. Interesting results in relatively low energy demands can be achieved during disintegration of very hard concrete in conjunction with an acoustic pulse generator...|$|E

Selected results of laboratory tests of disintegration of various types of concrete as well as rocks are presented and compared with results of <b>concrete</b> and rock <b>disintegration</b> by means of continuous water jet under the same operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{chlorides}} on the thaumasite form of sulfate attack in limestone cement concrete is studied. Concrete specimens made from ordinary Portland cement and two Portland limestone cements (limestone content 15 % and 35 % respectively) were prepared. After 28 days of curing the specimens were immersed in six solutions of various sulfate and chloride content and stored at 5 oC. Visual assessment of the specimens, mass measurements and compressive strength tests took place {{for a period of}} 24 months. XRD method was used to identify thaumasite in the deteriorated parts of the specimens. All measurements showed that Portland cement concrete exhibits a lower degree of deterioration than Portland limestone cement <b>concrete.</b> Specimen <b>disintegration</b> was more severe, the higher the limestone contents of the cements and the higher the sulfate content of the corrosive storage solutions. Chlorides play an inhibitory role, delaying the deterioration of the concrete specimens. XRD analysis showed the presence of thaumasite at the deteriorated parts of the specimens after nine months of curing...|$|R
40|$|Aggregate {{alkaline}} corrosion {{of cement}} in concrete {{is going to}} respond in sodium and potassium hydroxide (lye) with active SiO 2 found in some aggregates. During this reaction, the concrete has resulted in significant internal stresses which cause deformation of the <b>concrete,</b> cracking and <b>disintegration.</b> The reaction is slow and concrete signs of decomposition appear only {{after a few months}} or years. The study used two different aggregates quarries. Studies show that Lithuania gravel contaminated with reactive particles having amorphous silicon dioxide reacting with cement in sodium and potassium hydroxide and the resulting alkaline concrete corrosion. It was found that, according to AAR 2 large aggregates include Group II – potentially reactive because of their expansion after 14 days, higher than 0. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|Moscow Channel {{represents}} a most important hydraulic engineering structure in Russia. Since its locks {{have been in}} operation for over 75 years, there are numerous cases of <b>concrete</b> <b>disintegration</b> of various nature and extent in the walls of locks chambers. The situation is quite risky due to the growing threat of accidents. The article deals with detection and analysis of destructive processes in the concrete walls of lock chambers, as well as evaluation of their stress-strain state. Gate no. 2 serves as an example, because several signs of its dangerous condition were first detected there (including cracks in the concrete and destruction of concrete). Various methods were employed to reinforce the structure, including consolidation of chamber walls using anchor rods, and reinforcement of camera walls by metal rods. Calculations were made to assess the stress-strain state of the concrete walls of Gate no. 2 of the Moscow Channel. The article includes an overview and analysis of earlier methods of repair and reinforcement of the chamber walls. The authors provide their recommendations on further safety of operation of the structures {{on the basis of}} the research findings and their analysis. Выявлены и проанализированы деструктивные процессы, происходящие в бетоне стен камер шлюзов канала имени Москвы и приведена оценка их напряженно-деформированного состояния на примере шлюза № 2, на котором впервые были отмечены признаки аварийного состояния и проверены различные способы усиления конструкций.

40|$|Utilization of {{laterite}} rock at 20 % as partial aggregate replacement {{in concrete}} production {{is seen as}} one of the alternative to reduce the high dependency of concrete industry on granite aggregate supply and preserve this natural resource for future generation. This paper reports the durability performance of concrete containing laterite aggregate upon sulphate attack. A reference mix, plain concrete consisting 100 % granite aggregate and another one mix containing 20 % laterite aggregate as partial coarse aggregate replacement were used. All specimens were prepared in cubes of (100 × 100 × 100 mm) and subjected to water curing for 28 days. After that, the specimens were immersed in Magnesium Sulphate solution for a period of 50 weeks. The durability of the concrete mixes was determined through measurement of mass change and residual compressive strength. The compressive strength test was conducted following the procedures in BSEN 12390 – 3. Upon exposure in sulphate environment, reaction between sulphate ions and portlandite which formed gypsum contributes to <b>concrete</b> expansion and <b>disintegration</b> causing strength reduction in both specimens. Owing to the small difference in total mass loss and residual compressive strength between the two mixes, it is concluded that the sulphate resistance of laterite concrete is comparable to plain concrete...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the <b>disintegration</b> mechanism of <b>concrete</b> due to the infiltration of the moisture to the milling overlay pavement and to come up with a method to minimize the disintegration as well as verifying the effectiveness of the edge sealing and Fogseal method. METHODS: This study investigated the distress mechanism due to the infiltrated moisture remaining in the milling overlay pavement through chloride freezing test and verified the effectiveness of the sealing of the milling edge and fog seal methods, which have been devised to minimize the moisture infiltration, through laboratory water permeability test. Additionally, long-term pavement performance was compared for the effectiveness of the proposed method through under loading test, and field water permeability test was carried out to verify the field applicability of the proposed method. RESULTS: The result of the research confirmed that chloride deteriorates the <b>concrete</b> surface through <b>disintegration</b> and lowers its strength and that the laboratory moisture infiltration test verified the effectiveness of the milling edge sealing and fog seal methods in the deterrence of moisture infiltration to the overlay pavement with excellent long-term performance of the pavement treated with the proposed method. Although the field water permeability test revealed some deterrence of moisture infiltration of the milling edge sealing and fog seal methods to a certain extent, the difference was a little. CONCLUSIONS: The milling edge sealing and fog seal methods are limited in their effectiveness for the cases of improvident compactio...|$|R
