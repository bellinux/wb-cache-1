Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and <b>C</b> <b>nitrogen</b> centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E

40|$|Abstract The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to eval-uate the stability of astaxanthin after drying and storage at different conditions during a 9 -week period. Recovery of astaxanthin was evaluated by extracting pigments from the dried powders and analysing extracts by HPLC. The powders obtained were stored under different conditions of temperature and oxygen level and the effects on the deg-radation of astaxanthin were examined. Under the experi-mental conditions conducted in this study, the drying temperature that yielded the highest content of astaxanthin was 220 C, as the inlet, and 120 C, as the outlet temper-ature of the drying chamber. The best results were obtained for biomass dried at 180 / 110 C and stored at- 21 C under nitrogen, with astaxanthin degradation lower than 10 % after 9 weeks of storage.
