40|$|An {{integrated}} petrographical and petrophysical {{approach was}} carried out {{on a set of}} 35 <b>chalk</b> outcrop samples, covering a wide range of lithologies and textures. One major outcome of the study is the improvement of the understanding of the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) signal of <b>chalks,</b> with a focus on tight <b>chalks,</b> including all low reservoir quality <b>chalks</b> independently of their sedimentological and diagenetic history. In this study various <b>chalk</b> rock-types have been characterized, in terms of microtextures and porous network, by integrating both geological and petrophysical data. The petrographical investigation includes macroscopic, thin section and SEM observations as well as insoluble residue quantification; whereas petrophysical investigation includes porosity, permeability, low field NMR, MICP, specific surface area (BET) and sonic velocity measurements. Based on these petrographical and petrophysical analysis, 6 groups of samples were identified, each evidencing especially a singular NMR signature: (1) Clean <b>chalks,</b> (2) Argillaceous <b>chalks,</b> (3) Cemented <b>chalks,</b> (4) Coarse <b>chalks,</b> (5) Atypical marl-seam <b>chalks</b> and (6) Silicified <b>chalk</b> sample. NMR T 2 distributions were linked to pore body size, 1 /T 2 being the transverse relaxation rate. It is apparent that tight <b>chalks</b> – whether they originate from sedimentological (e. g. argillaceous <b>chalks)</b> or diagenetic processes (cemented or silicified <b>chalks)</b> yield smaller pore sizes (T 2 logmean 60 ms). The common characteristic of all atypical marl-seam <b>chalk</b> samples, is a bimodal T 2 distribution, with a second peak related to high intraparticular porosity. The microtextural and petrophysical properties of marl-seam <b>chalks</b> vary widely depending on the intensity of the burial dissolution. The result of this work provide information regarding the development of a NMR based approach to characterize an enormous variety of <b>chalk</b> samples. Those results compared with NMR logging data can provide a continuous record of the pore size and <b>chalk</b> microtexture characteristics in the hydrocarbon reservoirs. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nondietary {{exposure}} to milk proteins {{may be a}} risk for children who do not outgrow milk allergy by school age. Objective: To study the allergenicity of casein containing <b>chalk.</b> Methods: A 6 -year-old, milk allergic child developed asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis while in school. The suspected cause was dust-free <b>chalk</b> containing casein. To study the relationship of dust-free <b>chalk</b> containing casein with asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis, 13 additional milk allergic patients were studied: 3 school-aged children, 8 preschool-aged infants, and 2 children with outgrown milk allergy. Skin tests and/or specific IgE with <b>chalk</b> and casein were performed. A <b>chalk</b> use test was performed in older children. Milk allergens contained in <b>chalk</b> were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblot, and IgE inhibition experiments. Results: All school-aged, milk allergic children were exposed to <b>chalk</b> and reported symptoms attributed to <b>chalk</b> exposure. The skin test result to <b>chalk</b> was positive in 5 of 12 cases, and the specific IgE test result was positive in all 12 study participants {{in which it was}} performed. Casein strongly inhibited the binding of IgE to <b>chalk.</b> <b>Chalk</b> sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed proteins with molecular weight similar to caseins.
