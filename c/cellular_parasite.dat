Several host factors that restrict HIV and other retroviral infections have also recently been described. Here we demonstrate that Mov 10, a protein associated with P-bodies that has a putative RNA-helicase domain, when overexpressed in cells can inhibit the production of infectious retroviruses. Interestingly, reducing the endogenous Mov 10 levels in virus-producing cells through siRNA treatment also modestly suppresses HIV infectivity. The actions of Mov 10 {{are not limited to}} HIV, however, as ectopic expression of Mov 10 restricts the production of other lentiviruses as well as the gammaretrovirus, murine leukemia virus. We found that HIV produced in the presence of high levels of Mov 10 is restricted at the pre-reverse transcription stage in target cells. Finally, we show that either helicase mutation or truncation of the C-terminal half of Mov 10, where a putative RNA-helicase domain is located, maintained most of its HIV inhibition; whereas removing the N-terminal half of Mov 10 completely abolished its activity on HIV. Together these results suggest that Mov 10 could be required during the lentiviral lifecycle and that its perturbation disrupts generation of infectious viral particles. Because Mov 10 is implicated as part of the P-body complex, these findings point to the potential role of cytoplasmic RNA processing machinery in infectious retroviral production...|$|R

Furthermore, the molecular pathways that control gene expression are often the target of <b>cellular</b> <b>parasites,</b> such as viruses. Gene expression is controlled through multiple mechanisms that are coordinated to ensure the proper and timely expression of each gene. Many of these mechanisms target the life cycle of the RNA molecule, from transcription to translation. Recently, another layer of regulation at the RNA level involving RNA modifications has gained renewed interest of the scientific community. The discovery that N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), a modification present in mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, can be removed by the activity of RNA demethylases, launched the field of epitranscriptomics; the study of how RNA function is regulated through the addition or removal of post-transcriptional modifications, similar to strategies used to regulate gene expression at the DNA and protein level. The abundance of RNA post-transcriptional modifications is determined by the activity of writer complexes (methylase) and eraser (RNA demethylase) proteins. Subsequently, the effects of RNA modifications materialize as changes in RNA structure and/or modulation of interactions between the modified RNA and RNA binding proteins or regulatory RNAs. Disruption of these pathways impairs gene expression and cellular function. This review focuses on the links between the RNA modification m 6 A and its implications in human diseases...|$|R

Lysis of nucleocapsids then releases viral DNA, and two final phenol-chloroform steps remove remaining proteins. The final DNA captured from solution is highly concentrated and pure, with an average OD 260 / 280 of 1. 90.

Hence, blockage of this important process through therapeutic induction of apoptosis in their embryonic stages offers promise for developing effective anti-parasitic measures against these extra <b>cellular</b> <b>parasites.</b> However, unlike {{in the case of}} protozoan parasites, induction of apoptosis as a therapeutic approach is yet to be explored against metazoan helminth parasites. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For the first time, here we developed and evaluated flow cytometry based assays to assess several conserved features of apoptosis in developing embryos of a pathogenic filarial nematode Setaria digitata, in-vitro as well as ex-vivo. We validated programmed cell death in developing embryos by using immuno-fluorescence microscopy and scoring expression profile of nematode specific proteins related to apoptosis [e. g. CED- 3, CED- 4 and CED- 9].  Mechanistically, apoptotic death of embryonic stages was found to be a caspase dependent phenomenon mediated primarily through induction of intracellular ROS. The apoptogenicity of some pharmacological compounds viz. DEC, Chloroquine, Primaquine and Curcumin were also evaluated. Curcumin was found to be the most effective pharmacological agent followed by Primaquine while Chloroquine displayed minimal effect and DEC had no demonstrable effect. Further, demonstration of induction of apoptosis in embryonic stages by lipid peroxidation products [molecules commonly associated with inflammatory responses in filarial disease] and demonstration of in-situ apoptosis of developing embryos in adult parasites in a natural bovine model of filariasis have offered a framework to understand anti-fecundity host immunity operational against parasitic helminths.

40|$|Abstract Background Toxoplasmosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{parasitic}} infections in humans. It can establish chronic infection and is characterized by the formation of tissue cysts in the brain. The cysts remain largely quiescent for the life of the host, but can reactivate and cause life-threatening toxoplasmic encephalitis in immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS, neoplastic diseases and organ transplants. Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor MyD 88 activation is required for the innate sensing of Toxoplasma gondii. Mice deficient in MyD 88 have defective IL- 12 and Th 1 effector responses, and are highly susceptible to the acute phase of T. gondii infection. However, the role of this signaling pathway during cerebral infection is poorly understood and requires examination. Method MyD 88 -deficient mice and control mice were orally infected with T. gondii cysts. <b>Cellular</b> and <b>parasite</b> infiltration in the peripheral organs and in the brain were determined by histology and immunohistochemistry. Cytokine levels were determined by ELISA and chemokine mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR (qPCR). Results Thirteen days after infection, a higher parasite burden was observed but there was no histological change in the liver, heart, lungs and small intestine of MyD 88 −/− and MyD 88 +/+ mice. However, MyD 88 −/− mice compared to MyD 88 +/+ mice were highly susceptible to cerebral infection, displayed high parasite migration to the brain, severe neuropathological signs of encephalitis and succumbed within 2 weeks of oral infection. Susceptibility was primarily associated with lower expression of Th 1 cytokines, especially IL- 12, IFN-γ and TNF-α, significant decrease in the expression of CCL 3, CCL 5, CCL 7 and CCL 19 chemokines, marked defect of CD 8 + T cells, and infiltration of CD 11 b + and F 4 / 80 + cells in the brain. Conclusion MyD 88 is essential for the protection of mice during the cerebral installation of T. gondii infection. These results establish a role for MyD 88 in T cell-mediated control of T. gondii in the central nervous system (CNS). </p...|$|R
40|$|Leishmaniasis {{develops}} after parasites {{establish themselves}} as amastigotes inside mammalian cells and start replicating. As relatively few parasites survive the innate immune defence, intracellular amastigotes spreading towards uninfected cells is instrumental to disease progression. Nevertheless {{the mechanism of}} Leishmania dissemination remains unclear, mostly {{due to the lack}} of a reliable model of infection spreading. Here, an in vitro model representing the dissemination of Leishmania amastigotes between human macrophages has been developed. Differentiated THP- 1 macrophages were infected with GFP expressing Leishmania aethiopica and Leishmania mexicana. The percentage of infected cells was enriched via camptothecin treatment to achieve 64 · 1 ± 3 % (L. aethiopica) and 92 ± 1 · 2 % (L. mexicana) at 72 h, compared to 35 ± 4 · 2 % (L. aethiopica) and 36 · 2 ± 2 · 4 % (L. mexicana) in untreated population. Infected cells were co-cultured with a newly differentiated population of THP- 1 macrophages. Spreading was detected after 12 h of co-culture. Live cell imaging showed inter-cellular extrusion of L. aethiopica and L. mexicana to recipient cells took place independently of host cell lysis. Establishment of secondary infection from Leishmania infected cells provided an insight into the <b>cellular</b> phenomena of <b>parasite</b> movement between human macrophages. Moreover, it supports further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of parasites spreading, which forms the basis of disease development...|$|R
40|$|Papain-like {{cysteine}} proteases {{of malaria}} parasites degrade haemoglobin in an acidic food vacuole to provide amino acids for intraerythrocytic parasites. These proteases are potential drug targets because their inhibitors block parasite development, and efforts are underway to develop chemotherapeutic inhibitors of these proteases as the treatments for malaria. Plasmodium knowlesi {{has recently been}} shown to be an important human pathogen in parts of Asia. We report expression and characterization of three P. knowlesi papain-like proteases, termed knowpains (KP 2 - 4). Recombinant knowpains were produced using a bacterial expression system, and tested for various biochemical properties. Antibodies against recombinant knowpains were generated and used to determine their <b>cellular</b> localization in <b>parasites.</b> Inhibitory effects of the cysteine protease inhibitor E 64 were assessed on P. knowlesi culture to validate drug target potential of knowpains. All three knowpains were present in the food vacuole, active in acidic pH, and capable of degrading haemoglobin at the food vacuolar pH (< 5. 5), suggesting roles in haemoglobin degradation. The proteases showed absolute (KP 2 and KP 3) to moderate (KP 4) preference for peptide substrates containing leucine at the P 2 position; KP 4 preferred arginine at the P 2 position. While the three knowpains appear to have redundant roles in haemoglobin degradation, KP 4 may also have a role in degradation of erythrocyte cytoskeleton during merozoite egress, as it displayed broad substrate specificity and was primarily localized at the parasite periphery. Importantly, E 64 blocked erythrocytic development of P...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} induction of pancarditis in mice {{by the use}} of Trypanosoma brucei brucei is reported. The {{sequential analysis}} of whole-organ sections demonstrated the presence of trypanosomes in the cardiac structures from the fourth week after infection. Parasites predominated on the endocardial and epicardial side but were also present in the valves, the conducting system, and the lymphatic system draining the heart, the latter being particularly evident in late infection. At the time of parasite invasion, deposits of IgM and IgG and of complement (C 3) appeared in the tissues. Also at this time parasitemia reached a plateau, and the circulating specific antitrypanosomal antibodies, the serum Ig and C 3, as well as the Clq activity, reached pathologic levels. <b>Cellular</b> response followed <b>parasite</b> invasion and appeared to be similar to that described in human African trypanosomiasis. In late infection, the draining lymph nodes showed a marked histiocytic proliferation, and the vessels became convoluted and distended. The suggested pathogenic mechanisms involve immunologic and mechanical factors. It is possible that the immunologic process prepares for a simultaneous or subsequent parasite invasion of the tissues with an associated inflammatory response. The partial obstruction of the lymphatic cardiac draining system probably accounts at least in part for the peculiar distribution of the parasite-induced lesions. A therapeutic trial was unsuccessful, but the persistence of trypanosomes in the tissues when circulating parasites were no longer detectable may account for relapses...|$|R
