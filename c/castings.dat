5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized <b>castings,</b> which is why die casting produces more <b>castings</b> than any other casting process. Die <b>castings</b> are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|Maximum weight {{limits for}} aluminium, brass, {{magnesium}} and zinc <b>castings</b> are approximately , , , and , respectively.|$|E
5|$|Ohio is {{considered}} the historical center of steel production in the U.S. The state produces annually around 14 million tons, with a $7.2 billion state economic impact. The largest steel foundry in North America is located in Columbus, Columbus <b>Castings.</b> It was formerly part of Buckeye Steel <b>Castings,</b> which traces its root back to the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Bosses {{are added}} to die <b>castings</b> to serve as stand-offs and {{mounting}} points for parts that {{will need to be}} mounted. For maximum integrity and strength of the die casting, bosses must have universal wall thickness.|$|E
5|$|Two {{variants}} are pore-free die casting, {{which is}} used to eliminate gas porosity defects; and direct injection die casting, {{which is used}} with zinc <b>castings</b> to reduce scrap and increase yield.|$|E
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die <b>castings,</b> these <b>castings</b> can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized <b>castings,</b> forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches can be expensive, broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
5|$|From 1869 at the latest, {{the company}} owning the Walker Engine Works was Bells, Goodman & Co. In that year the firm made the {{tunnelling}} shield and iron <b>castings</b> to line the Tower subway tunnels. In 1871 the firm made pumping and winding engines for Seghill Colliery. In 1875 it made machinery to condense smoke and gases for Clyde Lead Works of Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|The Acurad {{system was}} the first die casting process that could {{successfully}} cast low-iron aluminum alloys, such as A356 and A357. In a traditional die casting process these alloys would solder to the die. Similarly, Acurad <b>castings</b> could be heat treated and meet the U.S. military specification MIL-A-21180.|$|E
5|$|Two aluminium-alloy <b>castings</b> joined {{together}} on the horizontal centreline. The upper portion bears the wheelcase, supercharger and accessories; and carries the cylinder blocks, crankshaft main bearings (split mild-steel shells lined with lead bronze alloy), {{and part of the}} housing for the airscrew reduction gear. The lower half forms an oil sump and carries the oil pumps and filters.|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die <b>castings,</b> and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die <b>castings</b> are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of the casting from the die. All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from the die. Die <b>castings</b> that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E
5|$|Forgemasters, {{founded in}} 1805, {{is the sole}} {{remaining}} independent steel works {{in the world and}} dominates the north east of Sheffield around the Lower Don Valley. The firm has a global reputation for producing the largest and most complex steel forgings and <b>castings</b> and is certified to produce critical nuclear components, with recent projects including the Royal Navy's Astute-class submarines. The firm also has the capacity for pouring the largest single ingot (570 tonnes) in Europe and is currently in the process of expanding its capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make <b>castings</b> of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like <b>castings,</b> splints or customized seatings.|$|E
5|$|The three {{cylinders}} of each bogie {{were cast}} in mono-block format, each surrounded by two annular inlet steam chests {{and a single}} large outlet steam chest. These had the added function of keeping the cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain the temperature and pressure of steam entering the cylinders. However, these <b>castings</b> were difficult to machine accurately. The steam-sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex, {{with each of the}} six cylinders and valve sleeves requiring 24 sealing rings.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is used {{in steel}} as an {{alloying}} element (ferro-titanium) to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer, and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content. Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), vanadium, copper (to harden), iron, manganese, molybdenum, and other metals. Titanium mill products (sheet, plate, bar, wire, forgings, <b>castings)</b> find application in industrial, aerospace, recreational, and emerging markets. Powdered titanium {{is used in}} pyrotechnics {{as a source of}} bright-burning particles.|$|E
5|$|When a mouse {{or other}} prey is spotted, the kite drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; {{sometimes}} in one long drop to ground level, {{more often in}} two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. Birds will have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or <b>castings.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or <b>castings,</b> a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free egress or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, and then the next tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|At trial, crucial {{testimony}} {{came from}} Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy {{in the vicinity}} of the Chi Omega House that evening, and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to <b>castings</b> of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.|$|E
5|$|Blast furnace: Although {{cast iron}} tools and weapons {{have been found}} in China dating to the 5th century BC, the {{earliest}} discovered Chinese blast furnaces, which produced pig iron that could be remelted and refined as cast iron in the cupola furnace, date to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, while the vast majority of early blast furnace sites discovered date to the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) period immediately following 117 BC with the establishment of state monopolies over the salt and iron industries during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141– 87 BC); most ironwork sites discovered dating before 117 BC acted merely as foundries which made <b>castings</b> for iron that had been smelted in blast furnaces elsewhere in remote areas far from population centres.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, the Angle Mills {{site was}} the largest steel plate factory in the world. In 1892, in {{addition}} to steelmaking, the company had a foundry (a mile from Consett at Crookhall) capable of making 150 tons of iron <b>castings</b> per week, and a brickworks capable of making around 12,000 bricks per week. The estate had grown to roughly 2,700 workers' cottages. The company ran a 16-bed infirmary to treat injured workers. The 6,000 workers were paid an average of £5.33 a month. The company continually invested in modern equipment, such as a Roots blower (a powerful air pump) that was acquired in 1893.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and <b>castings.</b> The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the main wheels retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural <b>castings,</b> and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. They were tasked with the founding and erection {{of the pier}} cylinders on the riverbed, and the erection and riveting of the twenty-one bowstring spans and the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the <b>castings</b> and the wrought iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.|$|E
5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a collapsible umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai. However, the Chinese collapsible umbrella is perhaps a concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. Zhou Dynasty bronze <b>castings</b> of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts—which {{could have been used}} for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} <b>castings</b> was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reputation}} of the Mars Works grew, so too did the demand for its products. After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland. Oliver Evans's son George was the first such order, having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill. George and the mill were highly successful, and generated a great deal of interest in Evans's engines across the interior. However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania, Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective. In 1811 Evans and George, as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens, founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company, which in addition to engines would, like the Mars Works, produce heavy machinery and <b>castings</b> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity, the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork, as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{memorial}} began in 1928 with the cut and placement of marble blocks from Macclesfield and Angaston. The South Australian Monumental Works {{were chosen to}} work on the construction, with Alan Tillett as the principal. Although no sculptor was named in the winning proposal, it did make mention of a possible candidate—who later proved to be Rayner Hoff, a Sydney-based sculptor born in England. Rayner Hoff produced the designs for the sculptures from his Sydney studio, with the bronze <b>castings</b> from Hoff's plaster models being produced by the South Australian firm A. W. Dobbie and Company. (Hoff had expressed reservations that a South Australian company would be capable of handling bronzes of the required size, but a test casting of the lion's head from {{the memorial}} was sufficient to overcome his concerns). The two angel reliefs sculpted from the Angaston marble were produced by Julius Henschke in situ from Hoff's designs, expressed through one-third sized plaster models which Henschke then scaled to suit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted two World's Fairs: the Panama-California Exposition in 1915 and the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style {{buildings}} that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The buildings were intended to be temporary structures, but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair. Most were eventually rebuilt, using <b>castings</b> of the original façades to retain the architectural style. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area's Spanish and Mexican past. In the 2010s there was a proposal for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of Balboa Park, but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy <b>castings</b> and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has an {{international}} reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. Many innovations in these fields {{have been made}} in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter. Thomas Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18thcentury. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations. Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), <b>Castings</b> Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI), and William Cook Group.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{plutonium}} core {{had to wait}} until Windscale delivered sufficient product, which was not until late 1951. The uranium tamper proved more of a challenge for the metallurgists than anticipated, due to a shortage of machine tools and moulds, and difficulty with the vacuum furnace. The first spheres were cast in December 1951, and while they were spherical to within , there were some casting defects, and it was feared they would hinder the implosion process. The defects were repaired, and two <b>castings</b> were prepared for Operation Hurricane. Work on plutonium chemistry and metallurgy was carried out at Harwell, as the hot laboratory at Aldermaston was not completed until May 1952. The first plutonium billet was cast there from plutonium nitrate from the Chalk River Laboratories in 1951. The metallurgists chose to alloy {{the plutonium}} with gallium to stabilise it in the malleable δ phase allotrope. Not until the first billet arrived from Harwell in 1951 were they able to confirm that this was practical. The first plutonium at Aldermaston was cast in an argon atmosphere in a cerium sulphide crucible.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 500 foundry units in Rajkot. The cluster came up mainly {{to cater to}} the casting {{requirements}} of the local diesel engine industry. The geographical spread of the cluster includes Aji Vasahat, Gondal Road, Bhavanagar Road areas, Shapar, Veraval and Metoda. The majority of foundry units in Rajkot produce grey iron <b>castings</b> for the domestic market. About 2% of the foundry units export <b>castings</b> such as electric motor <b>castings</b> and automobile <b>castings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The keywork is {{constructed}} by lost-wax <b>castings</b> and machining, with mounting posts and ribs silver-soldered to the tube. On the best flutes, the <b>castings</b> are forged {{to increase their}} strength.|$|E
