25|$|It {{took many}} years to build a <b>complete</b> <b>line</b> to serve the Northland Region, with {{different}} sections being developed at different times. Eventually {{it became clear that}} a main line was required to link these isolated railways to improve transport for both passengers and freight to and from New Zealand's northernmost region, and to open up land for greater economic development. However, the construction was not without criticism. In 1910, the Minister of Railways himself criticised the project, arguing that the project of extending it would bring little benefit, as most traffic from north of Auckland was already covered by only going as far as Helensville, while country to the north was poor and {{would not be able to}} support the line.|$|E
25|$|In 1939-1941 the Army Ordnance Corps was {{developing}} a <b>complete</b> <b>line</b> of tactical trucks that could operate over all roads and cross-country terrain in all weather. A 6-ton (5,400kg) payload rated 6×6 truck to tow anti-aircraft artillery was needed. Corbitt, {{a small company}} who had sold the US Army trucks since 1917, began delivering 200 prototypes in 1940. In 1941 their improved Model 50SD6, with a larger engine and different hood and fenders, was standardized and went into production. Shortly after White began building them, {{they would be the}} largest producer. Brockway began in 1942, and FWD in 1945. Ward LaFrance also built the chassis. Seven body types were built, some by more than one manufacturer. All manufacturer’s models were virtually identical, with very minor variations. Early models had closed cabs with full doors, in 1942 open cabs with half doors were introduced.|$|E
25|$|In 1939-1941 the Army Ordnance Corps was {{developing}} a <b>complete</b> <b>line</b> of tactical trucks that could operate over all roads and cross-country terrain in all weather. Corbitt, {{a small company}} which had sold the US Army trucks since 1917, was working on designs for heavy-duty conventional 6x6s trucks. In 1940 their designs for a 6-ton truck and a 10-ton wrecker chassis were standardized, with Corbitt to build 6-ton cargo trucks, while the 10-ton wreckers were contracted to Kenworth Motor Truck Corp. and Ward LaFrance Truck Corp. Ward LaFrance began production in 1941 and would build 4,925 vehicles. Kenworth began in 1942, but because of interruptions in manufacturing only built 840. At first the manufacturers' chassis were similar and used the same components. After the 1943 upgrade to -A1 standard, the two chassis were mechanically identical and parts were interchangeable. After the war, the rating of the 10-ton wrecker was lowered to 6-ton.|$|E

Although named Mega Man, the multi-colored figures were actually inspired by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the 1993 children's action series which was still popular {{at the time of the}} episode's original broadcast. The script was originally written with direct references to the Power Rangers, but Comedy Central asked Parker and Stone to change the name due to copyright issues. Cartman receives Ants in the Pants, an actual children's tabletop game, as a birthday present. Stone described Ants in the Pants as [...] "the lamest game ever", which is why Cartman responds so negatively to the gift in the episode.|$|E
