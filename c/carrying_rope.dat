30|$|Aerial ropeway is an {{effective}} alternative to the conventional modes of land public transport in metropolitan areas and cities. Construction of passenger aerial ropeways in urban environment is a very costly enterprise in terms of engineering and economics, and requires significant financial resources. This article is aimed at {{the development of the}} design method of the passenger aerial ropeway, ensuring the reduction in its construction cost. For this purpose, the individual components of the construction cost are considered, and the approximate calculation dependencies are proposed. It is shown that the cost of the aerial ropeway is mainly influenced by the installation step, height of intermediate towers and <b>carrying</b> <b>rope</b> tension. The task of the conditional nonlinear optimization of the given parameters is formulated and solved in the research. This task ensures the minimum cost of the aerial ropeway. The optimization task is done by taking into account possible limitations on the ropeway laying in the severely urbanized environment (the terrain, urban infrastructure arrangement, altitude performance of the urban development, technical characteristics of the <b>carrying</b> <b>rope,</b> etc.). Implementing the solution findings of the given optimization task makes it possible to significantly reduce the construction cost of aerial ropeways in urban environment.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. It is {{necessary}} to study the formalization of approaches to determination of energy reserves of aerial ropeways drives {{taking into account the}} twisting forces diagrams. Methodology. To determine the energy reserves the twisting forces diagrams were used. A method is based on the comparative analysis of areas of braking and power operation modes of ropeway drive. Their area depends on the road profile (length and overfall of clearance heights, <b>carrying</b> <b>rope</b> deflection) and location of the drive station (on the lower or the upper supporting points). Findings. The application of the method of energy accumulation in the braking mode with its subsequent consumption in the power mode enables to use the energy reserves of drives. Taking into account the relief, it is possible on the stage of planning to set the parameters the road profile, as well as to locate the drive station so that on the twisting forces diagram the areas of braking mode alternated with the areas of the power mode and were approximately equal in size. This, in turn, will save the electric power in the process of operation. Originality. The approach to determination of energy reserves of the aerial ropeway drives is offered. Practical value. The use of the offered method will help (before the construction) to calculate such a road profile, which will increase the areas of braking mode. The latter in turn will positively affect the size of the accumulated energy...|$|E

40|$|In {{article was}} {{formulated}} and {{solved the problem}} of conditional nonlinear optimization of the distance between inter-mediate supports during {{the design of the}} cable metro lines in highly urbanized environment, taking into account not the horizontal surface of the terrain. The optimization problem involves a single-criterion objective function that expresses the cost of construction of the cable metro line (total cost of intermediate supports and their foundations, traction and carrying steel cables and technical equipment). The specified objective function subject to minimization by finding the optimal combination of the distance between intermediate supports and tension <b>carrying</b> <b>ropes</b> with accounting con-structive, modal, structural and planning constraints in the form of nonlinear inequalities. When constructing the objec-tive function were considered three possible forms sagging of <b>carrying</b> <b>ropes,</b> which can be implemented for various values of the efforts of their tension. Analysis was done of the influence of the angle of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief along the line of the cable metro on the value of the optimal distance between intermediate supports de-pending on the design and cost of intermediate supports and at the cost of 1 km line of the cable metro. Quantitative calculations showed that with the increase of the longitudinal slope of the surface construction cost also increases with nonlinear increasing rate. The dependence of the cost of 1 km of line underground cable metro from the parameters of the relief is of extreme character with a pronounced minimum at small angles of inclination of the terrain surface about 3 [...] . 60 degrees. The position of the minimum is quite stable and only slightly changes when enough significant change in the cost of intermediate supports and installed on them technological equipment. The most effective conditions for the construction of the cable metro is the terrain with considerable differences in altitude {{along the length of the}} route of transport: only if the surface inclination of more than 50 [...] . 60 degrees cost of 1 km line starts to exceed the cost of 1 km line laid along a strictly horizontal surface. At small angles of inclination of the surface (less than 6 [...] . 8 degrees) to min-imize the cost of construction of the cable metro line requires more frequent installation of intermediate supports. How-ever, despite the possibility of building a lower and cheaper supports, the observed increased values of the cost of 1 km of optimum option of the line. At large angles of inclination of the surface a need for a more rare setup higher interme-diate supports. Within the tilt angle 10 [...] . 60 degrees the range of variation of the optimal step is small enough, amount-ing to no more than ± 10 % from the value of the step at an angle of inclination of the surface 10 degree. In the range of small angles of inclination of the terrain surface (3 [...] . 6 degrees) observed abrupt changes in the basic technical and eco-nomic characteristics of the cable metro lines. This is due to the change of the forms sagging of load-bearing ropes. The increase in the number of supporting ropes has a very small economic effect (within 4 %). It does not change the opti-mal characteristics of such line, as a step of the installation and the height of intermediate supports, shape and sagging boom <b>carrying</b> <b>ropes.</b> However, the significantly reduced diameter of the supporting rope and the horizontal force ten-sion. The increase in aggregate strength of <b>carrying</b> <b>ropes</b> provides a directly proportional increase in the optimal step installation of intermediate supports and leads to a marked decrease in the cost of construction of the cable metro lines. At the height of intermediate supports and the horizontal force of the tension <b>carrying</b> <b>ropes</b> of their aggregate strength influence practically does not, however, leads to a significant reduction in the required diameter of the supporting ropes. It also has a positive effect on reducing the cost characteristics of the construction cable metro line. The capacity of the line cable metro has a significant impact on the optimal values of some of its basic technical and economic characteris-tics, in particular, the cost of 1 km line, the step to install intermediate supports, tension and diameter of the supporting ropes. Its increase is possible by increasing the allowed speed passenger cabins and (or) their capacity and quantity. In all these cases, increasing capacity causes the increase in the cost of 1 km of line and the reduction step of the installa-tion of intermediate supports. The degree of influence these areas of increasing capacity is not the same, which suggests the presence for the given value of the theoretical capacity of an optimal combination of speed, capacity and number of passenger cabins, which will be achieved the greatest technical and economic effect during the construction of the cable metro line...|$|R
