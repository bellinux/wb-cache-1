5000|$|In {{the first}} hearing, the {{magistrate}} normally does not hear arguments nor conduct formal trial; instead, the magistrate normally reads the charges out loud before the accused {{and lets the}} accused {{have the chance to}} plead guilty or not guilty. Knowing the fact that the accused has been summonsed and informed of the charges, repeating the charges in open court to the accused seems very repetitive and redundant. In fact, it is necessary. First, the Secretary for Justice has the discretionary power to remove and <b>change</b> <b>charges</b> in between the first hearing and the time the prosecutors first formally issue charges according to the situation, evidence, and findings; thus, repeating charges before the accused can assure and verify the charges he is facing. Moreover, repeating the charges can prevent potential administrative errors (like, mixing up files due to similar names). Lastly, the accused is charged by the government which represents the society; thus, the public have the right to know what crime the accused is involved. As a result, repeating charges before the accused in open court can ensure justice, transparency, and fairness. In conclusion, in the first hearing, one of the following situations is going to happen: ...|$|E

The accumulation circuit is configured to <b>change</b> <b>charges</b> on charge storage elements during a phase in dependence on image element signals of associated image elements, and to change an association between the storage elements and the image elements in successive phases such that the charge depends on image element signals of a set of image elements in a set of phases. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for operating an image sensor with a set of image elements configured to provide associated image element signals (2) a computer program for performing a method for operating an image sensor with a set of image elements configured to provide associated image element signals (3) a computer program for performing a method for operating an image sensor with a set of image elements configured to provide associated image element signals. USE - Image sensor e. g. time-delayed integration complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} image sensor and charge coupled device image sensor, for use in inspection systems and positioning systems, automobile systems, or automotive systems such as lane detection systems, pre-accident sensor technologies and pedestrian protection and topography measurements. ADVANTAGE - The sensor obtains a sharp mapping of pictures moved with respect to the sensor. The sensor allows a realization in a CMOS technology. The sensor allows a particularly cost-effective realization, when the realization of charge storage elements and the realization of a changeable association between charge storage elements and image elements are implemented in a conventional technology at a low cost. The sensor provides an operational speed that is increased by avoiding the bucket-brigade principle. The sensor avoids a loss of quality by smearing of charge...|$|E

Results of molecular dynamics computer simulations in the explicit solvent have been combined with mode-coupling diffusion models including and neglecting the molecule-solvent correlations.

The <b>change</b> in <b>charge</b> distribution is modelled by mixing occupied and unoccupied orbitals of the gas-phase system.

The overall energy is comprised of two terms, that due to the internal molecular energy and that due to the electrostatic interaction of charged species in the solid state, which stabilises the more ionic structures. The overall energy is calculated as a function of θ, and the lowest-energy arrangement is identified. Initial calculations are made on the system in the gas phase, using semi-empirical Hartree-Fock theory. The results produced by this calculation are then input into the model, which calculates the energy and charge distribution for the solid phase. The model has been applied to the LiF system.
