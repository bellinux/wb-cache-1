5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and <b>cantle</b> projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E

25|$|Manx2's Belfast-Cork route was {{operated}} on the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) of Flightline S.L., based in Barcelona. As such Flightline {{was responsible for}} controlling all operational matters relating to that service. In practice many day-to-day decisions were taken by Manx2 in its Isle of Man office. One such decision was the pairing of Lopez and <b>Cantle</b> to crew flight 7100 on 10 February. Correct adherence to European aviation regulations (EU-OPS) by the AOC-holder should have prevented this inappropriate pairing of a newly promoted captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer. It had come about because <b>Cantle</b> was drafted in to replace the pilot who was originally rostered as first officer for the flight when he became unavailable. Flightline {{was not aware of}} the change in personnel.|$|E

25|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature of western style riding {{is in the}} saddle, which has a substantial tree that provides greater support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a lariat after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high <b>cantle.</b> The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to {{be attached to the}} saddle.|$|E

The first officer had logged 539 total hours, of which 289 were on the aircraft type. Their pairing together on the flight was considered inappropriate and highly unusual, due to their shared lack of total experience. Both pilots were certified for Instrument landing system CAT I; neither pilot, however, was certified for CAT II.|$|E
25|$|Saddles in Asia {{date back}} several {{thousand}} {{years to the}} time of the Scythians and Cimmerians. Modern Asian saddles can be divided into two groups: Saddles from Central Asia, which have a prominent horn and leather covering, and saddles from East Asia, which have a high pommel and <b>cantle.</b> Central Asian saddles are noted for their wide seats and high horns. The saddle has a base of wood with a thin leather covering that frequently has a lacquer finish. Central Asian saddles have no pad and must be ridden with a saddle blanket. The horn comes in particular good use during the rough horseback sport of buskashi, played throughout Central Asia, which involves two teams of riders wrestling over a decapitated goat’s carcass.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{emerging}} policy debate on interculturalism we critically review two recent books in 2012 : Bouchard’s L’interculturalisme: un point de vue quebecois, and <b>Cantle’s</b> Interculturalism: The New Era of Cohesion and Diversity. In my view, both contribute very directly {{to open a}} foundational debate on interculturalism. In addressing the point of convergence and the dividing lines of these two contributions, I will claim {{that in spite of}} having one core concept of interculturalism, there are, however, at least two basic conceptions that have to be interpreted in complementary ways: Bouchard’s essay represents the contractual strand, <b>Cantle’s</b> book the cohesion strand. At the end I would also suggest that these two strands do not manage to express explicitly that diversity can also be seen as a resource of innovation and creativity, and so can drive individual and social development. This view is based on the diversity advantage literature already informing most of the diversity debate in Europe and elsewhere. This is what I will call the constructivist strand. My ultimate purpose is to defend a comprehensive view, grounded on the argument that no one can have the sole authority to define intercultural policy, since the three strands can be applied at different moments, according to different purposes and policy needs. The challenge now is that policy managers be able to achieve a balance between these three policy drivers...|$|R
60|$|On Egdon {{there was}} no {{absolute}} hour of the day. The time at any moment was a number of varying doctrines professed by the different hamlets, some of them having originally grown up from a common root, and then become divided by secession, some having been alien from the beginning. West Egdon believed in Blooms-End time, East Egdon {{in the time of}} the Quiet Woman Inn. Grandfer <b>Cantle's</b> watch had numbered many followers in years gone by, but since he had grown older faiths were shaken. Thus, the mummers having gathered hither from scattered points each came with his own tenets on early and late; and they waited a little longer as a compromise.|$|R
500|$|The saddle {{with a solid}} tree {{provided}} a bearing surface to protect the horse from {{the weight of the}} rider. The Romans are credited with the invention of the solid-treed saddle, possibly as early as the 1st century BC, and it was widespread by the 2nd century AD. [...] Early medieval saddles resembled the Roman [...] "four-horn" [...] saddle, and were used without stirrups. The development of the solid saddle tree was significant; it raised the rider above the horse's back, and distributed the rider's weight, reducing the pounds per square inch carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus [...] greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life. Horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree. [...] It also allowed a more built up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle. [...] From the 12th century on, the high war-saddle became more common, providing protection as well as added security. The built up <b>cantle</b> of a solid-treed saddle enabled horsemen to use lance more effectively.|$|E

[...] Or, in lieu of rings, a design used on English saddles utilizes a t-shaped brace that is inserted under the saddle between the rear panels and the tree.|$|E
5000|$|The early Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and Xbox {{versions}} of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 were criticized for {{their lack of}} online support outside Japan. Gerstmann commented that online multiplayer would have added {{a lot to the}} game's appeal. In his Xbox review, Aaron Boulding of IGN was particularly critical over its exclusion, citing Capcom's failure to deliver on its promise for Xbox Live support as the reason for his low score. However, following the release of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 ports, critics praised the game for providing a smooth online multiplayer experience. Topher <b>Cantler</b> of Destructoid praised the network performance, calling it [...] "outstanding" [...] and [...] "flawless". Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com stated that the addition of online play made the game [...] "an essential purchase".|$|R
50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{finding in}} Fujinoki was {{the remnants of}} a saddle, which were not often found in their entirety in other tombs. This saddle was adorned with gilt-bronze, arc-shaped ornaments that were attached to the wooden <b>cantles.</b> The saddle mainly consisted of two bows, in the front and the rear, which would have had straps that looped under the accompanying part of the horse for stability. These bows had a section dedicated to decoration that was reinforced by a thick, heavy outer frame and a thick, lower arc for buckles. Only the rear bow had a special middle piece that was completely missing from the front bow. The rear bow appeared to be less extravagant and lacked decoration, indicating this was an afterthought, while the front bow’s ornamentation was full and complete.|$|R

2500|$|Saddles from East Asia {{differ from}} Central Asian saddles by their high pommel and <b>cantle</b> {{and lack of}} a horn. East Asian saddles {{can be divided into}} several types that are {{associated}} with certain nationalities and ethnic groups. Saddles used by the Han Chinese are noted by their use of inlay work for ornamentation. Tibetan saddles typically employ iron covers inlaid with precious metals on the pommel and <b>cantle</b> and universally come with padding. [...] Mongolian saddles are similar to the Tibetan style except that they are typically smaller and the seat has a high ridge. Saddles from ethnic minority groups in China’s southwest, such as in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, have colorful lacquer work over a leather covering.|$|E
2500|$|In {{interviews}} {{with both the}} Oldham Evening Chronicle and BBC Radio, <b>Cantle</b> accused some community leaders of hindering progress because {{they were worried about}} losing their political influence.

5000|$|It {{has also}} been {{asserted}} that modern reenactment and experimental archaeology {{has shown that the}} stirrup provides very little benefit for a mounted lancer, and a <b>cantled</b> saddle and spurs have a greater effect. White noted the importance of the prior emergence of the saddle, but argued, [...] "The stirrup made possible—although it did not demand—a vastly more effective mode of attack" [...] (than a blow [...] "delivered with the strength of shoulder and biceps"): [...] "now the rider could lay his lance at rest, held between the upper arm and the body, and make at his foe, delivering the blow not with his muscles but with the combined weight of himself and his charging stallion." [...] Stirrups provide stability for striking in melee after the initial cavalry charge.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of GATC (Dam-recognition) sites in available E. coli DNA sequences (representing about 2 % of the chromosome) {{has been determined}} by a simple numerical analysis. Our approach was to analyze the nucleotide composition of nine large sequenced DNA stretches ("cantles") {{in order to identify}} patterns of GATC distribution and to rationalize such patterns in biological/structural terms. The following observations were made: (i) In addition to oriC, GATC-rich regions are present in numerous locations. (ii) There is a wide variation in GATC frequency both between and within DNA <b>cantles</b> which led to the identification of a void-cluster pattern of GATC arrangement. The distance between two GATCs was never greater than 2 kb. (iii) GATC sites are found more frequently in translated regions than (in decreasing order) non-coding or non-translated regions. In particular, rRNA and tRNA encoding genes exhibit the lowest GATC content...|$|R
50|$|The {{best known}} usage of {{military}} lances {{was that of}} the full-gallop closed-ranks charge of a group of knights with underarm-couched lances, against lines of infantry, archery regiments, defensive embankments, and opposition cavalry. Two variants on the couched lance charge developed, the French method, en haie, with lancers in a double line and the German method, with lancers drawn up in a deeper formation which was often wedge-shaped. It is commonly believed that this became the dominant European cavalry tactic in the 11th century after the development of the <b>cantled</b> saddle and stirrups (the Great Stirrup Controversy), and of rowel spurs (which enabled better control of the mount). Cavalry thus outfitted and deployed had a tremendous collective force in their charge, and could shatter most contemporary infantry lines. Recent evidence has suggested, however, that the lance charge was effective without the benefit of stirrups.|$|R
