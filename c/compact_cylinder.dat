50|$|The Ducati ST4s {{was based}} on the ST4, but had {{improved}} suspension and a larger engine, using the liquid-cooled Desmoquattro (four desmodromic valves) 90° V-twin engine based on the Ducati 996. The Desmoquattro was largely unchanged from the 996 Superbike, and retained a valve angle of 40°, but lost 4 mm of diameter on each of the intake throttle bodies (down from 54 mm on the 996). Chassis clearances also required the use of the more <b>compact</b> <b>cylinder</b> head design that was shared with the 748 Superbike and Monster S4. In spite of the smaller intakes, the ST4s actually made slightly more power and torque than the 996 Superbike due to the mostly straight-through design of the ST's exhaust, compared to the under-seat exhaust of the Superbike.|$|E
50|$|A {{horizontally}} opposed engine, {{also called}} a flat or boxer engine, has two banks of cylinders {{on opposite sides}} of a centrally located crankcase. The engine is either air-cooled or liquid-cooled, but air-cooled versions predominate. Opposed engines are mounted with the crankshaft horizontal in airplanes, but may be mounted with the crankshaft vertical in helicopters. Due to the cylinder layout, reciprocating forces tend to cancel, resulting in a smooth running engine. Opposed-type engines have high power-to-weight ratios because they have a comparatively small, lightweight crankcase. In addition, the <b>compact</b> <b>cylinder</b> arrangement reduces the engine’s frontal area and allows a streamlined installation that minimizes aerodynamic drag. These engines always have an even number of cylinders, since a cylinder {{on one side of the}} crankcase “opposes” a cylinder on the other side.|$|E

50|$|The Roll Out Solar Array, {{known as}} ROSA, is a solar array {{designed}} by NASA. This {{new type of}} solar array provides much more energy than the old solar arrays. Traditional solar panels used to power satellites can be bulky with heavy panels folded together using mechanical hinges. When launching into space, mass and volume are everything, and ROSA is 20 percent lighter and four times smaller in volume than rigid panel arrays. It is a flexible and rollable solar array like a measuring tape wound on its spool. The new solar array design rolls up to form a <b>compact</b> <b>cylinder</b> for launch with significantly less mass and volume, potentially offering substantial cost savings {{as well as an}} increase in power for satellites. Being smaller and lighter than the traditional solar panels, ROSA has a center wing made of a flexible material which support the strings of photovoltaic cells that churn out electrical energy. Both the sides of the wing have a narrow arm that extends through the length of the wing to provide support to the array, called a high strain composite boom. The booms look like split tubes made of a stiff composite material, flattened and rolled up lengthwise.The array does not need any motor to unfurl.This is achieved using the energy stored in the booms that is released as each boom transitions from a coil shape to a straight support arm. Those solar wings are then deployed due to strain energy in rolled booms that are present at the two ends of the structure.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use {{of ground}} {{granulated}} {{blast furnace slag}} (ggbs) is well established in many cement applications where it provides enhanced urability, including high resistance to chloride penetration, resistance tosulphate attack and protection against alkali silica reaction (ASR). The use of ggbs in soil stabilization is, however, still a novel process in the UK {{although it has been}} used in South Africa. This paper eports on efforts to extend the use of ggbs to highway and other foundation layers by determining the beneficial effect which it has on the reduction of expansion due to the presence of sulphates. The paper describes the results of laboratory tests on lime-stabilized kaolinite containing different levels of added sulphate to which different amounts of ggbs have been added. The tests determine the strength development of <b>compacted</b> <b>cylinders,</b> moist cured in a humid environment a 30 ~ and the linear expansion of these moist cured cylinders on soaking in water.

40|$|BackgroundLoss of nipple {{projection}} is {{a common}} problem following nipple reconstruction. The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate that the use of a tightly rolled dermal graft is effective in the long-term maintenance of nipple projection. MethodsNipple reconstruction was performed using the C-V flap technique. A dermal graft was harvested from the dog-ear portion of previous scars. The graft was rolled tightly into a <b>compact</b> <b>cylinder</b> and used to augment the nipple reconstruction. Postoperatively, stacked Allevyn dressing was used for protecting the nipple from compression for a minimum of two months. Nipple projection was measured at the time of surgery and at 12 months postoperatively. ResultsForty nipple reconstructions were performed using this technique. There were 19 transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flaps, 10 latissimus dorsi (LD) flaps, and 11 tissue-expanded breast mounds. At one year, the mean projection was 0. 80 cm (range, 0. 62 - 1. 22 cm). The twelve-month average maintenance of nipple projection was 70. 2 % for the TRAM flap group, 76. 3 % for the LD flap group, and 61. 8 % for the tissue-expanded group. In two patients with previous irradiation of the reconstructed breasts, relatively poor maintenance of nipple projection was noted (45. 7 %). No complications were noted, and all of the donor sites healed well primarily. ConclusionsOur results demonstrated that the use of a C-V flap with a tightly rolled dermal graft for nipple reconstruction improves the long-term maintenance of nipple projection. Its advantages include reproducibility, technical simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and minimal donor site morbidity...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a Thesis project at the Master Programme in Industrial Design Engineering at Luleå University of Technology (LTU). The project took place between Januari and August 2012 and the goal is to develop a new kind of hand held pump for people with rheumatism. The project is {{initiated}} by Fredrik Martinsson, a client based in Mölndal, but the work is done at LTU. The purpose is to develop a new user friendly product to make it easier for people with lowered functionality in their hands to inflate car- and bicycle tires. Existing pumps are based on outdated technology and contain a lot of cumbersome steps during use. The client’s requirements focus on a user friendly product and quick usage which excludes the possibility of a completely manual pump. To meet the specific demands the development work aims to design a portable product that is easy to carry with a propulsion method fast enough to inflate a tire in a matter of seconds. Limitations during the project is an additional market analysis, regarding market potential, other than the one received from the client. It will therefore be assumed that there is an existing need for the product and that the primary users are people with rheumatism and also people who seek a user friendly and fast pump. The overall goal is a fully functional prototype. Package design and marketing material will not be considered. The project started out with conventional methods for project management and a project plan, time plan and included acitivies were discussed with the client. A product development process consisting of four different phases with dedicated deliverables was created. The first phase consists of convergent data collection with user studies, interviews and benchmarking. A problem statement and requirements list were made and lay the foundation for the second creative ideation phase. The quantitative amount of ideas generated were evaluated with numerous methods and a set of concepts were created for further development. The concepts were then refined with sketches, mock-ups and computer models in the third phase to narrow the solution space down to one final concept. Before the fourth and last phase, concepts were evaluated once more and one final direction was chosen for embodiment design. The winning concept was concretized to a finished product with a fully functioning prototype, manufacturing drawings, methods and authentic computer renderings. The result is a new-to-the-world portable pump based on usage in a standing position. This reduces the strain on finger joints, wrist as well as hips, back and knees. The product folds up to a small <b>compact</b> <b>cylinder</b> for transportation which meets the dimensional requirements and is then unfolded with a spring-loaded telescope function before use.

The main aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the potential of utilizing POFA and RHA as sustainable stabilizer material as partial replacement of traditional one which is lime and Portland Cement (PC). Laboratory investigations were carried out to establish the potential utilization of Malaysian Agricultural wastes POFA and RHA in stabilizing Teluk Kapas Landfill soil.

40|$|In vivo and {{in vitro}} {{multichannel}} field and somatic intracellular recordings are frequently {{used to study}} mechanisms of network pattern generation. When interpreting these data, neurons are often implicitly considered as electrotonically <b>compact</b> <b>cylinders</b> with a homogeneous distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. However, the actual distributions of dendritic length, diameter, and the densities of excitatory and inhibitory input are non-uniform and cell type-specific. We first review quantitative data on the dendritic structure and synaptic input and output distribution of pyramidal cells and interneurons in the hippocampal CA 1 area. Second, using multicompartmental passive models of four different types of neurons, we quantitatively explore the effect of differences in dendritic structure and synaptic distribution on the errors and biases of voltage clamp measurements of inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents. Finally, using the 3 -dimensional distribution of dendrites and synaptic inputs we calculate how different inhibitory and excitatory inputs contribute to the generation of local field potential in the hippocampus. We analyze these effects at different realistic background activity levels as synaptic bombardment influences neuronal conductance and thus the propagation of signals in the dendritic tree. We conclude that, since dendrites are electrotonically long and entangled in 3 D, somatic intracellular and field potential recordings miss the majority of dendritic events in some cell types, and thus overemphasize the importance of perisomatic inhibitory inputs and belittle the importance of complex dendritic processing. Modeling results also suggest that pyramidal cells and inhibitory neurons probably use different input integration strategies. In pyramidal cells, second- and higher-order thin dendrites are relatively well-isolated from each other, which may support branch-specific local processing as suggested by studies of active dendritic integration. In the electrotonically compact parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-containing interneurons, synaptic events are visible in the whole dendritic arbor, and thus the entire dendritic tree may form a single integrative element. Calretinin-containing interneurons {{were found to be}} electrotonically extended, which suggests the possibility of complex dendritic processing in this cell type.

Although small amounts of gypsum further reduced these parameters, higher gypsum levels (up to 8 wt%) produced substantial water absorption, extreme expansion and high swelling pressures.

Because it was believed that some of the fine sand might be transported through the gravel and rock by the percolating water, a 14 -mesh screen and a 2 -inch later of clear fine gravel (3 / 162 ̆ 2 - 3 / 82 ̆ 2) was placed over the gravelly material being tested. After the percolation-consolidation test was completed, the screen and fine gravel was removed and the fine graved was screened on a No. 14 screen. This minus No. 14 material which had been transported out of the sample was then weighed and computed as the percent of the total percolation sample...|$|R
