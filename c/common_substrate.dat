The most <b>common</b> <b>substrate</b> is glass, {{due to its}} transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. The reflective coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass {{on one side and}} the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if it is}} not a <b>common</b> <b>substrate</b> for metabolism, benzene can be {{oxidized}} by both {{bacteria and}} eukaryotes. In bacteria, dioxygenase enzyme can add an oxygen to the ring, and the unstable product is immediately reduced (by NADH) to a cyclic diol with two double bonds, breaking the aromaticity. Next, the diol is newly reduced by NADH to catechol. The catechol is then metabolized to acetyl CoA and succinyl CoA, used by organisms mainly in the Krebs Cycle for energy production.|$|E
500|$|Another form of monistic Vedanta is Vishishtadvaita (Qualified Non-Dualism) as posited by the {{eleventh}} century philosopher Ramanuja. Ramanuja criticized Advaita Vedanta by arguing that consciousness is always intentional {{and that it is}} also always a property of something. Ramanuja's Brahman is defined by a multiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity. This doctrine is called [...] "samanadhikaranya" [...] (several things in a <b>common</b> <b>substrate).</b>|$|E

500|$|Asplenium bradleyi can {{be found}} on steep, acidic rocks from altitudes of [...] Sandstone is a <b>common</b> <b>substrate,</b> {{but it can also be}} found on schist, gneiss, granite, or other acidic rocks. Like A.montanum, the soil formed when these rocks weather must be subacid (pH 4.5–5.0) to mediacid (pH 3.5–4.0) to support A.bradleyi; it is {{slightly}} calcium-tolerant. It usually grows tightly wedged into horizontal or vertical crevices in exposed rock or cliff faces. These microsites are too small for most other vascular plants to survive, except for a few other spleenworts. Some mosses and lichens may occur in the same habitat. The soil there is typically composed of a mixture of acidic sand weathered from the rock and decomposing organic materials, often including old fronds. Fronds are frequently lost and decompose in summer when the soil is drier, but the crevices are usually moist or wet in winter and spring. Some shade may be present, but dense shade is not tolerated. A.bradleyi specializes in growing in this rather hostile environment, and competes poorly with other plants in even slightly richer environments.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{manifest}} reality {{is described as}} Kula (a variant form of the term Kaula), the unifying factor, the Deity, is termed Akula.

2500|$|On a {{molecular}} level, amino acid residues at different locations of a protein may evolve non-independently {{because they have}} a direct physicochemical interaction, or indirectly by their interactions with a <b>common</b> <b>substrate</b> or through long-range interactions in the protein structure. [...] Conversely, the folded structure of a protein could potentially be inferred from the distribution of residue interactions. One of the earliest applications of ancestral reconstruction, to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein through residue contacts, was published by Shindyalov and colleagues. Phylogenies relating 67 different protein families were generated by a distance-based clustering method (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean, UPGMA), and ancestral sequences were reconstructed by parsimony. The authors reported a weak but significant tendency for co-evolving pairs of residues to be co-located in the known three-dimensional structure of the proteins.|$|E

2500|$|The {{grouping}} of Dacian, Illyrian and Thracian languages into a Thraco-Illyrian {{branch of the}} Indo-European language family, a widespread idea {{in the first half}} of the 20thcentury, has lost popularity because of the lack of convincing evidence. Similarly, the supposed close relationship between Dacian and Thracian remains unproven. There are around 100 Romanian words with a possible substratum origin, but the language from which they were transferred cannot be determined. Around 30% of these words represent the specific vocabulary of sheep- and goat-breeding. Moreover, about 70 possible substrate words, have Albanian cognates. István Schütz argues that the fact that [...] "the same Albanian phone is represented by multiple phones in Romanian, and the same Romanian phone may derive from different Albanian phones" [...] suggests an [...] "AlbanianRomanian symbiosis" [...] lasting more than one century. Alexandru Madgearu and other scholars refuse this idea, stating that [...] "the common elements are less significant than the differences" [...] between the two languages. Albanian, Romanian and other languages sharing some common morphological and syntactic characteristics form together a supposed [...] "Balkan linguistic union". These common features include the postposed definite articles and the merger of the dative case and possessive case. Whether they represent a <b>common</b> <b>substrate</b> language, or convergent development is still a matter of debate among linguists.|$|E
