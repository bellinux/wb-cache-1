5|$|<b>Chemical</b> {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a <b>chemical</b> barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful <b>chemical</b> defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chemical</b> {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a <b>chemical</b> stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying <b>chemical</b> that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses <b>chemical</b> signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E

5|$|<b>Chemical</b> {{restoration}} {{is a type}} of <b>chemical</b> milling. Typically, <b>chemical</b> milling is used {{to slowly}} remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, <b>chemical</b> restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a <b>chemical,</b> usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of <b>chemical</b> that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E

5|$|Short {{proteins}} {{can also}} be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as <b>chemical</b> ligation to produce peptides in high yield. <b>Chemical</b> synthesis allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. <b>Chemical</b> synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. Most <b>chemical</b> synthesis methods proceed from C-terminus to N-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.|$|E
