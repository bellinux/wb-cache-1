40|$|Changes in {{vanadium}} coordination during cell lysis {{have been}} followed by EPR spectroscopy of the blood cells of the phlebobranch ascidians Ascidia <b>ceratodes</b> and Phallusia julinea. The spectra obtained for A. <b>ceratodes</b> whole blood samples can be mainly ascribed to aquated oxovanadium(IV) in which the signals are broadened in freshly frozen blood relative to when the cells are lysed by thawing. The sources of this broadening are discussed and it is shown that the oxovanadium(IV) signal has its origin in {{a small percentage of}} damaged or lysed cells which release vanadium into a low sulfate, low acid environment in fresh samples. When thawed, the cells lyse releasing acid and sulfate into the environment of the oxovanadium(IV), with consequent narrowing of the EPR spectral linewidth. Freshly frozen P. julinea blood cell samples have EPR spectra with parameters intermediate between aquated oxovanadium(IV) and the 2 ̆ 7 type I 2 ̆ 7 parameters observed in a previous investigation of tissue samples of this species (S. G. Brand, C. J. Hawkins, A. T. Marshall, G. W. Nette, and D. L. Parry, Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 93 B, 425 (1989)). A. <b>ceratodes</b> tissue samples also have EPR spectra that differ from that of the blood. It is suggested that EPR studies on tissue samples are more indicative of the resting state of vanadium in the cells as there is more physiological material to provide a pH buffering effect to stabilize the cells. Schemes are presented which incorporate all of the EPR observations in ascidian literature, where cellular lysis is proposed to be accompanied by vanadium undergoing oxidation and a series of chelate exchanges from a 2 ̆ 7 type I 2 ̆ 7 complex to aquated oxovanadium(IV). Protons released during these exchanges are suggested to provide the acidity characteristic of blood cells lysates. The biological implications of the concomitant release of vanadium and tunichrome (S. W. Taylor, D. L. Parry, C. J. Hawkins, and J. H. Swinehart, Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 106 A, 531 (1993)) from the blood cells, to the process of wound repair are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Ascidia <b>ceratodes</b> {{exposed to}} 14 C-phenylalanine in the {{surrounding}} seawater incorporates the radiolabel into newly biosynthesized tunichrome molecules. Radioactivity can be detected in tunichrome extracted from circulating blood cells within one day following initial exposure to the radiolabel; weak activity (≤ 4 μCi/mol tunichrome= 22 nmol phenylalanine/mol tunichrome) is detected in 1 to 10 days; significantly higher amounts of radiolabel (57 μCi/mol tunichrome= 318 nmol phenylalanine/mol tunichrome) appear 20 days after seawater exposure. Therefore, phenylalanine can function as a precursor in the biosynthesis of tunichrome...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of intact blood {{cells of the}} tunicate Ascidia <b>ceratodes</b> have been measured up to 50 kOe with a SQUID susceptometer. Analysis of total metal contents by plasma emission spectroscopy and V(IV) content by epr indicates that approximately 5 % of the accumulated vanadium is + 4 vanadyl ion. Measured values of the magnetic moment MP at different values of the applied magnetic field H over the temperature range T = 2 – 100 K depend on {{the magnitude of the}} field indicating magnetic anisotropy of the ground state. The slope of the MP vs. H/T curve at high temperature is significantly higher than expected from electron spin S = 1 per vanadium(III) ion. The model that fits these data best is a dimer with one V(III) S = 1 ion ferromagnetically coupled to a second V(III) S = 1 ion, with spin-coupling constant J = 3. 5 cm− 1, and 5 % of the total vanadium content {{in the form of a}} V(IV) S = 1 / 2 ion. Since vanadium in A. <b>ceratodes</b> is known to reside in at least three different types of blood cell, the excellent fit indicates that the metal is stored predominantly as a dimer regardless of blood cell type. Ferromagnetic coupling implies that the two vanadium ions in the dimer are connected by an unprotonated μ-oxo bridge...|$|E
40|$|Radiolabeled {{tyrosine}} {{is incorporated}} into newly biosynthesized tunichrome of Ascidia <b>ceratodes</b> {{at a rate}} comparable to previous findings with phenylalanine. 3 H-tyrosine incorporation indicates that formation of the catechol and pyrogallol moieties occurs via the NIH shift pathway. Radiolabel is found in many compartments other than solely tunichrome (tunic > whole body ⪢ blood plasma ⋙ tunichrome). The amount of label in the tunic, whole bodies and blood plasma declines over the 14 days following exposure to 3 H-tyrosine, whereas the radiolabel in the tunichrome continues to increase. These {{results are consistent with}} two alternative hypotheses: tunichromes may be formed either by sequential hydroxylation of di- and tri-peptide precursors, or by selective cleavage of a larger DOPA- or TOPA-containing compound. In either event, hydroxylation may precede formation of tunichrome 2 ̆ 7 s carbon backbone...|$|E
40|$|Biotic {{resistance}} {{is the ability}} of communities to inhibit the establishment, spread or impact of novel species. However, the interactions that underlie biotic resistance depend heavily on the contexts in which species interact. Consequently, studies of biotic resistance that consider single processes, patches, species or life-history stages may provide an incomplete picture of the capacity for communities to resist invasion. Many organisms have multiphasic life cycles, where individuals can occupy distinct niches at different stages of the life history. Generally, studies of biotic resistance focus on interactions within a single life-history stage, and interactions at other life-history stages are overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that different mechanisms of biotic resistance occur across the life history and together limit the invasion success of an introduced marine invertebrate (Ciona intestinalis) in Northern California. We tested the role of interactions (competition and predation) with the resident community in limiting the abundance of Ciona through experiments conducted on fertilization, larval survival, settlement, early postsettlement survival, and the survival of juveniles and adults. Under some circumstances, Ciona became abundant in mid-successional stages and showed more rapid growth rates than a morphologically similar native species, Ascidia <b>ceratodes.</b> However, predators reduced Ciona abundance much more than that of Ascidia at several life stages. Furthermore, Ciona appeared to be a weaker competitor at the adult stage. Early life-history interactions with other sessile species at the fertilization, larval and recruit stages had modest to no effects on Ciona abundance. The presence of biotic resistance mechanisms acting at multiple life stages, and potentially under different conditions, suggests that different components of biotic resistance interact to enhance the resident community 2 ̆ 7 s resistance to invasion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA rise in {{intracellular}} free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) {{is required}} to activate sperm of all organisms studied. Such elevation of [Ca 2 +]i can occur either by influx of extracellular Ca 2 + or by release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. We have examined these sources of Ca 2 + in sperm from the sea squirt Ascidia <b>ceratodes</b> using mitochondrial translocation to evaluate activation and the Ca 2 +-sensitive dye fura- 2 to monitor [Ca 2 +]i by bulk spectrofluorometry. Sperm activation artificially evoked by incubation in high-pH seawater was inhibited by reducing seawater [Ca 2 +], {{as well as by}} the presence of high [K+]o or the Ca channel blockers pimozide, penfluridol, or Ni 2 +, but not nifedipine or Co 2 +. The accompanying rise in [Ca 2 +]i was also blocked by pimozide or penfluridol. These results indicate that activation produced by alkaline incubation involves opening of plasmalemmal voltage-dependent Ca channels and Ca 2 + entry to initiate mitochondrial translocation. Incubation in thimerosal or thapsigargin, but not ryanodine (even if combined with caffeine pretreatment), evoked sperm activation. Activation by thimerosal was insensitive to reduced external calcium and to Ca channel blockers. Sperm [Ca 2 +]i increased upon incubation in high-pH or thimerosal-containing seawater, but only the high-pH-dependent elevation in [Ca 2 +]i could be inhibited by pimozide or penfluridol. Treatment with the protonophore CCCP indicated that only a small percentage of sperm could release enough Ca 2 + from mitochondria to cause activation. Inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) delivered by liposomes or by permeabilization increased sperm activation. Both of these effects were blocked by heparin. We conclude that high external pH induces intracellular alkalization that directly or indirectly activates plasma membrane voltage-dependent Ca channels allowing entry of external Ca 2 + and that thimerosal stimulates release of Ca 2 + from IP 3 -sensitive intracellular stores...|$|E
