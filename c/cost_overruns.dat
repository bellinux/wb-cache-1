40|$|Researchers and {{engineers}} worldwide continue to ponder over {{the reliability of}} construction cost forecasts made at {{the early stages of}} project development. The accuracy of such estimates influences the selection of projects for implementation. After a project has been incorporated in the statewide transportation improvement program, more detailed estimates of its cost are prepared at the remaining stages of project development, namely, design estimate, engineer 2 ̆ 7 s estimate, and bid estimate. This dissertation presents a methodology for identifying contracts that are likely to experience <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> at different stages of project development process. This was done on the basis of contract specific factors. Also, the dissertation analyzed escalation patterns of cost estimates across project development stages. The methodology used risk-based econometric models to determine probability of an escalation pattern and <b>cost</b> <b>overrun.</b> An application of the methodology was demonstrated using data from Indiana. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to analyze the variability in the probability of an escalation pattern and the variability in the probability of <b>cost</b> <b>overrun.</b> Using the models, a software tool was developed to identify contracts that are more likely to experience <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> in Indiana. The methodology can, however, be used by other highway agencies. For the case study, the results showed that for expansion (capacity addition) and bridge contracts, the probability of <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> increased with increase in contract size. Large pavement contracts (greater than 5 million), on the other hand, were more likely to experience a cost underrun as compared to small pavement contracts. Pavement contracts in urban areas were more likely to experience <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> compared to their rural counterparts. For expansion and bridge contract <b>cost</b> <b>overrun,</b> no significant difference was found between urban and rural areas. Expansion and pavement contracts on Non-NHS highways were more likely to experience <b>cost</b> <b>overrun,</b> compared to such contracts on other transportation systems. Bridge contracts on Interstates were more likely to experience <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> compared to other transportation systems. Furthermore, it was found that as the time duration between project proposal and design completion increased, the tendency of a contract to experience <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> increased. Longer time spans between project proposal and letting were also found to increase the probability of <b>cost</b> <b>overrun.</b> In addition, the risk of occurrence of a particular escalation pattern influenced the probability of <b>cost</b> <b>overrun.</b> ...|$|R

It is well known that most construction projects in China are exposed to <b>cost</b> <b>overrun.</b> From the literature review, forty-three general <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> factors in construction projects were obtained based on previous researches from many countries. The aim of this study is to evaluate the most important <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> factors that are specifically related to resources, namely labour, material, equipment and subcontractor. Two questionnaire surveys were used to achieve the objectives in this study. The first questionnaire was designed to determine the severity of <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> factors, and the second one was designed to obtain the proportions of cost components and top-ten factors cost for each component. Data from the questionnaires were analysed by using the relative importance index (RII) method and mean value method. The findings indicated that material cost is the highest, and subcontractor cost is the lowest, while equipment and labour cost are approximately the same. Low productivity of labour, lack of skilled labour, escalation of material prices, material quality issues, high cost of machineries and poor cash flow management are among the important factors for <b>cost</b> <b>overrun.</b> This study concludes factors that cause <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> in China are similar to those that can be found in other countries except for a few factors.

40|$|One of {{the main}} problems, faced by the {{construction}} industry is <b>cost</b> <b>overrun.</b> The final <b>cost</b> {{at the completion of}} the project exceeds over the initial cost, during the time of inception of the project. As a result of this, the projects have to be stopped or reduced their scopes, without fulfilling the total requirements of the end users. So, it is necessary to analyze the main causes for the <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> in construction projects. After the end of thirty years of war and recent Tsunami, there are many reconstruction projects, especially in building sector undergoing in Sri Lanka. It is observed that the <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> {{at the end of the}} project, created unpleasant situations among the clients, consultants and contractors. The contractors are the most affected by the issue of <b>cost</b> <b>overrun,</b> because they have to wait for their payments for a certain period due to the unavailability of excess fund. The aim of the research project is to identify the main factors contributing the <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> in the view of contractors and how they are distributed. The other focusing area of this study is to find out the steps to mitigate the <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> in future. The preliminary data for this research have been collected through a literature review from Sri Lanka and worldwide. The main factors causing <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> listed from the literature review, were modified using the facts obtained from the case studies and the opinions of some experts in the field. A detailed questionnaire form has been prepared using the modified factors and circulated island wide. 77 questionnaires were received, out of 180 issued questionnaires and the response rate of 43 %. The data analysis was carried out using the relative importance index method. The Five point priority scale was used to rank the significant factors according to the rating of respondents. In addition to that, an open ended question was added in the last part of the questionnaire form to get the views of the mitigation of <b>cost</b> <b>overrun</b> in future.

This trend is more severe in developing countries where these overruns sometimes exceeds 100 % of the anticipated cost of the project. Like other countries, construction industry in Malaysia is also facing a lot of challenges such as the delay to complete the project in time, the expenditure exceeding the budget, the building defects and over dependent of foreign workers. The ultimate effects of project delay also results in exceeding cost. This leads to serious need of addressing the critical issue of construction <b>cost</b> <b>overrun.</b> To avoid construction <b>cost</b> <b>overrun,</b> very first and most important step is to identify and understand the causes and factors responsible for that.
