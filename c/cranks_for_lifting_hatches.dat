40|$|The Kerman-Klein {{formulation}} of the equations of motion for a nuclear shell model and its associated variational principle are reviewed briefly. It is then applied to the derivation of the self-consistent particle-rotor model and of the self-consistent <b>cranking</b> model, <b>for</b> both axially symmetric and triaxial nuclei. Two derivations of the particle-rotor model are given. One of these is of a form that lends itself to {{an expansion of the}} result in powers of the ratio of single-particle angular momentum to collective angular momentum, that is essential to reach the cranking limit. The derivation also requires a distinct, angular-momentum violating, step. The structure of the result implies the possibility of tilted-axis <b>cranking</b> <b>for</b> the axial case and full three-dimensional <b>cranking</b> <b>for</b> the triaxial one. The final equations remain number conserving. In an appendix, the Kerman-Klein method is developed in more detail, and the outlines of several algorithms for obtaining solutions of the associated non-linear formalism are suggested...|$|R
50|$|Early {{automobiles}} {{required a}} hand <b>crank</b> <b>for</b> starting. Occasionally, when the spark lever was not properly set, the hand crank kicked back, causing serious injury: a broken wrist, arm, or shoulder. On a winter night in 1908, {{the result was}} much worse.|$|R

50|$|The bike {{was popular}} {{at first but}} soon {{reliability}} problems began to emerge and the problems lay with the Omni-Phase balancer: At high rpm the balance weights would whip oil in the sump into a froth, aerating the oil and starving the <b>crank</b> <b>for</b> lubrication which resulted in bearing failure.|$|R

50|$|The use of {{a return}} {{connecting}} rod to a shaft beneath the boiler with overhung cranks also avoided the need <b>for</b> an internal <b>crank.</b> <b>For</b> Stephenson's designs, this crank axle would also have carried the locomotive's weight, not being merely a crankshaft, and so this avoided a particularly difficult piece of forging work.|$|R

50|$|A company named Davis Diesel Development in the USA {{also make}} a similar {{crankshaft}} called a Killer <b>crank</b> <b>for</b> their diesel conversions.

40|$|CV. Titian Mandiri is {{a company}} that produce {{bottling}} water which still use manual lifting method. The advantages of this method are more flexible, effective and low cost. On the other hand, bad manual lifting can generate pain in several operator body segments, such as hand, back, waist and thigh. Leave from those reality, it is needed to do some working method analysis and improvement based on biomechanical principle. NIOSH method used to know lifting safety limit and Chaffin-Anderson equation used to predictable the force that happened on abdominal segment, L 5 /S 1 and operators hand segment. This study shows that RWL value <b>for</b> <b>lifting</b> to pick up car is 8, 223 kg and lifting to the box car is 6, 208 kg. The LI value <b>for</b> <b>lifting</b> to pick up car is 2, 311 and <b>for</b> <b>lifting</b> to box car is 3, 060. The improvement of working method was done by rearrange the gallon position and add amount of table. The high of the table is 52 cm and the gallon position would be in front of operator sagital line exactly. This improvement changes RWL value <b>for</b> <b>lifting</b> to pick up become 13, 820 kg and 11, 475 kg <b>for</b> <b>lifting</b> to the box car.

50|$|As {{the trio}} watch, the {{elevator}} doors open {{but there is no}} sign of any monster/alien outside. Ben steps out and invites Ellen to join him in leaving the building via the stairs. Ellen initially accepts but becomes fearful of Ben when she sees Hank's knife in his pocket. She dashes right back into the elevator before Ben can stop her. While the lift goes down, Hank presses the stop button to halt the elevator and Ellen becomes panicked, saying that she wants to go down. Before they can argue, someone attempts to open the <b>lift</b> <b>hatch.</b> Hank keeps the hatch shut while instructing Ellen to send the elevator to floor 44. This causes the thing outside to stop its attempt to enter, but dents the hatch. Before the two can react, they're startled by Ben's mutilated corpse which comes tumbling down into the elevator.|$|R
