We explore how the social allocation of work during the feudal system took place and trace back the development of wage labor within agriculture, industry and service sector. In particular, the historical roots of the so-called 'standard employment contract' in Germany are investigated. We find that during the pre-industrial time the social organization of work occurred in various forms and that wage labor was rather a rare phenomenon {{in the beginning of the}} 19 th century. Hence, a widespread and functioning labor market cannot be identified at that time.

40|$|A unique {{characteristic}} of Indonesian banking {{system is the}} existence of community development banks, {{which is owned by}} local governments. This study examines the performance of this type of banks compared to private and federal government banks. The sample of this study consists of 15 community development banks, 56 private banks, and 3 federal government banks from 1995 to 2006. Using panel data methodologies, we find that community development banks perform at least as good as the other types of banks. There are two possible explanations for this finding. First, the survival of local government depends on the performance of local banks. Mismanagement of banks might indicate the incompetence of local elected officials. Thus the officials have more incentives to monitor local banks. Second, since community development banks only serve one province, they have specialized knowledge about that province. Third, loans are given out only to <b>civil</b> <b>servants.</b> Since {{it is very difficult to}} terminate the employment <b>contracts</b> of <b>civil</b> <b>servants,</b> these loans represent low risk investments to the banks. To our knowledge, this is the first study that looks at the performance of community development bank in comparison with other types of banks in Indonesia...|$|R

The use of extended short-term employment contracts can become structural and extend beyond the simple management of temporary work overloads. The level and type of education are important determinants in the type and timeframe of stabilisation in employment. The holders of prestigious qualifications often immediately secure an open-ended <b>contract</b> or <b>civil</b> <b>servant</b> status. Some show mobility within the first 18 months, breaking off an open-ended contract in what appears to be a career move. Prolonged job insecurity is found more frequently among the less qualified. Certain secondary vocational courses in preparation for industrial occupations appear to foster stable employment with somewhat involuntary mobility partly due to the frequent use of temporary work.

The young women in this cohort found quick entry into the internal civil service market. Conversely, public sector employment more often comes later for the young men. More generally, a larger number of women work a fairly long period in a public sector job, whereas there is a greater probability of the mens paths showing a dominant proportion of short-term contracts in the private sector, youth employment contracts and unemployment. There are more qualified women in the paths with swift integration into the public sector and more qualified men in the paths where the private sector dominates. Yet, independently of this distribution, the young people with periods in the public sector have higher levels of education.
