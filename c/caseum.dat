50|$|A tuberculoma is a {{clinical}} manifestation of tuberculosis which conglomerates tubercles into a firm lump, {{and so can}} mimic cancer tumors of many types in medical imaging studies. Since these are evolutions of primary complex, the tuberculomas may contain within <b>caseum</b> or calcifications.|$|E
50|$|Foamy macrophages {{are also}} found in {{diseases}} caused by pathogens that persist in the body, such as Chlamydia, Toxoplasma, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In tuberculosis (TB), bacterial lipids disable macrophages from pumping out excess LDL, causing them to turn into foam cells around the TB granulomas in the lung. The cholesterol forms a rich food source for the bacteria. As the macrophages die, the mass of cholesterol {{in the center of}} the granuloma becomes a cheesy substance called <b>caseum.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} common Latin words that have {{disappeared}} in many or most Romance languages have survived {{either in the}} periphery or in remote corners (especially Sardinia and Romania), or as secondary terms, sometimes differing in meaning. For example, Latin <b>caseum</b> [...] "cheese" [...] in the more outer places (Portuguese queijo, Spanish queso, Romansh caschiel, Sardinian càsu, Romanian caş), but in the central areas {{has been replaced by}} formāticum, originally [...] "moulded (cheese)" [...] (French fromage, Occitan/Catalan formatge, Italian formaggio, with, however, cacio also available; similarly (com)edere [...] "to eat (up)", which survives as Spanish/Portuguese comer but elsewhere is replaced by mandūcāre, originally [...] "to chew" [...] (French manger, Italian mangiare, Catalan menjar, but Spanish/Portuguese noun manjar [...] "food" [...] or [...] "uplifting meal"). In some cases, one language happens to preserve a word displaced elsewhere, e.g. Italian ogni [...] "each, every" [...] < omnes, displaced elsewhere by tōtum, originally [...] "whole" [...] or by a reflex of Greek κατά (e.g. Italian ognuno, Catalan tothom [...] "everyone"; Italian ogni giorno, Spanish cada día [...] "every day"); Friulan vaî [...] "to cry" [...] < flere [...] "to weep"; Vegliote otijemna [...] "fishing pole" [...] < antenna [...] "yardarm"; Aromanian [...] "sprunã" [...] (warm ashes) < pruna (burning coal). Sardinian even preserves some words that were already archaic in Classical Latin, e.g. àchina [...] "grape" [...] < acinam, also found in Sicilian ràcina.|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis {{remains a}} leading {{global health problem}} that is aggravated by {{emergence}} of drug-resistant strains, which account for increasing number of treatment-refractory cases. Thus, eradication of this disease will strongly require better therapeutic strategies. Identification of host factors promoting disease progression may accelerate discovery of adjunct host-directed therapies (HDTs) that will boost current treatment protocols. HDTs focus on potentiating key components of host anti-mycobacterial effector mechanisms, and limiting inflammation and pathological damage in the lung. Granulomas represent a pathological hallmark of TB. They are comprised of impressive arrangement of immune cells that serve to contain the invading pathogen. However, granulomas can also undergo changes, developing <b>caseums</b> and cavities that facilitate bacterial spread and disease progression. Here we review current concepts {{on the role of}} granulomas in pathogenesis and protective immunity against TB, drawing from recent clinical studies in humans and animal models. We also discuss therapeutic potential of inflammatory pathways that drive granuloma progression, with a focus on new and existing drugs that will likely improve TB treatment outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of CO 2 laser cryptolysis by coagulation (LCC) treatment in the volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) halitometry in patients with chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). Background Data: <b>Caseum</b> retention and halitosis characterize CCT. Failure of clinical treatment indicated tonsillectomy. Recently, a conservative new treatment, CO 2 LCC, has been introduced. It is painless and opens the crypt ostium, thus avoiding <b>caseum</b> retention. Halitometry is an objective new method for halitosis diagnosis. It measures VSC in parts per billion (ppb) in breathed air. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with CCT and complaints of halitosis were selected, underwent physical examination and halitometry measurements, and then received four sessions of LCC. The laser technique consisted of 6 -W applications, in scanned and unfocused mode, around crypts, following the shape of their openings (fluence 54. 5 joules/cm(2)) and, afterwards, over the entire tonsillar surface (fluence 18 joules/cm(2)). Halitometries were done before each LCC session. Results: LCC was well tolerated by all patients, and all patients showed improvement in halitosis after LCC treatment. Eight patients (21 %) had abnormal halitometry (> 150 ppb) before treatment, but after LCC sessions their halitometry values became normal. These patients had <b>caseum</b> at examination. VSC measurement was reduced by 30. 1 %, and <b>caseum</b> retention was significantly decreased in this group. Conclusion: Abnormal halitometry in this population is related to the presence of <b>caseum.</b> LCC is safe, well tolerated, and improves complaints of halitosis in patients with CCT. Improvement was related to a decrease in <b>caseum</b> retention. Patients with abnormal halitometry had VSC halitometry improvement of approximately 30 %...|$|E
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Chronic {{tonsillitis}} with <b>caseum</b> {{has been}} proven to {{be the cause of}} halitosis. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of temperature-controlled radiofrequency tonsil ablation in the treatment of halitosis caused by chronic tonsil-litis with <b>caseum.</b> Materials & Methods: In this clinical trial study 28 adult patients with halitosis due to chronic tonsillitis with <b>caseum</b> were treated by temperature-controlled radiofrequency tonsil ablation and efficacy and complications of procedure were recorded and the data were analyzed by Spss software and paired t-test. Results: The difference between the amount of halitosis was statistically significant before and after the procedure (P < 0. 001). Patients’ pain were mild to moderate. Mild bleeding occurred in 21 % of patients and 79 % had no bleeding. In average 3. 14 days after the procedure patients tolerated regular diet and after 1. 96 days they could do their daily routines. Conclusion: Temperature-controlled radiofrequency tonsil ablation is a safe and effective method for treatment of halitosis due to chronic tonsillitis with <b>caseum</b> and have several ad-vantages compared to conventional tonsillectomy such as reduced post-operative pain and bleeding, shorter recovery time and convenience of an office procedure.

40|$|Part I. Basic Principles. TB {{vaccines}} cannot prevent {{establishment of}} the infection. They can only prevent an early pulmonary tubercle from developing into clinical disease. A more effective new vaccine should optimize both cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) better than any existing vaccine. The rabbit is the only laboratory animal in which {{all aspects of the}} human disease can be reproduced: namely, the prevention of most primary tubercles, the arrestment of most primary tubercles, the formation of the tubercle’s solid caseous center, the liquefaction of this center, the formation of cavities and the bronchial spread of the disease. In liquefied <b>caseum,</b> virulent tubercle bacilli can multiply extracellularly, especially in the liquefied <b>caseum</b> next to the inner wall of a cavity where oxygen is plentiful. The bacilli in liquefied <b>caseum</b> cannot be reached by the increased number of activated macrophages produced by TB vaccines. Therefore, new TB vaccines will have little or no effect on the extracellular bacillary growth within liquefied <b>caseum.</b> TB vaccines can only increase the host’s ability to stop the development of new TB lesions that arise from the bronchial spread of tubercle bacilli from the cavity {{to other parts of the}} lung. Therefore, effective TB vaccines do not prevent the reactivation of latent TB. Such vaccines only control (or reduce) the number of metastatic lesions that result after the primary TB lesion was reactivated by the liquefaction process. (Note: the large number of tubercle bacilli growing extracellularly in liquefied <b>caseum</b> gives rise to mutations that enable antimicrobial resistance—which is a major reason why TB still exists today). Part II. Preclinical Testing. The counting of grossly visible tubercles in the lungs of rabbits after the inhalation of virulent human-type tubercle bacilli is the most pertinent preclinical method to assess the efficacy of new TB vaccines (because an effective vaccine will stop the growth of developing tubercles before while they are still microscopic in size). Unfortunately, rabbits are rarely used in preclinical vaccine trials, despite their relative ease of handling and human-like response to this infection. Mice do not generate an effective DTH response, and guinea pigs do not generate an effective CMI response. Only the rabbits and most humans can establish the proper amount of DTH and CMI that is necessary to contain this infection. Therefore, rabbits should be included in all pre-clinical testing of new TB vaccines. New drugs (and/or immunological procedures) to reduce liquefaction and cavity formation are urgently needed. A simple intradermal way to select such drugs or procedures is described herein. Part III. Clinical Testing. Vaccine trials would be much more precise if the variations in human populations (listed herein) were taken into consideration. BCG and successful new TB vaccines should always increase host resistance to TB in naive subjects. This is a basic immunological principle. The efficacies of new and old TB vaccines are often not recognized, because these variations were not identified in the populations evaluated...|$|E
30|$|Lung {{destruction}} due {{to primary}} progressive TB is generally unilateral, with upper lobe predominance [2]. The presence of peribronchial or hilar lymph adenopathies, a common finding in primary infection that is occasionally accompanied by endobronchial injury, can {{give rise to}} bronchial obstruction. The lymph adenopathies may disappear, while the bronchial stenosis persists. Bronchial obstruction due to <b>caseum,</b> pus or an excess of mucus {{can lead to a}} secondary pyogenous infection or lobar collapse, with resulting atelectasis due to fibrosis of a lobe (partial) or the entire lung.|$|E
40|$|A {{multi-modal}} {{mass spectrometry}} imaging (MSI) and profiling {{approach has been}} applied to assess the partitioning of the anti-TB fluoroquinolone levofloxacin into pulmonary lesions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and a commercial liquid microjunction surface sampling technology (LMJ-SSP), or flowprobe, have been used to both spatially profile and image drug distributions in lung tissue sections from TB-infected rabbits following oral administration of a single human-equivalent dose., Levofloxacin levels were highest at 6 h post-dose in normal lung, cellular granuloma, and necrotic <b>caseum</b> compartments. The drug accumulated in the cellular granuloma regions with lower amounts partitioning into central caseous compartments. Flowprobe imaging at 630 μm (limited by the probe tip diameter) enabled visualization of drug distribution into lesion compartments, including limited differentiation of relative drug abundance in cellular versus caseous regions of the lesions., MALDI-MSI analysis at 75 μm provided more detailed drug distribution, which clearly accumulated in the cellular region immediately surrounding the central <b>caseum</b> core. Imaging and profiling data acquired by flowprobe and MALDI-MSI were validated by quantitative LC/MS/MS analysis of lung and granuloma homogenates taken from the same animals., The results of the investigation show flowprobe imaging and sampling as a rapid and sensitive alternative to MALDI-MSI for profiling drug distributions into tissues when spatial resolution of data below the threshold of the probe diameter is not required...|$|E
40|$|Mice are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used species for non-clinical evaluations of drug efficacy against tuberculosis (TB). Unlike commonly used strains, C 3 HeB/FeJ mice develop caseous necrosis in the lung, which might alter the representation of drug efficacy {{in a way that is}} more like human TB. Because the development of such pathology requires time, we investigated the effect of infection incubation period on the activity of six drugs in C 3 HeB/FeJ and BALB/c mice. Mice were aerosol infected and held for 6, 10 or 14  weeks before receiving therapy with rifampin (RIF), rifapentine (RPT), pyrazinamide (PZA), linezolid (LZD), sutezolid (PNU) or metronidazole (MTZ) for 4 - 8  weeks. Outcomes included pathological assessments, pH measurements of liquefied <b>caseum</b> and assessment of colony-forming unit (CFU) counts from lung cultures. Remarkable heterogeneity in the timing and extent of disease progression was observed in C 3 HeB/FeJ mice, largely independent of incubation period. Likewise, drug efficacy in C 3 HeB/FeJ mice was not affected by incubation period. However, for PZA, LZD and PNU, dichotomous treatment effects correlating with the presence or absence of large caseous lesions were observed. In the case of PZA, its poor activity in the subset of C 3 HeB/FeJ mice with large caseous lesions might be explained by the pH of 7. 36 ± 0. 09 measured in liquefied <b>caseum.</b> This study highlights the potential value of C 3 HeB/FeJ mice for non-clinical efficacy testing, especially for investigating the interaction of lesion pathology and drug effect. Careful use of this model could enhance the bridging of non-clinical results with clinical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Current {{tuberculosis}} (TB) treatment requires 6 {{months of}} combination therapy with isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol for active TB and 9 months of INH or 3 months of rifapentine (RFP) + INH for latent TB. The lungs {{of patients with}} active and latent TB contain heterogeneous mixtures of cellular and caseous granulomas harboring Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli ranging from actively replicating (AR) to nonreplicating (NR), phenotypically drug-resistant stages. Several in vitro models to obtain NR cells were reported, including exposure to hypoxia, nutrient starvation, acid + nitric oxide, and stationary phase. Overall, these models showed that RIF, RFP, PA- 824 (PA), metronidazole (MZ), bedaquiline (BQ), and fluoroquinolones were the most active drugs against NR M. tuberculosis. In hypoxia at pH 5. 8, some combinations killed AR plus NR cells, as shown by lack of regrowth in liquid media, whereas in hypoxia at pH 7. 3 (the pH of the <b>caseum),</b> only RIF and RFP efficiently killed NR bacilli while several other drugs showed little effect. In conventional mouse models, combinations containing RFP, BQ, PA, PZA, moxifloxacin, sutezolid, linezolid, and clofazimine sterilized animals in ≤ 2 months, as shown by lack of viable bacilli in lung homogenates after 3 months without therapy. Drugs were less effective in C 3 HeB/FeJ mice forming caseous granulomas. Overall, in vitro observations and in vivo {{studies suggest that the}} search for new TB drugs could be addressed to low lipophilic molecules (e. g., new rpoB inhibitors with clogP < 3) killing NR M. tuberculosis in hypoxia at neutral pH and reaching high rates of unbound drug in the <b>caseum...</b>|$|E
40|$|Granulomas {{are complex}} lung lesions {{that are the}} {{hallmark}} of tuberculosis (TB). Understanding antibiotic dynamics within lung granulomas will be vital to improving and shortening the long course of TB treatment. Three fluoroquinolones (FQs) are commonly prescribed as part of multi-drug resistant TB therapy: moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX) or gatifloxacin (GFX). To date, insufficient data are available to support selection of one FQ over another, or to show that these drugs are clinically equivalent. To predict the efficacy of MXF, LVX and GFX at a single granuloma level, we integrate computational modeling with experimental datasets into a single mechanistic framework, GranSim. GranSim is a hybrid agent-based computational model that simulates granuloma formation and function, FQ plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics {{and is based on}} extensive in vitro and in vivo data. We treat in silico granulomas with recommended daily doses of each FQ and compare efficacy by multiple metrics: bacterial load, sterilization rates, early bactericidal activity and efficacy under non-compliance and treatment interruption. GranSim reproduces in vivo plasma pharmacokinetics, spatial and temporal tissue pharmacokinetics and in vitro pharmacodynamics of these FQs. We predict that MXF kills intracellular bacteria more quickly than LVX and GFX due in part to a higher cellular accumulation ratio. We also show that all three FQs struggle to sterilize non-replicating bacteria residing in <b>caseum.</b> This is due to modest drug concentrations inside <b>caseum</b> and high inhibitory concentrations for this bacterial subpopulation. MXF and LVX have higher granuloma sterilization rates compared to GFX; and MXF performs better in a simulated non-compliance or treatment interruption scenario. We conclude that MXF has a small but potentially clinically significant advantage over LVX, as well as LVX over GFX. We illustrate how a systems pharmacology approach combining experimental and computational methods can guide antibiotic selection for TB...|$|E
40|$|Liquefaction {{of solid}} caseous tuberculous lesions and the {{subsequent}} cavity formation {{are probably the most}} dangerous processes in the pathogenesis of human pulmonary tuberculosis. In liquefied <b>caseum,</b> the tubercle bacilli grow extracellularly {{for the first time since}} the onset of the disease and can reach such large numbers that mutants with antimicrobial resistance may develop. From a cavity, the bacilli enter the bronchial tree and spread to other parts of the lung and also to other people. Of the commonly used laboratory animals, the rabbit is the only one in which cavitary tuberculosis can be readily produced. This report is the first to describe and analyze the complete course of cavitary tuberculosis, produced by aerosolized virulent bovine-type tubercle bacilli in commercially available New Zealand white rabbits. After the inhalation of 220 to 880 bacillary units, all of the rabbits were overtly well until they were sacrificed at 33 weeks. After the inhalation of 3, 900 to 5, 800 bacillary units, half of the rabbits died of progressive tuberculosis between 5 and 9 weeks and the other half lived until they were sacrificed at 18 weeks. Pulmonary cavities developed in both low- and high-dose groups, some beginning as early as 6 weeks. Bacilli from primary cavities sometimes caused nearby secondary cavities, but more frequently, they ascended the bronchial escalator, were swallowed, and caused secondary tubercles in the lymphoid tissue of the appendix and ileocecal junction. Histologically, and by culture, the number of bacilli found in the liquefied <b>caseum</b> varied from many to comparatively few. Strong tuberculin reactions at 4 weeks after infection were associated with fewer primary lesions, while strong tuberculin reactions at 33 weeks were associated with more cavitary lesions. In the tuberculous granulation tissue surrounding caseous and liquefied pulmonary foci and cavities, we found many mature epithelioid macrophages that contained high levels of the proteinase cathepsin D. Therefore, cathepsin D probably plays a major role in the liquefaction of solid caseous material and in the subsequent cavity formation...|$|E
40|$|Granulomas are the {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} tuberculosis (TB). However, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. To {{understand the role}} of granulomas in TB, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. Using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. We found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that {{is characterized by the}} presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Conversely, the tissue surrounding the <b>caseum</b> has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. These findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. Although the balance between systemic pro and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. From the protein and lipid snapshots of-human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (Mtb) infection {{results in}} the formation of a granuloma by the host immune response. The well-structured tuberculous (TB) granuloma confines the bacilli at the local foci, preventing the systemic infection. Most of Mtbinfected individuals are able to control the infection and stay healthy. However, by still unknown mechanisms, the TB granuloma can liquefy and erode into the airway space, thereby releasing bacilli and transmitting TB to other hosts. Despite the importance of granulomas in TB pathogenesis, our understanding is still unclear. This work was performed to advance our knowledge on the biology of TB granuloma by using human TB tissues and in vitro and in vivo models. Our microarray analysis on human TB granulomas shows upregulation of biological processes including inflammation, lipid metabolism, tissue remodeling, and apoptosis. Immunohistological analysis on human TB lung tissues reveals that proteins responsible for lipid synthesis and accumulation are disproportionately expressed in granulomas; adipose differentiation-related protein (ADFP), acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 1 (ACSL 1), and saposin C (SapC) are most strongly expressed in caseous granulomas but not in resolved granulomas. The biochemical analysis shows that the <b>caseum</b> of TB granulomas is enriched with neutral lipids and glycosphingolipids, which are tightly associated with the upregulated expression of ADFP, ACSL 1, and SapC. In addition, Mtb infection in macrophages in vitro induces similar changes of transcript and protein expression when compared to that of human pulmonary TB granulomas, suggesting that the host lipid metabolism is perturbed by Mtb infection. Furthermore, murine granulomas induced by the Mtb-cell wall component, trehalose dimycolate (TDM), accumulate extensive amounts of lipids in cells, and this phenomenon is not dependent on the presence of B- or T-cells, indicating that innate immunity is mainly responsible for the accumulation of lipids in cells in response to TDM. In addition to lipid accumulation, the microarray analysis shows that the murine TDM-granuloma is strikingly reminiscent of human TB granuloma; e. g. tissue remodeling and degeneration, cell death, and angiogenesis. In summary, these data demonstrate (1) human TB granulomas undergo dysregulated lipid metabolism, which culminates {{in the formation of}} lipid-filled <b>caseum,</b> (2) Mtb bacilli infection affects the lipid metabolism in macrophages in vitro, (3) the Mtb cell wall lipid, TDM, induces the formation of lipid-filled foam cells in mice in vivo, and (4) TDM-induced granulomas resemble the pathology of human TB granulomas...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{report an}} undiagnosed case of {{systemic}} sarcoidosis manifesting with bilateral acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). Case Report: A 26 -year-old Caucasian man was referred for management of unilateral visual loss {{together with a}} paracentral scotoma developing 2 weeks after a flu-like syndrome. Clinical signs and ancillary diagnostic investigations suggested APMPPE. Laboratory tests demonstrated elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme and lysozyme levels. Chest CT-scan disclosed moderate hilar lymph node calcifications but QuantiFERON-TB gold test was negative and bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsies were unremarkable. Accessory salivary gland biopsy disclosed epithelioid and gigantocellular granuloma formation without <b>caseum,</b> confirming a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The fellow eye was involved {{a few days later}} and the patient complained of dyspnea. Echocardiography disclosed severe granulomatous myocardial infiltration and high dose corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide were initiated. Systemic treatment controlled both cardiac and ocular lesions, and was tapered accordingly. Conclusion: The constellation of "white dot syndromes" and systemic symptoms necessitates a general work-up to exclude granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis. Delayed diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis may have life-threatening consequences and the ophthalmologist may be the first physician to diagnose the condition...|$|E
40|$|Background : Pulmonary {{tuberculosis}} (TB), {{a highly}} contagious infectious disease, {{is a significant}} public health problem {{all over the world}} and remains an important cause of preventable death in the adult population. Endobronchial TB is an unusual form of thoracic TB that may be complicated by tracheobronchial stenosis, and bronchoesophageal fistula formation is a very rare complication. Tubercular lymphadenitis can also lead to fistula formation through a process of <b>caseum</b> necrosis and opening of a fistula between the bronchus and oesophagus. Case Report : We report an uncommon case of thoracic TB in an immunocompetent 73 -year-old Caucasian man who presented several problems: bronchoesophageal fistula, endobronchial TB, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the absence of contemporary parenchymal consolidation. Furthermore, he presented a normal chest radiograph and mostly unclear and non-specific symptoms at onset. Conclusions : We emphasize the need for a better knowledge of this illness and awareness that it may have an unusual presentation. In these cases, diagnosis and proper treatment can be delayed, with severe complications for the patient. Pulmonary TB remains a real diagnostic challenge: a normal chest radiograph and nonspecific symptoms do not allow us to exclude this persistent infectious disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: BCG {{protection}} is suboptimal {{and there is}} significant interest to develop new tuberculosis (TB) vaccines. However, there are significant limitations of the current vaccine evaluation systems in the mouse model. Here, we developed a BCG-challenge rabbit skin model as {{a new way to}} evaluate the protective efficacy of selected TB subunit vaccine candidates. Methods: Rabbits were immunized with subunit vaccines, including EAMM (ESAT 6 -Ag 85 B-MPT 64 -Mtb 8. 4), MH (Mtb 10. 4 -HspX), and LT 70 (ESAT 6 -Ag 85 B-MPT 64 -Mtb 8. 4 -Rv 2626 c) three times subcutaneously every 3 -weeks and challenged with the attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG intradermally 6 -weeks after last immunization. The immune response induced by the vaccine candidates was measured, the histopathology induced by the BCG challenge was studied, and the number of bacilli in the liquefied <b>caseum</b> was determined. Results: The subunit vaccines generated high antigen-specific IgG antibodies and fastened the liquefaction and healing process, and significantly reduced the viable BCG load. The subunit vaccine LT 70 and EAMM-MH reduced BCG bacterial load in comparison to proteins EAMM, MH, Rv 2626 c, and also BCG itself. The Koch phenomena induced by the LT 70 and combination of EAMM-MH were the same as that produced by BCG itself and were more rapid than those induced by the other proteins and the saline controls. Conclusions: The subunit vaccines LT 70 and the combination of EAMM-MH showed promising protective efficacy as expected in the rabbit skin model, which can serve as a visual and convenient new model for evaluating TB vaccines...|$|E
