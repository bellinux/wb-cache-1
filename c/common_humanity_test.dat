40|$|I {{attempt to}} explore the idea of M. C. Nussbaum. She criticizes the social theory of J. Rawls for his theory made not point of good but goods. She insists that social theory has to inquire {{what is good for}} man and raises "capability approach". In this approach, the {{principle}} of social theory is generalized from our deepest desires. She pursues them in stories and debates with various people. According to this idea, she says that students must learn about the different to recognize <b>common</b> <b>humanity,</b> and about <b>common</b> <b>humanity</b> to see how variously they are instantiated in many cultures and their history. In her theory, the public in education is formed from these point : 1. examination into private area, 2. persuation of <b>common</b> <b>humanity</b> (deepest desires), 3. exploration of social theory...|$|R

For example, with regards to the need for a <b>common</b> <b>humanity</b> and cooperative solutions, rationalists see this as being achieved without the need to abolish sovereignty and the Westphalian concept of the nation-state.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationships}} between self-compassion and loneliness. Participants were 398 university students who were enrolled in mid-size state University, in Turkey. In this study, the Self-compassion Scale and the UCLA Loneliness were used. In correlation analysis, self-kindness, <b>common</b> <b>humanity,</b> and mindfulness factors of self-compassion were found negatively related to loneliness. On the other hand, self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification factors of self-compassion were found positively correlated to loneliness. According to path analysis results, loneliness was predicted negatively by self-kindness, <b>common</b> <b>humanity,</b> and mindfulness. Further self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification predicted loneliness in a positive way. This research shows that self-compassion has a direct impact on the lonelines...|$|R
50|$|Neff's scale proposes three {{interacting}} {{components of}} self-compassion, which are each {{composed of two}} opposite facets. The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment. Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself. The second dimension is <b>common</b> <b>humanity</b> versus isolation. <b>Common</b> <b>humanity</b> refers to one's ability to recognize that {{they are part of}} a related group of others and that suffering is part of the human condition. The third dimension is mindfulness versus over-identification. Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way. Neff describes these three dimensions interacting to enhance and engender one another.|$|R
40|$|Mindfulness and self-compassion are {{emerging}} as crucial constructs {{in mental health}} research. Recent {{studies have shown that}} both mindfulness and self-compassion skills may play important roles in well-being and positive emotions associated with mindfulness training. Studies are needed to explain this relationship and to determine what facets may be correlating and mediating the meditation–happiness relationship. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the meditation–happiness relationship and examine which mindfulness and self-compassion facets are better predictors of happiness. A total of 365 participants completed an assessment protocol composed of: the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Self-Compassion Scale-short form (SCS-SF), and the Pemberton Happiness Index (PHI). Hierarchical regression analysis showed that two FFMQ facets (Observing and Awareness) and two SCS components (Self-kindness and <b>Common</b> <b>humanity)</b> were significant predictors of happiness. Mediation results revealed a significant total indirect effect of Observing, Awareness, Self-kindness and <b>Common</b> <b>humanity</b> in the meditation frequency–happiness relationship. Significant indirect effects were found for observing, self-kindness and <b>common</b> <b>humanity.</b> The results supported the model of mindfulness and self-compassion facets as partial mediators of the meditation–happiness relationship. Findings are in line with other studies and provide evidence about the influence of mindfulness and self-compassion on happiness...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{traditional}} foundations {{of respect for}} others have been challenged {{on the basis that}} universal grounds — the assumption that we share a <b>common</b> <b>humanity</b> — have resulted in the exclusion of particular others from full moral consideration or respect. This current questioning of the concept of a <b>common</b> <b>humanity</b> is of enormous significance, in that universalism {{has been one of the}} central assumptions of modern western philosophy and a foundational key to its moral and political theory. This book attempts to address the question of just what grounds are needed in order to justify respect for others, and in addressing this question raises issues of fundamental importance; such as, what exactly does it mean to be human? On what basis can we claim that all humans are equal? Are there differences between animals and humans, and are these differences of moral significance — that is, should animals be accorded the same respect as humans? The author not only critically assesses past and current arguments for and against a <b>common</b> <b>humanity,</b> but also provides a distinctively new conceptualization of what it might mean to be human — and why being human is indeed morally significant...|$|R
