In the first week of June, when nitrate levels were reduced below 0. 5 Μm, the majority of the L. danicus cells present in the CEE formed resting spores. The spores were heavily armored with spines and appeared to sink unmolested {{to the bottom of the}} CEE. Four continuous cultures were started with an inoculum from the CEE and, in a 24 h period when N became depleted, 86 % of the L. danicus present (∼ 80 % of the total phytoplankton assemblage) formed resting spores. A daily dilution culture with nutrients kept at saturating levels was started at the same time from the same inoculum and continued for 2 wk beyond the spore formation event in the N-limited cultures. No spores were observed in the nutrient-saturated culture, indicating that N limitation was necessary to trigger spore formation. Spores were kept in the dark at 3 and 10 C. After 36 and 97 days, a large percentage of the spores germinated. After 214 days, > 1 % of the spores were still capable of germination. Laboratory studies with L. danicus isolated from the CEE confirmed that N limitation was the primary factor triggering spore formation. Microscope observations of these cultures indicated that the spores were formed by auxospores following sexual reproduction...|$|R

5000|$|The {{latest version}} of the SEEA (Q3, 2012) has two other parts, aside from the Central Framework: SEEA <b>Experimental</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> Accounts and SEEA Extensions. [...] The <b>Experimental</b> <b>Ecosystem</b> Accounts, specifically, {{introduces}} an accounting framework for ecosystems, {{despite the fact that}} many of its relevant stocks and flows are centered on non-market assets. While some of the measurement concepts involved in the accounting process are still evolving, it is possible that the eventual valuation of ecosystems and their depletion could be included in the calculations of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. This has implications for future policy, since the emphasis on certain projects or activities undertaken by governments will likely change, depending on how the above-mentioned measurements impact their respective accounts, and subsequent environmental adjustments to certain indicators.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{ecosystem}} dynamics {{is crucial}} as contemporary human societies face ecosystem degradation. One {{of the challenges}} {{that needs to be}} recognized is the complex hierarchical dynamics. Conventional dynamic models in ecology often represent only the population level and have yet to include the dynamics of the sub-organism level, which makes an ecosystem a complex adaptive system that shows characteristic behaviors such as resilience and regime shifts. The neglect of the sub-organism level in the conventional dynamic models would be because integrating multiple hierarchical levels makes the models unnecessarily complex unless supporting experimental data are present. Now that large amounts of molecular and ecological data are increasingly accessible in microbial <b>experimental</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> it is worthwhile to tackle the questions of their complex hierarchical dynamics. Here, we propose an approach that combines microbial <b>experimental</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and a hierarchical dynamic model named population–reaction model. We present a simple microbial <b>experimental</b> <b>ecosystem</b> as an example and show how the system can be analyzed by a population–reaction model. We also show that population–reaction models can be applied to various ecological concepts, such as predator–prey interactions, climate change, evolution, and stability of diversity. Our approach will reveal a path to the general understanding of various ecosystems and organisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{biodiversity}} on ecosystem functioning generally increase over time, but the underlying processes remain unclear. Using 26 long-term grassland and forest <b>experimental</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> we demonstrate that biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships strengthen mainly by greater increases in functioning in high-diversity communities in grasslands and forests.

These results are expected to further foster or trigger new research and development experiments, directions for building radical environments, new teaching methods and ways of working.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{nutrient}} inputs on the carbon (C) budget of rocky shore communities using a set of eight large experimental mesocosms. The mesocosms received a range of inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions, at an N:P ratio of 16. These additions were designed to elevate the background concentration, relative to that in eutrophic Oslofjord (Norway) waters, by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 mumol dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) l(- 1) (and the corresponding P increase). Two unamended mesocosms were used as controls'. The nutrients were added continuously for 27 months before gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), net community production (NCP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production were assessed for the dominant algal species (Fucus serratus) and for the whole <b>experimental</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Inputs and outputs of DOC and particulate organic carbon (POC) from the mesocosms were also quantified. The F. serratus communities were generally autotrophic (average P/R ratio = 1. 33 +/- 0. 12), with the GPP independent of the nutrient inputs to the mesocosms, and maintained a high net DOC production during both day (0. 026 +/- 0. 008 g C m(- 2) h(- 1)) and night (0. 015 +/- 0. 004 g C m(- 2) h- 1). All the <b>experimental</b> rocky shore <b>ecosystems</b> were autotrophic (P/R ratio = 2. 04 +/- 0. 28), and neither macroalgal biomass nor production varied significantly with increasing nutrient inputs. Most of the excess production from these autotrophic ecosystems was exported from the systems as DOC, which accounted for 69 % and 58 % of the NCP of the dominant community and the <b>experimental</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> respectively, the rest being lost as POC. High DOC release and subsequent export from the highly energetic environments occupied by rocky shore communities may prevent the development of eutrophication symptoms and render these communities resistant to eutrophication...|$|R
