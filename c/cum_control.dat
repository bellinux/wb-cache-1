40|$|Looking {{into the}} vast threats of {{possible}} silent introduction of yellow fever virus into India, we have studied the various probable responsible factors, situations and circumstances along-with ways &amp; means of ensuring adequate prevention <b>cum</b> <b>control</b> measures in case of any inadvertent identified presence of this virus in the Indian territories. Thus recommended evidence based analytical approach, designed and implemented in word and spirit, {{will go a long}} way in generating confidence not only among the beneficiary general population of India, but will also give a sigh of relief from the possible grave public health threats of yellow fever to the policy makers, programme managers and health functionaries already overloaded with health care challenges of multiple types, dimensions and magnitude. A strategic policy initiative is the answer to address the critical issues based on suggestions deliberated herein...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} stability and quality guarantee of the productive process regarding soluble coffee plant {{situated in the}} state of Paraná. The collected sample contents 4. 598 observations of weight of 50 and 100 grams cans. The process of collection was made automatically during period of October 8 th and December 5 th 2004. ARIMA model’s residues were evaluated by the cumulated sum control charts (CUSUM) with “V” mask form, which showed that productive process is statistically unstable. This is evinces fragility of the process regarding the guarantee for the products that do not comply with requirements, mainly the weight of the 50 grams’ containers. The results suggest that employees should have more accurate attention to the discipline and control of everyday activities, besides banning mistakes made by them on the routine work that can be solved with the right orientation and changing equipment adjustment procedures.

It is used to detect and control the fungi growth. The Model is tested in North-Eastern (Shillong) Region of India. The diseases like Aspergillosis, mucor amphibiorum, penicillium marneffei and hypersensitivity pneumonic are caused due to long term exposure of Aspergillus Sp., Mucor Sp. and Penicillum Sp. fungi which causes severe breathing problem, bleeding lungs, cancer and even death. The developed system {{can be used in}} the room/laboratory/library or any closed environment in which the fungal growth control is needed {{to prevent the spread of}} fatal diseases...|$|R

The firms, as we see them today in the USA, Japan and many other countries, are organized according to OIs {{that took place in}} the USA and Japan in the last 150 years or so. A historical review during that period will identify OIs in these two countries. OIs such as integration of production and distribution, focal factories, and just-in-time <b>cum</b> quality <b>control</b> (JIT/QC) are more thoroughly described. organizational innovations, disembodied technology, firms, economic growth, historical review...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Cooperative {{communications}} {{can significantly}} enhance transmission reliability and bandwidth efficiency in wireless networks. However, {{the impact of}} cooperative communications on network-level upper layer issues, such as topology control, routing and network capacity, is largely ignored. At the same time, security {{is an important issue}} in MANETs and existing security schemes have significant impact on throughput. In this paper, a security <b>cum</b> topology <b>control</b> scheme, called COCO+ALPHA scheme to improve the network capacity as well as to provide the security in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) with cooperative communications is presented. Both upper layer network capacity and physical layer relay selections are considered in the proposed scheme...|$|R

ECOWAS and the African Union also suspended Mali. The U.S., the World Bank, and the African Development Bank suspended development aid funds in support of ECOWAS and the AU's reactions to the coup.|$|R

Shortly after the acquisition of CCG, Cumming acquired Southern Management Group (SMG), a South Carolina-based firm with more than 20 years of experience in program and project/construction management. Later in 2008, after several years working abroad, Cumming established Cumming International and opened its first overseas office in Abu Dhabi.|$|R
40|$|No doubt, {{one of the}} {{perennial}} problems which has not only defied all past attempts at permanent solution, but has also evoked high emotions {{on the part of}} all concerned is the issue of equitable revenue allocation in Nigeria. Thus, the thrust of this paper is an in-depth analysis of the politics of revenue allocation <b>cum</b> resource <b>control.</b> The paper takes a cursory look at virtually all previous attempts at arriving at equitable formula. The paper however, infers that in a deeply plural and divided society like Nigeria a polity that ‘robs Peter to pay Paul’ may eventually be both counter-productive and dysfunctional. The clarion call however is a federal system with fiscal policy that can imbue in the citizenry sense of justice, equity and fairness visà-vis revenue allocation. To do otherwise according to the findings {{of this paper is to}} jeopardize all efforts at national cohesion and integration...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} uncovers {{a well-defined}} monetary policy regime starting in 1986 {{in the aggregate}} Euro Area. Both alternative solution-estimation methods employed - optimal <b>control</b> <b>cum</b> GMM, and dynamic programming cum FIML - identify a regime of strict inflation targeting with interest rate smoothing. The unemployment gap, properly estimated as quasi real-time information, is a relevant element in the information set of the monetary authority, despite not being included in its preferences. The emergence of the regime relates to {{the improvement of the}} volatility trade-off between inflation and unemployment gap since the mid- 80 s. Additional improving factors have been milder supply shocks and better ability of policymakers to set the interest rate closer to optimum.

5|$|After the pit stops Hartley {{remained}} {{the leader in}} the No. 1 Porsche while Jarvis moved in front of Lotterer because the latter had a longer pit stop. <b>Cumming</b> lost <b>control</b> of the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports Ligier driving into Club corner after encountering a LMGTE Ferrari, went across grass, and spun at the turn's center, allowing Rusinov {{to move into the}} lead of LMP2 and Ricardo González took over second. The LMGTE field began making pit stops after 52 minutes when Darren Turner drove the No. 95 Aston Martin into his pit box while Fernando Rees in the sister No. 97 car was issued with a stop-and-go penalty for exceeding track limits. Both Ford cars moved into second and third in LMGTE Pro when the No. 77 Porsche had only fuel placed inside it. Turner overtook Priaulx for fourth place in LMGTE Pro while Christensen moved ahead of Mücke for second position in the category at Stowe corner. Merhi went wide at Copse corner, which allowed Nelson Panciatici to take advantage, and he overtook Merhi for fifth in LMP2. Kane passed González to move into second in the category. Panciatici heavily out-braked Cumming to claim fourth place while Piquet lost control of his car in an attempt to overtake the defensive Rossiter who kept eighth position.|$|R

25|$|Express riders {{had brought}} the news 1,000 miles from the Missouri River {{settlements}} to Salt Lake City within about {{two weeks of the}} army's start to march west. Fearing the worst as 2,500 troops (roughly 1/3 the army then) led by General Albert Sidney Johnston started west, Brigham Young ordered all residents of Salt Lake City and neighboring communities to prepare their homes for burning and evacuate southward to Utah Valley and southern Utah. Young also sent out a few units of the Nauvoo Legion (the Utah militia consisted roughly of all men between 16 and 60, roughly 8,000–10,000 men), to delay the army's advance. The majority he sent into the mountains to prepare defenses or south to prepare for a scorched earth retreat. Although some army wagon supply trains were captured and burned and herds or army horses and cattle run off no serious fighting occurred. Starting late and short on supplies, the United States Army camped during the bitter winter of 1857–58 near a burned out Fort Bridger in Wyoming. Through the negotiations between emissary Thomas L. Kane, Young, <b>Cumming</b> and Johnston, <b>control</b> of Utah territory was peacefully transferred to Cumming, who entered an eerily vacant Salt Lake City in the spring of 1858. By agreement with Young, Johnston established the army at Fort Floyd 40 miles away from Salt Lake City, to the southwest.|$|R
