2500|$|On the {{following}} days, negotiations between PSOE and minor parties resulted in <b>Canarian</b> <b>Coalition</b> (CC) confirming its affirmative vote for Sánchez, while Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Democracy and Freedom (DiL) announced they would coordinate themselves, together confirming {{their opposition to}} a PSOE-led accord unless it recognized Catalonia's sovereignty by allowing a self-determination referendum to be held. The PSOE accepted both parties' stance, as it would not accept their votes either, opposing a referendum. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) had already rejected supporting Rajoy, and it conditioned support for Sánchez on a new political status for the Basque Country. Euskal Herria Bildu (EH Bildu) opened a window to [...] "involving itself in the investiture" [...] if there was [...] "a real offer of change". Popular Unity (IU–UPeC) kept negotiating with PSOE, with its leaders expressing their interest in preventing [...] "a right-wing government" [...] {{as well as in}} reaching an understanding with other left-wing forces.|$|E

50|$|The Canarian Government is {{drafting}} a new Statute of Autonomy where the Canary Islands will {{be defined as}} a nation. However this nationalism is mild in its formulation; thus independence is not even in the nationalist agenda. Historically, the <b>Canarian</b> <b>Coalition</b> can be deemed more as a lobby in order to favour Canarian interests within Spain rather than a nationalist movement like the ones formulated in other areas.|$|E

50|$|But the 1994 {{elections}} saw {{a considerable}} reduction in Regionalist {{representation in the}} Parliament, with only the <b>Canarian</b> <b>Coalition,</b> Lega Nord, Scottish National Party and People's Union keeping their MEPs. But Lega Nord had been suspended from the EFA following its decision to join the Italian coalition government alongside the right-wing National Alliance. The weakened EFA was {{no longer able to}} maintain their own group, and instead allied with members of the French Energie Radicale to form the Group of the European Radical Alliance.|$|E
50|$|At 156 seats, {{this would}} be the worst {{performance}} for a winning party in Spain until Mariano Rajoy's result in the 2015 election. As a consequence of the election result, Aznar was forced to tone down his attacks to Catalan and Basque nationalists in order to garner their support for his investiture. After two months of negotiations, agreements were reached with CiU, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and <b>Canarian</b> <b>Coalition</b> (CC), enabling for José María Aznar to become Prime Minister of a centre-right minority cabinet, the first in Spain in nearly 14 years.|$|E
50|$|On 3 March 1996, the PP won {{the early}} {{parliamentary}} elections {{and formed a}} government {{with the support of}} the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), Convergence and Union (CiU) and the <b>Canarian</b> <b>Coalition.</b> Rajoy, a long-time associate of newly elected Prime Minister José María Aznar, made the move into national politics in Aznar's first government when he was appointed Minister of Public Administration on 6 May. His term was marked by the adoption, in 1997, of the Law on organization and operation of the general administration of the State (LOFAGE), which regulates the organization and functions of central government, and the Law on Government.|$|E
5000|$|In Spain, {{there is}} a long {{tradition}} of liberalism. This ended with the Franco dictatorship. On a national level there were attempts to establish liberal parties, but they did not succeed until Union, Progress and Democracy (Unión, Progreso y Democracia), a progressive, social liberal and centralist party. It was replaced as major liberal party in 2015 by Citizens - Party of the Citizenry, which is autonomist and postnationalist. On a regional level, the <b>Canarian</b> <b>Coalition</b> (Coalición Canaria) and the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (Convergència Democrática de Catalunya, member ALDE) are nationalist, liberal parties(Main article: Liberalism and radicalism in Spain).|$|E
50|$|The {{party has}} twenty {{seats in the}} Canarian Parliament, the twenty-first seat belongs to the Agrupación Herreña Independiente, also a Canarian {{nationalist}} party that usually contests Canarian elections in coalition with the <b>Canarian</b> <b>Coalition,</b> but as an independent, allied party. In the Cortes Generales, it has one deputy, and two senators, making it the third-largest Canarian party. It usually negotiates with the plurality party at the Cortes to form a majority in exchange for resources for the islands. It also governs the local administrations of Tenerife, La Palma, and Fuerteventura, as well as having majority control {{in most of the}} town councils on the Canary Islands.|$|E
