The Union's budget for 1905-06 was 3,800 rubles, of which 1,000 rubles designated to support other organizations and strikers. In Fall 1906, the Saint Petersburg branch organized an agitation lecture tour; most popular lectures attracted audiences of up to 800. In 1907, the Union distributed 10,000 pamphlets and books in the countryside. Since not all women were literate, joint readings were organized.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} the mechanical properties of carbon fibre composite bone plates {{with those of}} stainless steel and titanium. The composite plates have less stiffness with good fatigue properties. Tissue culture and small animal implantation confirmed the biocompatibility of the material. We also present a preliminary report {{on the use of}} the carbon fibre composite plates in 40 forearm fractures. All fractures united, 67 % of them showing radiological remodelling within six months. There were no refractures or mechanical failures, but five fractures showed an unexpected reaction; this is discussed. In a retrospective review of AO plating in 1 33 forearm 0. 9. fractures (unpublished data) we found that some mechan- 8 ical failure had occurred in 9 % (fracture of plate 3 %, loosening 6 %) while biological failure had occurred in 0. 7 13 % (non-union 5 %, <b>cross</b> <b>union</b> 3 %, infection 5 %). Hadden, Reschauer and Seggl (1984) have reported a 0. 6. similar experience. z 0. 5. This led us to consider the use of a less rigid implant which would provide a more biological method of 0. 4. fixation. Tayton et al (1982) have reported the clinical 0. 3 use of a similar plate for tibial fractures. We now report further developmental and experimental work on these 0. 2. plates, and have analysed our results with special attention to the biological responses. /CFRP blank drilled at hol...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Radial {{bone loss}} {{associated}} with gross manus valgus deformity {{can be managed}} by open reduction internal fixation using intervening strut bone graft, callus distraction using ring or monoaxial fixator, and achieving union by distraction histogenesis. These methods are particularly suitable when bone loss is small. Single or staged procedure is described for congenital {{as well as in}} acquired extensive bone loss of radius. Distraction through radial proximal to distal segments, to achieve reduction of distal radio-ulnar joint (DRUJ), is also described in acquired cases. In the present series, functional results of distraction through ulna to 2 nd metacarpal is studied alongwith, functional status of hand, stability of wrist, level of patient′s satisfaction are also studied. Materials and Methods: 7 unilateral cases of radial loss (M = 5, F = 2) affecting 4 right hands of mean age 17 years (range 9 to 24 years) were included in this study. They were treated by distracting through ulna to 2 nd metacarpal to achieve DRUJ alignment in first stage. Subsequently ulna was osteotomised and translated to distal stump of radius. It was then fixed to the distal radial remnant in 30 ° pronation in dominant and 30 ° supination non dominant hands. Results: Union was achieved in all cases associated with beneficial <b>cross</b> <b>union</b> of distal ulna. Hand functions improved near to normal, with fully corrected stable wrist joint, hypertrophied ulna and without recurrence. All of them had practically complete loss of forearm rotations, however patients were fully satisfied. Conclusion: This method is particularly suitable when associated with 6 cm or more radial bone loss. But when loss is small, sacrifice of one bone may not be justifiable...|$|E

50|$|Shiprow is a {{historic}} street {{in the heart of}} Aberdeen, Scotland, near the harbour.Formerly the Shiprow sloped upward more gradually than it does now, and it <b>crossed</b> <b>Union</b> Street in a depression between St Catherine's Hill on the west and Castle Street, once high uneven ground, on the east. That the Shiprow has been made up several feet can be seen by a house at the end of Exchequer Row, and it <b>crossed</b> <b>Union</b> Street and entered Broad Street at a lower level than the present. The Shiprow {{was one of the most}} important streets in the city, since it led from the harbour into the Castlegate area - the heart of Aberdeen. It is first mentioned in documents in 1281. Over the years it became more and more rundown and, although it had many historic connections, nearly all of it was demolished in the 1950s and 60s.Exchequer Row known locally as Cheq'ra Wynd (first mentioned in 1350) was a short congested lane connecting the Shiprow to the Castlegate, and on its right side, were a number of courts leading into an area crammed with insanitary dwellings which were later demolished. It was popularly supposed that the name Exchequer Row derived from the Aberdeen Mint which stood in the area. However, it comes from the name of the Royal Customs House - the Skakkarium, dating back to the 14th century.|$|R
