5000|$|The {{most common}} of these dating {{techniques}} is Cosmogenic radionuclide dating.Earth is constantly bombarded with primary cosmic rays, high energy charged particles [...] - [...] mostly protons and alpha particles. These particles interact with atoms in atmospheric gases, producing {{a cascade of}} secondary particles that may in turn interact and reduce their energies in many reactions as they pass through the atmosphere. By the time the cosmic ray cascade reaches the surface of Earth it is primarily composed of neutrons. When one of these particles strikes an atom it can dislodge one or more protons and/or neutrons from that atom, producing a different element or a different isotope of the original element. In rock and other materials of similar density, most of the cosmic ray flux is absorbed within the first meter of exposed material in reactions that produce new isotopes called cosmogenic nuclides. At Earth's surface most of these nuclides are produced by neutron spallation. Using certain cosmogenic radionuclides, scientists can date how long a particular surface has been exposed, how long a certain piece of material has been buried, or how quickly a location or drainage basin is eroding. The basic principle is that these radionuclides are produced at a known rate, and also decay at a known rate. Accordingly, by measuring the concentration of these cosmogenic nuclides in a rock sample, and accounting for the flux of the cosmic rays and the half-life of the nuclide, {{it is possible to}} estimate how long the sample has been exposed to the cosmic rays.The <b>cumulative</b> <b>flux</b> of cosmic rays at a particular location can be affected by several factors, including elevation, geomagnetic latitude, the varying intensity of the Earth's magnetic field, solar winds, and atmospheric shielding due to air pressure variations.Rates of nuclide production must be estimated in order to date a rock sample. These rates are usually estimated empirically by comparing the concentration of nuclides produced in samples whose ages have been dated by other means, such as radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, or optically stimulated luminescence.|$|E

However, the associations of cumulative UV exposure based on residential history with different skin cancers, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), have not been evaluated simultaneously in prospective studies. Methods: We conducted a cohort study among 108 [*] 578 women in the Nurses' Health Study (1976 – 2006) to evaluate the relative risks of skin cancers with <b>cumulative</b> UV <b>flux</b> based on residential history in adulthood.

We present results of field tests where drainage was with two types of suction (resolution of 0. 16 and 1. 6 mm (- 1)) and a nonsuction (resolution of 0. 22 mm tip(- 1)) water flux meter (WFM). The soil was a microstructured weathered volcanic ash located on a coral atoll subject to intense rainfall and located in the Kingdom of Tonga. Our objectives were to evaluate water flux measurements by comparing them with (i) simple water balance estimates of <b>cumulative</b> <b>fluxes,</b> (ii) <b>cumulative</b> <b>fluxes</b> deduced from soil moisture content changes, and (iii) simulated fluxes using HYDRUS- 1 D. Soil hydraulic properties were obtained at five soil depths. During the 60 -d evaluation period rainfall totaled 340 mm. The WFMs were installed in duplicate using disturbed soil. The consistency of {{the shape of the}} drainage curves measured with the WFMs, those derived from soil moisture changes, and those obtained with modeling led us to conclude that soil disturbance during WFM installation did not severely influence measurements. This was attributed to the strong microaggregation and disturbance introduced by plowing. Water balance and HYDRUS model estimates of drainage corresponded well with the measurement by nonsuction WFMs. Suction WFMs overestimated drainage, possibly due to flow convergence created by wick and divergence barrier lengths being not properly sized for the observed flow conditions. After the evaluation period some of the WFMs failed to respond. Nevertheless, flux meters are seen as promising tools to provide remote and continuous measurement of root zone drainage...|$|R

Variability {{in the past}} strength of the southwest and northeast monsoons and its influence on primary productivity, sea surface temperature (SST), and planktonic community structure were investigated. The average alkenone-derived SST for the last glacial period was ~ 3 °C lower than that measured for the Holocene. Prior to the deglacial, the lowest SSTs coincide with the highest measured fluxes of organic biomarkers, which represent primarily a planktonic suite of diatoms, coccolithophorids, dinoflagellates, and zooplankton. We propose that intensification of winter northeast monsoon winds during the last glacial period resulted in deep convective mixing, cold SSTs and enhanced primary productivity. In contrast, postdeglacial (< 17 ka) SSTs are warmer during times in which biomarker fluxes are high. Associated with this transition is a planktonic community structure change, in which {{the ratio of the}} average <b>cumulative</b> <b>flux</b> of diatom biomarkers to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flux</b> of coccolithophorid biomarkers is twice as high during the deglacial and Holocene than the average ratio during the last glacial period.

Chambers are the most widely used method to measure N 2 O fluxes, but also micrometeorological methods have successfully been applied. In this paper we present a comparison of N 2 O fluxes measured by non-steady state chambers and eddy covariance (EC) (using an ultra-sonic anemometer coupled with a tunable diode laser) methods from an intensively grazed and fertilised grassland site in South East Scotland. The measurements were taken after fertilisation events in 2003, 2007 and 2008. In four out of six comparison periods a short-lived increase of N 2 O emissions after mineral N application was observed, returning to background level within 2 – 6 days. Highest fluxes were measured by both methods in July 2007 with maximum values of 1300 ng N 2 O-N m− 2 s− 1 (EC) and 651 ng N 2 O-N m− 2 s− 1 (chamber method). Frequently, negative fluxes above the detection limit were observed in all comparison periods by EC, while with chambers negative fluxes were always below detection limit. Despite observed negative fluxes, median and average fluxes over each period were always positive. Over all 6 comparison periods 69 % of N 2 O fluxes measured by EC at the time of chamber closure were within the range of the chamber measurements. Differences between N 2 O fluxes calculated from chamber measurements and EC over the same measurement period were never significant. Overall, N 2 O fluxes measured by EC during the time of chamber closure were smaller compared to those measured by chambers, however this was the case in only 3 out of 6 comparison periods. This inconsistency observed on the same experimental field at different times can partly be {{explained by the fact that}} the different techniques integrate fluxes over different spatial scales. Large fluxes measured by chambers may have represented local hotspots, which made a small contribution to the flux derived by the EC method which integrates fluxes over a larger area. The spatial variability from chamber measurements was high as shown by a coefficient of variation of up to 139 %. No diurnal pattern of N 2 O fluxes was observed, possibly due to the small diurnal variations of soil temperature.

40|$|Summary Nitrogen (N) storage {{capacity}} of cherry (Prunus avium L.) trees grown in sand culture was preconditioned by applying contrasting N supplies for one year. During {{the spring of}} the following year, a constant amount of 15 N was supplied and the dynamics of N remobilization and root uptake were characterized {{as a function of}} internal N status of the trees. To calculate the flux of N through xylem, both xylem sap N con-centration and whole-tree transpiration rates were measured. By comparing the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flux</b> of N through the xylem with the amount of N recovered in the new aboveground growth, we indirectly evaluated the recycling of N in the xylem, i. e., the amount of N derived from shoot–root translocation that was subsequently reloaded into the xylem. The contrasting N storage capacities imposed during the first year affected both N remobilization and uptake from roots in the following year. Recycling of N in the xylem apparently did not occur during the remobilization of internal reserves (i. e., during the first 6 – 8 weeks after bud burst). However, when remobilization declined, measurement of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flux</b> of N through the xylem overestimated the amount of N re-covered in the new biomass, allowing the extent of N recycling to be evaluated. The amount of N recycling in the xylem was greater in high-N trees, which also took up less N through their roots than trees preconditioned to have a lower internal N sta-tus. This suggests that recycling of N in the xylem is a mecha-nism by which plants regulate N uptake by roots...|$|E

The PSFM consists of a symmetric hydrofoil that is vertically installed in a stream and one or more sorbent columns that {{are connected to the}} nonuniform flow field around the hydrofoil. Depending on the ambient flow velocity, a flow occurs through each column, which elutes portions of initially present “resident” tracers in the column, while, at the same time, solutes in the water (e. g., contaminants or nutrients) are retained in the sorbent column. Quantification of the resident tracer mass remaining and the mass of solutes sorbed in the column enables determination of the local cumulative or time-averaged water and solute mass fluxes.

Soil temperature, WFPS and NO 3 − and NH 4 + concentrations were all {{found to be significantly}} affected by land use. Temporal crop effects were also observed in soil inorganic nitrogen dynamics, due in part to C 4 litter incorporation into the soil under Miscanthus.

A combination of eddy covariance, high-resolution dynamic chamber and static chamber methods was used.

Given that REDD will not represent a permanent change in the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flux</b> of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, payment scheme design is motivated {{by the need to}} secure forest carbon sinks over time (the ‘permanence criterion’) while remaining relatively cost-effective. Alternative payment schemes, combining fixed and variable components, are considered in a framework with two competing land uses, forest and agriculture. Cost-effectiveness depends on the dependency structure between the returns from the indexed component of the payment and the returns from the alternative land use, the relative volatility level of the underlying returns, and the relative combination of fixed and variable payments. After developing the general model, it is is applied to REDD policy scenarios in Parana State, Brazil...|$|E

Ozone (O 3) is {{implicated in the}} natural origin of ClO 4 -, and has increased since preindustrial times. O 3 produces ClO 4 - in vitro from Cl -, and plant tissues contain Cl- and redox reactions. We hypothesize that O 3 exposure may induce plant synthesis of ClO 4 -. We exposed contrasting crop species to environmentally relevant O 3 concentrations. In the absence of O 3 exposure, species exhibited a large range of ClO 4 - accumulation {{but there was no}} relationship between leaf ClO 4 - and O 3, whether expressed as exposure or <b>cumulative</b> <b>flux</b> (dose). Older, senescing leaves accumulated more ClO 4 - than younger leaves. O 3 exposed vegetation is not a source of environmental ClO 4 -. There was evidence of enhanced ClO 4 - content in the soil surface at the highest O 3 exposure, which could be a significant contributor to environmental ClO 4 -...|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen cycling {{has been}} studied in soils from Hob Moor, an unimproved, unfertilized and N-impacted acid {{grassland}} near York, UK. Preliminary assessment of 7 soil profiles sampled to 60 cm depth indicated considerable N mineralization and nitrification in sub-soils. Later soils from a freely draining area of the grassland were sampled from 2 superficially similar profiles to 1 m depth to explore interactions between N species transformations and soils properties. The spatial heterogeneity of the 2 soil profiles was not anticipated, and was attributed to different fates of litter inputs to the soils. When N mineralization was expressed on a soil C basis, both profiles followed similar trends. These freely drained acidic profiles showed incredible potential for N mineralization and mobility well below the root zone which potentially could contaminate surface and/or ground-waters. This was confirmed using intact core microcosms with vegetation and litter layers. Episodic drainage water analysis revealed considerable and sustained NH 4 +-N and NO 3 [...] N concentrations from 3 freely draining soil profiles. One profile apparently had litter incorporated into sub-soils and behaved differently {{compared to the other}} two with more surficial litter presence. This led to design of a microcosm study to assess the litter effects on drainage water inorganic nitrogen (DIN), organic nitrogen (DON) and organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and fluxes over a natural seasonal temperature gradient over 7 months from early winter to mid summer. Litter mineralization resulted in substantial NH 4 + production. Temperature apparently showed strong effects on NH 4 + production. Mobile NH 4 + from litter layers raised the extractable NH 4 + concentrations in underlying subsoils. When litter was incorporated within subsoils, it greatly reduced NO 3 - concentrations in the drainage water, especially in winter when NO 3 - is many fold more mobile due to lower biological uptake. Extractable NH 4 + concentrations correlated positively with water-soluble DOC, suggesting a role of DOC in NH 4 + dynamics. In contrast, extractable NO 3 - concentrations were correlated negatively with DOC, indicating a role for DOC in NO 3 - immobilization by acting as substrate for microorganisms. Litter manipulations significantly altered concentrations and fluxes of DIN, DON and DOC in the drainage water. Concentrations of NH 4 + increased substantially after freeze-thaw events, which facilitated NH 4 + mobilization. Litter layers produced sustainable DOC and DON in the drainage water. In summer, increase in temperature significantly enhanced DOC and DON concentrations for the control and surface litter treatments; however, the reverse behaviour was observed for the subsurface litter treatment. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>fluxes</b> indicated that DON formed a significant component of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), 42, 46 and 62 % for the control, surface litter and subsurface litter treatments respectively. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>fluxes</b> showed net NH 4 + retention in each treatment and significant reduction in NO 3 - flux associated with subsurface litter placement.
