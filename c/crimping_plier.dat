One require-ment to perform a resistant assembly is to master crimping parameters. Numerical simulation is then an efficient tool to limit tedious experimental test campaigns. Nevertheless, the numerical model accuracy depends on input data determina-tion, such as material behaviour law parameters. This paper deals with study done to determine material behaviour law parameters of component involved on electri-cal crimping process. The two samples, a strand and an electrical contact, have both small dimensions and specific shapes. For that reason, normalised tensile or compression tests could not be perform. Indeed, inverse analysis is a powerful tool to determine the behaviour laws parameters. The goal is to precisely model the sample mechanical solicitation. A series of computations is launched with various rheological parameters. By comparing experimental and simulated results, {{the goal is to}} minimize a cost function. Thus, the first step of the study has been to determine experimental tests to perform in order to gather the force/displacement experimental data. The copper strands have been studied in compression, with a micro indentation de-vice. A 60 N force sensor has been used to acquire force data, whereas an inductive displacement sensor has been used for displacement acquisition data. The 60 N force sensor is too weak to crush completely a copper contact. For that sample, we decided to use an instrumented <b>crimping</b> <b>plier.</b> A series of crimping tests has been performed on empty barrel, and the equivalent simulation has been done. With the best copper strand material parameters set, relative errors between experimental and simulated copper strand data finally amount to 6. 9 % (lower than the 8 % experimental data scattering). On the other side, with the best cop-per contact material parameters set, the cost function amounts to 4 % (lower than the 7 % experimental data scattering). This study allows to determine material parameters sets which are use to simulate efficiently the crimping process...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing defects are {{inherent}} to any manufacturing process. However, in composite materials {{they might be}} unavoidable, e. g. ply waviness or even folds of plies are present in complex shaped parts during high pressure resin transfer molding of carbon fiber reinforced polymers. In this work, {{the effect of the}} ply folds on the fatigue life of the composite material is investigated. Folds along fiber direction (as they commonly appear during manufacturing) were artificially introduced in unidirectional non <b>crimp</b> fabric <b>plies.</b> The target of this study is the prediction of damage initiation due to this particular type of manufacturing defect. The folds locally increase the fiber volume fraction and also introduce resin rich areas. Fatigue tests in fiber direction and transverse to fiber direction are performed at different load ratios under constant amplitude loading. The influence of the defect geometry on damage initiation and progression is investigated at different scales by non-destructive methods before testing, continuous strain measurement and monitoring the damage progression during testing and fractography analysis after final failure. Most of the time, the first damage was observed at the location of the introduced fold for all considered load cases. However, it was also found, that the folds lead to no significant reduction in fatigue lif...|$|R
