40|$|Standard {{procedures}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>collocates,</b> which involve the elaboration of lists of <b>collocates</b> on a two-by-two basis, are far from optimum for the study of connectivity, i. e. observing whether these <b>collocates</b> in turn display a tendency to co-occur or not. This paper explores an alternative strategy that has garnered considerable interest in recent years: that of using Social Network Analysis procedures. Lists of <b>collocates</b> (concgrams) were extracted from a one million word corpus of crime journalism using standard techniques. Gephi software was then used to transform the list of <b>collocates</b> into a network. A small number of <b>collocate</b> pairs were seen to be isolates, i. e. <b>collocating</b> only with each other, while the majority belonged to the giant component, composed of pairs in which at least one member <b>collocates</b> with at least one other word. Modules (clusters of highly interconnected <b>collocates)</b> were identified; these were seen to pertain to specific subject areas. The corpus was then re-examined to see where these clusters of <b>collocates</b> occurred, and co-occurred, and to gauge how much this technique may tell us about the ‘aboutness’ of particular texts...|$|R

5|$|The {{depression}} slid slowly northwestward {{between the}} contiguous upper vortex {{and a large}} high-pressure region over the central Atlantic. A region of lighter wind shear ahead, {{as well as an}} anticipated weakening of the upper cyclone, prompted the NHC to introduce the possibility of a tropical transition. Later, satellite observations showed a rapid improvement in the depression's structure; convective banding wrapped completely around the broad inner wind field, which produced gusts to 65mph (105km/h). Accordingly, the NHC upgraded the depression to Subtropical Storm Otto at 21:00UTC on October6, about 215mi (345km) northeast of Grand Turk. Although satellite images continued to display a classical subtropical cyclone, with Otto's center and the vortex aloft nearly <b>collocated,</b> data from a Hurricane Hunters aircraft indicated a weak warm convective core was developing within the mid levels of the circulation—a feature normally present at the upper levels of tropical cyclones. Moreover, a contraction of the large wind field reaffirmed that Otto was entering the final stages of its tropical transition. Although convective activity briefly weakened overnight, weakening shear and considerably warmer sea surface temperatures permitted small patches of thunderstorms to refire on the morning of October7. As Otto meandered northward, temperature contrasts from forecast models indicated that the warm core within the circulation had ascended to the upper levels of the cyclone. In consequence, a burst of deep, tropical convection with extreme cloud top temperatures of approximately 112°F (80°C) occurred over the center. Having shed the last of its subtropical characteristics, Otto became a warm-core system and was operationally declared tropical at 1200UTC that day.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe shrubs of Artemisia sphaerocephala show {{different}} patterns ware investigated in the Mu Us Sandy Land of north central China. Supported by field observation and, {{based on the}} understanding of wind field distribution and wind energy change, the mechanism of planting disposition to prevent soil wind erosion was analyzed using aerodynamics principle. The result indicates that the wind speed profile of Artemisia sphaerocephala with banding <b>collocate,</b> uniformity, and stochastic model all follow one-variable linear regression. The rate of change of wind velocity in shrubs with “banding <b>collocate</b> model” is biggest, the one with “uniformity model” comes second, and the one with “stochastic model” is the smallest. Under the same condition of vegetation coverage, the variation tendency of the stability of surface roughness and the average windbreak effect for three distribution modes {{is the same as}} that of rate of change of wind velocity. The shrubs of Artemisia sphaerocephala with “banding <b>collocate</b> model” reduce the wind velocity at 20 cm and are remarkably superior to that of the other two. At the height of 50 cm, the effect of windbreak for the shrubs with “banding <b>collocate</b> model” are 22. 9 % higher than the one with stochastic model, but there is a significant between the shrubs with “banding <b>collocate</b> model” and “uniformity model”. From this we can find out the shrubs of Artemisia sphaerocephala with the banding <b>collocate</b> model is optimum for controlling wind erosion...|$|R

40|$|L 2 {{learners}} often produce “ungrammatical” {{word combinations}} such as, e. g., *give a suggestion or *make a walk. This {{is because of}} the “collocationality” of one of their items (the base) that limits the acceptance of <b>collocates</b> to express a specific meaning (‘perform’ above). We propose an algorithm that delivers, for a given base and the intended meaning of a <b>collocate,</b> the actual <b>collocate</b> lexeme(s) (make / take above). The algorithm exploits the/nlinear mapping between bases and <b>collocates</b> from examples and generates a collocation transformation matrix which is then applied to novel unseen cases.
