5|$|Most common ravens prefer wooded {{areas with}} large expanses of open land nearby, or <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In {{some areas of}} dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take {{advantage}} of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} growth of Indonesian eastern zone has {{lower than that}} of Indonesian western area relatively. Within pushing {{economic growth}}, poor region will faster than rich region, income disparity among region in Indonesian Eastern Region will converge. The phenomena also could be seen from comparing among <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> in the area. The research was aimed to know of technological contribution in converging of economic growth among <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> in Indonesian eastern area. Data were panel data from period 1975 - 2002 which were analyzed using Total Factor Productivity (TFP) catch-up model and Technological transferring model. The results show that within TFP model, the difference of technological level among <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> in Indonesian Eastern Area brought of difference of catching TFP significantly. If the difference of technological level was gone, catching of TFP would show at the faster level and pushing converge at the income level among <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> in Indonesian Eastern area. Within technological transferring model, most of the convergence come from technological transfer with the difference of technological level among <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> are widest. If the difference was gone, the technological transfer would be faster and more pushing of income converging among <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> in Indonesian eastern zone...|$|R

5|$|The Bruneian Empire was {{established}} in the <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> of Sarawak by the mid-15th century, and the Kuching area was known to Portuguese cartographers during the 16th century as Cerava, one of the five great seaports of Borneo. It was also during this time that witnessed the birth of the Sultanate of Sarawak, a local kingdom that lasted for almost half a century before being reunited with Brunei in 1641. By the early 19th century, the Bruneian Empire was in decline, retaining only a tenuous hold along the <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> of Sarawak which were otherwise controlled by semi-independent Malay leaders. Away from the coast, territorial wars were fought between the Iban and a Kenyah-Kayan alliance.|$|E

A possible explanation for the high participation in the northern <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> is a combination of (1) a high degree of manufacturing in the northern <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> and (2) supply side factors that motivate women to work.

5|$|As Bob moved {{towards the}} U.S. Gulf Coast, the National Weather Service issued gale {{warnings}} for <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> extending from Vermilion Bay, Louisiana to Biloxi, Mississippi at 1600 UTC on July 10. These warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings upon Bob's strengthening {{to such an}} intensity. During the storm's existence, forecasts and predictions from the National Hurricane Center were of greater accuracy than on average. In addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches, the agency also advised small craft from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida to remain in port.|$|E

When forecasts indicated a landfall east of the state, the hurricane watch was canceled and the hurricane warning amended to a tropical storm warning. By September29, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the seizure of the American vessels, Congress debated and approved the Naval Act of 1794, which authorized the building of six frigates, four of 44 guns and two of 36 guns. Supporters were mostly from the northern states and the <b>coastal</b> <b>regions,</b> who argued the Navy would result in savings in insurance and ransom payments, while opponents from southern states and inland regions thought a navy was not worth the expense and would drive the United States into more costly wars.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of Indonesian {{intelligence}} influential with Suharto {{had initially}} envisaged that invasion, subdual of Fretilin resistance, and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless. The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were devastating for the East Timorese, an enormous drain on Indonesian resources, were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally, and ultimately a failure. The wanton, wholesale killings by the TNI near the <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> {{during the opening}} months of the invasion had driven {{a large portion of}} the population and most of the remaining Falintil into the central regions. This proved counterproductive as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to agricultural resources and population. The civilian population came to see the Falintil as a buffer against the excesses of the Indonesian forces, which led to heightened support for the resistance. From 1975 to 1977, the Fretilin protected at least 40% of the population who had fled the <b>coastal</b> <b>regions,</b> in inhospitable conditions, with the active support of rallied communities. Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military's power base remained barely dented by the mid-1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures, was a measure of the military's dominance of Indonesian affairs.|$|E

Extension across a broad area of northeast Japan and contraction across the onshore Pacific <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> and the offshore area are also produced by the mantle wedge relaxation (Fig.  4 c).

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands.

5|$|No {{tropical}} cyclone warnings or watches were issued {{in relation to}} Sergio. Several storm advisories indicated a slight threat to <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> of Mexico; the National Hurricane Center assessed a 29% probability of tropical storm-force winds affecting Barra de Navidad in Jalisco. From November 16 and 17, the outer rainbands of the hurricane dropped light precipitation along the Mexican coastline, peaking at 1.97inches (50mm) at Tierra Colorada in Guerrero.|$|E
5|$|Often in {{part because}} of the threat of hurricanes, many <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> had sparse {{population}} between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.|$|E
