40|$|The {{cleaning}} of pipework from fluids of high viscosity {{is a significant}} problem in many food and personal care industries which can cause considerable economic and environmental impact. Three stages are identified in the {{cleaning of}} straight pipes; (i) a short core removal stage of product recovery, before water breaks through the filled pipe, (ii) the 1 st <b>cleaning</b> <b>stage</b> (film removal stage) {{when there is a}} continuous wavy annular film on the wall, and (iii) the 2 nd <b>cleaning</b> <b>stage</b> (patch removal stage) in which the material is present as patches on the wall.

40|$|Food {{manufacturing}} processes require frequent cleaning {{to assure the}} quality of the end product and to maintain a faultless mode of operation of the equipment. However, the environmental impact of such cleaning steps, which are known to consume large amounts of water, energy and chemicals, is rarely assessed. The objective of this work therefore is to quantify the environmental impact of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>stages</b> of an industrial food manufacturing process consisting of milk protein separation using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and to demonstrate the application of LCA for improvement of the process design. The inventory of the foreground system was established based on a collaborative project between several research institutes and industrial partners. Generic data was derived from the Ecoinvent V 2. 2 data base and a comparative attributional Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) was carried out using IMPACT 2002 + and the Simapro 8. 0 software. The environmental impact of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>stages</b> corresponds to 31 % {{of the impact of the}} entire process, compared to 65 % for the production phase, 3 % for the transport and 1 % for the equipment. To reduce the environmental burden of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>stages</b> two different strategies have been applied: (C 1) reutilization of the process water from the reverse osmosis used for the concentration of the milk proteins as rinsing water and (C 2) rationalization (i. e. less frequent renewal) of the cleaning solutions. Strategy C 1 requires supplementary equipment for treatment of the permeate produced by the reverse osmosis thus generating an additional impact. Nonetheless, it allows a significant reduction of both the water consumption by 316 m 3 /day (583 m 3 milk treated/day) and the aquatic ecotoxicity impact of the entire process by 26 %, mainly due to a lesser utilization of the potable water network. The second strategy (C 2) decreases the environmental impact of the entire process by less than 10 %. Both strategies could be implemented simultaneously thus leading to an even more considerable improvement of the environmental performance. Note that the environmental impact is generally underestimated due to incomplete data regarding the cleaning agents, missing impact factors for certain chemical compounds and the exclusion of the water volume. Besides, the economic impact of the very time intensive cleaning procedures is not addressed at this stage. This work demonstrates the usefulness of LCA for decision-making on more efficient process design and it emphasizes to increase efforts for improving the cleaning operations of food processes to reduce their impact on the environment...|$|R

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that the optimum separation performances achieved by multiple <b>stage</b> <b>cleaning</b> using various column flotation technologies and single <b>stage</b> <b>cleaning</b> using a Packed-Flotation Column are superior to the performance achieved by the traditional release procedure, {{especially in terms of}} pyritic sulfur rejection. This superior performance {{is believed to be the}} result of the advanced flotation mechanisms provided by column flotation technologies. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a suitable process utilizing the advanced froth flotation mechanisms to characterize the true flotation response of a coal sample. This investigation resulted in the development of a modified coal flotation characterization procedure, termed as the Advanced Flotation Washability (AFW) technique. The apparatus used for this procedure is a batch operated Packed-Column device which provides enhanced selectivity due to a plug-flow environment and a deep froth zone. The separation performance achieved by the AFW procedure was found to be superior to those produced by the conventional tree and release procedures for three nominally - 100 mesh coal samples and two micronized samples. The largest difference in separation performance was obtained on the basis of product pyritic sulfur content. A comparison conducted between the AFW and the release procedures at an 80 % recovery value showed that the AFW technique provided a 19 % improvement in the reduction of pyritic sulfur. For an Illinois No. 5 coal sample, this improvement corresponded to a reduction in pyritic sulfur content from 1. 38 % to 0. 70 % or a total rejection of 66 %. Micronization of the sample improved the pyritic sulfur rejection to 85 % while rejecting 92 % of the ash-bearing material. In addition, the separation performance provided by the AFW procedure was superior to that obtained from multiple <b>cleaning</b> <b>stages</b> using a continuous Packed-Column under both kinetic and carrying-capacity limiting conditions...|$|R

30|$|The {{gasification}} and gas cleaning, biomass pretreatment, {{and road}} infrastructure stages {{contribute significantly to}} the GWP results for all systems, whereas the cultivation stage is a large contributor for the straw-based systems. In most biomass systems, negative emissions are produced during the biofuel conversion stage as the excess electricity is exported to the grid. Specifically for the FT diesel conversion stage, the production of naphtha and kerosene results in additional benefits. However, these benefits are smaller than the excess electricity benefits. In general, between the TB- and TW-based systems, torrefaction results in benefits in the pretreatment stage, due to decreasing the electricity requirements of the pelletization step, and in the transportation stage due to the feedstock having a higher calorific value. Hence, fewer feedstock (in mass unit) should be transported to produce {{the same amount of}} transportation fuel (in energy unit) in the torrefied system. Moreover, torrefaction results in benefits in the gasification and gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>stage</b> by lowering the requirements for the gas cleaning step due to the lower tar content of the product gas. On the other hand, due to the mass and energy losses during torrefaction, more wood chips are required for the TB-based systems, which result in higher storage emissions of the wood chips.|$|E

30|$|Regarding the {{compressed}} SNG systems, the straw-based system {{results in the}} best environmental performance. The three biomass systems are comparable with respect to biomass pretreatment and gasification and gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>stages.</b> However, this difference in the GWP of the straw-based system derives mainly from negative emissions due to the excess electricity produced in the biofuel conversion stage, due to the high steam content of the product gas. The cultivation stage of the straw-based system contributes significantly to its GWP, but not to an extent that offsets the benefits of excess electricity generation. Our GWP results are partially in agreement with Alamia et al. [9] who reported a value of 200  g CO 2 eq km− 1. These authors modelled the GoBiGas demonstration plant; hence, they assumed larger transportation distances and they considered compressed SNG with a lower LHV (approximately 10 %) than this study. On the other hand, Hurtig et al. [14] reported a much lower GWP value of 40  g CO 2  eq km− 1.

Results A full scale UF module was operated continuously for 2 years, treating highly variable surface water. The sustainable hydraulic conditions leading to a greater water yield from the direct UF treatment scheme under different scenarios were defined. Summer periods enabled the attainment of higher filtration fluxes, although raw river water showed greater turbidity and total suspended solids content. Winter periods presented higher dissolved organic carbon concentration, with greater biopolymers content, which have been claimed as main membrane foulants. A preliminary micro-coagulation of FeCl 3 (< 1. 5 mg Fe(III) L- 1) enabled supporting harsher hydraulic conditions and thus, implementing similar conditions throughout the year.

30|$|It is {{concluded}} that the transportation biofuels did not offer environmental benefits in every single impact category when they replaced fossil fuels. However, all biomass systems resulted in a better aggregated environmental performance than the fossil resource-based systems. Moreover, all biomass systems resulted in a substantial GWP reduction, from 45 to 78 %, and they comply with the RED 2009 / 28 /EC. For 2017 only the bio-H 2 systems, the straw-based SNG system and the TW- and TB-based FT diesel systems comply with the RED target. In case European countries have {{to comply with the}} even more stringent target of 60 % emissions savings for new production plants, then all systems would be benefited if less fossil sources are used. The bio-H 2 systems result in the largest benefits with respect to GWP, ranging between 84 and 93  g CO 2 eq km− 1, whereas the TB- and TW-based FT diesel systems offer overall benefits which concern not only the Port Vision 2030 target of CO 2 emissions reduction (122 and 114  g CO 2 eq km− 1, respectively), but also the air quality improvement of the broader area as well (0.039 and 0.064  g PM  2.5  eq  km− 1, respectively). However, the biomass systems resulted in inferior performance regarding AP, EP, or PMP, except for TB- and TW-based FT diesel systems which showed benefits in the AP and PMP impact categories. In general, wood offers more environmental benefits than straw as feedstock due to the emissions associated with the cultivation and collection stage of straw, and wood torrefaction offers additional benefits in the transportation and in gasification and gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>stages.</b> The storage emissions of wood chips are contributing up to 11 % of the GWP; thus, a proper management of the wood supply chain is highly recommended to even eliminate this contribution. Other contributors to environmental impacts are the pretreatment and gasification and gas <b>cleaning</b> <b>stages,</b> up to approximately 34 % for both, of the biomass systems. Both stages can be further improved two- or threefold using electricity sources with a lower carbon footprint. In addition, in this study, propane is consumed in the torrefaction plant for heat production. However, in the future, when the CO 2 targets become more stringent, a torrefaction plant would reduce the fossil fuels utilization and use a renewable energy source for its heat requirements. Finally, the economic allocation (already) integrated in the ecoinvent database affects the final results and LCA practitioners should import data from databases with caution. Therefore, it is recommended that the port authorities investigate the economical aspect of utilizing torrefied wood pellets and wood pellets regarding such biomass to transportation fuel pathways.|$|R

Cumulative legislative, economic and ecological pressure along with a growing demand for food in developing and emerging, and functionalized food in Western countries call for revision of the state-of-the-art food manufacturing. The aforementioned constraints merely reduce the degrees of freedom with respect to both design and process control and prevent the search for a real compromise between the different and often conflicting technological, economic and environmental objectives of a process. The purpose of this paper hence is to propose an integral simulation-optimization ecodesign approach (ISOA), especially designed for food {{manufacturing processes}} and to address the research questions in order to promote a sustainable food industry. The ISOA encompasses simulation of both the production of utilities and the food process itself considering the generation of waste, wastewater and by-products in addition to environmental and socio-economic impact assessment, multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision-making thus directing at an optimal process control. The ISOA likewise considers the food quality including bacterial safety and the nutritional, techno-functional and gustative properties of the food product. However, implementation of the ISOA proves difficult due to the deficient understanding of the impact of processes on the food properties and the subsequent lack of models.

40|$|Daoism is a {{traditional}} Chinese religion. Daoism has had a deep and pervasive impact {{on the lives of}} China’s peoples. Chinese theatrical performances were often integrated with religious activities, thereby gradually giving rise to many forms of popular drama that are deeply inflected with religious overtones. Xianggong Tapeng (相公踏棚, Xianggong stamps the shed) is one component of Puxian opera’s rites for <b>stage</b> <b>cleaning</b> that is closely linked with Daoist thought. First, Xianggong is both a theatrical spirit within Puxian opera {{and a member of the}} Daoist pantheon. Second, the lyric “luo li lian” featured in Xianggong Tapeng bears a remarkable resemblance to the two Daoist spells Yuanshuai Zhou (元帥咒, Incantation of Yuanshuai) and Xiangmo Zhou (降魔咒, Incantation for Subduing Demons). This is due to the fact that traditional Daoist verse often features phrases such as “luo li lian”. Moreover, the <b>stage</b> <b>cleaning</b> rites that are characteristic of Puxian opera share many similarities with Daoist altar purification rites. A detailed investigation and comparison reveal that Xianggong Tapeng is an adaptation of the Daoist altar purification rite to the needs of popular custom and theatrical performance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} methods developed to increase {{the quality of the}} crescent bond together with the tail bond quality. Low pull force of the crescent bond limits the usage of insulated Au wire in microelectronics assembly. Premature break of the tail which results in the stoppage of the bonding machine is one of obstacles to overcome for Cu wire. The primary focus of this thesis is to understand the tail and crescent bonding process and then to propose methodologies to improve thermosonic wire bonding processes when Cu and insulated Au wires are used. Several series of experiments to investigate the crescent and tail bonding processes are performed on auto bonders. Cu and insulated Au wires with diameters of 25 mm are bonded on the diepads of Ag leadframes. For simplicity, wire loops are oriented perpendicular to the ultrasonic direction. It was found that the crescent bond breaking force by pulling the wire loop (pull force) with insulated Au wire is about 80 % of that of bare Au wire. A modification of the crescent bonding process is made to increase the pull force with insulated Au wire. In the modified process, an insulation layer removing stage (<b>cleaning</b> <b>stage)</b> is inserted before the bonding stage. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>stage</b> consists of a scratching motion (shift) toward to the ball bond in combination with ultrasound. Bonds are then made on the fresh diepad with the insulation removed from the contact surface of the insulated Au wire. This process increases the pull force of the crescent bond up to 26 % which makes it comparable to the results obtained with bare Au wire. An online tail breaking force measurement method is developed with a proximity sensor between wire clamp and horn. Detailed understanding of tail bond formation is achieved by studying tail bond imprints with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. Descriptions are given of the dependence of the tail breaking force on the bonding parameters, metallization variation, and cleanliness of the bond pad. Simultaneous optimization with pull force and tail breaking force can optimize the Cu wire bonding process both with high quality and robustness. It is recommended to first carry out conventional pull force optimization followed by a minimization of the bonding force parameter to the lowest value still fulfilling the pull force cpk requirement. The tail bond forms not only under the capillary chamfer, but also under the capillary hole. The tail breaking force includes both the interfacial bond breaking strength and the breaking strength of the thinned portion of the wire that will remain at the substrate as residue. Close investigations of the tail bond imprint with scanning electron microscopy indicate the presence of fractures of the substrate indicating substrate material being picked up by Cu wire tail. Pick up is found on Au and Cu wires, but the amount of pick up is much larger on Cu wire. The effect on the hardness of the subsequently formed Cu free air ball (FAB) as investigated with scanning electron microscopy and micro - hardness test shows that Cu FABs containing Au and Ag pick ups are softer than those without pick up. However, the hardness varies significantly more with Au pick up. The amount of Au pick up is estimated higher than 0. 03 % of the subsequently formed FAB volume, exceeding typical impurity and dopant concentrations (0. 01 %) added during manufacturing of the wire...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to reinvestigate the release analysis procedure, which is traditionally conducted using a laboratory Denver cell, and to develop a modified process that can be used for all froth flotation technologies. Recent studies have found that the separation performance achieved by multiple stage cleaning and, in some cases, single stage cleaning using column flotation is superior to the performance achieved by the traditional release procedure. These findings are a result of the advanced flotation mechanisms provided by column flotation, which will be incorporated into a modified release analysis procedure developed in this study. A fundamental model of an open column has been developed which incorporates the effects of system hydrodynamics, froth drop-back, selective and non-selective detachment, operating parameters, feed solids content, and feed component flotation kinetics. Simulation results obtained during this reporting period indicate that the ultimate separation that can be achieved by a column flotation process can only be obtained in a single <b>cleaning</b> <b>stage</b> if the detachment mechanism in the froth phase is highly selective, which does not appear to occur in practice based on experimental results. Two to three cleaning stages were found to be required to obtain the ultimate performance if non-selective detachment or kinetic limiting conditions are assumed. this simulated finding agrees well with the experimental results obtained from the multiple stage cleaning of an Illinois No. 5 seam coal using the Packed-Column. Simulated results also indicate that the separation performance achieved by column flotation improves with increasing feed solids content after carrying-capacity limiting conditions are realized. These findings will be utilized in the next reporting period to modify the traditional release analysis procedure...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to improve the {{flotation}} selectivity between galena and sphalerite during the flotation of a Cu-Pb-Zn sulphide composite ore from the Rosh Pinah Mine (Namibia). Xanthate collectors {{were found to be}} unselective for the flotation of the Rosh Pinah composite sample. It was observed that the recovery of sphalerite increased with both the recovery of galena and the concentrate mass pull. In addition, the recovery of sphalerite increased after activation with Cu(II) ions while that of galena decreased when the composite was dry ground in a mild steel mill with mild steel grinding media. However, the recovery of galena was not affected after wet milling in a stainless steel mill. The recovery of Cu(II) -activated sphalerite was independent of the milling environment (wet or dry) and grinding media. The activation of sphalerite by cuprous cyanide complexes, which are present in the recycled water, was clearly shown in this study. Both batch flotation tests and XPS analysis have confirmed that sphalerite was activated by copper(I) from the cuprous cyanide complexes. The recovery of copper(I) -activated sphalerite increased further when the composite was dry milled as compared to wet milling. Batch flotation tests have shown that the use of cyanide alone is not efficient for the depression of sphalerite due to the mineralogical texture of the Rosh Pinah ore. A large quantity of galena locked and/or attached to sphalerite was observed in the lead concentrate. Their prevalence increased with increasing particle size. The use of both cyanide and zinc sulphate improved the depression of sphalerite much better than cyanide alone. A flowsheet has been proposed to improve selectivity between galena and sphalerite in the lead flotation circuit. It includes the regrinding of the lead rougher concentrate prior to the <b>cleaning</b> <b>stage</b> due to poor liberation between galena and sphalerite.
