25|$|The Dreamhold, by Andrew Plotkin (2004). Designed {{for those}} new to IF, it {{provides}} an extensive help section and tutorials. Although the puzzles are not too difficult, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for both novice and experienced players.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{language}} learning in classrooms {{focused more on}} reading and writing than on speaking. The use of modern technology has made it more practical for second language learners to actually practice speaking. One approach is use a video-call technology such as Skype to pair off two students who wish to learn each other's native language. One obvious advantage of using such technology {{is that there is}} no need for the two students to be geographically close. Though if they are in very different time-zones, finding a suitable time <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge.</b>|$|E
25|$|Individuals with BPD {{sometimes}} use {{mental health}} services extensively. People with this diagnosis accounted for about 20 percent of psychiatric hospitalizations in one survey. The majority of BPD patients continue to use outpatient treatment in a sustained manner for several years, but the number using the more restrictive and costly forms of treatment, such as inpatient admission, declines with time. Experience of services varies. Assessing suicide risk <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for {{mental health services}} (and patients themselves tend to underestimate the lethality of self-injurious behaviours) with typically a chronically elevated risk of suicide much above that {{of the general population}} and a history of multiple attempts when in crisis.|$|E

50|$|For {{speakers}} of French, la dictée <b>is</b> <b>a</b> school exercise that aims at testing {{the mastery of}} orthography and grammar. Since many features of French grammar are distinguished in writing but not in speech, this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> task.|$|R
40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} {{the performance of}} photovoltaic systems <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> undertaking, but <b>a</b> necessary one to assess the financial viability of a PV system and to accelerate the wide scale deployment of PV. PV system energy production <b>can</b> <b>be</b> affected by numerous factors including the choice of location...|$|R
25|$|Another {{challenge}} of feminist historians is integration in digital format. Women’s historians {{have had some}} success in working with digital humanists in creating their databases, but the databases {{are few and far}} between. This creates a problem for feminist historians trying to create a feminist history database based on women’s history databases. Since data mining is not a field many digital humanist women are involved in, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to find the necessary relationships between these few. Though Filene argues that data mining {{is the best way to}} integrate histories, this lack of involvement by feminist digital humanists detaches the work from others sharing similar feminist historian’s work.|$|E
25|$|Hognose snakes are {{frequently}} found in herpetoculture. Heterodon nasicus are often {{considered to be}} the easiest to care for, and captive-bred stock is easily found. Heterodon platirhinos is also commonly found, but their dietary requirements <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for some keepers, and there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that feeding them a diet of exclusively rodents contributes to liver problems and a shortened life span. Leioheterodon species are imported regularly from Madagascar, and are not often bred in captivity and get much larger, so can pose a set of different challenges for care. Lystrophis species are fairly new to the commercial reptile trade, and are now commonly bred in captivity, but can be some of the more expensive hognose snakes available.|$|E
500|$|Choosing a {{software}} tool for structural alignment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> {{due to the}} large variety of available packages that differ significantly in methodology and reliability.

25|$|The top-most {{layer of}} <b>a</b> quilt <b>is</b> usually made from cotton {{quilting}} fabric. Selecting the fabric <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> exercise, {{and the number}} of different fabrics required depends on the quilting pattern selected.

2500|$|For a {{small number}} of bodies, an -body problem can be solved using direct methods, also called particle–particle methods. These methods numerically {{integrate}} the differential equations of motion. Numerical integration for this problem <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> for several reasons. First, the gravitational potential is singular; it goes to infinity as the distance between two particles goes to zero. The gravitational potential may be softened to remove the singularity at small distances: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another popular {{setup is}} the biotope {{aquarium}}. A biotope aquarium is a recreation {{of a specific}} natural environment. Some {{of the most popular}} biotopes are the freshwater habitats of the Amazon and Rio Negro rivers, the African rift lake environments of Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika, and saltwater coral reefs of Australia, the Red Sea, and the Caribbean. The fish, plants, substrate, rocks, wood, coral, and any other component of the display should completely match that of the local natural environment. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to recreate such environments, and most [...] "true" [...] biotopes will only have a few (if not only one) species of fish and invertebrates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{realism of}} the viewing {{experience}} in a planetarium depends significantly on the dynamic range of the image, i.e., the contrast between dark and light. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> in any domed projection environment, because a bright image projected {{on one side of}} the dome will tend to reflect light across to the opposite side, [...] "lifting" [...] the black level there and so making the whole image look less realistic. Since traditional planetarium shows consisted mainly of small points of light (i.e., stars) on a black background, this was not a significant issue, but it became an issue as digital projection systems started to fill large portions of the dome with bright objects (e.g., large images of the sun in context). For this reason, modern planetarium domes are often not painted white but rather a mid grey colour, reducing reflection to perhaps 35-50%. This increases the perceived level of contrast.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of gene {{expression}} patterns during {{early stages of}} mammalian embryonic development can provide important clues about gene function, cell-cell interaction and signaling mechanisms that guide embryonic patterning.

40|$|Electrode {{movement}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> {{issue in}} EIT modelling. In {{cases where the}} imaged region is changing, such as lung EIT, small artefacts may arise.

5000|$|Long term {{nature of}} {{advocacy}}: Since many advocacy goals are long term, measuring impact <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenge.</b> Instead, outcomes, interim progress, and intermediary goals are the preferred measures of influence.|$|E
40|$|Adreno-cortical {{insufficiency}} in {{the context}} of <b>an</b> adrenal mass <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>challenging</b> clinical problem.
