50|$|In 1991 Turtle-Pac {{came up with}} a {{solution}} to this problem with the development of a collapsible Ferry Tank. Unlike aluminum tanks, the <b>collapsible</b> <b>tank</b> is made of a soft structure that can alter shape under high “G” loads, which increases its puncture and burn resistance. Furthermore, the tanks self-wedge into the fuselage and is gripped by friction. This reduces the load on the tie point considerably.|$|E
5000|$|A {{portable}} {{water tank}} {{is a temporary}} <b>collapsible</b> <b>tank</b> designed for the reserve storage of water in firefighting, emergency relief, and military applications. These tanks can be either supported or unsupported. The supported tanks have a steel or aluminum frame and {{range in size from}} 600 to 5000 US gallons or larger by custom design. Portable water tanks are also unsupported such as self-supporting tanks (onion tanks), blivets and pillow or bladder tanks and are available in sizes ranging from 100 gal up to 80,000 gal.|$|E
40|$|Tanks for bulk liquid {{containment}} will {{be required}} to support advanced planetary exploration programs. Potential applications include storage of potable, process, and waste water, and fuels and process chemicals. The launch mass and volume penalties inherent in rigid tanks suggest that collapsible tanks may be more efficient. Collapsible tanks are made of lightweight flexible material and can be folded compactly for storage and transport. Although collapsible tanks for terrestrial use are widely available, a new design was developed that has significantly less mass and bulk than existing models. Modelled after the shape of a sessible drop, this design features a dual membrane with a nearly uniform stress distribution and a low surface-to-volume ratio. It can be adapted to store a variety of liquids in nearly any environment with constant acceleration field. Three models of 10 L, 50 L, and 378 L capacity have been constructed and tested. The 378 L (100 gallon) model weighed less than 10 percent of a commercially available <b>collapsible</b> <b>tank</b> of equivalent capacity, and required less than 20 percent of the storage space when folded for transport...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the method for quality measurement method about <b>collapsible</b> fuel <b>tank,</b> and mathematical model {{about the quality}} of the fluid inside <b>collapsible</b> fuel <b>tank</b> is set up. Comparing the calculate results and principle experimental obtained results, the method of quality measurement is validated. The method is characterized in simple and high measurement precision, which can be extended to apply in measuring the quality of liquid of large-scale irregularly shaped or <b>collapsible</b> fuel <b>tank...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to steel <b>tanks,</b> <b>collapsible</b> fabric <b>tanks</b> can be relatively easily and quickly transported, unfolded, and deployed-features {{that make them}} a logical choice for applications in remote sites (such as mining exploration camps) and temporary installations (such as military operations).|$|R
40|$|The team {{designed}} a <b>collapsible</b> water <b>tank</b> {{to be used}} for emergency activities such as fire fighting. The goal was to design a light-weight circular frame which quickly and easily sets up and packs up to a managable size and wieght. The most important design requirements included: fast and easy set up, competitive weight, modular design, and circular in shape. The concept design was tested in a computer simulation to ensure that it would work. Data from the simulation was used to optimize part sizes and choose materials. A prototype was built and tested. The test results were used to produce the final design specifications for the <b>collapsible</b> storage <b>tank...</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{officer who}} was injured in the same {{incident}} and had been undergoing treatment at the hospital, Lieutenant Edward Okoyo attached to the 3rd Kenya Rifles. Also later died. He had only served for one-and-a-half years. He had been commissioned into the Kenya Defence Forces on 30 June 2010. Four AK-47 rifles, {{a large amount of}} ammunition, communication equipment and a <b>collapsible</b> water <b>tank</b> were recovered during the raid in which 11 al Shabaab fighters were reportedly killed.|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} apparatus adapted to feed liquids by gas pressure. One important use of my invention is {{in connection with}} rocket craft or other air-craft in which two liquids, such as gasoline and liquid oxygen, are to be fed at high pressure to a combustion chamber. It is the general object of my invention to provide improved liquid-feeding apparatus for such use and for other similar purposes, which is apparatus is extremely light in weight and which will supply two or more different liquids under pressure in a safe and reliable manner. I further provide improved means by which a substantially constant gas pressure may be maintained as the tanks are gradually emptied. More specifically, my invention relates to the provision of liquid feeding apparatus comprising a light but strong and rigid outer metal casing and a plurality of flexible and <b>collapsible</b> inner <b>tanks</b> which are enclosed by said outer casing and which are adapted to store and deliver different kinds of liquids, such as gasoline and liquid oxygen. I also provide means for ejecting the liquids from the inner tanks by gas pressure exerted {{on the outside of}} said tanks, which gas pressure may be much higher than could be previously used in direct contact with cold liquids. Another feature of the invention relates to means for precooling the oxygen tank and its connections before the tanks are filled. [URL]...|$|R
