40|$|The {{purpose of}} the future {{instrument}} is to promote legal certainty and economic efficiency {{with respect to the}} cross-border holding and disposition of securities held with an intermediary, by harmonising certain legal aspects in this regard. This has become a necessary venture due to the considerable change in market practices within the last 50 years, combined with an everincreasing volume of cross-border activities in the capital markets. It has been widely recognised in recent years that these developments in the practice of holding and disposition of securities have, in a number of respects, outrun the traditional legal framework. The basic rules on the legal nature, transfer and collateral provision of securities were formulated in the days when securities were transferred individually by physical delivery of <b>certificates</b> <b>representing</b> them. Under these rules, there was always a direct relationship between issuers and holders. In the case of registered securities, the investor’s name was always registered in the issuer’s books. In the case of bearer securities, the mere possession of a securities <b>certificate</b> <b>represented</b> or evidenced the direct property interest. The tokens were either physically held by the investors or under their names by an agent, for example a bank or a broker. Any type of transfer of the securities involved a direct or indirect possessory transfer and sometimes entailed the physical transfer of the tokens from one vault to another...|$|R

DTC's parent, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), is a non-profit cooperative owned by approximately thirty of the largest Wall Street players that typically act as brokers or dealers in securities. These thirty banks are called the DTC participants. DTC, through a legal nominee, owns each of the global securities {{on behalf of all}} the DTC participants.|$|R

50|$|In 1978 Bank of America {{issued the}} first {{residential}} mortgage-backed security that securitized residential mortgages not guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise (“private label RMBS”). Also in 1978, the OCC approved a national bank, such as Bank of America, issuing pass-through <b>certificates</b> <b>representing</b> interests in residential mortgages and distributing such mortgage-backed securities to investors {{in a private}} placement. In 1987 the OCC ruled that Security Pacific Bank could “sell” assets through “securitizations” that transferred “cash flows” from those assets to investors and also distribute in a registered public offering the residential mortgage-backed securities issued in the securitization. This permitted commercial banks to acquire assets for “sale” through securitizations under what later became termed the “originate to distribute” model of banking.|$|R

30|$|Both upper {{segments}} include occupations {{almost exclusively}} reserved {{for young people}} with permission to enter higher education or an intermediate school-leaving certificate. This covers two-fifths of all new apprenticeship contracts in the dual system. With 62 [*]% of young adults holding a higher education access qualification, the upper segment 2 can nearly {{be referred to as}} the Abitur segment. Young people with secondary school leaving certificate (Hauptschule) have almost no chance to enter this segment, representing only 3 [*]% of the new apprenticeship contracts. The second segment 3, classified as “upper middle segment” shows a comparably high rate of school-leavers with an intermediate school-leaving certificate and in addition more than one quarter with Abitur. Also in this segment, only about one-seventh of young people with a secondary school-leaving <b>certificate</b> (Hauptschule) are <b>represented.</b> Even in the third segment 4, the “lower middle segment”, the intermediate school-leaving certificate is dominant, whereas young adults with a secondary school-leaving <b>certificate</b> (Hauptschule) are <b>represented</b> only by one third. Only in the lower segment 5 do young people with a secondary school leaving <b>certificate</b> <b>represent</b> the largest group (two-thirds).

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent surge in work in {{probabilistic}} databases, propelled {{in large part by}} the huge increase in noisy data sources — sensor data, experimental data, data from uncurated sources, and many others. There is a growing {{need to be able to}} flexibly represent the uncertainties in the data, and to efficiently query the data. Building on existing probabilistic database work, we present a unifying framework which allows a flexible representation of correlated tuple and attribute level uncertainties. An important capability of our representation is the ability to <b>represent</b> <b>shared</b> correlation structures in the data. We provide motivating examples to illustrate when such shared correlation structures are likely to exist. <b>Representing</b> <b>shared</b> correlations structures allows the use of sophisticated inference techniques based on lifted probabilistic inference that, in turn, allows us to achieve significant speedups while computing probabilities for results of user-submitted queries. ...|$|R

Graduate <b>certificates</b> <b>represent</b> completion of studies beyond the bachelor's degree, yet short of a masters degree.

Team cognition is comprised of several factors including shared understanding as measured by shared mental models (SMM). To <b>represent</b> team <b>shared</b> mental models more accurately we present a data analysis methodology that utilized individually constructed concept maps as the primary data source. This data is translated into an aggregate map (analysis constructed shared mental model—AC-SMM) that represents team understanding. AC-SMM maps can be compared {{over a period of}} time in order to understand the development of team cognition. ...|$|R
