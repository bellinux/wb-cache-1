5|$|With a $45 million {{production}} budget, filming {{began on}} 12 November 2010 in <b>Cape</b> <b>Town</b> and took approximately 13 weeks, with second unit photography occurring over seven weeks.

The project involved a majority of <b>Cape</b> <b>Town</b> crew members and about 40 imported crew. The producers chose to film in South Africa because of the lowered cost of employing cast and crew compared to locations in Europe and North America, and government incentives that offered to rebate up to 25% of the production costs. The film was shot digitally and primarily in 3D using RED MX, SI2K and Phantom Flex high-speed cameras. Multiple camera rigs were used. Some 2D elements were converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E
