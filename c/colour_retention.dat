40|$|For {{determination}} of poultry quality shortly after slaughtering, physical criteria (pH-value, conductivity, <b>colour,</b> juice <b>retention)</b> are of importance. However, they {{are affected by}} breeding, transport, cooling and the storage period. PH-values of breast meat (genetically structured material) were recorded shortly after slaughtering (15 min p. m.) and differences between breeding line and gender were found (n= 5109). The pH 1 -values ranged from 5. 50 to 6. 79. Male broilers showed significantly lower pH 1 -values than female ones (6. 02 : 6. 10). There were also significant differences concerning breeding line and gender. Meat quality (PSE, DFD) of broilers can be recorded quickly and accurately determining the pH 1 -value of breast meat.

Experiment was carried out in different combinations including and excluding mordants by adopting different mordanting methods. Dyeing performance was assessed in terms of dye absorption (%), Colour values (CIELAB), Colour strength (K/S), and fastness properties. The dye in combination with mordants showed significant importance and resulted in different shades on wool, silk and pashmina fabrics. However, the cotton fabric did not show much affinity for the dye and mordant and showed less affinity for the dye and mordants with lower values of <b>colour</b> quality and <b>retention</b> grades.

50|$|These {{lacquers}} {{are also}} used on wooden products, furniture primarily, and on musical instruments and other objects. Nitrocellulose lacquers {{are also used}} to make firework fuses waterproof. The nitrocellulose and other resins and plasticizers are dissolved in the solvent, and each coat of lacquer dissolves some of the previous coat. These lacquers were a huge improvement over earlier automobile and furniture finishes, both in ease of application and in <b>colour</b> <b>retention.</b> The preferred method of applying quick-drying lacquers is by spraying, {{and the development of}} nitrocellulose lacquers led to the first extensive use of spray guns. Nitrocellulose lacquers produce a hard yet flexible, durable finish that can be polished to a high sheen. Drawbacks of these lacquers include the hazardous nature of the solvent, which is flammable and toxic, and the hazards of nitrocellulose in the manufacturing process. Lacquer grade of soluble nitrocellulose is closely related to the more highly nitrated form which is used to make explosives. They become relatively non-toxic after approximately a month since at this point, the lacquer has evaporated most of the solvents used in its production.|$|E

A distinct drawback in the transition zone is winter dormancy, a temporary suspension of visible growth, followed by discoloration and loss of functionality. In order to investigate the genotype/species effect in relation with agro-meteorological conditions, 10 cultivars/experimental lines were screened {{for their ability to}} extend the winter <b>colour</b> <b>retention.</b> A two years field study was conducted on mature swards and evaluated during the onset of dormancy and spring green-up using digital image analysis.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} how visual information is organised in perceptual short term memory, with special interest in colour, spatial frequency and velocity. Previous studies of VSTM have indicated the existence of specific memory mechanisms for visual attributes such as orientation, spatial frequency, velocity, contrast and <b>colour.</b> The <b>retention</b> of information in visual short term memory for these basic visual attributes can be disrupted by the presentation of masking stimuli during inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs), which are outside the range of traditional sensory masking. We exploited this memory masking effect {{in order to examine}} the organisation of visual information in VSTM. Four groups of experiments were conducted in which participants carried out a delayed discrimination paradigm that employed a two-alternative forced choice (2 -AFC) procedure in conjunction with a method of constant stimuli. The fidelity of VSTM was measured by performance markers such as discrimination thresholds and point of subjective equalities. We have found selective memory masking effects, which serve as further evidence in favour of the modular organisation in VSTM, namely, that human visual perceptual memory is based upon multiple, tuned channels in case of colour, spatial frequency and speed, similar to those found in the earliest stages of visual processing for spatial frequency. Moreover, each of these storage mechanisms are tuned to a relatively narrow range of stimulus parameters that are closely linked to visual discrimination mechanisms. These findings add further support to the view that low-level sensory processing mechanisms form the basis for the <b>retention</b> of <b>colour,</b> spatial frequency and velocity information in perceptual memory. We also found evidence for the broad range of transfer of memory masking effects across spatial location, which indicates more long range, long duration interactions between channels that are likely to rely upon contributions from neural processes located in higher visual areas. In conclusion, the experiments presented in this thesis provide significant insight into the organization of visual information in perceptual short term memory.

40|$|The colour-fading of hair {{treated with}} {{oxidative}} dyes {{is attributed to}} the effects of ultraviolet light and other environmental factors, but mostly it occurs during shampooing. This effect is caused by the diffusion of chromaphores from within the cortex towards the cuticle surface. The colour fading of dyed hair during shampoo washing is determined by a range of factors, most significantly by the chemistry of the chromaphores, the porosity of the hair fibres, and the properties of the used surfactants. Optimising the cleansing efficacy of shampoos in relation to colour protection claims is of interest to formulators. This study investigates the effects of two co-surfactants and a range of conditioning additives, polycationic and silicone-based, on the colour fading of hair tresses treated with red oxidative hair dye and put through repeated wash-and-dry cycles.

Removal of tooth structure was as dictated by caries and access. All non-caries fissures were sealed with either a compomer pit and fissure sealant (K- 0093 ?) for compomer restorations or an opaque resin sealant (Delton DDS?). All enamel and dentin were treated with conditioner prior to application of 1 layer of self-priming adhesive. A total of 42 compomer restorations (12 with fissure sealants and 18 complex) and 35 composite resin restorations (13 with fissure sealants and 15 complex) were evaluated at baseline, 6 months and 1 year using the USPHS criteria for <b>retention,</b> <b>colour</b> match,marginal discolouration and integrity, secondary caries, anatomical form, occlusal and proximal contacts, surface texture and hypersensitivity. Two evaluators compared the epoxy resin casts of the restorations with models of the Leinfelder clinical wear standards.

40|$|Dynamic {{control system}} (DCS) is an interactive, {{patented}} storage concept, {{which can be}} regarded as the successor of traditional controlled atmosphere (CA) storage for some commodities. Instead of using static, fixed set-points for gas conditions like in CA, the oxygen concentration in the DCS storage facility is controlled upon product response. When applying DCS, the oxygen concentration is slowly lowered until the product emits a stress-signal. More specific, DCS uses ethanol, the final product of fermentation, to establish the lowest possible oxygen concentration under which a product can be stored. DCS was applied for the storage of apples (cv `Elstar¿). Experiments with this cultivar, as presented here, show that apples are firmer after DCS storage, especially after shelf life, and have a better <b>colour</b> <b>retention</b> compared with traditional CA. Furthermore, apples tend to develop less skin spots under DCS, a major storage disorder of `Elstar¿...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCurcumin was {{complexed}} with β-CD using co-precipitation, freeze-drying and {{solvent evaporation}} methods. Co-precipitation enabled complex formation, {{as indicated by}} the FT-IR and FT-Raman techniques via the shifts in the peaks that were assigned to the aromatic rings of curcumin. In addition, photoacoustic spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, with the disappearance of the band related to aromatic rings, by Gaussian fitting, and modifications in the spectral lines, respectively, also suggested complex formation. The possible complexation had an efficiency of 74 % and increased the solubility of the pure colourant 31 -fold. Curcumin–β-CD complex exhibited a sunlight stability 18 % higher than the pure colourant. This material was stable to pH variations and storage at − 15 and 4 °C. With an isothermal heating at 100 and 150 °C for 2 h, the material exhibited a <b>colour</b> <b>retention</b> of approximately 99 %. The application of curcumin–β-CD complex in vanilla ice creams intensified the colour of the products and produced a great sensorial acceptance...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of new products and their introduction in the market need rapid and reliable accelerated durability tests {{have the capacity to}} predict the service lifetimes of the materials. In this paper we report time-consuming standardised procedures in order to study the durability and the stability of typical polyester powder coatings, used as surface and structure white decorative finish in external architecture. SUNTEST, UVA and UVB accelerated aging tests were done in order to compare the resistance to weathering degradation of different kinds of coatings, four of standard durable and seven of superdurable type. The stability of the single formulation was determined through the evaluation of some chemicals and physical changes on aged samples respect the unaffected one. ATR measurements showed as the degradation differ mainly on the specific type of reactive binder system meanwhile the DSC measurements showed if the accelerate aging processes involved hydrolysis or an increase of the degree of polymerization. A good resistance, in term of gloss and <b>colour</b> <b>retention,</b> were also determined...|$|E
40|$|Silk {{and wool}} fabrics were {{coloured}} employing aqueous tea extract in absence and presence of magnesium sulphate, aluminium sulphate and ferrous sulphate as the mordanting agents. Colour uptake for wool {{was found to}} be more than that for silk under all conditions studied. Colouring biochemical components of tea revealed highest affinity for both the protein fibres at pH 2 to 4 in presence and absence of such mordanting agents. Use of ferrous sulphate and aluminium sulphate produced significant improvement in colour uptake following a pre- or post mordanting methods. Coloured protein fibres in general produced a light-fastness rating of 5 on a scale of 1 - 5 and a wash-fastness rating of 4 on a scale of 1 - 5. Ferrous sulphate and aluminium sulphate improved <b>colour</b> <b>retention</b> on washing and the fastness properties further. Coloured protein fibres became blackish, when ferrous sulphate was employed as mordanting agent. This item was scanned with a HP 4850 Scanjet at 300 dpi and consists of 9 pages...|$|E
