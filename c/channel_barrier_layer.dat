Detailed 2 D simulations show that threshold voltages in excess of 3 V can be achieved {{through the use of}} AlGaN channel layers. We also calculate the two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) mobility in AlGaN channel HEMTs and evaluate their power figures of merit as a function of device operating temperature and Al mole fraction in the channel. Our models show that power switching transistors with AlGaN channels would have comparable on-resistance to GaN-channel based transistors for the same operation voltage.

The effects of InGaN channel growth temperature on the structural and transport properties of the heterostructures are investigated in detail. High resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD) and Photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicate {{that the quality of}} InGaN channel strongly depends on the growth temperature. Meanwhile, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) results show that the interface morphology between the InGaN <b>channel</b> and the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> also relies on the growth temperature. Since the variation of material properties of InGaN channel has a significant influence on the electrical properties of InAlN/InGaN heterostructures, the optimal transport properties can be achieved by adjusting the growth temperature. A very high two dimension electron gas (2 DEG) density of 1. 92 × 1013 cm− 2 and Hall electron mobility of 1025 cm 2 /(V⋅s) at room temperature are obtained at the optimal growth temperature around 740 °C.

40|$|Abstract. The {{concept of}} the {{diffusion}} barrier coating system (DBC system) is summarized and the latest results are presented. The DBC system is comprised of alloy substrate/diffusion barrier/Al-reservoir/an external scale. Diffusion flux (JAl) of Al through the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> will be given approximately by JAl = DAl x SAl x (CAl/x), where DAl and SAl are the diffusion coefficient and solubility limit of Al in the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> respectively as well as CAl / x is driving force given by the concentration difference across the barrier (CAl) divided by {{the thickness of the}} <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> (x). A slow diffusion flux can be obtained by using low values of DAl, SAl, or (CAl / x). Accordingly, a selection of a <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> with lower DAl and SAl is essential. A low driving force is also an important factor, and can be achieved by using lower CAl with a constant <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness x. At higher temperatures, however, the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> can react with the alloy substrate and Al-reservoir layer, resulting in gradual degradation of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> This means that the thickness x of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> tends to decrease and may finally disappear. With decreasing thickness of the diffusion <b>barrier</b> <b>layer,</b> the driving force (CAl/x) will increase, and the effectiveness of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> will be eliminated.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig. 1 that there is a length {{distribution}} for the nanotubes and nanowires in each sample.

40|$|Nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> are commonly-used in {{metallisation}} of silicon-based microelectronic and {{photovoltaic devices}} to prevent copper diffusion from metal contacts {{to the underlying}} silicon. This thesis compares the effectiveness of nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers,</b> formed using: (i) electroless plating; and (ii) light-induced plating (LIP), in preventing copper diffusion into mono-crystalline silicon laser-doped selective emitter (LDSE) solar cells. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was {{used in conjunction with}} transmission electron microscopy for chemical identification of copper-rich regions in silicon under the nickel/copper metal contacts of heat-treated cells. It was observed that copper can penetrate through both electroless-plated and LIP Ni <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> in LDSE cells that have been heated for 5 hours at 200 °C or 400 °C, followed by quenching in ethylene glycol (fast cooling). Current-voltage measurements were used to characterise the electrical performance of LDSE cells with different nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers.</b> Significant degradations in cell efficiency, fill factor and open-circuit voltage were observed for LDSE cells with electroless-plated nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> after heating at 200 °C and subsequent quenching in ethylene glycol. In the worst case, the fill factor was reduced from 66 % to 31 %, causing severe efficiency degradation. However, the fill factor of cells with LIP nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> were only reduced from 66 % to 58 % under the same conditions. When cells were cooled slowly the electrical performance of the cells was only slightly affected and was independent of the type of nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layer.</b> Furthermore, LDSE cells with electroless-plated nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> that were originally heat-treated followed by fast cooling, were exposed to a second heat treatment at 250 °C for 2 hours, followed by slow cooling. This resulted in a significant improvement in the lifetime. These results suggest that copper may diffuse through both electroless plated and LIP nickel <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> at temperatures as low as 200 °C. However, on slow cooling (which is likely in the field), the copper can out-diffuse to regions of the cell where the cell&# 146;s electrical performance is not degraded.

An evaluation of the vertical salinity gradient tendency showed that the dramatic thickening of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> was due to the vertical oceanic mixing by the atmospheric MJO forcing and the vertical stretching by the oceanic downwelling coastal Kelvin wave intruding from the open ocean. In addition, an evaluation of the vertical temperature gradient tendency showed that the temperature inversion in the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> formed by losing heat to the atmosphere due to the MJO forcing and downward advection of the temperature gradient due to the downwelling Kelvin wave resulting in the dramatic isothermal layer deepening.

40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{investigating}} experimentally fretting corrosion, that is, corrosion {{induced by}} friction of AISI 316 L SS against poly(methyl methacrylate) under small displacements. The observed wear on {{the stainless steel}} has been modeled using the Point Defect Model (PDM). The originality of this approach in applying the PDM to fretting corrosion consists of using a modified rate of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> dissolution, {{in the case of}} cyclical wear, such that the rate of destruction of the <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> at the <b>barrier</b> layer/solution interface exceeds the rate of <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> growth at the metal/barrier layer interface at zero <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> thickness, which is the condition specified by the PDM for depassivation. By optimization of the PDM on experimental electrochemical impedance data under fretting conditions, {{we have been able to}} ascertain values for various model parameters, and to calculate the steel volume loss as a function of potential...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of various}} types of Josephson junctions is investigated with cross-sectional (CS) high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM). Special specimen preparation techniques, to facilitate the CS investigation, {{are discussed in the}} first part. Examples are shown of specially produced arrays of junctions and of the focused ion beam thinning technique allowing us to investigate specific measured junctions. Ramp-type junctions with (PrBCGaO) <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> are discussed in more detail in the second part. The microstructure of PrBCGaO (0. 1 < x < 1. 0) thin films, <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> and bulk material is studied by HREM. Thin <b>barrier</b> <b>layers</b> with contain a Ga-rich intergrowth, never observed before in YBCO-type structures. Ga-rich inclusions in single thin films exhibit a similar structure. In addition, diffusion of Ga in the ion-etched substrate surface region was observed. The observed segregation of Ga from the PrBCGaO <b>barrier</b> <b>layer</b> explains the observed junction properties...|$|R
