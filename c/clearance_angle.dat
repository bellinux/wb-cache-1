2500|$|The first {{handheld}} power routers {{were invented}} in 1915 and were Jet Motor Hand Routers, called Onsruters. The name derives {{from a combination}} of the inventor's last name [...] "Onsrud" [...] and the term [...] "router". The Onsruter married a router plane with an endmill to create the first handheld power router. The idea for the Onsruter started when a rail road company decided they wanted to power the front light on a Steam Locomotive using exhaust steam from the engine. Oscar Onsrud and his son Rudy came up with, and submitted, a design for a jet motor (air turbine) to generate the power for the light, however, they failed to win the contract. A few months later Rudy was talking with a friend about his frustrations making the groove {{in the bottom of a}} cane bottom chair using a router plane. A spark went off in Rudy's head that he could re-purpose the jet motor, which he had spent so much time developing, to run on compressed air and spin a modified endmill and make the routed groove easily. The modified endmills would have to spin at 30,000 RPM, instead of the 3,000 RPM of a milling machine, in order to cut wood and not burn it. These bits also needed a steeper rake and <b>clearance</b> <b>angle</b> to evacuate the chips than needed on a traditional endmill. These new bits became known as router bits or router cutters (UK).|$|E
50|$|All {{the other}} angles are for {{clearance}} {{in order that}} {{no part of the}} tool besides the actual cutting edge can touch the work. The front <b>clearance</b> <b>angle</b> is usually 8 degrees while the side <b>clearance</b> <b>angle</b> is 10-15 degrees and partly depends on the rate of feed expected.|$|E

The cohorts in this study are a combination of modular Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) and Adept femoral heads on CPT stems. The study reviews the geometry of the taper interfaces to establish if the taper <b>clearance</b> <b>angles</b> was outside of the normal range for other taper interfaces. In addition the rates of material loss from the bearings and taper and a ranking of the stem damage were reviewed to determine if the levels of loss were above that seen for other similar joints. The material loss analysis demonstrated that the rates or levels of loss from the bearings, taper and stem were no different to levels published for manufacturer matched joints and in many cases were lower. The results demonstrate that the taper <b>clearance</b> <b>angles</b> for the mixed manufacturer joints (BHR-CPT: 0. 067 to - 0. 116, Adept-CPT: 0. 101 to - 0. 056) were within the range of other studies and manufacturer matched clearances (0. 134 to - 0. 149). Using components from different manufacturers has not in this instance increased the level of material loss from the joints, when compared to other similar manufacturer matched joints. <br/...|$|R
50|$|In April 1961 the Travelall {{underwent}} {{the same}} changes as the pickup range upon {{which it was}} based. The new C-series Travelall benefitted from a whole new chassis with all new independent front torsion bar suspension. Aside from the lower body, the most obvious visual difference were that the twin headlights were now mounted side-by-side, and a new grille of a concave egg-crate design. The wheelbase for the C-100/C-110 Travelall went up to 119 inches, as the front wheels were mounted further forward.

5000|$|Because of the {{limitations}} on tooling design imposed {{by the fact that}} the workpiece mostly surrounds the tool, boring is inherently somewhat more challenging than turning, in terms of decreased toolholding rigidity, increased <b>clearance</b> <b>angle</b> requirements (limiting the amount of support that can be given to the cutting edge), and difficulty of inspection of the resulting surface (size, form, surface roughness). These are the reasons why boring is viewed as an area of machining practice in its own right, separate from turning, with its own tips, tricks, challenges, and body of expertise, despite the fact that they are in some ways identical.|$|E
5000|$|A precise {{profile of}} the tooth (including gullet area, hook angle and top <b>clearance</b> <b>angle)</b> must be {{maintained}} for proper saw operation and wood chip removal.

A saw filer will maintain the gullet shape by manually shaping the grinding wheel with a dressing stone, and the set up of his grinding machine. Variations include face angle, face length, back angle, gullet width and depth, and a frost notch (if necessary). Typical bandsaw tooth dimensions are 1-3/4" [...] tooth space x 3/4" [...] gullet depth x 3/4" [...] gullet width (grinding wheel width) x 30deg face angle x 16deg back angle.|$|E

5000|$|A {{substantial}} {{technological advance}} {{occurred in the}} 1890-1910 period, when Frederick Winslow Taylor applied scientific methods {{to the study of}} tool bits and their cutting performance (including their geometry, metallurgy, and heat treatment, and the resulting speeds and feeds, depths of cut, metal-removal rates, and tool life). Along with Maunsel White and various assistants, he developed high speed steels (whose properties come from both their alloying element mixtures and their heat treatment methods). His cutting experiments chewed through tons of workpiece material, consumed thousands of tool bits, and generated mountains of chips. They were sponsored in large part by William Sellers (a principal of Midvale Steel and Cramp's shipyard) and later by Bethlehem Steel. Not only did Taylor develop new materials to make single-point cutters from, but he also determined optimum geometry (rake <b>angles,</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>angles,</b> nose radiuses, etc.). He developed Taylor's Equation for Tool Life Expectancy. After Taylor, it was no longer taken for granted that the black art of individual craftsmen represented the highest level of metalworking technology.

50|$|The {{second type}} of cold saw blade, {{tungsten}} carbide-tipped (TCT), are made with an alloy steel body and tungsten carbide inserts brazed to {{the tips of the}} teeth. These tips are ground on all surfaces to create tangential and radial clearance and provide the proper cutting and <b>clearance</b> <b>angles</b> on the teeth. The alloy body is generally made from a wear-resistant material such as a chrome vanadium steel, heat treated to 38/42 HRC. The tungsten carbide tips are capable of operating at much higher temperatures than solid HSS, therefore, TCT saw blades are usually run at much higher surface speeds. This allows carbide-tipped blades to cut at faster rates and still maintain an acceptable chip load per tooth. These blades are commonly used for cutting non-ferrous alloys, but have gained significant popularity for ferrous metal cutting applications in the last 10 years. The tungsten carbide inserts are extremely hard (98 HRC) and capable of very long wear life. However, they are less resistant to shock than solid HSS cold saw blades. Any vibration during the cutting process may severely damage the teeth. These cold saw blades need to be driven by a backlash free gear box and a constant feed mechanism like a ball-screw feed.|$|R

40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make thread milling cutters {{has shown that}} most of milling cutters are produced with the helical flutes with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °. Thus, thread milling cutters, made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of thread milling cutter shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and <b>clearance</b> <b>angles,</b> and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of thread milling cutter, made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to measure the cutting force and the {{resultant}} machined surface quality for tension wood and normal wood of Rubberwood using a single saw tooth experimental set-up. Three different saw tooth geometries {{were used in the}} experiment, to establish the optimum saw tooth design for the sawing of tension wood. The results showed that the specific principal cutting force was lower for tension wood compared to normal wood, due to the less lignified cell walls of the tension wood. It appears that the lignin component in the cell wall provides the stiffness to the cell wall, which was lacking in the cell walls of tension wood, hence reducing the cutting forces significantly. Nevertheless, the overall power consumption during the machining of tension wood was markedly higher due to the presence of fuzzy grains on the machined surface of tension wood, which increased the frictional force acting on the cutting edges during the machining process. Further, it was found that saw tooth design No. 2 produced the optimal result, both from the economic and quality perspectives for the sawing of tension wood. Therefore, in order to optimize the sawing of tension wood, saw tooth with the highest rake and <b>clearance</b> <b>angles</b> is recommended as it required the least cutting force, while producing the best surface quality.

Thus, chatter is one important restriction for the quality and efficiency of titanium alloy manufacture, especially for the thin-walled workpiece made of titanium alloy due to poor structural stiffness.

40|$|In {{developing}} a high performance titanium milling process current industry practice uses experimental approach. However, trial-and-error tests are time-consuming {{and have become}} increasingly costly due to rising material costs. In this study, several models addressing the important parameters in the titanium milling processes are developed {{for the evaluation of}} tool performance. First, a cutting force model has been developed. The model considers varying rake and <b>clearance</b> <b>angles</b> along the flutes and uses a universal uncut chip thickness calculation for arbitrary cutter geometry. Moreover, the force of worn milling tool is also modeled in the study. The forces of sharp and worn tools are both validated by experiments. The second topic includes a temperature model and a temperature measurement technique for milling process. The model considers the varying heat flux and heat input area. The coolant and flank wear effects are also included in the model. Finally, a tool-foil thermocouple technique has been designed to measure temperature in milling process and the measurement results are used for model validation. An integrated model for estimating tool wear progression is proposed based on existing models. The model uses iterations between tool wear and force, so that the increase in wear with cutting time is able to be estimated from the CAD model of the tool. Tool wear is measured in the experiments to validate the wear progression in the model. Moreover, by setting a criterion of flank wear, the tool life can be predicted. Tool lives under several cutting conditions are calculated and compared with experimental results. Finally, an analytical model for calculating the stress in the tool is developed.
