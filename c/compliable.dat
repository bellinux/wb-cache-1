He had got rid, some time before this period, by death, of General Clavering, by death, of Colonel Monson, and by vexation and persecution, and his consequent dereliction of authority, he had shaken off Mr. Francis. The whole Council consisting only of himself and Mr. Wheler, he, having the casting vote, was in effect the whole Council; and {{if ever there was}} a time when principle, decency, and decorum rendered it improper for him to do any extraordinary acts without the sanction of the Court of Directors, that was the time. Mr. Wheler was taken off,--despair perhaps rendering the man, who had been in opposition futilely before, <b>compliable.</b> The man is dead. He certainly did not oppose him; if he had, it would have been in vain. But those very circumstances which rendered it atrocious in Mr. Hastings to make any change induced him to make this. He thought that a moment's time was not to be lost,--that other colleagues might come, where he might be overpowered by a majority again, and not able to pursue his corrupt plans. Therefore he was resolved,--your Lordships will remark the whole of this most daring and systematic plan of bribery and peculation,--he resolved to put it out of the power of his Council in future to check or control him in any of his evil practices.|$|E

During software evolution, source code editing and testing are interleaved activities to assure code quality. When regression tests fail unexpectedly after a long session of editing, {{it may be difficult}} for programmers to find out the failure causes. Moreover, due to the extensive use of subtyping and dynamic dispatch in object-oriented programming language and the inherent semantic intricacies in aspectoriented features, the nontrivial combination of those likely nonlocal changes would also affect other parts of program accidentally and that may indicate potential faults in the updated version. In this paper, we propose a new fault locating technique for AspectJ programs. At the core of our approach is the source level atomic change representation, which captures precisely the semantic differences between two program versions. If a test fails unexpectedly, a subset of affecting changes is identified and programmers are allowed to select (and apply) suspected atomic changes to the original program, constructing <b>compliable</b> intermediate versions. Then programmers can re-execute the failed test against these intermediate program versions to locate the exact failureinducing reasons by iteratively select, apply and narrow down the set of affecting changes.

40|$|Two {{different}} {{measurement techniques}} {{were applied to}} study the attachment of the smooth foot pads of the Madagascar hissing cockroach Gromphadorhina portentosa. The attachment of the non-manipulated adhesive organs was {{compared with that of}} manipulated ones (depletion or substitution by artificial secretions). From measurements of the friction on a centrifuge, it can be concluded that on nanorough surfaces, the insect appears to benefit from employing emulsions instead of pure oils to avoid excessive friction. Measurements performed with a nanotribometer on single attachment organs showed that, in the non-manipulated euplantulae, friction was clearly increased in the push direction, whereas the arolium of the fore tarsus showed higher friction in the pull direction. The surface of the euplantulae shows an imbricate appearance, whereupon the ledges face distally, which might contribute to the observed frictional anisotropy in the push direction. Upon depletion of the tarsal adhesion-mediating secretion or its replacement by oily fluids, in several cases, the anisotropic effect of the euplantula disappeared due to the decrease of friction forces in push-direction. In the euplantulae, adhesion was one to two orders of magnitude lower than friction. Whereas the tenacity was slightly decreased with depleted secretion, it was considerably increased after artificial application of oily liquids. In terms of adhesion, it is concluded that the semi-solid consistence of the natural adhesion-mediating secretion facilitates the detachment of the tarsus during locomotion. In terms of friction, on smooth to nanorough surfaces, the insects appear to benefit from employing emulsions instead of pure oils to avoid excessive friction forces, whereas on rougher surfaces the tarsal fluid rather functions in improving surface contact by keeping the cuticle <b>compliable</b> and compensating surface asperities of the substratum...|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-linked}} polymer ``gel'' electrolyte {{obtained from}} free radical polymerization of a vinyl monomer (acrylonitrile; AN) {{in a room}} temperature ionic liquid electrolyte (N,N-methyl butyl pyrrolidinium-bis (trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide-lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide;LiTFSI-[Py(1, 4) -TFSI]) for application in high rate capability rechargeable lithium-ion batteries is discussed here. This is a novel alternative compared to the often employed approach of using a molecular liquid as the medium for performing the polymerization reaction. The polymer ``gel'' electrolytes (AN:Py(1, 4) -TFSI = 0. 16 - 0. 18, w/w) showed remarkable <b>compliable</b> mechanical strength and higher thermal stability compared to LiTFSI-[Py(1, 4) -TFSI]. Despite two orders increase in magnitude of viscosity of polymer ``gels'', the room temperature ionic conductivity of the ``gels'' (1. 1 x 10 (- 3) - 1. 7 x 10 (- 3) Omega(- 1) cm(- 1)) were nearly identical {{to that of the}} ionic liquid (1. 8 x 10 (- 3) Omega(- 1) cm(- 1)). The present ``gel'' electrolytes did not exhibit any ageing effects on ionic conductivity similar to the conventional polymer gel electrolytes (e. g. high molecular weight polymer + salt + high dielectric constant molecular solvent). The disorder (ionic liquid) to a relative order (cross-linked polymer electrolyte) transformation does not at all influence the concentration of conducting species. The polymer framework is still able to provide efficient pathways for fast ion transport. Unlike the ionic liquid which is impossible to assemble without a conventional separator in a cell, the polymer ``gel'' electrolyte could be conveniently assembled without a separator in a Li vertical bar lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO(4)) cell. Compared to the ionic liquid, the ``gel'' electrolyte showed exceptional cyclability and rate capability (current density: 35 - 760 mA g(- 1) with LiFePO(4) electronically wired with carbon (amorphous or multiwalled nanotube [MWCNT]) ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years much {{interest}} has been shown in the computer language Prolog, a fifth generation language. Since its beginnings in the early 1970 's more and more implementations of the language have been written each with their own particular characteristics. One of the main drives has been in trying to achieve more efficient implementations in terms of speed and use of storage space. Many implementations have been interpreters and only a relatively few compilers, which generally tend to be faster than interpreters, have been written, especially for machines other than personal computers. Garbage collectors are present in most systems and for large programs can make real time processing difficult. Prolog itself is a markedly different language to conventional languages like Pascal, Algol, C etc. and linking with existing software written in these languages can also be difficult. ProtoCola is an attempt to surpass some of these difficulties in that it takes a Prolog program and translates it into an equivalent (i. e. when run produces the same results as the Prolog program) Pascal program. The advantages come from the facts that: it is <b>compliable</b> for fast code; no garbage collector is needed; links to existing software are easier to achieve. As an added advantage it is highly portable since it is written in Standard Pascal. The use of 'continuations' to mimic the control flow and search strategy of Prolog easily and successfully has been a key factor in producing such an implementation. The idea of their use in such a way comes from the existing Gener 8 system which produces a parser or generator of a language as defined by an input grammar specification. This thesis describes my work in improving the Gener 8 system and gives a full description of the ProtoCola system which I have designed and developed...|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{here the}} ion {{transport}} mechanism of a gel electrolyte comprising lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) solvated by two plastic crystalline solvents, one a solid (succinonitrile, abbreviated as SN) and another (a room temperature ionic liquid) (1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium bis-(trifluorotuethanesulfonyl) imide, (abbreviated as IL) confined inside a linear network of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The {{concentration of the}} IL component (x) determines the physical properties of the unconfined electrolyte (i. e., SN 1 -xILx-LiTFSI) and when confined inside the polymer network (GPE-x). The extent of disorder in the SN 1 -xILx-LiTFSI and the GPE-x electrolytes is enhanced compared to both the bare SN-LiTFSI and IL-LiTFSI electrolytes. The enhanced disordering in the plastic phase alters both the local ion environment and viscosity. These changes strongly influence the ion mobility and nature of predominant charge carriers and thus the ion conduction mechanism in SN 1 -xILx-LiTFSI and GPE-x. The proposed SN 1 -xILx-LiTFSI and the GPE-x electrolytes show predominantly anion conduction (t(TFSI) approximate to 0. 5); however, lithium transference number (t(Li) approximate to 0. 2) is nearly an order higher than the IL-LiTFSI (t(Li) approximate to 0. 02 - 0. 06). The ionic conductivity of SN 1 -xILx-LiTFSI is much higher (especially for x approximate to 0. 1) compared to both SN-LiTFSI and IL-LiTFSI. The ionic conductivity of the GPE-x, though lower than the unconfined SN 1 -xILx-LiTFSI electrolytes, is still very promising, displaying values of similar to 10 (- 3) Omega(-) 1 cm(- 1). The GPE-x displayed <b>compliable</b> mechanical properties, stable Li-electrode/electrolyte interface, low rate of At corrosion, and stable cyclability over several tens of charge-discharge cycles when assembled in a separator-free Li-graphite cell.

In efforts to provide patients with a more <b>compliable</b> treatment method, Oramed Pharmaceuticals tested the capacity of its oral insulin capsule (ORMD- 0801, 8 mg insulin) in addressing this resistant clinical state. Eight Type I diabetes patients with uncontrolled diabetes (HbA 1 c: 7. 5 - 10 %) were monitored throughout the 15 -day study period {{by means of a}} blind continuous glucose monitoring device. Baseline patient blood glucose behavior was monitored and recorded over a five-day pretreatment screening period. During the ensuing ten-day treatment phase, patients were asked to conduct themselves as usual and to self-administer an oral insulin capsule three times daily, just prior to meal intake. CGM data sufficient for pharmacodynamics analyses were obtained from 6 of the 8 subjects. Treatment with ORMD- 0801 was associated with a significant 24. 4 % reduction in the frequencies of glucose readings > 200 mg/dL (60. 1 ± 7. 9 % pretreatment vs. 45. 4 ± 4. 9 % during ORMD- 0801 treatment; p =  0. 023) and a significant mean 16. 6 % decrease in glucose area under the curve (AUC) (66055 ± 5547 mg/dL/ 24 hours vs. 55060 ± 3068 mg/dL/ 24 hours, p =  0. 023), with a greater decrease during the early evening hours.

40|$|AbstractPurposeA fixed-dose {{combination}} of a stain and an antihypertensive drug may be useful {{for the treatment of}} patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. It may also improve patient drug compliance to help control risk factors of cardiovascular disease. This study was designed to evaluate the blood pressure–lowering and cholesterol-lowering effect of a {{fixed-dose combination}} of irbesartan-atorvastatin compared with monotherapy by either agent over an 8 -week treatment period. MethodsPatients with comorbid hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were screened for this randomized, double-blind, Phase III study. Eligible study patients were randomly assigned to test groups receiving a combination of irbesartan 300 mg and atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg (IRB 300 + ATO 40 and IRB 300 + ATO 80). Comparator groups comprised monotherapy groups with irbesartan 300 mg (IRB 300) or atorvastatin 40 mg (ATO 40) or atorvastatin 80 mg (ATO 80), or placebo. Patients who were eligible at screening were subjected to a 4 - to 6 -week washout period before commencing 8 weeks of therapy per their assigned group. The primary efficacy end points were percent change in LDL-C and sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels from baseline to end of therapy. Tolerability profiles of combination therapy were compared with other groups. FindingsA total of 733 patients with comorbid hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were screened for this study; 230 eligible patients were randomized to treatment. The mean age of patients was 58. 9 (8. 5) years, and their mean body mass index was 25. 8 (3. 2) kg/m 2. More than two thirds (70. 9 %) of the study patients were male. Mean LDL-C and sitting DBP levels at baseline were 149. 54 (29. 19) mg/dL and 92. 32 (6. 03) mm Hg, respectively. Percent reductions in LDL-C after 8 weeks were 46. 74 % (2. 06 %) in the IRB 300 + ATO 40 group and 48. 98 % (2. 12 %) in the IRB 300 + ATO 80 group; these values were 47. 13 % (3. 21 %) and 48. 30 % (2. 98 %) in the ATO 40 and ATO 80 comparator groups. Similarly, a reduction in sitting DBP after 8 weeks was – 8. 50 (1. 06) mm Hg in the IRB 300 + ATO 40 group and 10. 66 (1. 08) mm Hg in the IRB 300 + ATO 80 group compared with 8. 40 (1. 65) mm Hg in the IRB 300 group. The incidence rate for treatment-emergent adverse events was 22. 27 % and was similar between the monotherapy and combination groups.

40|$|Compared {{to other}} disciplines, {{software}} engineering {{as of today}} is still dependent on craftsmanship of highly-skilled workers. However, with constantly increasing complexity and efforts, existing software engineering approaches appear more and more inefficient. A paradigm shift towards industrial production methods seems inevitable. Recent advances in academia and practice have lead to the availability of industrial key principles in software development as well. Specialization is represented in software product lines, standardization and systematic reuse are available with component-based development, and automation has become accessible through model-driven engineering. While each of the above is well researched in theory, only few cases of successful implementation in the industry are known. This becomes even more evident in specialized areas of software engineering such as systems integration. Today’s IT systems need to quickly adapt to new business requirements due to mergers and acquisitions and cooperations between enterprises. This certainly leads to integration efforts, i. e. joining different subsystems into a cohesive whole {{in order to provide}} new functionality. In such an environment. the application of industrial methods for software development seems even more important. Unfortunately, software development in this field is a highly complex and heterogeneous undertaking, as IT environments differ from customer to customer. In such settings, existing industrialization concepts would never break even due to one-time projects and thus insufficient economies of scale and scope. This present thesis, therefore, describes a novel approach for a more efficient implementation of prior key principles while considering the characteristics of software development for systems integration. After identifying the characteristics of the field and their affects on currently-known industrialization concepts, an organizational model for industrialized systems integration has thus been developed. It takes software product lines and adapts them in a way feasible for a systems integrator active in several business domains. The result is a three-tiered model consolidating recurring activities and reducing the efforts for individual product lines. For the implementation of component-based development, the present thesis assesses current component approaches and applies an integration metamodel to the most suitable one. This ensures a common understanding of systems integration across different product lines and thus alleviates component reuse, even across product line boundaries. The approach is furthermore aligned with the organizational model to depict in which way component-based development may be applied in industrialized systems integration. Automating software development in systems integration with model-driven engineering was found to be insufficient in its current state. The reason herefore lies in insufficient tool chains and a lack of modelling standards. As an alternative, an XML-based configuration of products within a software product line has been developed. It models a product line and its products {{with the help of a}} domain-specific language and utilizes stylesheet transformations to generate <b>compliable</b> artefacts. The approach has been tested for its feasibility within an exemplarily implementation following a real-world scenario. As not all aspects of industrialized systems integration could be simulated in a laboratory environment, the concept was furthermore validated during several expert interviews with industry representatives. Here, it was also possible to assess cultural and economic aspects. The thesis concludes with a detailed summary of the contributions to the field and suggests further areas of research in the context of industrialized systems integration...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{inquires}} {{into the}} different conceptions {{of justice that}} are prevalent within international criminal justice. How is justice spoken of and what means are available for its pursuance {{in the aftermath of}} mass atrocity and international crimes? In 2004, the International Criminal Court decided to open an investigation in Uganda concerning the brutal and drawn-out war between the government army and a rebel group knows as the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) in the northern parts of the country. When the Court unsealed its arrest warrants for the five top commanders of the LRA, the local reactions were disparate, some claiming that the ICC inflicts a top-down justice that is not <b>compliable</b> with local notions of justice. As peace talks in Juba, South Sudan, started producing encouraging results towards a cessation of hostilities, attitudes concerning the ICC’s intervention grew increasingly antagonistic as the arrest warrants became an impediment to further peace negotiations. The situation in Northern Uganda has thus come to epitomise the debate on peace vs. justice, non-prosecutorial vs. prosecutorial, restorative vs. retributive justice, and which therefore lay the background for the discussions on justice in this thesis. The thesis is concerned with discourse on multiple levels, as social and discursive practices. Representations of the discourse are identified along with carriers of the dominant representation: prosecutorial justice. These representatives make up four actors in the data material: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the UN Security Council and the International Criminal Court. Sampled documents from the actors on the situation in Uganda are analysed using a textural-oriented approach to discourse analysis, elucidating strategies in maintaining discursive dominance as well as attitudes to alternative perceptions of ‘justice’. Furthermore, the role of nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) upon the field of international criminal justice is elaborated. As intermediaries between the local and the global, the victims of the conflict and the corridors of The Hague, human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have become important constituents of the field. This role is placed under scrutiny and seen in light of the changing premises of political activism brought about by globalisation. Human rights organisations are typically perceived to be apolitical and purporting the rights of humanity, yet I call this perception into question and present alternative modes of interpretations. Their roles as intermediaries and carries of discourse are further explored through identifying particular discursive strategies, among others detectable in the unique style of the human rights report and the organisations’ claim to speak for the victims. I also present a theoretical discussion on transitional justice; that is, how to best deal with the aftermath of mass atrocity, international crimes and state-orchestrated violence. Criminal trials have come to constitute the centrepiece of social repair, yet this {{is by no means the}} only alternative. Non-punitive mechanisms as truth commissions and amnesties are elaborated by reference to experiences in South Africa and other countries having dealt with a troubled past. As international criminal justice is an enterprise, both institutionally and academically, which builds its mastery on the works of domestic institutions and their discourses on justice, punishment, and conflict resolution, western domestic theories of justice are discussed and accounted for. In the final chapter, I reach beyond international criminal justice in an effort to see its development in light of the social changes brought about by globalisation. Specific attention is given to the human rights movement where I question the validity of the concepts and values intrinsic to the movement. Lastly, I indicate some challenges and avenues for further criminological studies on international crimes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the work on}} a combined system consisting of a solar collector, a geothermal heat pump and borehole ground storage. To fully utilize solar energy this study {{is based on a}} heating system deigned to store the solar thermal energy in an underground storage, using U-tube heat exchangers. Renewable energy sources are habitually out of phase with the heating demand, which makes them challenging to fully exploit. Heat from the underground thermal energy storage will be discharged when the solar energy is not sufficient enough, as for the winter months. A simulation model, developed in TRNSYS, is used to simulate the performance of the proposed combined system. The heat load is a single residential building, and the simulation is performed for two different locations. Their difference in design and performance is then analyzed and discussed. The locations used for the system simulations are Trondheim in Norway and Siping in China. The complexity of a combines system is high due to several options when deciding on the system design. Solar collectors will lift the ground source temperature and in this way reducing the operation time of the heat pump. This will reduce the electricity use in combines systems. The purposes of this study have been to design a combined system for a single house at two different locations, Trondheim (63 °N, 10 °E) and Siping (43 °N, 124 °E). Studies on the performance of these two systems have then been performed. The focus has been on the thermal energy ground storage, consisting of several boreholes and its temperature behavior. The simulation software TRNSYS was used to analyze the interaction between the different components, the heat losses and gains, the electricity savings and the load requirement. The concept house has been designed in TRNBuild and Meteonorm provides the metrological data used for the different locations. A base case was used as stepping stone for the system optimization; the base case is bases on previous related work. The system is divided into four different modes simulated separately in TRNSYS. The four simulation modes were solar thermal ground storage, solar direct heating, direct heat exchange with the ground storage and geothermal heat pump. The duration of the modes was divided into the storage season and the heating season. With the intention to achieve a sufficiently high enough storage end temperature for direct heating of the building when needed, the system design parameters where chosen. The results of the simulation confirmed that the size and design of the ground storage is of great importance The resulting design for the system located in Trondheim consists of 11 boreholes spaced 1. 5 m apart. However for Siping the optimal design consists of 4 boreholes with a pacing of 2. 5 m. Both systems has ground storage volume of 623. 24 m 3 at 30 m depth, a solar collector of 200 m 2 and a water tank with a volume of 10 m 2. With these parameters the storage end temperature was above 40 oC for both and <b>compliable</b> for heating. The heating season was found to be from September to March for Trondheim and from October to May for Siping. Simulations of the solar direct heating mode show that this mode can cover 19. 2 % of the heating load for the system located in Trondheim and as much as 47. 5 % for the system in Siping. The direct heat exchange with the ground covers 27. 9 % of the heating load in Trondheim, only 11. 97 % of the heating load is covered by this mode for Siping. The geothermal heat pump covers the largest part of the heating load in Trondheim with 52. 9 %, while it covers 40. 53 % of the heating demand in Siping. The initial depth of 30 m resulted in freezing boreholes for both location and consequently the depth was changed to 150 m for Trondheim and 200 m for Siping. The COP was found to be 2. 78 and 2. 54 for Trondheim and Siping respectfully...|$|E
