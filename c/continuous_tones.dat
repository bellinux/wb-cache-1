50|$|When pixel art is {{displayed}} {{at a higher}} resolution than the source image, it is often scaled using the nearest-neighbor interpolation algorithm. This avoids blurring caused by other algorithms, such as bilinear and bicubic interpolation—which interpolate between adjacent pixels and work best on <b>continuous</b> <b>tones,</b> but not sharp edges or lines. Nearest-neighbor interpolation preserves these sharp edges, but it makes diagonal lines and curves look blocky, an effect called pixelation. Thus, hybrid algorithms have been devised to interpolate between <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> while preserving the sharpness of lines in the piece; such attempts include the 2xSaI, Super Eagle, and the high-quality hqx algorithms.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, the {{advantage}} of dye-sublimation printing has been {{the fact that it}} is a continuous-tone technology, where each dot can be any color. In contrast, inkjet printers can vary the location and size of ink droplets, a process called dithering, but each drop of ink is limited to the colors of the inks installed. Consequently, a dye-sublimation printer produces true <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> appearing much like a chemical photograph. An inkjet print is composed of droplets of ink layered and scattered to simulate <b>continuous</b> <b>tones,</b> but under magnification the individual droplets can be seen. In the early days of inkjet printing, the large droplets and low resolution made inkjet prints significantly inferior to dye-sublimation, but some of today's inkjets produce extremely high quality prints using microscopic droplets and supplementary ink colors, producing superior color fidelity to dye-sublimation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>tone</b> printing, either {{collotype}} or screenless lithography, are {{processes that}} are in limited use. The halftone method of reproduction {{is still the most}} economical way to reproduce a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> original. This study dealt with the mechanism of screenless lithography, more specifically on how to make the use of negative working plates a feasible alternative to positive working plates. It is known that the positive working plate can print a longer range of tones than a negative working plate. So the main point of the experiment dealt with how to extend the range of a negative working plate. A negative plate is of high contrast, and so multiple negative working plates were used to print one image. Each plate in itself can print three to four steps of a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> step wedge. In this experiment, three plates were used in the hopes of printing twelve steps in a continuous gradation. A <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> step wedge along with a black and white photograph were divided among the three plates. Twelve steps on the step wedge were identified, and so each film had four of the possible thirty steps which existed on the step wedge. These films were exposed to plates, and mounted on the press. Each image was run in registration with one another, and the solid ink density was varied to produce the <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> effect. From the press sheets examined, in which there are examples in this report, a high contrast image was produced. One of the main problems in the experiment was differences in emulsion coating on each individual plate. Which resulted in inconsistent exposure times from one plate to another. From repeated plate testing using a. 15 density increment <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> step wedge as a control guide, it was found that for the same exposure a hardening of the plate coating (and consequently of ink receptivity) corresponding to two steps equaling. 30 density difference was to be expected. This made it virtually impossible {{to get a handle on}} the correct exposure time needed for the plate. Results from this experiment show, that it is not possible to effectively print a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> image with a negative working plate and or multiple negative plates. This is due to the high contrast of the negative working plate, thus making it suitable for mainly halftone lithographic purposes...|$|R
50|$|Where {{continuous}} tone imagery contains an infinite {{range of colors}} or greys, the halftone process reduces visual reproductions to an image that is printed with only one color of ink, in dots of differing size (amplitude modulation) or spacing (frequency modulation). This reproduction relies on a basic optical illusion: the tiny halftone dots are blended into smooth tones by the human eye. At a microscopic level, developed black-and-white photographic film also consists of only two colors, and not an infinite range of <b>continuous</b> <b>tones.</b> For details, see film grain.|$|E
50|$|Whiteprint {{describes}} a document reproduction produced {{by using the}} diazo chemical process. It {{is also known as}} the blue-line process since the result is blue lines on a white background. It is a contact printing process which accurately reproduces the original in size, but cannot reproduce <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> or colors. The light-sensitivity of the chemicals used was known in the 1890s and several related printing processes were patented at that time. Whiteprinting replaced the blueprint process for reproducing architectural and engineering drawings because the process was simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals. A blue-line print is not permanent and will fade if exposed to light for weeks or months, but a drawing print that lasts only a few months is sufficient for many purposes.|$|E

40|$|Vector {{representation}} of graphics has an {{advantage of being}} displayed at any size. When resolution of a bitmap image is changed, lack of a line segment arises.

Resolution conversion of binary image can easily be performed without moire by <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> approximation of halftone dots. First, we separate the area of halftone dots and line drawings in the image. Next, a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> approximation {{is applied to the}} area of halftone dots.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{contemporary}} method of <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> colour printing {{based upon the}} Nineteenth Century printing process of Woodburytype as developed by Walter Bentley Woodbury in 1865. Woodburytype was the only truly <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> printing process yet invented, and died out {{in the late nineteenth}} century as more expedient and cost effective methods of printing prevailed, thus laying the path for current CMYK print technologies. Digital print itself, since its development as a range of colour printing technologies, has followed a route based on the half-tone dot and four colour separation predicated around CMYK. In recent years stochastic algorithms and dithering have allowed the lay down of multiple passes and colour sets to create a near <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> image. The downside of this approach is that in order to create a full colour subtractive image, the resultant prints have very little surface topography and a mechanical uniformity that demonstrates none of the surface characteristics, tactile qualities and rich tonal warmth of the 19 th century photo-mechanical processes. Current research at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) at the University of the West of England, Bristol, is exploring the potential of CNC milled imagery, where the tonal range of each colour is assigned a physical height to produce a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> topographic relief printing matrix, from which the colour image is cast in a silicone ink. A translucent image is cast from each of the colour matrices and each colour is assembled one on top of another resulting in a true four colour separation <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> print, where colour tone is created by physical depth of colour...|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{xerography}} and {{inkjet printing}} employ a halftone process and ink to reproduce digital images on paper, digital-C is a photographic continuous tone process rather than halftone or error diffusion which are common on offset press or ink-jet. The device natively supports 24-bit RGB raster files, and is capable printing vector based files when fronted by a photographic Raster Image Processor (RIP). 24 bit color continuous-tone devices use large multitudes of colors, up to 16,777,216, {{rather than the}} small number of colors available to 4-color press and 8-color ink-jet type devices. Therefore, posterization and banding are unlikely from these types of prints when provided with a file of good integrity. Due to slight halation of the light source, digital C-prints produced on high end equipment have true <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> not possible with images created with ink or pigments (due to CMYK halftone limitations).|$|E
5000|$|The term Übertragung {{was usually}} {{reserved}} for the transcription of music written for instruments which produce <b>continuous</b> <b>tones,</b> for example, the organ or violin. Pieces written for these instruments can require more alterations to preserve the original intent or spirit (Geist) of the music. The piano, {{when compared to the}} harpsichord, clavichord, or lute, presented technical changes (e.g., multiple steel strings for a given pitch, greater tension on the strings, larger sound board, more effective transfer of energy to the sound board) which allowed tones to be played more loudly and be sustained for a longer time. The damper pedal, which enables other strings in the instrument to vibrate in sympathy with the played string, provided the possibility of further augmentation and enrichment of the sound. Thus the piano represented an instrument on which it was possible to play transcriptions of such Tonstücke pieces more effectively. (The German term Tonstück is typically meant less specifically and translated simply as [...] "piece of music.") ...|$|E
50|$|Measurements {{based on}} psychoacoustics, {{such as the}} {{measurement}} of noise, often use a weighting filter. It is well established that human hearing is more sensitive to some frequencies than others, as demonstrated by equal-loudness contours, {{but it is not}} well appreciated that these contours vary {{depending on the type of}} sound. The measured curves for pure tones, for instance, are different from those for random noise. The ear also responds less well to short bursts, below 100 to 200 ms, than to continuous sounds such that a quasi-peak detector has been found to give the most representative results when noise contains click or bursts, as is often the case for noise in digital systems. For these reasons, a set of subjectively valid measurement techniques have been devised and incorporated into BS, IEC, EBU and ITU standards. These methods of audio quality measurement are used by broadcast engineers throughout most of the world, as well as by some audio professionals, though the older A-weighting standard for <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> is still commonly used by others.|$|E
