The first female ascent was made in 1890 by Fay Fuller, accompanied by Van Trump and three other teammates.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} voalavo probably largely {{lives on}} the ground, but is able to <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> vegetation. It likes areas with dense networks of roots, among which it moves using runways and natural tunnels. The species is nocturnal (active during the night), is solitary, probably eats fruits and seeds, and bears up to three young per litter.|$|E

50|$|After their {{co-operation}} with Jones in {{his very}} successful Rock <b>Climbing</b> <b>in</b> the English Lake District (1897), they produced companion volumes, Rock <b>Climbing</b> <b>in</b> North Wales (George, in 1906) and Rock <b>Climbing</b> <b>in</b> Skye (Ashley, in 1907). These attempted to emulate Jones' exuberant style, and were of course illustrated {{with their own}} photographs.|$|R

5|$|The powerfully {{rising and}} sinking air in {{mountain}} waves {{was discovered by}} glider pilot, Wolf Hirth, in 1933. Gliders can sometimes <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> these waves to great altitudes, although pilots must use supplementary oxygen to avoid hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|A {{quartet of}} riders made the <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> second {{position}} on the road behind Pellizotti: race leader Denis Menchov, Danilo Di Luca, Ivan Basso, and Stefano Garzelli. Di Luca rode with a very high cadence {{in an attempt to}} separate himself from Menchov, but was unable to until the sprint for the finish line. By virtue of the time bonuses gained for third place as well as the gap on the road, Di Luca closed his deficit to Menchov to under 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After their {{trips to}} the Himalaya, the Workmans gave lectures about their travels. They were invited to learned societies; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and the second {{to speak at the}} Royal Geographical Society. She {{received}} many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was {{recognized as one of the}} foremost climbers of her day. She demonstrated that a woman could <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.|$|E

5|$|Hill has {{experienced}} only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> Buoux, France; after forgetting {{to tie a}} safety rope, she fell 85ft (25m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.|$|E

The league is skater-owned and skater-run.|$|E
5|$|The Snowdon Massif {{includes}} {{a number of}} cliffs, and holds an important place {{in the history of}} rock climbing in the United Kingdom. Clogwyn Du'r Arddu is often colloquially known as 'Cloggy' among climbers, and was the site of the first recorded <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> Britain, in 1798. It was carried out by Peter Bailey Williams and William Bingley, while searching for rare plants. It is now considered {{to be one of the}} best cliffs in Britain for rock climbing.|$|E

5|$|The {{demonstration}} profile {{as designed}} by Holland included a 360° turn around Fairchild's air-traffic-control tower. Holland had not attempted this maneuver in previous air-show demonstrations. During the final flight, Holland performed {{a series of}} 60° banked turns and a 68° pitch <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> violation of Brooks' orders. No evidence exists that McGeehan or Wolff attempted to intervene as Holland executed the maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|The lengthy {{individual}} {{time trial}} featured a <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of}} it, but no KOM points were on offer. The course was technical and featured several turnarounds. It was the same course that was raced four times in stage eight, except that the finish line was not situated at the same place. Midway through the stage, the riders took on {{the difficulty of the}} day, the -long Liebewill. There were other small climbs to pepper the course.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} €2,023,300 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall {{winner of the}} general {{classification}} received €450,000, with {{the second and third}} placed riders got €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers of the race were awarded with money.

5|$|Despite a shaky {{start at}} the anchor desk, Jennings' {{broadcast}} began to <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> the ratings. Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay area, media pundits praised Jennings and ABC News for their prompt on-air response, while criticizing the delayed reaction of Tom Brokaw and NBC News. The next month, Brokaw redeemed himself by scooping the other networks with news {{of the fall of}} the Berlin Wall. It was World News Tonight, however, that ended the year at the top; ABC's evening newscast spent the last 13 weeks of the year in first place, and its average ratings for the entire year beat CBS for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The early {{breakaway}} included four riders. These were Thomas Voeckler (Direct Énergie), Matthew Brammeier (Dimension Data), Florian Vachon (Fortuneo–Vital Concept) and Evaldas Siskevicius (Delko–Marseille Provence KTM). They {{were not}} allowed to build a large advantage, with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead. The main action of the day came on the second-category final <b>climb.</b> <b>In</b> the breakaway, now just a minute ahead, Voeckler attacked and dropped the other breakaway riders. Nathan Haas (Dimension Data) attacked the peloton {{at the top of the}} climb, but made a mistake on a corner and ended up in a field. On the climb, Marcel Kittel and Arnaud Démare were dropped, with Démare then pulling out of the race. Geraint Thomas was one of several riders to crash on the climb, but he was able to return to the peloton.|$|E
5|$|The {{team did}} not have any rider {{highlighted}} as a favorite entering the Giro di Lombardia; pre-race analyses held Gilbert as the man to beat. Zaugg rode {{at the front of the}} race the entire day, riding off the front to occupy first position as the solo leader on the Villa Vergano climb. He then maintained his advantage on the alternating flat sections and remaining climbs (the Muro dell'Alpino and the finishing <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> Lecco), holding on for victory ahead of 's Dan Martin and 's Joaquim Rodríguez by 8 seconds. The victory was not only Zaugg's first monument classic win, or even his first single-day win, it was his first professional victory of any kind, coming at age 30. Post-race analysis compared Zaugg's triumph to some of the more notable upsets to which the race has played host in its history.|$|E

5|$|The tenth {{stage was}} planned to mimic stage 17 of the 1949 Giro d'Italia, which was won by Italian cycling legend Fausto Coppi {{en route to}} the overall victory. That route {{originally}} included the Col d'Izoard, a <b>climb</b> <b>in</b> France which has been featured in the Tour de France numerous times. Race organizers were forced to alter this stage to cover only the Italian side of the Alps rather than also visit France, as there were concerns over radio communication in the area, and the roads stood the risk of landslides. It was subsequently made longer than first planned, with an additional, shorter climb added. Stages 10 and 16, the latter of which went over Monte Petrano and two other first-category climbs, were both called the race's queen stage.|$|E
