50|$|Many debates {{have been}} {{discussed}} {{about whether or not}} <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> are sufficient to compete with modern equipment currently {{as well as in the}} future, since <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> were among one of the oldest machine-driven dewatering devices. Efficiency improvements are possible in many applications where modern <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> have the best characteristics for the job, however, despite the fact that many mechanical improvements have been made, <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> still remain to operate on the same concept as when first invented. A lack of progress in efficiency improvement as well as a lack of research on conquering associated issues surrounding <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> have suggested a possibility of performance inadequacy. At the same time, many other types of filter could do the same or better job as <b>press</b> <b>filters.</b> In certain cases, it is crucial to compare characteristics and performances.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hydrometallurgy is {{a popular}} {{metallurgical}} technology. <b>Filter</b> <b>press</b> is common but vital {{to the production of}} hydrometallurgy. Hence, the process monitoring of <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> is of great significance for hydrometallurgy. Due to data analysis and related knowledge of <b>filter</b> <b>press,</b> Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to process monitoring of the <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> via two traditional statistics. However, modeling and test data collected from actual production suffers from outliers, missing data, inconsistent sampling period between variables.

5000|$|Many {{specialized}} {{applications are}} associated with different types of <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> that are currently used in various industries. Plate <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> is extensively used in sugaring operations such as the production of maple syrup in Canada, since it offers very high efficiency and reliability. According to M.Isselhardt, [...] "appearance can affect the value of maple syrup and customer's perception of quality".

5000|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>presses</b> {{are used}} in a huge variety of {{different}} applications, from dewatering of mineral mining slurries to blood plasma purification. At the same time, <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> technology is widely established for ultrafine coal dewatering as well as filtrate recovery in coal preparation plants. According to G.Prat, the [...] "filter press is proven {{to be the most}} effective and reliable technique to meet today's requirement". One of the examples is Pilot scale plate <b>filter</b> <b>press,</b> which is specialized in dewatering coal slurries. In 2013 the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration published an article highlighting this specific application. It was mentioned that the use of the <b>filter</b> <b>press</b> is very beneficial to plant operations, since it offers dewatering ultraclean coal as product, as well as improving quality of water removed to be available for equipment cleaning.|$|R
25|$|In {{order of}} {{increasing}} cost and decreasing product moisture {{the most common}} dewatering options are a thickener, deep bed thickening, belt <b>presses</b> and membrane <b>filter</b> <b>presses.</b> In general centrifuges and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt <b>press</b> <b>filter,</b> for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. Belt <b>press</b> <b>filters</b> in general have the lowest flocculant consumption {{for any of the}} listed processes excluding membrane <b>filter</b> <b>presses</b> and centrifuges.|$|R
