25|$|Cell {{suspensions}} are turbid. Cells {{absorb and}} scatter the light. The higher the cell concentration, {{the higher the}} turbidity. Spectrophotometers can measure intensity of light very accurately. The cell culture is placed in a transparent <b>cuvette</b> and the absorption is measured relative to medium alone. Optical density (OD) is directly proportional to the biomass in the cell suspension in a given range that is specific to the cell type. Using spectrophotometry for measuring the turbidity of cultures is known as turbidometry.|$|E

25|$|As the bonobos' {{habitat is}} shared with people, the {{ultimate}} success of conservation efforts still rely on local and community involvement. The issue of parks versus people is salient in the <b>Cuvette</b> Centrale the bonobos' range. There is strong local and broad-based Congolese resistance to establishing national parks, as indigenous communities {{have often been}} driven from their forest homes by the establishment of parks. In Salonga National Park, the only national park in the bonobo habitat, there is no local involvement, and surveys undertaken since 2000 indicate the bonobo, the African forest elephant, and other species have been severely devastated by poachers and the thriving bushmeat trade. In contrast, areas exist where the bonobo and biodiversity still thrive without any established parks, due to the indigenous beliefs and taboos against killing bonobos.|$|E

Aided by local guerrillas and resistance, he has however no way to take the city by force. He then started with his men in a campaign of sabotage and bombings that lasted more than a month. After having isolated the city by destroying the infrastructure surrounding it (overpasses, railway lines, bridges, etc.), the FFI had managed to rally the population and give the occupiers an impression of encirclement.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{reclamation}} interventions of post-smelting slag dumps being undertaken so far either failed or produced poor results. Certain lichens, {{especially of}} the genus Cladonia, are known as effective colonisers of bare ground in anthropogenic habitats. The paper presents preliminary results of the experiment aimed at the evaluation of lichen usefulness in reclamation interventions. The cultivation in vivo involving transplantation of lichens directly on slag substrate was established in 2015. Five species, i. e. Cladonia rei, C. cariosa, C. pyxidata, C. subulata, C. macilenta, were transplanted into 32 <b>cuvettes</b> filled with sterilised slag substrate. The sample weight of 2 and 6 g were used and half of <b>cuvettes</b> were regularly supplied with 2 % malt solution. The first important symptoms at the present stage of the experiment are as follow: the growth of thalli has appeared only {{in the case of}} first three species; C. rei shows the most effective development; <b>cuvettes</b> with 6 g sample weight are characterized by higher coverage of fresh lichen thalli; lichen biomass are visually higher in <b>cuvettes</b> treated with malt solution. The results give us reason to believe that lichens could be successfully used as an alternative element during planning of slag dumps reclamation in the future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The harmful {{side effects}} of {{electroporation}} to cells due to local changes in pH, the appearance of toxic electrode products, temperature increase, and the heterogeneity of the electric field acting on cells in the <b>cuvettes</b> used for electroporation were observed and discussed in several laboratories. If cells are subjected to weak electric fields for prolonged periods, for example in experiments on cell electrophoresis or galvanotaxis the same effects are seen. In these experiments investigators managed to reduce or eliminate the harmful {{side effects of}} electric current application. Methods For the experiments, disposable 2003 ̆bcl <b>cuvettes</b> with two walls made of dialysis membranes were constructed {{and placed in a}} locally focused electric field at a considerable distance from the electrodes. <b>Cuvettes</b> were mounted into an apparatus for horizontal electrophoresis and the cells were subjected to direct current electric field (dcEF) pulses from a commercial pulse generator of exponentially declining pulses and from a custom-made generator of double and single rectangular pulses.

2500|$|Before {{testing a}} sample, the Spectronic 20 is {{calibrated}} using a blank solution, {{which is the}} pure solvent that {{is used in the}} experimental sample. [...] It is typically water or an organic solvent. [...] In this calibration, the transmittance is set at 100% using the calibration knob of the instrument (the amplifier control knob in the figure at right). The instrument can also optionally be calibrated with a stock solution of a sample at a concentration known to have an absorbance of 2 or else vendor supplied standards, using the light absorption knob in the diagram shown at right. After calibration, the user places a 1/2 inch test tube or <b>cuvette</b> containing the sample solution to be measured into the sample compartment. Calibration is repeated each time the wavelength is changed. It or a standard reference sample is generally used to periodically check for drift. To measure wavelengths above 650 nm, the bottom of the instrument is opened, and a red filter and a red-sensitive photocell is installed.|$|E

Stanislas Batchi replied that he was not in the process of settling a family dispute, but a highly important matter related to the security of the state.This example from the [...] "Mpita Group" [...] case shows how to violating the rules of mutual assistance, by using cynicism towards his own, by getting their hands dirty, allegiance to the new political order and safeguarding his Position in the leading core.

50|$|The <b>cuvette</b> {{calibration}} has a {{great effect}} on the absorbance measurement. Many variables {{need to be considered}} to ensure precision and accuracy. The spectrophotometric measurement is sensitive to the change in volume. The calibration <b>cuvette</b> helps scientists to convert the volume data from relative value units to the true volume with the less uncertainty. The <b>cuvette</b> adjustment is important for laboratory technicians who acquiring a precise estimation of the volume of solution. In the laboratory facility, sometimes a round glass <b>cuvette</b> is frequently utilized. The adjusted <b>cuvette</b> that has been aligned and sold in the market is expensive in comparison with the cost of normal glass tubes. The glass cell costs approximately 30 times more than an ordinary glass tube. In turn, the cuvettes do the most appropriate sort of spectrophotometer, but in the some researches need the great number of <b>cuvette</b> and can be costly. A high quality glass tube as calibrated can give similar result as a <b>cuvette.</b> However, the manually calibrated <b>cuvette</b> has less consistency. The adjustment and position of the tube affect the reading value of the absorbance as the light goes through the sample controlled by the width of the <b>cuvette.</b> The distance traveled by light and the concentration of solution influence the estimation of absorbance. The appropriate wavelength and type of <b>cuvette</b> is the main component for measuring the correct absorbance with manually calibrating the <b>cuvette.</b>|$|E
