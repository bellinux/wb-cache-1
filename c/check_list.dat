40|$|To guide {{undergraduate}} medical, dental {{and health}} science students undertaking self-directed learning {{and preparing for}} examinations in general and systematic pathology, comprehensive graded <b>check</b> <b>lists</b> of selected learning topics have been prepared. Each topic is allocated a grade of 0 (knowledge of the topic not required), 1 (awareness of existence of condition needed, but detailed information not required), 2 (moderately important) or 3 (very important, substantial knowledge required). As students advance through the undergraduate medical course they are provided with replacement lists in which the gradings of many topics have been increased to match requirements for increased knowledge. Over the five years that these <b>check</b> <b>lists</b> have been used, they have received {{a high level of}} approval, students finding them increasingly useful as self-directed learning progressively replaces didactic teaching methods. The introduction of the <b>check</b> <b>lists</b> has markedly reduced student inquiries regarding the levels of knowledge required for examinations, and has proved useful to teachers involved in the setting and marking of student assessments.
