40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} argues that {{helicopter}} money – a permanent {{increase in the}} monetary base – can always boost aggregate demand. Therefore, liquidity traps, periods of persistently low inflation, and demand-‐ driven secular stagnations can be undone via monetary policy that permanently increases the monetary base. The author establishes this result by analyzing consumption behavior in a Blanchard-‐Yaari perpetual youth model where households face a constant probability of death. The author solves for optimal consumption {{as a function of}} household wealth, which is the sum of current assets and human capital (the present discounted value of future labor income less taxes). By substituting the government’s intertemporal budget constraint into the household’s intertemporal budget constraint, the author shows how consumption depends on the money supply.

40|$|Abstract. We define Petrin-Levinsohn (PL) {{aggregate}} {{productivity growth}} as {{the change in}} aggregated final demand minus {{the change in the}} aggregated cost of primary inputs. It is an indicator of the change in potential aggregate <b>consumption</b> <b>holding</b> total primary input use constant. We show how to aggregate plant-level data to PL, and how to use plant-level data to decompose PL into technical efficiency and reallocation components. We confront the “non-neoclassical ” features that impact plant-level data, including related factors like plant-level heterogeneity, the entry and exit of goods, fixed and sunk costs, markups, returns to scale, adjustment costs like hiring, firing and search costs, gestation lags, and sub-optimal behavior of plants. There are well-known estimation techniques available for both the reallocation and real growth components of PL. While the assumptions necessary for PL to equal welfare are strong, many well-known theoretical models write down welfare functions that are special cases of it measures the change in potential consumption. We compare PL to several variants of a widely used alternative definition of aggregate productivity growth proposed originally in Bailey, Hulten, and Campbell (1992). While these indexes have decompositions into technical efficiency and reallocation terms that are similar in spirit, we show economic theory suggests the BHC will depart from the PL on both the aggregate technical efficiency term and the reallocation term. Panel data for manufacturing industries from Chile and Colombia show that these two measures can differ significantly, as do several results from othe...|$|E

Military participation is negatively and again insignificantly related to GDP growth in countries of the highest third GDPs of the 98 countries, but is positively and significantly related to GDP growth in countries of the lowest third GDPs. This study looks at the effects of military participation on economic growth. First, it studies the panel of 98 countries looked at in Robert J Barro’s 1991 study on economic growth. Then, those countries are sorted by its level of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and separated into 3 groups, the top 35, middle 28, and bottom 35 countries according to GDP.

40|$|It {{seems to}} {{be taken for granted}} by many {{commentators}} that the sharp decline in prices of computers, telecommunications equipment and software resulting from the technological improvements in the information and communications technology (ICT) -producing sector is good for jobs and is a major driving force behind the non-inflationary employment miracle and booming stock market {{in the latter half of}} the nineties in the U. S. and their recurrence since 2004. We show that, in our model, a technical improvement in the ICT-producing sector by itself cannot explain a simultaneous increase in employment and a rise in firms' valuation (or Tobin's Q ratio). There are two cases. If the elasticity of equipment price (pI with respect to ICT-producing sector's productivity is less than one, labor's value marginal productivity increases thus pulling up the demand wage and expanding employment. However, the increased output by adding to the capital stock and thus driving down future capital rentals causes a decline in firms' valuation, q per unit, even though Tobin's Q (=q/pI) is up. If the elasticity is greater than one, equipment prices fall so dramatically that labor's value marginal productivity declines, employment in the ICT-using sector expands proportionately more than the increase in capital stock, thus raising future capital rentals, so both firms 'valuation and Tobin's Q rise; but then real demand wage falls and employment contracts. The key to generating a booming stock market alongside employment expansion is to hypothesize that when technical improvement in the ICT-producing sector occurs, the market forms an expectation of future productivity gains to be reaped in the ICT-using sector. Then we can explain not only the stock market boom and associated rise in investment spending and employment in the period 1995 - 2000 but also the subsequent decline in employment, in Tobin's Q and in investment spending in 2001, with <b>consumption</b> <b>holding</b> up well as productivity gains in the ICT-using sector were realized.

We calculate {{the changes in}} real GDP and real consumption that result from changes in trade costs {{in a range of}} workhorse trade models, following the procedures outlined by statistical agencies in the United States.

Second, with balanced trade in each country, changes in world real consumption and changes in world real GDP (i. e. : weighting the change in each country by its nominal GDP) in response to changes in variable trade costs coincide, up to a first-order approximation, with changes in world theoretical (welfare-based) consumption.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this chapter is on social, as opposed to convenience, eating. This basic {{distinction}} is made by Cullen (1994), who suggests that social eating must fulfil certain social functions {{for it to be}} successful. The meal experience investigated, therefore, involves more than snacks, 'grazing' activities, 'refuelling', or those with ulterior motives such as business lunches (Lashley, 2000). It engages with the special and memorable occasion, providing insights into aspects concerned with emotions and inherent social dynamics. Meal occasions may be regarded both as an 'object' displaying structure and form as well as an 'event' with physiological, psychological and sociological components (Douglas, 1975), and are recognizable in that they tend to be associated with their cyclical appearance in the household and with social events (Mitchell, 1999). In this respect, Gillespie and Morrison (2001) suggest that <b>consumption</b> <b>holds</b> symbolic emotional value associated with rites of passage, such as graduation, wedding or funeral.

In this paper, a descriptive approach has been taken to synthesize the world’s energy portfolio and the global energy balance outlook {{in order to provide}} insights into the role of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in maintaining “stability” and “balance” of the world’s energy market. This synthesis illustrates that in the absence of stringent policies, i. e., if historical trends of the global energy production and <b>consumption</b> <b>hold</b> into the future, it is unlikely that non-conventional liquid fuels and renewable energy sources will play a dominant role in meeting global energy demand by 2030.

OPEC’s potential to impact the supply and price of oil could enable this organization to act as a facilitator or a barrier for energy transition policies, and to {{play a key role in}} the global energy security through cooperative or non-cooperative strategies. It is argued that, as the global energy portfolio becomes more balanced in the long run, OPEC may change its typical high oil price strategies to drive the market prices to lower equilibria, making alternative energy sources less competitive. Alternatively, OPEC can contribute to a cooperative portfolio management approach to help mitigate the gradually emerging energy crisis and global warming, facilitating a less turbulent energy transition path while there is time...|$|R

Across the nation, water shortages are triggering growing concern and an acceleration of efforts to increase water use efficiency.

Such measures can help stretch limited water supplies, save businesses money, reduce energy consumption, improve water quality, and protect local, regional, and statewide ecosystems. In February of 2008, California’s governor called for a reduction in per capita urban water use of 20 percent by 2020, and the CII sector has a critical {{role to play in}} reaching this target. In California, CII sector water use is estimated to be 2. 5 million acre-feet per year—or approximately one-third of total water use in California’s urban areas.

This study determines how {{and to which}} extent the management of phosphorus in Austria can be optimized. A detailed national model, obtained for the year 2013 through Material Flow Analysis, represents the reference situation. Applicability and limitations are discussed {{for a range of}} actions aimed at reducing consumption, increasing recycling, and lowering emissions. The potential contribution of each field of action is quantified and compared using three indicators: Import dependency, Consumption of fossil-P fertilizers and Emissions to water bodies. Further, the uncertainty of this assessment is characterized and priorities for the upgrade of data collection are identified. Moreover, all the potential gains discussed in the article are applied to the reference situation to generate an ideal target model. The results show that in Austria a large scope for phosphorus stewardship exists. Strategies based exclusively either on recycling or on the decline of P <b>consumption</b> <b>hold</b> a similar potential to reduce import dependency by 50 % each. An enhanced P recycling from meat and bone meal, sewage sludge and compost could replace the current use of fossil-P fertilizers by 70 %.

40|$|Research {{on alcohol}} {{consumption}} across and within countries {{is complicated by}} measurement issues. Measurement error may result from sensitivity of the topic and difficulty of the questions. When the questionnaire is administered face-to-face, interviewers are likely to contribute to this measurement error. As a result, part of the variation across countries and across sociodemographic groups {{may be due to}} differences between countries in the way interviewers administer the questionnaires, rather than real differences in alcohol consumption. This paper investigates how patterns of alcohol consumption, in terms of frequency and quantity consumed, vary across Europe, and how they relate to key sociodemographic background variables, age, gender, and education level. Data from the rotating module on health inequalities of the seventh round of the European Social Survey (ESS 7) is used. Potential interviewer effects on the alcohol consumption variables are taken into account by allowing for random intercepts in a multilevel regression model. The results show that European countries vary strongly in alcohol consumption patterns. Some evidence emerges for the ‘wet’ versus ‘dry’ drinking cultures distinction. In some countries, people drink frequently but relatively small amounts whereas in other countries, people drink less frequently but larger amounts. Both the frequency and amount of alcohol consumption are higher for men than women in all countries studied. The effects of age and education level are less consistent. Even though the interviewer effects on these questions about alcohol consumption are substantial in some countries, the overall conclusions about the effects of sociodemographic characteristics on alcohol <b>consumption</b> <b>hold</b> when interviewer effects are taken into account, but country-specific conclusions can be affected, especially for weaker effects and for outcome measures that are strongly affected by interviewer effects. status: publishe...|$|R
