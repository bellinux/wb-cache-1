At the time, DVI-HDCP (DVI with HDCP) and DVI-HDTV (DVI-HDCP using the CEA-861-B video standard) were being used on HDTVs.

40|$|Owing to the {{turbulence}} of entrepreneurial environment in recent years, {{the need to}} examine how technology entrepreneurship capabilities affect nascent graduate mindset toward creating new technology-based organizations is topical. Despite the fact that technological capabilities, relational <b>capabilities,</b> financial <b>capabilities,</b> <b>and</b> knowledge-sharing <b>capabilities</b> are central drivers of technology entrepreneurship, explicit gaps {{exist in the literature}} concerning their impact on technopreneurship intention. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the relationship between technology entrepreneurial <b>capabilities</b> <b>and</b> technopreneurship intention. A cross-sectional study was conducted with seven hypotheses in order to investigate the mediating role of knowledge sharing capabilities on the relationships between technology entrepreneurship <b>capabilities</b> (technological, relational, <b>and</b> financing) and technopreneurship intention. The hypotheses are tested based on data collected from 121 nascent graduates in Nigeria using multiple regression. Based on the output of the results, the study suggests direct and full mediating role of knowledge-sharing capabilities on technology entrepreneurship <b>capabilities</b> <b>and</b> technopreneurship intention. Thus, knowledge-sharing capabilities mediates the relation between technological <b>capabilities</b> <b>and</b> technopreneurship intention, as well as financial <b>capabilities</b> <b>and</b> technopreneurship intention.

A sample of 266 Colombian consumers representing different socio-economic classes is used to test the model using structural equation modeling. The results show that self-esteem, self-assessed <b>capabilities,</b> <b>and</b> product domain knowledge are predictive of expectations of complexity, with low self-esteem, low <b>capabilities,</b> <b>and</b> low product knowledge leading to higher complexity expectations. Socioeconomic status relates closely to self-esteem, self-assessed <b>capabilities,</b> <b>and</b> product domain knowledge and {{can be used as a}} surrogate for the individual-level constructs.

By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E

Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and Apollo 15, obtained samples of pre-mare lunar material, before lava began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, none had actually visited the lunar highlands.|$|E

As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to restart the game with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the <b>capability</b> <b>and</b> liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
