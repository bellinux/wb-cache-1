5|$|In February 1994, the Great Southern Hotel {{ended its}} {{operations}} {{from the building}} as the hotel faced increasing competition in the hospitality industry. At {{the time of its}} closure, the hotel was operating only 40 rooms that were equipped with a double-bed and a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan,</b> catering mainly to budget travellers from Malaysia and Indonesia. The other seven existing tenants of the building vacated their businesses after the building was sold, and were each paid a compensation sum.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 1991, Sihanouk {{returned}} to Cambodia {{to participate in}} the elections, followed by Son Senn, a Khmer Rouge official, who arrived a few days later to set up the organisation's electoral campaign office in Phnom Penh. On 27 November 1991, Khieu Samphan also {{returned to}} Cambodia on a flight from Bangkok; initially he had expected his arrival to be uneventful, but as soon as Khieu Samphan's flight landed at Pochentong Airport, he was met by an angry crowd which shouted insults and abuse at him. As Khieu Samphan was driven into the city, another crowd lined the route towards his office and threw objects at his car. As soon as he arrived at his office, Khieu Samphan entered and immediately telephoned the Chinese Government to save him. Shortly afterwards, an angry mob forced its way into the building, chased Khieu Samphan up the second floor and tried to hang him from a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan.</b> Eventually, Khieu Samphan was able to escape from the building by a ladder with his face bloodied, and was immediately taken to Pochentong Airport, where he flew out of Cambodia. With the departure of Khieu Samphan, the Khmer Rougeâ€™s participation in the election seemed doubtful.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{propellers}} {{from the}} Vickers Vimy {{was given to}} Arthur Whitten Brown and hung for many years {{on the wall of}} his office in Swansea before he presented it to the RAF College Cranwell. It {{is believed to have been}} displayed in the RAF Careers Office in Holborn until 1990. It is believed to be in use today as a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> in Luigi Malone's Restaurant in Cork, Ireland.|$|E

50|$|Due to this renewed {{commercial}} success using <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> effectively as an energy conservation application, many American manufacturers also started to produce, or significantly increase production of, <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans.</b> In {{addition to the}} imported Encon <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans,</b> the Casablanca Fan Company was founded in 1974. Other American manufacturers of the time included the Hunter Fan Co. (which was then a division of Robbins & Myers, Inc), FASCO (F. A. Smith Co.), Emerson Electric, and Lasko; the latter two were often branded as Sears-Roebuck.|$|R
50|$|Through the 1980s and 1990s, <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> {{remained}} {{popular in}} the United States. Many small American importers, most of them rather short-lived, started importing <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans.</b> Throughout the 1980s, the balance of sales between American-made <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> and those imported from manufacturers in India, Taiwan, Hong Kong and eventually China changed dramatically with imported fans taking the lion's {{share of the market}} by the late 1980s. Even the most basic U.S-made fans sold for $200 to $500, while the most expensive imported fans rarely exceeded $150.|$|R
25|$|Pul died on 9 August 2016 {{at the age}} of 47. His {{body was}} {{discovered}} that morning hanging from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> in the room where he practiced yoga. Police took the body into custody and sent it for autopsy. He allegedly committed suicide by hanging in the Chief Minister's bungalow at Itanagar which he still occupied while his home was under renovation. He is survived by three wives and four children.|$|E
25|$|After another {{incident}} of desecration of the Koran, Kurnaz said that Afghan prisoners tore down a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan,</b> honed blades, and attacked their captors using the fan blades as swords. No soldiers were killed, though some were badly bloodied. Three more prisoners subsequently died. Kurnaz {{said that people}} from the cellblock of these prisoners {{talked to him about}} events. They described the metal shutters being closed. They said that night, soldiers carried three of the prisoners out of their cells dead, with pieces of torn sheet in their mouths and other torn sheets binding their arms and legs. US authorities said these three prisoners had committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2005, Colts coach Tony Dungy was {{notified}} that his eldest son, James Dungy, was found unresponsive {{in his apartment}} in Lutz, Florida by James' girlfriend. A deputy from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department performed CPR on the 18-year-old Dungy before an ambulance transported him to University Community Hospital, where James was pronounced dead. The Operations Manager at the Hillsborough County Medical Examiners Department said {{that the cause of}} death was an apparent suicide. On February 17, 2006, after the autopsy was performed, Dr. Jacqueline Lee of the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's Office stated that Dungy had hanged himself from a bedroom <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> with a leather belt.|$|E
5000|$|Bladeless <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans.</b> This type was {{introduced}} in 2012 by Exhale fans and uses a bladeless turbine to push air outwards from the fan, {{which is also the}} case of regular <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> on updraft mode. These feature a brushless DC motor instead of a normal direct drive motor.|$|R
5000|$|Cast-iron <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans.</b> Cast-iron <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> {{account for}} almost all <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> made from their {{invention}} in 1882 through the 1950s. A cast-iron housing encases a very heavy-duty oil-bath motor, usually of the shaded-pole variety. These fans must be oiled periodically, usually once or twice per year, since they use an oil-bath system for lubrication. Because these fans are so sturdily built, and due to their utter lack of electronic components, {{it is not uncommon}} to see cast-iron fans aged eighty years or more running strong and still in use today.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{electric}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> {{became very}} popular in other countries, particularly those with hot climates, such as India and the Middle East, where a lack of infrastructure and/or financial resources made energy-hungry and complex freon-based air conditioning equipment impractical. In 1973, Texas entrepreneur H. W. (Hub) Markwardt began importing highly efficient <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> to the United States that were manufactured in India by Crompton Greaves, Ltd. Crompton Greaves had been manufacturing <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> since 1937 through a joint venture formed by Greaves Cotton of India and Crompton Parkinson of England, and had perfected the world's most energy efficient <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> thanks to its patented 20 pole induction motor with a highly efficient heat-dissipating cast aluminum rotor. These Indian manufactured <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> caught on slowly at first, but Markwardt's Encon Industries branded <b>ceiling</b> <b>fans</b> (which stood for ENergy CONservation) eventually found great success during the energy crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s, since they consumed far less energy (under 70 watts of electricity) than the antiquated shaded pole motors used in most other American made fans. The fans became very effective energy saving appliances for residential and commercial use by supplementing expensive air conditioning with a cooling wind-chill effect. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the heat transfer coefficient, but do not lower temperatures directly.|$|R

500|$|Shroeder confronts Gogolak, {{accusing him}} of trying to kill his family. Instead Schroeder is told [...] "Rob Petrie" [...] is the real problem. Meanwhile, Mulder {{believes}} the creature that kills the homeowners moves through the yard, under the grass. Scully shares her lab results: the [...] "blood" [...] on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> and on the dog is actually grime, as the neighborhood is built {{on top of an}} old landfill. Mulder believes the Klines were buried in their yard, so the next day he gets a backhoe to dig up the front yard, telling the neighbors he's putting in a reflecting pool, which is not against the community rules. They don't find the Klines, but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died. The windmill bears a label from Gogolak's company.|$|E
500|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} the Klines' disappearance, going undercover as new homeowners under the aliases Rob and Laura Petrie. As Mulder and Scully {{are moving into}} the Klines' former home, neighbor Win Shroeder nervously tucks away Mulder's basketball hoop into the garage, telling him that it is against the community's CC. Settling in, the agents begin searching the house and find {{what appears to be}} blood on a blade of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan.</b> When Big Mike, another neighbor, wants to let the [...] "Petries" [...] in on the [...] "consequences" [...] of breaking the community rules, homeowner association president Gene Gogolak describes him as [...] "a weak link" [...] to be dealt with. That night, Big Mike disappears after being attacked by the creature. While taking a walk, Scully later finds the Schroeder's dog Scruffy and Big Mike's necklace in a storm drain. Scruffy's face is covered in a substance that looks like blood.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Donna Gooden acts as, {{among other}} things, the town's {{veterinarian}} and medical examiner. On Twin Peaks, Laura's best friend was named Donna, and Donna's father, Dr. Hayward, {{was also the}} town doctor and medical examiner. While drinking a Cherry Coke, Maudette states, [...] "Isn't cherry the best?" [...] Sherilyn Fenn, the actress who portrays Maudette, famously tied a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue in Twin Peaks. Later, Ray Wise suddenly has white hair, just as his Twin Peaks character Leland Palmer's hair turned white overnight in one episode. Dual Spires {{is famous for its}} cinnamon pie and apple cider, as Twin Peaks was famous for cherry pie and [...] "damn fine" [...] coffee. The mayor of Dual Spires is named Douglas Fir, and the town of Twin Peaks was filled with Douglas-fir trees. The local paper in Dual Spires is [...] "The Great Northern," [...] while Twin Peaks had a hotel called the Great Northern. In both series, there are stacks of donuts at the police station. In both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks, a sawmill was the source of the town's livelihood and burned down in a case of arson. Paula Merral is found wrapped in plastic by the lake, just as in Twin Peaks Laura Palmer's body was found [...] "dead, wrapped in plastic" [...] on a rocky beach. The Barkers have a framed prom photo of their niece wearing a tiara prominently displayed, and a similar photo of Laura Palmer remains the iconic Twin Peaks image. Leo the cinnamon owl was the festival mascot, whereas the character of Leo Johnson was suspected of Laura Palmer's murder in Twin Peaks. Owls were a major part of Peaks as well. The pet bird in Dr. Gooden's waiting room was the same type of bird that bit Laura's shoulder in Twin Peaks. There is similar camera work and sound effect focus on a <b>ceiling</b> <b>fan</b> whipping around {{at the top of the}} stairs at Sheriff Jackson's house; this happened often in Twin Peaks. The sheriff's house also looks similar to the Palmers' house. Paula secretly dated the sheriff's son and shared [...] "secret special lover earrings" [...] with him, and in Twin Peaks, Laura and the nephew of one of the townsmen each had half of a golden heart necklace. A local teenage boy wears a jeweled crown. In Peaks, Audrey Horne's older brother wore a Native American headdress. In both series, the sheriff's deputy is a Native American who is very in tune with nature. Sheriff Andrew Jackson's name references the seventh president of the United States, just as the name of the sheriff of Twin Peaks, Harry Truman, references the 33rd. Shawn and Gus find a book written by Earl Wyndam; in Peaks, Windom Earle was a psychopathic ex-FBI agent.|$|E
