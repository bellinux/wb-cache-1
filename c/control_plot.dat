Five years after the initiation of the fragmentation, the density of rosettes did not differ between fragments and <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> The number of leaves per rosette was higher in fragments than in <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> in summer but not in late spring and early autumn. The extent of leaf damage, expressed as proportion of leaf area removed by invertebrate herbivores, increased over the vegetation period. Leaf damage was greater in fragments than in <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> at two study sites, whereas the opposite (less strongly expressed) was found at the third site. Number of species and density (individuals per m(2)) of potential herbivores (gastropods and grasshoppers) were recorded in all. fragments and <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> Effects of fragmentation on the number of species and densities depended on plot size and differed between gastropods and grasshoppers. Leaf damage in fragments increased with increasing density of gastropods if the third site, which had lowest leaf damage, was excluded. Such a positive relationship was neither found in <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> nor for grasshopper densities. Thus, movement of gastropods in fragments was probably restricted which resulted in increased feeding pressure at least in two sites. However, even if our fragmentation experiment was well designed and replicated, the interpretation of these experimental results remains difficutt because there was large site-to-site and seasonal variation.

Because refuges of forest-dwelling rodents are often associated with woody debris, we examined refuge use by 37 radio-collared Peromyscus gossypinus (cotton mice) in experimental plots with different levels of woody debris.

Of 247 refuges, 159 were in rotting stumps (64 %), 32 were in root boles (13 %), 19 were in brush piles (8 %), and 16 were in logs (6 %); 10 refuges could not be identified.

Both experimental and <b>control</b> <b>plots</b> were treated alike with all other agricultural practices. Data was collected methodically at regular intervals, but for the purpose of analysis they are presented for periods of 4, 6, 10 and 14  months. The same workers were employed in both treatment and <b>control</b> <b>plots.</b> Instruments such as weighing scales and spray tanks used for foliar spraying were regularly calibrated. The measurements and records maintained by the plantation company were regularly audited by internal, external and statutory audit teams independently after verifying and confirming all estate records.|$|R
