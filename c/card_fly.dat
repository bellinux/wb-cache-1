50|$|Coming {{off their}} bye week, the Cardinals flew to Raymond James Stadium for a Week 9 intraconference duel with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In the first quarter, the <b>Cards</b> <b>flew</b> first with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 47-yard field goal. However, the Buccaneers {{took the lead}} with QB Jeff Garcia {{completing}} a 37-yard TD pass to WR Joey Galloway. In the second quarter, Arizona continued to struggle as Tampa Bay kicker Matt Bryant nailed a 32-yard field goal for the only score of the period.|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, when Rogers guest-starred in {{a season}} 4 episode of The Muppet Show, he {{performed}} this song with a Muppet character. Rogers is shown seated on a train with three muppets, one of them The Gambler (portrayed by Jerry Nelson). Rogers sings the opening verse, while Nelson sings most of [...] "The Gambler's" [...] dialog, then falls asleep just as Rogers concludes the song's story. After he dies, The Gambler's spirit rises from his Muppet body, singing backup and dances to the song's last two choruses, and lets a deck of <b>cards</b> <b>fly</b> from his hand before fading away.|$|R

6000|$|Dick halted {{beside the}} table. His heavy boot shot up, {{and with a}} crash the table split, and glasses, <b>cards,</b> chips <b>flew</b> everywhere. As they rattled down and the chairs of the dumfounded players began to slide Dick called out: [...] "My name is Gale. I'm looking for Mr. Radford Chase." ...|$|R

5000|$|Mirko Vosk (Dimir): A Vampire who's {{especially}} {{skilled at}} finding secrets and exploiting his enemies' weaknesses, he's the perfect {{choice for the}} Dimir. His 2/4 <b>card</b> with <b>Flying</b> gives [...] "Milling" [...] players a distinct advantage: Whenever he deals combat damage, the player he targeted mills cards from his deck until they've milled four lands.|$|R
50|$|The Garuda Executive Lounge {{is open to}} {{passengers}} travelling in Executive Class, as well {{as those}} holding a Gold or Platinum Garuda Frequent <b>Flyer</b> <b>card.</b> Starting in 2011, passengers with an Executive Card Plus card or Garuda Indonesia Citibank credit card can no longer gain access to the lounge. Lounges are located at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and throughout Indonesia, offering food and drinks, wireless internet, showers, meeting rooms and business services.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} deal, {{both the}} Pilot and Flying J chains will keep their identities intact, while both chains started {{accepting}} the Comdata and Flying J's in-house TCH fuel <b>cards.</b> In addition, <b>Flying</b> J received cash and equity in the new combined chain. Flying J's oil & refining operations {{as well as its}} banking & insurance division will remain separate from the new company, and was subsequently renamed FJ Management Inc.|$|R
50|$|Test pilot {{training}} {{was nearly as}} informal as the selection process with most material directed toward the aeronautical engineers who supervised the tests. Reports and texts of this time provided little guidance regarding how tests should be flown. The best training for test pilots came from practical experience gained while flying as observers and hangar-talk tutorials from other pilots. A test pilot was not {{expected to have a}} formal engineering background. He was simply to follow the instructions on the test <b>card</b> and <b>fly</b> the airplane appropriately. Setting the standard to overcome this condition were test pilots such as Jimmy Doolittle. While at McCook Field, Doolittle served as a test pilot but was given leave to earn both master of science and doctoral degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Today, most test pilots have advanced degrees in engineering.|$|R
50|$|In June 1988, Barrymore confronted {{her mother}} Jaid after {{an evening of}} heavy drinking. She began {{breaking}} glass objects until Jaid left. Shortly thereafter, a friend of Barrymore's and the friend's mother entered the house and whisked her into a waiting car. They took her to ASAP, a Van Nuys rehabilitation clinic, where she remained for twelve days. Barrymore returned to Los Angeles and continued her therapy. Six days later, she boarded a plane for New York to audition for a play. Her stay in New York proved to be her downfall, as she found that cocaine was easily available in nightclubs. One day later, she stole Jaid's credit <b>card</b> and <b>flew</b> with a friend back to Los Angeles, bought more cocaine, and went on an unauthorized shopping spree. Barrymore was quickly taken back to ASAP by private agents who were hired by Jaid.|$|R
50|$|Examples: Air France {{has issued}} smart cards to {{frequent}} flyers on its routes from Paris Orly to Marseille and Toulouse. The card is a contact-less smart card using the Mifare radio frequency technology, {{similar to the}} Lufthansa card. Gemplus supplied the cards. The card {{has been used as}} passenger identification, the ticket and boarding authority. ANA and Japan Airlines integrate smart cards into their frequent <b>flyer</b> <b>cards,</b> Mifare also offers integration with mobile phones that support it, for the same purpose on a far wider selection of domestic routes in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|The Touch 'n Go {{facility}} was also embedded in Buy N <b>Fly</b> loyalty <b>card</b> rewards program for Malaysia Airlines retail arm, Golden Boutiques Sdn Bhd's which {{was launched in}} December 1999. The hybrid cards have multi function on rewards airpoint, MEPS Cash & Touch 'n Go. However, on July 16, 2002, Malaysia Airlines announced that [...] "Buy N Fly" [...] Programme had ceased operations and consolidated its loyalty rewards into one entity; Malaysia Airlines Enrich Frequent Flyer Programme. Buy N <b>Fly</b> <b>cards</b> are no longer issued but active hybrid card users are still able {{to use them to}} perform transactions.|$|R
5000|$|The POWs organise {{themselves}} into teams. Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley is [...] "the scrounger" [...] who finds needed materials, from a camera to clothes and identity <b>cards.</b> Australian <b>Flying</b> Officer Louis Sedgwick, [...] "the manufacturer," [...] makes tools like picks for digging and bellows for pumping {{air into the}} tunnels. Flight Lieutenants Danny Valinski and William [...] "Willie" [...] Dickes are [...] "the tunnel kings" [...] {{in charge of the}} digging. Flight Lieutenant Andrew MacDonald acts as intelligence provider and Bartlett's second-in-command. Lieutenant Commander Eric Ashley-Pitt of the Royal Navy devises a method of spreading soil from the tunnels over the camp, under the guards' noses. Flight Lieutenant Griffith acts as [...] "the tailor", creating civilian outfits from scavenged cloth. Forgery is handled by Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe, who becomes nearly blind due to progressive myopia caused by intricate work by candlelight; Hendley takes it upon himself to be Blythe's guide in the escape. The prisoners work on three tunnels simultaneously, calling them [...] "Tom", [...] "Dick", and [...] "Harry".|$|R
5000|$|The {{participants}} {{arrive at}} the deck during free time. Conan sees the boy from before, who is called [...] "Yuki-kun" [...] by a man nearby. Conan wonders if the man is Yuki's father, and finds it suspicious that he didn't notice the shock, and wouldn't show himself until after the free time had started. He decides to follow the two, only to be stopped by Kogoro. Conan then notices the female SDF member, Nanami Fuji, who's also on the deck at the time. Conan borrows Mitsuhiko's camera and begs Nanami to take a group photo with them, attempting to get a close-up shot of her. When asked about her specific work on the ship, Nanami answers that she only cooks everyone's meal, a lie that Conan can easily perceive due to her captain-ranked insignia. Before Nanami leaves, Kogoro reaches {{for one of his}} flashy business card as he wants to hand it to her himself. Unfortunately, the detective's clumsiness causes the <b>cards</b> to <b>fly</b> all around them. They have to pick the cards up and give them to Ran.|$|R
5000|$|Macha {{puts out}} {{an order for}} a hit on Jake. Jake arrives home, without Billy, to be welcomed by one of Macha's hits. However, on his {{doorstep}} there is another card, which says [...] "Pick This Up". As Jake bends to retrieve the <b>card</b> bullets <b>fly</b> over his back. As the shooting continues, the same mysterious individual called Zach (Vincent Pastore) arrives and rescues Jake who {{is the only person}} to survive the hit. Zach introduces Jake to his partner, Avi (André Benjamin). They offer him a deal: they will take all of his money and he will do what they say, no questions asked. In exchange, they will protect Jake from Macha. In the course of their proposal, they show Jake his medical file, which they have mysteriously obtained. It indicates that the blackout occurred due to a rare blood disease which will cause his death within three days. Jake suspects a con. The mysterious men later reveal that his money will be used to fund their loan shark enterprise.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of the US and the State Department gathering intelligence on the UN was not new. Former UN diplomats commented that UN officials already work {{under the assumption that}} they are spied on and are used to getting around it, but the surprise in this case was that it was done by other diplomats rather than intelligence agencies. The Guardian wrote that the directive [...] "appears to blur the line between diplomacy and spying". Another surprise was the specific types of information being asked for, including the biometric information and credit <b>card</b> and frequent <b>flyer</b> numbers, which went beyond past practice and {{was not the kind of}} information diplomats would normally be expected to gather.|$|R
50|$|From June 2009, Everyday Rewards cardholders {{were able}} to earn Qantas Frequent Flyer points, by using their Everyday Rewards cards. Cardholders who had {{successfully}} linked their Frequent <b>Flyer</b> <b>card</b> to their registered Everyday Rewards card can earn one Frequent Flyer point for every dollar over $30 that they spent in store. In August 2009, Woolworths announced that there were 3.8 million cards registered, of which 1.2 million were linked to a Qantas Frequent Flyer account. On 26 October 2015 Woolworths announced that, from 1 January 2016, customer loyalty cards would no longer earn Qantas Frequent Flyer points. Instead they will receive more discounts on groceries. The new discount program came into effect on 28 October 2015. Everyday Rewards cardholders will be sent 'Woolworths Rewards' cards.|$|R
25|$|In July 2009, a {{confidential}} cable originating from the United States Department of State, and under United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's name, ordered US diplomats {{to spy on}} Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and other top UN officials. The intelligence information the diplomats were ordered to gather included biometric information (which apparently included DNA, fingerprints, and iris scans), passwords, and personal encryption keys used in private and commercial networks for official communications. It also included Internet and intranet usernames, e-mail addresses, web site URLs useful for identification, credit <b>card</b> numbers, frequent <b>flyer</b> account numbers, and work schedules. The targeted human intelligence was requested in {{a process known as}} the National Humint Collection Directive, and was aimed at foreign diplomats of US allies as well.|$|R
5000|$|An {{unsigned}} {{review in}} The Boston Globe explains, [...] "To {{make his point}} clear, Kenner follows up Swiss’s magic act and fancy patter with a snappy montage of various experts over the years denying that cigarettes cause cancer, or extolling the virtues of pesticide, or proclaiming that asbestos is “designed to last a lifetime — a trouble free lifetime.” And then the inevitable parade of climate change deniers bloviating in Congress or on cable news, all backed by Sinatra singing “That Old Black Magic.”" [...] A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times that Swiss' [...] "presence, and the animated playing <b>cards</b> that sometimes <b>fly</b> across the screen, feel like a glib and somewhat condescending gimmick, an attempt to wring some fun out of a grim and appalling story." ...|$|R
50|$|Members {{can earn}} one point {{for every dollar}} spent (some {{exclusions}} apply - see woolworthsrewards.com.au for full details) at participating Woolworths supermarkets, Woolworths online, BWS and selected Caltex Woolworths fuel outlets. Once members reach 2000 points they will automatically get $10 off a future shop. Members can also choose to bank their savings for Christmas. If a member has a Qantas Frequent <b>Flyer</b> <b>card</b> added to their Woolworths Rewards account they can then choose to convert their savings to Qantas Points. In addition, shoppers (not necessarily Woolworths Rewards members) who spend more than $30 in one transaction at a Woolworths supermarket are entitled to fuel discounts, which must be redeemed within 28 days at Caltex Woolworths/Safeway outlets. This entitlement can be stored electronically and accessed by presentation of the Rewards card, dispensing {{with the need for}} shoppers to retain paper coupons, which are still produced if a Rewards card is not presented. Woolworths also offers in-store discounts to customers with a Woolworths Rewards card.|$|R
