30|$|<b>The</b> <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> tweets {{propagated}} through Twitter {{has been}} analyzed in [17]. The authors have used automated methods to assess <b>the</b> <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> tweets related to trending topics. The features {{used by the}} authors include the re-tweeting behaviour, texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posts and links to external sources. The authors used supervised learning techniques to build a classifier to estimate <b>the</b> <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> tweets. <b>The</b> types <b>of</b> features used to characterize each tweet were of four types: message based features, user based features, topic based features and propagation based features. Use of message features included length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> message, positive or negative sentiments, presence of question marks or exclamation marks, and also <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> hashtags and retweets. User based features included number of followers and followees, number of past tweets etc. Topic based features were derived from user based and message based features to include fraction of tweets that contained hashtags, URLs and positive and negative sentiments. The propagation based features included <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retweet tree and number of initial tweets of a topic. Best results of automatic classification of tweets were achieved using J 48 learning algorithm. Sentiment features {{were found to be}} very relevant for predicting <b>the</b> <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> tweets. <b>The</b> fraction <b>of</b> tweets with negative tweets was found to be more credible as well as tweets with greater number <b>of</b> retweets. <b>The</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twitter community to act as social filter of credible information has been clearly brought out in the paper. Credible users with large number of followers and followees along with large tweet activity have better reputation score and tend to propagate credible news. While validating the best features to be used for automatic determination <b>of</b> <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> tweets, <b>the</b> propagation based features were ranked the best. The text and author based features alone are not sufficient to determine <b>the</b> <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> tweets. <b>The</b> <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> tweets increases when propagated through authors who have a higher reputation score, having written a large number of tweets before, originate at a single or few users in the network and have many retweets.|$|R

5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization was somewhat weakened {{by the fact that}} the United States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it after the end of the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E

5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time {{was a lack of}} standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E

They invaded and pillaged the Báthorys' estates at Fejérd (Feiurdeni). They also {{captured}} and beheaded many noblemen before attacking the abbey and forcing the abbot to flee. A group of rebels took possession of Nagyenyed {{with the assistance of}} its poor burghers and the inhabitants of the nearby villages. Most burghers of Kolozsvár also sympathized with the rebels, who thus entered the town without resistance.

5|$|Marwan's 737 {{expedition}} was {{the climax}} of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare, any recognition of Islam or of Arab supremacy by the khagan was evidently conditional upon the presence of Arab troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long. Furthermore, the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conversion of the khagan to Islam is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably reflects closer the original sources, suggests that it was not the khagan but a minor lord who converted to Islam and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz. The conversion of the khagan is also apparently contradicted by the fact that c. 740 the Khazar court embraced Judaism as its official faith, a decision which clearly owed a great deal to the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence from the Christian Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.|$|E

5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax.

5|$|NATO {{was little}} more than a {{political}} association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the <b>credibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999.
