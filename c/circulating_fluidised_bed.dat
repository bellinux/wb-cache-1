An electrostatic sensing system and two accelerometers are {{installed on the}} riser of a CFB test rig to collect signals simultaneously. Cross correlation, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), V-statistic analysis, and wavelet transform are applied for signal identification and cluster characterisation near the wall. Solids velocities are obtained through cross correlation. Non-stationary and non-linear characteristics are distinctly exhibited in the Hilbert spectra of the electrostatic and vibration signals, and the cluster dynamic behaviours are represented by the energy distributions of the signal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The cycle feature and main cycle frequency of cluster motion are characterised through V-statistic analysis of the vibration signals. Consistent characteristic information about particle clusters is extracted from the electrostatic and vibration signals. Furthermore, a cluster identification criterion for electrostatic signals is proposed, including a fixed and a wavelet dynamic thresholds, based on which the cluster time fraction, average cluster duration time, cluster frequency, and average cluster vertical size are quantified. Especially, the cluster frequency obtained from this criterion agrees well with that from the aforementioned V-statistic analysis.

40|$|Standpipes are {{commonly}} used in <b>circulating</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> (CFB) to gravitationally transport solids from a region of lower pressure {{at the apex of}} the cyclone to the higher pressure region of the riser, Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) is applied to observe and study the real-time particle motion in standpipes of 2. 5 cm and 4. 5 cm ID respectively. Experiments use a hopper connected {{to the top of the}} standpipe while the base is connected to a free-discharging L-valve. PEPT results confirm that the solids velocity profile is asymmetrical along the vertical axis of the standpipe at any given height, The average voidage of the standpipe, epsilon(a) and solids flow rate, Q(s) are dependent upon the discharge rate of the L-valve, expressed by its fractional opening, f. An empirical equation to predict epsilon(a) has been derived: epsilon(a) /D- 0. 4 = 2. 25 (C-d/C-ds) (- 0. 2). The drag force on an individual solid particle can then be calculated and determines the actual motion of solids. Upward solids motion will be detected when the drag force exceeds the particle weight, whereas the motion will be downward with some degree of particle acceleration if the particle weight exceeds the drag force. The use of the design equations is finally illustrated in assessing the operation of standpipes of different diameter. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Circulating</b> <b>Fluidised</b> <b>Beds</b> (CFBs) {{are widely}} {{applied in the}} process industry, for mostly gas-solid and gas-catalytic reactions. The riser is the key {{component}} of the CFB being the process reactor. The important design parameters are the operating gas velocity (U) and the solids concentration flux (G). The CFB operation starts at moderate to high superficial gas velocities. Its voidage exceeds ∼ 0. 9 and {{is a function of}} the solids circulation flux. Different flow modes have been presented in literature, and result in an operation diagram where G and U delineate specific operations, from dilute riser flow, through core-annulus flow, to dense riser upflow (mostly at any U, G exceeding 80 to 120 kg m- 2 s- 1). Increasing G whilst maintaining the gas velocity will cause an increase in suspension concentration. The riser flow can hence be characterized by its apparent voidage, ɛ. In the core-annulus operation, clusters of particles reflux near the wall, thus influencing the local radial voidage in the cross section of the riser, and also extending over a given distance, δ, from the wall to the core. Through measurements in CFBs of 0. 1 and 0. 14 m I. D., the research has been able to determine the average axial and radial voidages of the dense phase within the different regimes, whilst also determining the thickness of the annulus (in CAF-mode).

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the current status}} of utilisation of low quality coals worldwide. The largest market for low quality coals is power generation. Power generation using low quality coals is dominated by Pulverised Coal Combustion (PCC) plants. Although the majority of PCC plants uses subcritical technologies, a number of new plants have adopted supercritical steam conditions at large scale. Germany currently leads the way in developing high efficiency large-scale supercritical PCC technology for low rank coals. China and the USA are also developing supercritical PCC technology rapidly for low rank coals. <b>Circulated</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> combustion (CFBC) is, by the nature of its design, very suitable for burning low quality coals for power generation or cogeneration. This technology has been chosen for several repowering projects in Poland and the USA. China now has the largest number of CFBC units, and the 300 MW class CFBC has been rapidly deployed in that country. There is very limited experience with IGCC fuelled by low rank coals, and the major challenges are to increase the plant availability and to lower the capital and operating costs. Coal-to-liquids (CTL) emerges as an important sector in recent years due to concerns revolving security of energy supply and high oil/gas price volatilities. Currently, South Africa has the greatest experience with indirect CTL, while China is rapidly increasing its knowledge base through its large-scale demonstration projects of both direct and indirect CTL. There is also significant interest in CTL in Australia, Indonesia, Japan and the USA. Underground coal gasification (UCG) has the potential for tapping into large, otherwise inaccessible, coal reserves. Australia and South Africa lead the way in developing advanced UGC technologies that build on developments in directional drilling and computer drilling. Drying, cleaning and upgrading of low rank coals are of great importance for increasing the use of low rank coals, as these make the coals cleaner, safer for transport and storage, and more valuable as an exportable fuel. To this end, a number of high efficiency processes are under development i...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Oxy-fuel {{combustion}}, {{which refers}} to the combustion of coal {{in the presence of}} oxygen rather than air, {{is one of the key}} technology options among the portfolio of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Oxy-fuel combustion captures carbon dioxide in-situ, producing a CO 2 -enriched flue gas stream (95 vol% CO 2) ready for storage. The main shortcoming of the oxy-fuel combustion, however, is the high cost and energy intensity of its oxygen plant. At present, the main technology option for the oxygen plant is cryogenic air separation which typically consumes about 20 % of the total electricity produced in oxy-firing mode and, thus significantly reduces the thermal efficiency of the oxy-fuel power plant. The oxygen plant also accounts for 30 % of the total capital investment. In view of the above, a comprehensive program of study on alternative air separation technology - chemical looping air separation (CLAS), which offers a cost effective method for large-scale oxygen production, has been systematically conducted in the current study. The present study aims to identify and characterise the suitable metal oxide oxygen carriers for CLAS applications. The broad objectives of the project have been achieved using a combined theoretical and experimental approach. A comprehensive review of the current state of oxygen carrier developments and utilisation was carried out. Other emerging air separation methods have also been reviewed in detail as part of this literature review. A thermodynamic method of identifying the feasible metal oxide oxygen carriers for high temperature air separation was developed in the present study. The energy cost associated with oxygen production using CLAS and its comparison with an advanced cryogenic air separation unit has been investigated in detail. The reaction mechanisms, underpinning the oxidation and oxygen release processes under conditions pertinent to CLAS, were also determined as one of the main objectives for the current study. The relevant experiments have been carried out using a variety of experimental setups, including thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), packed-bed, and interconnected <b>circulating</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> (ICFB) system. Numerous oxides of metal elements from the periodic table were systematically investigated as potential oxygen carrier candidates for CLAS based on a thermodynamic approach in the current study. The majority of the metal oxides exhibit the capability of releasing oxygen. However, most of them cannot be used in CLAS considering the oxygen equilibrium partial pressure (EPP) lower than 0. 015, which may increase the use of sweep gas during the oxygen releasing process and correspondingly the energy consumption. Moreover, the likely carbonation and formation of hydrides on exposure to CO 2 /steam enriched conditions for metal oxides, such as the Ca and Na-based oxides, limit their application in the preparation of oxygen carriers. Only Mn 3 O 4 /Mn 2 O 3, CoO/Co 3 O 4, and Cu 2 O/CuO are found to be the most suitable oxidation pairs to transport oxygen in CLAS process. Furthermore, a special case for the integration of CLAS with oxy-fuel power plant, i. e., the direct use of clean CO 2 flue gas as the sweep media during oxygen release for CLAS, was used for the operation optimisation based on these three systems. Results have shown CLAS has significant lower energy consumption for oxygen production, compared to the advanced cryogenic air separation. Furthermore, oxygen carriers of Mn-, Co-, and Cu-based metal oxides with Al 2 O 3 or SiO 2 as a support were prepared by the dry impregnation method with an exception of the spray dried CuO/MgAl 2 O 4. The reactivity of these prepared oxygen carriers was determined through TGA in the temperature range of 800 - 950 oC. Among these studies, CuO/SiO 2 and Co 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 exhibit a very fast reaction rate in both oxidation and reduction processes. Co 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 has shown a higher rate of oxygen transport (ROT) for the oxygen release than CuO/SiO 2 at the same temperature, but a lower ROT of oxidation. It was also noted that the Mn and Co-based oxygen carriers on both Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 have thermodynamic limitations in high temperature oxidation under air. The CuO/MgAl 2 O 4 carrier was found to have a very stable performance and the highest oxygen transport capacity (OTC), however, very low mechanical strength after test, less than 0. 8 N. Oxygen content attaining the equilibrium partial pressure was achieved from CuO/SiO 2 and CuO/MgAl 2 O 4 in a packed bed reactor at the temperature of 800, 850, 900, and 950 oC. The reduction and oxidation kinetics were determined for CuO/SiO 2 and CuO/MgAl 2 O 4. Avrami-Erofe'ev random nucleation and subsequence growth (A 2) and phase boundary reaction (R 2) mechanisms were found to fit the experimental results very well for both of these two oxygen carriers. In response to the sinter issue of the mono-metallic CuO/SiO 2 oxygen carriers, attempts were made to add promoters to CuO/SiO 2 including MgO, Fe 2 O 3, NiO, Mn 2 O 3, and Co 3 O 4. The results indicated that the agglomeration of CuO can be supressed via the proper addition of secondary metal oxides, such as MgO, Fe 2 O 3, NiO, and Co 3 O 4. The best improvement was achieved by MgO with the added weight no less than 20. 4 wt%. In addition, an interconnected <b>circulating</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>beds</b> (ICFB) system was designed, built, and operated for CLAS.

50|$|The initial {{reactors}} from Kellogg and Lurgi gasifiers were tricky {{and expensive}} to operate. The original reactor design in 1955 was a <b>circulating</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> reactor (CFBR) with {{a capacity of}} about 1,500 barrels per day. Sasol improved these reactors to eventually yield about 6,500 barrels per day. The CFBR design involves moving the whole catalyst bed around the reactor which is energy intensive and not efficient {{as most of the}} catalyst is not in the reaction zone. Sasol then developed fixed fluidized bed (FFB) reactors in which the catalyst particles were held in a fixed reaction zone. This resulted in a significant increase in reactor capacities. For example, the first FFB reactors commercialised in 1990 (5 m diameter) had a capacity of about 3,000 barrels per day, while the design in 2,000 (10.7m diameter) had a capacity of 20,000 barrels per day.
