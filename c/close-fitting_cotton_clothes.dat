40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of clothing on dermal uptake of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), we measured uptake of selected airborne phthalates for an individual wearing clean clothes or air-exposed clothes and compared these results with dermal uptake for bare-skinned individuals under otherwise identical experimental conditions. Using a breathing hood to isolate dermal from inhalation uptake, we measured urinary metabolites of diethylphthalate (DEP) and di-n-butylphthalate (DnBP) from an individual exposed to known concentrations of these compounds for 6 [*]h in an experimental chamber. The individual wore either clean (fresh) <b>cotton</b> <b>clothes</b> or <b>cotton</b> <b>clothes</b> that {{had been exposed to}} the same chamber air concentrations for 9 days. For a 6 -h exposure, the net amounts of DEP and DnBP absorbed when wearing fresh clothes were, respectively, 0. 017 and 0. 007 [*]μg/kg/(μg/m 3); for exposed clothes the results were 0. 178 and 0. 261 [*]μg/kg/(μg/m 3), respectively (values normalized by air concentration and body mass). When compared against the average results for bare-skinned participants, clean clothes were protective, whereas exposed clothes increased dermal uptake for DEP and DnBP by factors of 3. 3 and 6. 5, respectively. Even for non-occupational environments, wearing clothing that has adsorbed/absorbed indoor air pollutants can increase dermal uptake of SVOCs by substantial amounts relative to bare skin...|$|R

These people occupied areas covering parts of north eastern Botswana, western and southern Zimbabwe, adjacent parts of South Africa and Mozambique by around AD 1000.

40|$|By {{studying}} on {{the little}} cotton textures from relics excavation, {{there is not a}} clear answer to when the China cotton planting started. Although Qiru area was the north weaving center, there were not so much unearthed fabrics. “The lion rolling ball” parcel cloth of Qing Dynasty is one of the seldom printed cottons. It contains rich culture, life custom and the information of weaving technology with cotton in the Qilu region. From the view of history, this paper analyzes the pattern model, fiber material, weaving technology of “The lion rolling ball” parcel cloth of Qing Dynasty. By comparing it with modern Lu brocade using empirical analysis method, we found that the yarns in fabric is cotton, one of ancient Asia cottons, which showed “The lion rolling ball” parcel cloth of Qing Dynasty {{played an important role in}} the history of <b>cotton</b> <b>clothes...</b>|$|R

Evaporative resistance of five clothing ensembles (<b>cotton</b> work <b>clothes,</b> <b>cotton</b> coveralls, and three coveralls of particle barrier, liquid barrier and vapor barrier properties) was determined empirically from wear tests during two study phases.

Study about fastness tests of dyed clothes was undertaken. The relative colour strength of the dye was determined in terms of K/S value with respect to autoclaved and non-autoclaved extract.
