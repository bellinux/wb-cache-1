5|$|The {{northern}} half of Belgium, {{which would}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Flanders, was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp, {{the city of}} Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along {{the valley of the}} Sambre and Meuse rivers – the sillon industriel ("industrial valley") – became the focus of industrialization. In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir ("Black Country"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes.|$|E

5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> science and technology studies.|$|E
5|$|Between September and November 1917, I Anzac Corps {{took part}} in a number of actions around Ypres in Belgium as the Allies {{launched}} a campaign in order to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau in Belgium. Collectively these actions have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Third Battle of Ypres, of which they were a part, although to Australians they are more commonly known by the names of the places where the individual actions took place—Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Shield nickel.|$|E

5|$|The old-style typefaces of Garamond and {{his contemporaries}} and successors {{remained}} {{in use in}} printing for over two hundred years after Garamond's death, and became influential on Dutch printing during the period known as Dutch golden age, when Dutch printing was itself very influential across Europe. Dutch and German printers and punchcutters, however, often favoured more solid, darker designs than Garamond's, which would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the “Dutch taste” (“Goût Hollandois”) style.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, {{all well and good}} for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|By 1336, the Sultan had {{conquered the}} Pandyas of Madurai, the Kakatiyas of Warangal {{and the tiny}} kingdom of Kampili. The Hoysalas were the only {{remaining}} Hindu empire who resisted the invading armies. Veera Ballala III stationed himself at Tiruvannamalai and offered stiff resistance to invasions {{from the north and}} the Madurai Sultanate to the south. Then, after nearly three decades of resistance, Veera Ballala III was killed at the battle of Madurai in 1343, and the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire were merged with the areas administered by Harihara I in the Tungabhadra River region. This new Hindu kingdom resisted the northern invasions and would later prosper and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Vijayanagara Empire.|$|E

5|$|By {{the nineteenth}} century, Jannon's {{matrices}} had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the Caractères de l'Université (Characters of the University). It {{has sometimes been}} claimed that this term was an official name designated for the Jannon type by Cardinal Richelieu, while Warde in 1926 more plausibly suggested {{it might be a}} garbled recollection of Jannon's work with the Sedan Academy, which operated much like a university despite not using the name. Carter in the 1970s followed this conclusion. Mosley, however, concludes that no report of the term (or much use of Jannon's matrices at all) exists before the nineteenth century, and it may originate from a generic term of the eighteenth century simply meaning older or more conservative typeface designs, perhaps those preferred in academic publishing.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him {{to believe that he}} was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> the High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, {{and the use of}} polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E

5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures that would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Kepler's solids. From there, {{he extended his}} harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and {{in the case of}} astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the earliest fragmentary remains that will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Deinosuchus, it was found that it was a relative of crocodiles, going as far as placing it in the same family (crocodylidae) in 1954, this assignment was mostly supported by dental features but was overturned in 1999 when the finding of new specimens from Texas and Georgia helped place Deinosuchus in a phylogenetic analysis, finding it in a basal position within the clade Alligatoroidea along with Leidyosuchus. This classification was bolstered in 2005 by {{the discovery}} of a well-preserved Deinosuchus brain case from the Blufftown Formation of Alabama, which shows some features reminiscent of those in the modern American alligator, Deinosuchus however, was not a direct ancestor of modern alligators.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{which would}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> Brazil was claimed by Portugal on 22 April 1500, when the navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on its coast. Permanent settlement followed in 1532, {{and for the}} next 300 years the Portuguese slowly expanded westwards until they had reached nearly all of the borders of modern Brazil. In 1808, the army of French Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, forcing the Portuguese royal family—the House of Braganza, a branch of the thousand-year-old Capetian dynasty—into exile. They re-established themselves in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, which became the unofficial seat of the Portuguese Empire.|$|E
