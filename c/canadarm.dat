5|$|Overall, {{the crew}} {{successfully}} completed all fifty-four {{of the planned}} mission test objectives. While the INSAT deployment was a success, the satellite had problems unfolding its solar array once in geostationary orbit, and was not fully operational {{until the middle of}} September. Once functional, however, it provided satisfactory service for seven years, returning 36,000 images of Earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote Indian villages. The Payload Flight Test Article evaluation found that the <b>Canadarm</b> remote manipulator system was capable of moving bulky masses with some accuracy, to a precision of 5cm and one degree of alignment.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} and fourth days (September 1 and 2, 1983), work began with the <b>Canadarm</b> Remote Manipulator System and the payload test article, and {{communications}} testing through TDRS continued. The former was successful, but the latter lost contact on a number of occasions, due to problems at the White Sands ground station. As a result, the crew had to be awakened early on September 1 {{in order to deal with}} the problem. A minor cabin pressure leak on September 2 was traced to the waste management system, and quickly controlled. The orbiter performed an Orbital Maneuvering System firing on September 2 to place itself in a lower orbit, where the air density was higher and the oxygen interaction experiments would work more effectively.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station. The mission was originally planned for mid-January, but was delayed due to NASA's concerns about some cables on the shuttles. This mission brought the U.S. built Destiny laboratory, {{which has a}} mass of 16 short tons. It was installed {{with the use of}} the shuttle's robotic <b>Canadarm,</b> controlled by Marsha Ivins. Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems. While the Shuttle was docked, the control of the station's orientation was switched from propellants to electrically powered gyroscopes, which had been installed in September 2000. The gyroscopes had not been used earlier due to the lack of key navigational electronics.|$|E
50|$|On November 13, 2012, Google Canada {{displayed}} a doodle on its home search page {{to celebrate the}} 31st anniversary of the <b>Canadarm's</b> first use in space.|$|R
50|$|On Flight Day 4, Bob Cabana fired Endeavour’s rockets {{several times}} to {{maneuver}} the shuttle within <b>Canadarm’s</b> reach of the Zarya FGB. At 6:47 pm EST, Currie grappled Zarya. Later, at 9:07 pm EST, Cabana fired Endeavour’s downward jets to bring the two modules together.|$|R
5|$|The Canadian Space Agency {{operates}} a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, and developing rockets and satellites. Canada {{was the third}} country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch. Canada is {{a participant in the}} International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the <b>Canadarm,</b> Canadarm2 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle. Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS and MOST. Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant; over 1,000 Black Brants have been launched since the rocket's introduction in 1961. In 1984, Marc Garneau became Canada's first male astronaut, followed by Canada's second and first female astronaut Roberta Bondar in 1992.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its astronauts and satellites, {{some of the most}} notable Canadian technological contributions to space exploration include the <b>Canadarm</b> on the Space Shuttle, as well as the Canadarm2 {{and the rest of the}} Mobile Servicing System on the International Space Station. The <b>Canadarm</b> and Canadarm2 employ the Advanced Space Vision System which allows more efficient use of the robotic arms. Another Canadian technology of note is the Orbiter Boom Sensor System, which is an extension of the <b>Canadarm</b> used to inspect the Space Shuttle's thermal protection system for damage while in orbit.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Lights $20 Silver Coin was {{the first}} RCM {{hologram}} coin to feature a hologram without a raised border and, therefore, no delineation. The hologram merges with the engraved relief of the mountains. In 2006, the $30 <b>Canadarm</b> coin {{was the first}} Canadian coin to be completely sculpted using computer software. Technically, it was a complex design to render, due to the depiction of the closed glass visor and the complicated features of the <b>Canadarm.</b>|$|E
25|$|Once on orbit, {{the crew}} of STS-133 opened the payload bay doors and {{activated}} the Ku band antenna for high-speed communications with Mission Control. While the Ku band antenna was being activated, Alvin Drew and Pilot Eric Boe activated the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), {{also known as the}} <b>Canadarm.</b> Later in the day, imagery of the External Tank during launch was downlinked for analysis.|$|E
25|$|For the Space Shuttle program, Lind was reassigned as a Mission Specialist {{along with}} McCandless (who, unlike Lind, {{continued}} to train {{as a potential}} Space Shuttle orbiter pilot until 1983) and the remaining Apollo-era scientist-astronauts. During this period, {{he was a member}} of the Astronaut Office's Operations Missions development group, responsible for developing payloads for the early Space Shuttle Orbital Flight Test (OFT) missions and the <b>Canadarm.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1957, A.V. Roe Canada Ltd. {{acquired}} PSC Applied Research Ltd., {{a manufacturer}} of flight navigation computers, and renamed it Canadian Applied Research, Ltd.. It was later divested by Hawker Siddeley Canada and merged with de Havilland Canada’s Special Products division to form SPAR Aerospace Ltd. (Special Products and Applied Research), developer of the <b>Canadarm</b> remote manipulator system for the Space Shuttle. It is today a part of MacDonald Dettwiler as MD Robotics, a subsidiary of its MDA Space Missions division.|$|E
25|$|The seven person crew of STS-131 {{was awakened}} {{to begin their}} first full day in space on Flight Day 2. Due {{to the lack of}} Ku-band communication, changes to the crews daily plan were read up for them to write out. After their post sleep activities, {{commander}} Alan Poindexter and pilot Jim Dutton fired Discoverys Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines to correct and further refine the shuttle's path to the ISS. Astronauts Naoko Yamazaki and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger began activating and checking out the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) also known as the <b>Canadarm.</b> While Metcalf-Lindenburger and Yamazaki were working with <b>Canadarm,</b> Stephanie Wilson was getting equipment together and set up to record the inspections of the shuttle's heat shield. The inspections were recorded so they could be downlinked to the ground once docked to the ISS. Once all that work was done, commander Poindexter and pilot Dutton joined Metcalf-Lindenburger, Yamazaki, and Wilson to conduct the inspection of the shuttle's heat shield. While the inspection was going on, Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson were on the mid-deck of Discovery checking out the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) and getting them ready for their three spacewalks. The last portion of the crew day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools used during rendezvous.|$|E
25|$|The Meteorological Station (MET) {{recorded}} the daily weather of Mars {{during the course}} of the Phoenix mission. It is equipped with a wind indicator and pressure and temperature sensors. The MET also contains a LIDAR (light detection and ranging) device for sampling the number of dust particles in the air. It was designed in Canada by Optech and MDA, supported by the Canadian Space Agency. A team headed by York University oversaw the science operations of the station. The York University team includes contributions from the University of Alberta, University of Aarhus (Denmark), Dalhousie University, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Optech, and the Geological Survey of Canada. <b>Canadarm</b> maker MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) of Richmond, B.C. built the MET.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 2, {{the crew}} of Endeavour {{completed}} several tasks {{in preparation for the}} docking on flight day 3. The first and most important of these tasks was surveying the shuttle's Thermal Protection System (TPS). The Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was used to survey the wing leading edge and nose cone. The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS, or <b>Canadarm</b> 1) was also used to look at the thermal tiles and blankets on and around the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods. After the survey was complete, the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3 was grappled by the SRMS. While the survey was conducted by Greg Johnson and mission specialists Roberto Vittori and Greg Chamitoff, {{the rest of the crew}} prepared the orbiter for docking. This included installing tools such as a center-line camera in the Orbiter Docking System, along with various other sensors used to gauge distance and speed. Kelly and mission specialists Mike Fincke and Drew Feustel furthermore checked out the two spacesuits carried on Endeavour, in preparation for the mission's four planned spacewalks.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 6, {{the members}} of Endeavours crew {{performed}} a focused inspection of an area of thermal protection tiles {{on the bottom of}} the orbiter. The tiles were damaged during launch, and detailed data provided by the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) was needed to make sure the orbiter could re-enter Earth's atmosphere safely. The focused inspection started with the Canadarm2 grappling the OBSS in the middle of the boom and handing it off to the shuttle's <b>Canadarm,</b> which was controlled by pilot Greg Johnson and mission specialists Mike Fincke and Roberto Vittori. The inspection process took approximately two hours to complete, and resulted in the Thermal Protection System (TPS) being cleared for entry. After the inspection was complete, Fincke joined Drew Feustel to get their spacesuits ready for the second spacewalk of the mission on flight day 7. The pair performed the standard overnight campout procedure to get ready for the EVA. Later in the crew day, the STS-134 crew assembled with the Expedition 27 crew in the Kibo module. The joint crew spoke with Pope Benedict XVI, answering several questions asked by the Pope.|$|E
25|$|The STS-134 crew {{installed}} the AMS-2 on flight day 4. AMS-2 was lifted out of Endeavours payload bay using the <b>Canadarm,</b> operated by Drew Feustel and Roberto Vittori. It was handed off to Canadarm2, which was operated by Greg Chamitoff and Greg Johnson, and {{was installed in}} its final location on the S3 truss segment at 09:46 UTC. Immediately after the installation, crews on the ground began activating the experiment. The installation of the AMS-2 marked {{the completion of the}} US Orbital Segment of the International Space Station. Later in the day, Greg Chamitoff, Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke prepared the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) that Chamitoff and Feustel would wear during their spacewalk on flight day 5. The trio was also assisted by commander Mark Kelly in preparing the tools required for the Extravehicular Activity (EVA). While this was going on, Expedition 27 crew members Paolo Nespoli, Cady Coleman and Ron Garan assisted the rest of the STS-134 crew in completing transfers to and from Endeavour. Late in the crew day, the two crews performed an EVA procedures review. After the review, Chamitoff and Feustel camped out in the Quest Airlock overnight, in preparation for the mission's first spacewalk. The campout was done with the airlock's air pressure reduced, so as to purge nitrogen bubbles from the astronauts' blood and thus prevent decompression sickness. Members of both crews also conducted two in-flight interviews with media on the ground, including PBS NewsHour, National Public Radio, Associated Press, Reuters and Fox News. The crew also answered questions that were relayed up to them by Miles O'Brien for Google.|$|E
500|$|On {{the fifth}} day (September 3, 1983), testing of the <b>Canadarm</b> continued, {{including}} a number of optional [...] "shopping list" [...] tests, and the TDRS tests were carried out with more success. A live press conference was held late in the day, the first in-flight press conference since Apollo 17. On the sixth day (September 4, 1983), experiment runs were completed and the crew prepared to deorbit. Two systems failures were recorded on this last day, the most serious of which involved a synchronization failure {{in one of the}} onboard computers.|$|E
2500|$|George Klein, (1904–1992), {{often called}} [...] "the most {{productive}} inventor in Canada in the 20th century"; electric wheelchairs, microsurgical staple gun, the ZEEP nuclear reactor and the <b>Canadarm.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As {{a member}} of the [...] Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, Nash was {{instrumental}} in stopping the acquisition of MacDonald Dettwiler by U.S.-owned Alliant Techsystems. MacDonald Dettwiler is the Canadian space company which produced the <b>Canadarm</b> and RADARSAT-2 satellite, and impacts the issue of Canadian Arctic sovereignty. [...] Nash argued that the sale would have devastated the Canadian aerospace industry and eliminated Canadian control over a technology developed with the aid of millions of Canadian taxpayers' dollars.|$|E
2500|$|NASA {{investigators}} {{determined that}} on-orbit repair by the shuttle astronauts was possible but overall considered [...] "high risk", {{primarily due to}} the uncertain resiliency of the repair using available materials and the anticipated high risk of doing additional damage to the Orbiter. Columbia did not carry the <b>Canadarm,</b> or Remote Manipulator System, which would normally be used for camera inspection or transporting a spacewalking astronaut to the wing. Therefore, an unusual emergency extra-vehicular activity (EVA) would have been required. While there was no astronaut EVA training for maneuvering to the wing, astronauts are always prepared for a similarly difficult emergency EVA to close the external tank umbilical doors located on the orbiter underside, which is necessary for reentry. Similar methods could have reached the shuttle left wing for inspection or repair.|$|E
2500|$|Endeavour {{lifted off}} from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39 at 08:56 EDT on 16 May 2011. The launch of Endeavour came after an on-time tanking process which filled the shuttle's {{external}} tank {{with more than}} [...] of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen; the tanking started at 23:36 EDT on 15 May 2011. Once the shuttle and crew were on-orbit, they set about preparing the shuttle for the mission ahead. The first tasks they completed were opening the payload bay doors, activating the Ku-band antenna, and activating the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), {{also known as the}} <b>Canadarm.</b> Prior to this, commander Mark Kelly and pilot Greg Johnson completed an engine firing, known as the OMS-2 burn, to circularize the orbit of the shuttle. They also completed another engine firing, the NC-1 burn, to help the shuttle catch up to the International Space Station (ISS). After completing these initial tasks, the crew activated the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, allowing it to be monitored by teams on the ground. Later in the crew's work day, they downlinked video recordings that had been shot of the external tank by mission specialist Mike Fincke.|$|E
50|$|The basic <b>Canadarm</b> {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a manipulator arm, a <b>Canadarm</b> display and control panel, including rotational and translational hand controllers at the orbiter aft flight deck flight crew station, and a manipulator controller interface unit that interfaces with the orbiter computer. Most of the time, the arm operators see {{what they are doing}} by looking at the Advanced Space Vision System screen next to the controllers.One crew member operates the <b>Canadarm</b> from the aft flight deck control station, and a second crew member usually assists with television camera operations. This allows the <b>Canadarm</b> operator to view <b>Canadarm</b> operations through the aft flight deck payload and overhead windows and through the closed-circuit television monitors at the aft flight deck station.|$|E
50|$|Also at {{the museum}} is Space Shuttle Endeavours <b>Canadarm,</b> the space shuttles' Canadian-built robotic arm. It was {{unveiled}} on 2 May 2013 with Chris Hadfield on hand from the International Space Station via video screen to aid with the unveiling. While Endeavours <b>Canadarm,</b> officially known as <b>Canadarm</b> 201, was moved back to Canada, Atlantis's and Discovery's Canadarms went to the museums of their respective shuttles.|$|E
50|$|The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), {{also known}} as <b>Canadarm</b> (<b>Canadarm</b> 1), {{is a series of}} robotic arms that were used on the Space Shuttle orbiters to deploy, {{maneuver}} and capture payloads. After the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the <b>Canadarm</b> was always paired with the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), which was used to inspect the exterior of the Shuttle for damage to the thermal protection system.|$|E
50|$|A {{simulated}} <b>Canadarm</b> {{installed on}} the Space Shuttle Enterprise was seen when the prototype orbiters payload bay doors were open to test hangar facilities early in the shuttle program. The <b>Canadarm</b> was first tested in orbit in 1981, on Space Shuttle Columbias STS-2 mission. Its first operational use was on STS-3 to deploy and maneuver the Plasma Diagnostics Package. <b>Canadarm</b> has since flown on more than 90 missions with all five orbiters.|$|E
50|$|The boom was {{essentially}} the same design as the <b>Canadarm</b> itself, except that the articulatory joints are fixed. OBSS arms for the three remaining orbiters were manufactured relatively quickly, primarily because some spare parts for the <b>Canadarm</b> system were used.|$|E
