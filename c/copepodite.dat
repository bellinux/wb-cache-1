40|$|AbstractInstantaneous {{mortality}} {{rates of the}} common planktonic copepod Oithona similis were investigated {{for the first time}} in Kola Bay, a region of the Barents Sea that is influenced by freshwater discharge. The rates were estimated in different seasons (December, May, September 2005 and July 2006). A vertical life table approach (VLT) was used to assess mortality. The total abundance of O. similis (copepodites IV and V, and adults) was highest in autumn and lowest in winter. The maximum mortality of O. similis for the stage pair <b>copepodite</b> IV–copepodite V (0. 005  ±  0. 001  day− 1) occurred in December 2005, while the highest {{mortality rates}} for the pairs <b>copepodite</b> VM–adult male (0. 453  ±  0. 026  day− 1) and <b>copepodite</b> VF–adult female (0. 228  ±  0. 006  day− 1) occurred in summer 2006. Simple regression analyses showed that the total abundance of each stage and the mortality rates were positively significantly correlated with water temperature. The mortality rates for the stage pairs <b>copepodite</b> VM–adult male and <b>copepodite</b> VF–adult female were positively significantly correlated with chlorophyll a concentration. The abundance and mortality rate of O. similis in each season was determined by life cycle factors, and possibly by the dynamics of its food resources and potential predators...|$|E
40|$|The {{abundance}} and depth distribution of metazoans > 20 μm were investigated at seven stations across the Southern Indian Ocean (SIO), October–November 2006. Copepod nauplii, copepodites and larvaceans dominated the metazooplankton community. Copepodites were most abundant within Agulhas Current and Southern Ocean waters, decreasing toward subtropical/tropical areas, whereas larvaceans showed the inverse pattern. The fraction < 200 μm contained {{the majority of}} the zooplankton enumerated, including 81, 23 and 93 % of the larvacean, <b>copepodite</b> and nauplii abundances, respectively. The relative abundance of larvaceans compared with copepodites increased from 7 to 44 % from South Africa towards Australia. Peak <b>copepodite</b> biomass was observed off South Africa, while larvacean biomass was < 1 % of the <b>copepodite</b> biomass there, increasing to 6 % in tropical waters. Both <b>copepodite</b> and nauplii biomass were positively correlated to total Chl a (P < 0. 0001), larvacean biomass was only significantly related to temperature (P = 0. 0213). Despite their low biomass, larvacean production was estimated to exceed the copepod production up to five times. It appears that the {{abundance and}} role of larvaceans in the SIO has been severely underestimated in previous studies; thus future investigations into the fate of organic matter will remain incomplete if this group is not adequately considered...|$|E

Except for R. gigas, the rare occurrence of adults {{indicated that the}} spawning activities ceased by mid-March in this research area. Younger <b>copepodite</b> stages appeared for C. propinquus compared to C. acutus, suggesting the late reproduction or slow growth in the former.

40|$|These are {{the first}} data on the feeding of larval {{albacore}} (Thunnus alalunga Bonnaterre, 1788) in the Mediterranean. Specimens were gathered from day-time bongo-hauls conducted over the SW Mallorcan (Balearic Islands) shelf-slope. Ninety eight percent of 101 individuals ranging from 2. 65 to 9. 4 mm standard length (SL) contained 1 to 15 prey items per gut. Mean number of prey/gut was 3. 55 ± 2. 19 (SD). A positive correlation was found between larval SL {{and the number of}} prey/gut. The analysis of frequency of occurrence (F), numerical frequency (N), weight frequency (W) and the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) showed a dominance of <b>copepodites</b> and nauplii in the smallest size-class. As larvae grew, cladocerans and Calanoida <b>copepodites</b> dominated the diet, and cladocerans and <b>copepodites</b> were important in F, N and W. Piscivory was observed after notochord flexion and was important in terms of W. A positive correlation between mean prey size and both SL and lower jaw length (LJL) was observed. The niche breadth (S) did not vary with LJL, but the raw prey size range did.

Samples were collected during May 1980 in the Celtic Sea. Individual <b>Copepodite</b> Stages 3, 4, 5, and Adult Male and Female Stage 6 were measured and analysed, and 36 linear regression equations derived for these variables together with mean values, standard deviations and 95 % confidence limits. The range of nitrogen values in the fresh material, expressed {{as a percentage of}} dry weight, ranged from 8. 08 %± 0. 80 (<b>Copepodite</b> Stage 3) to 10. 89 %± 0. 27 (adult female); carbon values changed from 41. 6 %± 3. 05 (mean ± 95 % confidence limits) for <b>Copepodite</b> Stage 3 to 50. 97 %± 2. 63 in <b>Copepodite</b> Stage 5.

40|$|Abstract The {{nutritional}} {{suitability of}} Ceratium furcoides for Eudiaplomus gracilis, Mesocyclops leuckarti, Thermocyclops oithonoides and Cyclops abyssorum was studied by observing ingestion and assimilation. The dinoflagellate was ingested by female adults of all species. The calanoid copepod E. gracilis could not utilize Ceratium; mortality {{was high and}} no egg production was observed when Ceratium was the only food source. Mortality was low for the adult cyclopoids on this food and repro-duction indicated that Ceratium was assimilated. The first two <b>copepodite</b> instars of M. leuckarti {{were not able to}} handle Ceratium, while older stages preyed on them. The dinoflagellate was not ingested by female M. leuckarti when its densities were low. Advanced <b>copepodite</b> stages of C. abyssorum devel-oped into adults on a diet of Ceratium only. Mesocyclops leuckarti females ingested Ceratium when offered a mixed food source of Ceratium and the rotifer Brachionus rubens, but the rotifer was posi-tively selected, even if its density was low. The results show that Ceratium provides a suitable food source for advanced <b>copepodite</b> instars and adult cyclopoid copepods, although it is not a preferred food source...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that certain microalgae have the ability to cause various negative effects on pelagic calanoid copepods. However, whether such pelagic microalgae have similar negative effects on benthic copepods has had little attention. The {{results of the present study}} indicated that both benthic naupliar and <b>copepodite</b> stages of the harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus japonicus could effectively utilize five species of pelagic microalgae to complete their development. The effects of different concentrations of various microalgae species on naupliar survival were significant; however, no significant effects on <b>copepodite</b> survival were detected. When fed with two diatoms Chaetoceros muelleri and Skeletonema costatum as well as the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum micans and the chrysophyte Isochrysis galbana at high concentrations (≥ 8. 50 μgC ml⁻¹), the survival of both naupliar and <b>copepodite</b> stages of T. japonicus was more than 90 %. However, when the diatom Nitzschia closterium f. minutissima was fed at the high concentrations of 8. 50 μgC ml⁻¹, the naupliar survival was 76. 3 ± 3. 2 [*]%. Interestingly, the negative effects of N. closterium f. minutissima as a diet in the naupliar stage did not affect the survival of the copepodites, which may be explained by increased mobility of copepodites...|$|E

The five different microalgal diets were Isochrysis galbana (IG), Chaetoceros affinis (CA), Chlorella marina (CM), Nannochloropsis oculata (NO) and mixed algae (mixture of IG, CA, CM and NO at an equal abundance to provide the exact cell density). The results indicated that the abundance of both A. erythraea and O. brevicornis was higher in tanks supplied with IG and mixed algae than the tanks supplied with CA, CM and NO. IG and mixed algal diets were statistically similar on the mean abundance for both A. erythraea and O. brevicornis. The maximum production of A. erythraea nauplii was observed on day 12 of culture period and the nauplii production decreased from day 13 onwards. The mean abundance of A. erythraea <b>copepodites</b> and adults increased along with time up {{to the end of the}} culture period. In the case of O. brevicornis nauplii, the maximum abundance was observed on day 9 day of culture period and the nauplii production decreased from day 10 onwards.

40|$|Vertical distribution, life cycle, and {{developmental}} {{characteristics of the}} mesopelagic copepod Gaidius variabilis in the Oyashio region were investigated by combining the analyses of field <b>copepodite</b> populations with laboratory-rearing data of egg hatching and naupliar development. Field samplings from five discrete depths between the surface and ≤ 2000 m were made approximately every month for one year. Most populations of G. variabilis occurred at 600 - 1000 m depth. A modest degree of reversed diel vertical migration behavior and some stage-specific depth-distribution patterns were noted. All <b>copepodite</b> stages were observed throughout the year, suggesting a year-round spawning of G. variabilis. From a prominent abundance peak of <b>copepodite</b> stage 1 (C 1) seen in June-August, together with development times of eggs and nauplii obtained in laboratory-rearing experiments, the major spawning season was extrapolated to April-June, the phytoplankton bloom season. Tracing the peak abundance of each <b>copepodite</b> stage (distinguishing males and females for C 4 -C 6), the generation lengths {{of males and females}} were deduced as 2 and 1 yr, respectively. All between-stage increments in terms of wet-, dry-, and ash-free dry weights were greatest in C 3 /C 4, and least in C 5 /C 6 for both males and females. The increments in C 3 /C 4 and C 4 /C 5 were greater for males than for females, reflecting a longer stage duration of the males. These weights did not increase in C 5 /C 6 males, possibly because feeding ceased in C 6 males. These results of G. variabilis are compared with those of some mesopelagic copepods previously reported from other regions...|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} factor to high mortality rate in larval rearing is feeding success in early larval stage related to kind and size of natural live food.

40|$|The spatial {{distributions}} of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) juveniles and their food organisms {{were examined in}} Mutsu Bay from April to July during 1988 - 1997. In April, large larvae (≤ 25 mm in total length (TL)) and pelagic juveniles (> 25 mm TL) were widely distributed in the bay, and were concentrated at the same depths as calanoid <b>copepodites</b> during daylight hours. Geographical changes in cod TLs might {{have been due to}} transport by the Tsugaru Warm Current. After mid- and late May, juveniles and calanoid <b>copepodites</b> occurred on the bottom. Mean densities of cod juveniles fluctuated annually in April and June, and high densities occurred when calanoid copepods were abundant. Juveniles were rarely found at temperatures > 12 ℃, and it is likely that they migrate out of the bay after late June when temperatures increase and the abundance of prey decrease in the bay. Pacific cod use Mutsu Bay as a nursery ground, and calanoid <b>copepodites</b> sustain cod larvae and juveniles as their prey until mid-June.

Closing PCP nets (0. 06 -mm mesh) were also towed to evaluate vertical distribution patterns in September 1990, November 1991 and February 1997. P. minutus was present throughout the year. The population structure was characterized by numerous early <b>copepodite</b> stages in February-April, largely <b>copepodite</b> V (CV) in May-November, and a rapid increase of adults in November to January. As the exclusive component of the population, CVs were distributed below 300 m in September and November both day and night. These CVs {{were considered to be}} in diapause. In February most of the Cl to CIV stages were concentrated in the top 100 m. All <b>copepodite</b> stages of P. newmani were collected for only 7 months of the year, disappearing from the water column in Toyama Bay from mid-June onward and their very small population recovered in November. Vertical sampling in September failed to collect them down to 1000 -m depth. The period of their absence corresponded to the period of seasonal warming of surface waters. Unlike P. minutus, P. newmani appears to lack the ability to sink to cooler water during the warm summer season in Toyama Bay. Vertical sampling in February revealed that all <b>copepodite</b> stages of P. newmani were distributed largely in the top 100 m. From these results, combined with the temperature-generation length relationship established by McLaren et al.

Metridia gerlachei, Ctenocalanus citer, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and the ice-associated Stephos longipes were also present in considerable proportions. The observed changes in the population characteristics and parameters of these species are described in detail and discussed in the context of the spring phytoplankton bloom. A conspicuous event occurring during the final stage of the study was the development of a strong storm. While the results suggest that this storm did not have any considerable influence on the populations of all other investigated copepod species, it very likely caused pronounced changes in the S. longipes population present in the water column. Before the storm, S. longipes was found primarily in the upper 100 m of the water column, and its population was dominated by adults (mean proportion = 41 %) and the <b>copepodite</b> stage I (mean proportion = 30 %). After the storm, the abundance increased considerably, and the <b>copepodite</b> stage I contributed by far the largest proportion (53 %) of the total population indicating that the early <b>copepodite</b> stages probably had been released from the sea ice into the under ice water layer due to ice break-up and ice melt processes caused by the storm...|$|E

We observed a negative relationship between the percentage of diatoms in the food environment and the filtration rate on Strombidium sp.

The eggs were deposited on the seaweed where the nauplii, which are unable to swim, crawl on the algae until they metamorphose into the first <b>copepodite</b> stage (CI). The CI copepodites leave the floating weed, and the juvenile stages may eventually disperse widely in the water column until floating weed is colonized, probably by adults or juveniles in the last one or two <b>copepodite</b> stages.

Methodology: In total, 1, 634 pedigreed Atlantic salmon were exposed to a single infection (SI) of P. salmonis (primary pathogen) or coinfection with C. rogercresseyi (secondary pathogen). Low and high level of coinfection were evaluated (LC = 44 <b>copepodites</b> per fish; HC = 88 <b>copepodites</b> per fish). Survival and quantitative genetic analyses were performed to determine the resistance to the single infection and coinfections. Main Findings: C. rogercresseyi significantly increased the mortality in fish infected with P. salmonis (SI mortality = 251 / 545; LC mortality = 544 / 544 and HC mortality = 545 / 545). Heritability estimates for resistance to P. salmonis were similar and of medium magnitude in all treatments (h 2 SI = 0. 2360. 07; h 2 LC = 0. 1760. 08; h...|$|R
40|$|The term “population {{synchrony}} ” {{refers to}} the phenomenon of synchronous fluctua-tions of populations. The strength of this phenomenon may indicate {{the nature of the}} synchronizing mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the relative importance of the Moran effect and dispersal on the levels of population synchrony in a zooplankton as-semblage. We monitored the density of 36 taxa (27 genera, Bdelloidea, cyclopoid nauplii, calanoid nauplii, cyclopoid <b>copepodites,</b> calanoid <b>copepodites</b> and four broad taxonomic groups) at 7 sites through 19 months (from May 2004 through November 2009). For each taxon, we estimated the regional levels of synchrony as the mean Spearman correlation coefficient for all pairwise combinations of sites. These values were significant for 33 of the 36 taxa analyzed. Variations in synchrony were uncorrelated with hydrological or geographical distances. Environmental synchrony was unrelated to distance. The low relationship between synchrony (both environ-mental and population) and hydrological distance indicates the importance of the Moran effect. Nevertheless, climatic effects were not the main synchronizing mech-anism. We suggest that damming was the main synchronizing force in this system...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{levels of}} CO 2 in the {{atmosphere}} have led to increased CO 2 concentrations in the oceans. This enhanced carbon availability to the marine primary producers {{has the potential to}} change their nutrient stoichiometry, and higher carbon to nutrient ratios are expected. As a result, the quality of the primary producers as food for herbivores may change. Here, we present experimental work showing the effect of feeding Rhodomonas salina grown under different pCO 2 (200, 400 and 800 µatm) on the copepod Acartia tonsa. The rate of development of <b>copepodites</b> decreased with increasing CO 2 availability to the algae. The surplus carbon in the algae was excreted by the copepods, with younger stages (<b>copepodites)</b> excreting most of their surplus carbon through respiration, and adult copepods excreting surplus carbon mostly as DOC. We consider the possible consequences of different excretory pathways for the ecosystem. A continued increase in the CO 2 availability for primary production, together with changes in the nutrient loading of coastal ecosystems, may cause changes in the trophic links between primary producers and herbivores...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} and convenient method of rearing Eucyclops serrulatus in a microculture environment is described. A complete {{life cycle of}} E. serrulatus was maintained in a narrow space on a microscope slide glass on which a cover glass of 22 x 40 mm in size was mounted at a height of 0. 8 mm. The culture medium was constituted by bottled mineral water boiled with grains of Glycine max (soybean). Chilomonas paramecium, a free-living protozoan organism, was provided as live food. Growth of nauplii hatched from eggs to {{the first stage of}} <b>copepodite</b> took an average of 7. 7 days, and the growth of <b>copepodite</b> 1 to the egg-bearing adult female took an average of 20. 1 days in the microculture cell with an average life time of 44. 7 days. Continuous passage of copepods was successfully maintained as long as sufficient medium and food were provided. The microculture method enables an in situ microscopic observation on the growth and developmental process of helminth larvae experimentally infected to copepods as well as of copepod itself. Furthermore, it does not require anesthetization and, therefore, minimize the amount of stress exposed to copepods during the handling process...|$|E
40|$|Plankton samples {{collected}} and analyzed by the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey {{were used to}} examine the length of time spent near the surface in the North Atlantic and the North Sea by three closely related groups of zooplankton (copcpodite stages l- 4 Metridia spp., <b>copepodite</b> stages 5 - 6 Metridia lucens, and <b>copepodite</b> stages 5 - 6 Metridia longa). For all three groups, the mean daily length of time spent near the surface in each month of the year covaried seasonally with day length. In addition, {{the amount of time spent}} near the surface varied significantly between the three groups, being longest for the copepods of smallest body size (Cl-C 4 Metridia spp.) and shortest for the copepods of largest body size (C 5 -C 6 AL longa). These results support the suggestion that diel vertical migration serves to reduce the risk of mortality from visually orienting predators. Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a common feature in zooplankton communities. Vertical migrants are nor-mally found deeper during the day and shallower at night. The ubiquity of DVM has provoked considerable and extended debate as to its functional significance. It ha...|$|E
40|$|For a {{short-lived}} organism, {{such as a}} freshwater zooplankter, the ways of coping with years of local recruitment failure are either to disperse between habitats and recolonise or to disperse in time through diapause. Diapause is common among freshwater zooplankton and is generally seen {{as a way to}} escape periods of harsh environmental conditions. The egg-bank or pool of diapausing <b>copepodites</b> in lake sediments resulting from the production of diapausing stages has several implications for zooplankton ecology, genetics, and evolution which we outline in this review. The presence of a benthic dormant stage also creates a coupling between the benthic habitat and the pelagic, and we argue that zooplankton phenology is a result of selective forces in both habitats. The spatial distribution of diapausing eggs appears to be governed by random resuspension dynamics coupled with higher hatching rates in shallow waters. For diapausing <b>copepodites,</b> however, an active choice of where and how deep to enter the sediment may affect their distribution. In a reanalysis of published data, we found a size-dependent bathymetric distribution and vertical distribution in the sediment of diapausing cyclopoid <b>copepodites.</b> Our review of published laboratory studies showed that predictors of seasonal change such as photoperiod and temperature were the only type of cues used for the termination of diapause. We also found a relation between generation length and the type of cue used for diapause induction: copepods mainly used seasonal cues from the abiota, rotifers mainly used cues from the biotic environment, and cladocerans used a mix of both types. We describe patterns in emergence timing and contribution to population dynamics from studies using in situ estimation of emergence, and conclude that hatching from dormant stages may qualitatively and quantitatively affect zooplankton population dynamics and seasonal succession...|$|R
