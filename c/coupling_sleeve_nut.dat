40|$|A few {{components}} and debris collected from an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of a crashed helicopter were sent to this laboratory for analysis. The items received for laboratory tests/investigation are: (a) drive <b>sleeve,</b> (b) <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeve,</b> (c) debris/deposits and (d) non-metallic pieces collected from {{various parts of the}} engine, and (e) metal pieces collected from magnetic chip detector (MCD). Debris collected from various parts of the engine was found to be either dust and soil or fragments of non-metallic fabric that was used {{in some parts of the}} engine. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic particles collected from the MCD were from the shaved off splines of drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves.</b> The mode of failure in the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves</b> was identified to be progressive in nature. There were three fatigue cracks in the coupling sleeve; all of them being initiated at the spline root region. However, it is to be noted that no fracture was associated with these cracks. Hence, fatigue cracks per se were not responsible for the failure of the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Rather, evidences suggest that the fatigue crack initiation and propagation had occurred subsequent to some other mechanism of failure. It was not possible to unambiguously establish the mode of failure of the splines of the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves</b> because of the severe destruction that took place following the failure. But, there were tell-tale marks on the working flank of the available portion of the splines, which were indicative of relative movement between these components in the axial direction. Considering the nature of failure in the present case, this assumes significance. Analysis shows that in the event of such movement, wear on the meshing surfaces of the splines is inevitable. As wear progresses, the clearance between the engaging splines increases. This induces cyclic load of higher magnitude on the splines which increases the vulnerability for fatigue crack initiation at the spline root region. Moreover, the wear on the splines results in loss of material and thereby reduces cross section of the splines. When the cross section reduces to critical limit such that the splines can no longer sustain the application load, they fold or shear off. Although direct evidences to this proposed mechanism is scarce on the component because of the post failure destruction, available signatures, however, point towards such a sequence of failure. This is further supported by metallurgical investigation wherein both drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves</b> were found conforming to the specifications with respect to (a) chemical composition, (b) microstructure, (c) surface treatment, and (d) hardness profile. The reason(s) for possible axial movement between the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves,</b> however, could not be established from the laboratory investigation. In view of the progressive failure in the drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves,</b> it is justifiable to state that the failure in these components was primarily responsible for the sudden loss of power in the engine. This report provides a detailed account of laboratory investigation with test results and analysis. Also, a few recommendations are suggested for identification of probable cause(s) which could give rise to axial movement between drive and <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves...</b>|$|R
50|$|On the superstructure, {{pre-stressed}} twisted-strand cables {{invented by}} the designer {{were used to}} advantage on both the main strands and the suspenders, meaning the time-consuming and expensive field adjustments were unnecessary. These cables debuted in the U.S. in 1931 on Steinman and Robinson’s Waldo-Hancock Bridge near Bucksport, Maine, and their St. Johns Bridge in Portland, Oregon. A new connection method, which used <b>sleeve</b> <b>nuts</b> to connect each main strand socket to its anchorage rod, was also used. These connections, invented by Robinson and first used on the Thousand Islands Bridge the previous year, made small adjustments to the main strands very easy.|$|R

3000|$|Efforts {{have been}} {{conducted}} to investigate the mechanical performance of splices with <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves</b> of various geometrical and mechanical configurations, mostly under incremental tensile loading. In general, the most common failure modes for splices under incremental tensile loading have been bar fracture and bar pull-out due to grout-bar bond failure (Einea et al. 1995; Jansson 2008; Ling et al. 2012). In these circumstances, the mechanical performance of the splices essentially depends on the bond behavior between grout and bars. Test results have indicated that the mechanical performance of the splices is generally {{not as strong as}} that of the connected bars. For example, the tensile strengths and deformation capacities of the splices were lower than those of the connected bars (Einea et al. 1995; Ling et al. 2012; Kim and Lee 2012; Ling et al. 2014; Henin and Morcous 2015), e.g., the ultimate strengths and ultimate strains of 24 specimens appropriately fabricated by Ling et al. (2014) averaged 95 and 62  % of those of the connected bars, respectively. In general, appropriate geometrical configuration of <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeves,</b> adequate embedded length of bars, and high compressive strength of grout help to enhance the grout-bar bond and, therefore, improve the mechanical performance of the splices. On the other hand, limited information is available for the behavior of splices under cyclic loading. Hayashi et al. (1997) studied strength, rigidity, capacity of elongation, and the bond stress-slip relationship of splices under cyclic loading. The loading reversed 20 loops and ranged from 0.95 F [...]...|$|R
40|$|Plasma antennas {{represent}} {{the importance of}} technology in wireless communication that was developed due to its potential and innovativeness. Plasma antenna is a type o f antenna in which the metal conducting elements of a conventional antenna are replaced by plasma. In microwave field, the analyses of different gases by using discharge tube are investigated by injecting the RF source to produce monopole plasma antenna. The discharges have limitation on practical usefulness in commercial applications. This thesis introduces a concept of plasma monopole antennas through RF- charging of different inert gas. The plasma antenna is constructed using different inert gases as the plasma medium. The relationship between the generated plasma parameters and the antenna characteristics are investigated and discussed in two related topics. First, the preliminary studies on plasma antenna performance and behaviour are presented. Special focus is given on proving the theoretical plasma antenna on simulation by using different gas to analyse the characteristics o f plasma antenna behaviour. The antenna’s capability to operate as a transceiver is verified through simulation by using CST Microwave Studio. It is shown that the S- parameter for different gases and pressures give different performance due {{to the number of}} turns of <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeve</b> used. The effect of the thickness o f the <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeve</b> is also discussed. The second topic in this thesis is the development of plasma antenna where the implications on the fabricated antenna characteristics are discussed. The antenna characteristics that will be taken into account is the s- parameter, radiation pattern and antenna gain. The capability of plasma antenna is satisfied to transmit and receive the signal when the plasma antenna is supplied with RF sources. This research works are limited to the investigations of basic plasma antenna characteristics in a single antenna setup. Further investigations such as actual implementation of plasma antenna in wireless transmission are also described...|$|R

We examined long-hole exploration drilling as a method of determining the rock properties with the objective of establishing an improved procedure for such surveys. This report describes the results of the development of an improved system for exploration drilling. For convenience, the system, including its data-storage package, was designed to be mounted on a drill jumbo. A large-diameter rod was used {{at the tip of the}} extension rods to prevent deviation of the hole, after testing had indicated that this was an issue. A rod with an integrated <b>coupling</b> <b>sleeve</b> was employed to reduce the time required for the test. Dedicated software was also developed to enable semi-automated processing of the data. The above features make the system convenient to use, and provide accurate data of the rock properties ahead of the tunnel face...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{designing}} the profiles of construction elements {{are defined as}} a perfect shape of line, circle or cylinder etc. Due to the production process the elements macrogeometry can be distorted in many ways. The direct measure of deviation of the real shape of a part from its nominal shape (the designed one) is a form deviation. If any additional restrictions concerning form deviations are not given in a production drawing, then the influence of these form deviations {{should be taken into}} account in allowable area of dimensions variation which is defined with tolerance zone. High values of rectilinearity deviations of a generating line, roundness deviations and cylindricity deviations can be a reason of changes of the assumed functional requirements. On the basis of saddleback shafts with oval cross-sections manufactured in three accuracy classes, i. e. IT 4, IT 6 and IT 9, the authors have presented the variation of static parameters of cooperation. The shafts were <b>coupled</b> with <b>sleeves</b> (with a nominal circular cross-section) on experimental test stand.

40|$|A tool {{makes it}} {{possible}} to couple a torque wrench to an externally knurled, internally threaded, round cable connector. The purpose served by the tool is to facilitate the tightening of multiple such connectors (or the repeated tightening of the same connector) to repeatable torques. The design of a prior cable-connector/ torque-wrench coupling tool provided for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location laterally offset from the axis of rotation of the cable connector, making it necessary to correct the torque reading for the offset. Unlike the design of the prior tool, the design of the present tool provides for application of the torque-wrench jaws to a location on the axis of rotation, obviating correction of the torque reading for offset. The present tool (see figure) consists of a split collet containing a slot that provides clearance for inserting and bending the cable, a collet-locking <b>sleeve,</b> a collet-locking <b>nut,</b> and a torque-wrench adaptor that is press-fit onto the collet. Once the collet is positioned on the cable connector, the collet-locking nut is turned to force the collet-locking sleeve over the collet, compressing the collet through engagement of tapered surfaces {{on the outside of the}} collet and the inside of the locking sleeve. Because the collet is split and therefore somewhat flexible, this compression forces the collet inward to grip the connector securely. The torque wrench is then applied to the torque-wrench adaptor in the usual manner for torquing a nut or a bolt...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBasically robots are {{designed}} in such {{way that they}} remove human intervention from labour intensive and hazardous work environment, sometimes they are also used to explore inaccessible work places which are generally impossible to access by humans. The inspection of pipe comes in same category because they carry toxic chemicals, fluids {{and most of the}} time has small internal diameter or bends which become inaccessible to human. The complex internal geometry and hazard content constraints of pipes demand robots for inspection of such pipes in order to check corrosion level of pipe, recovery of usable parts from pipe interior, sampling of sludge and scale formation on pipe internal surface etc. Several designs of In-pipe inspection robots (IPIR) have been proposed in the literature to solve the problems related with inspection of these complicated internal geometries. Designing of an in-pipe inspection robot (IPIR) is a difficult task and hence the designer must take care of the design issues like Mobility, Steer ability, Turning radius, Size and shape adaptability, Online adaptability, Flexibility, Stability, Autonomous operation and obstacle avoidance, Efficiency at uneven surface, Safe operation, Material selection, Type of task to be performed inside the pipe, Number of actuators, Operation in active pipe line, Retrieval of robot, User friendly navigation and control system, Range of operation, Quantitative analysis of defects inside the pipe. Based on above, this research work presents investigations into design issues pertaining to development of In-pipe inspection robotics and proposes a new model of an In-pipe inspection robot to overcome some critical design issues. This proposed model is a screw drive type wall press adaptable wheeled In-pipe inspection robot. It is able to move through vertical, horizontal pipes and it can easily pass through elbow of a pipe line. This model comprises of three modules- rotor, stator and control unit. The Rotor module has three wheels mounted on the outer periphery with a helix angle of 15 °. Wheels of rotor follow the helical path on the internal surface of pipe line and move in the longitudinal direction inside the pipe. A geared DC motor of 200 RPM is connected to rotor by a flexible <b>sleeve</b> <b>coupling.</b> Due to its flexibility motor can transmit torque to rotor even in case of minor misalignments and can easily be stopped at any point of journey inside the vertical or horizontal pipeline, thereby eliminating the need of braking system to achieve stability. Stator module is the housing of motor and it contains three spring loaded wheels on the outer periphery. Control Module of robot consist battery and wireless control unit. Spring loaded wheels of rotor and stator provide it shape adaptability and enhance friction between wheels and pipe interior...|$|R
