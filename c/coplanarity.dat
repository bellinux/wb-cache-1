40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} 3 D reconstruction from 2 D points {{in one or more}} images and auxiliary information about the corresponding 3 D features : alignments, <b>coplanarities,</b> ratios of lengths or symmetries are known. Our first contribution is a necessary and sufficient criterion that indicates whether a dataset, or subsets thereof, defines a rigid reconstruction up to scale and translation. Another contribution is a reconstruction method for one or more images. We show that the observations impose linear constraints on the reconstruction. All the input data, possibly coming from many images, is summarized in a single linear system, whose solution yields the reconstruction. The criterion which indicates whether the solution is unique up to scale and translation is the rank of another linear system, called the "twin" system. Multiple objects whose relative scale can be arbitrarily chosen are identified. The reconstruction is obtained up to an affine transformation, or, if calibration is available, up to a Euclidean transformation. ...|$|R

The fraction of events with alignment is statistically significant for families with superhigh energies and large numbers of hadrons. This {{can be interpreted as}} evidence for coplanar hard-scattering of secondary hadrons produced {{in the early stages of}} the atmospheric cascade development. This phenomenon can be described within the recently proposed "crystal world," with latticized and anisotropic spatial dimensions. Planar events are expected to dominate particle collisions at a hard-scattering energy exceeding the scale Λ_ 3 at which space transitions from 3 D 2 D. We study specific collider signatures that will test this hypothesis. We show that the energy-spectrum of Drell-Yan scattering and the parton momenta sum rule are significantly modified in this framework. At the LHC, two jet and three jet events are necessarily planar, but four jet events can test the hypothesis. Accordingly, we study in a model-independent way the 5 σ discovery reach of the ATLAS and CMS experiments for identifying four jets <b>coplanarities.</b> For the extreme scenario in which all pp → 4 jet scattering processes become coplanar above Λ_ 3, we show that with an integrated luminosity of 10 (100) fb^- 1 the LHC experiments have the potential to discover correlations between jets if Λ_ 3 1. 25 (1. 6) TeV.

Conjugation relies upon overlap of the π-orbitals of the aromatic rings, which, in turn, requires the thiophene rings to be coplanar (see Figure 2, top). [...] The number of coplanar rings determines the conjugation length—the longer the conjugation length, the lower the separation between adjacent energy levels, and the longer the absorption wavelength. Deviation from <b>coplanarity</b> may be permanent, resulting from mislinkages during synthesis or especially bulky side chains; or temporary, resulting from changes in the environment or binding.

The azimuthal normal angles estimated by the MVA are close those from the time lag method. The longitudinal angles are not zero but are confined within 30 °.

As shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1, Additional file 2 : Figure S 2 and Additional file 4 : Figure S 4, Additional file 5 : Figure S 5, the magnetic field jumps across the shocks are often linearly polarized in the GSM Y or Z directions; thus, the median and minimum variance directions are not determined precisely.

40|$|This thesis studies range-based WSN {{localization}} {{problem in}} 3 D environments that induce <b>coplanarity.</b> In most real-world applications, {{even though the}} environment is 3 D, the grounded sensor nodes are usually deployed on 2 D planar surfaces. Examples of these surfaces include structures seen in both indoor (e. g. floors, doors, walls, tables etc.) and outdoor (e. g. mountains, valleys, hills etc.) environments. In such environments, sensor nodes typically appear as coplanar node clusters. We refer {{to this type of}} a deployment as a planar deployment. When there is a planar deployment, the <b>coplanarity</b> causes difficulties to the traditional range-based multilateration algorithms because a node cannot be unambiguously localized if the distance measurements to that node are from coplanar nodes. Thus, many already localized groups of nodes are rendered ineffective in the process just because they are coplanar. We, therefore propose an algorithm called <b>Coplanarity</b> Based Localization (CBL) that can be used as an extension of any localization algorithm to avoid most flips caused by <b>coplanarity.</b> CBL first performs a 2 D localization among the nodes that are clustered on the same surface, and then finds the positions of these clusters in 3 D. We have carried out experiments using trilateration for 2 D localization, and quadrilateration for 3 D localization, and experimentally verified that exploiting the clustering information leads to a more precise localization than mere quadrilateration. We also propose a heuristic to extract the clustering information in case it is not available, which is yet to be improved in the future.
