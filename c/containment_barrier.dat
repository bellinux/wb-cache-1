50|$|Identification of {{the cause}} of {{alteration}} or the possibility of rockfall allows mitigation measures to be tailored to individual sites. The most-used passive protection measures are boulder-gathering trenches {{at the foot of}} the hillside, metal containment nets, and boulder barriers. Boulder barriers are generally composed of suitably rigid metal nets. Various structural types are on the market, for which the manufactures specify the kinetic energy of absorption based on an elemental analysis of the structure under projectile collision conditions. Another type of boulder <b>containment</b> <b>barrier</b> is the earth embankment, sometimes reinforced with geo-synthetics (reinforced ground). The advantages of such earthworks over nets are: easier maintenance, higher absorption of kinetic energy, and lower environmental impacts.|$|E

50|$|The {{procedure}} of entombment {{is a time}} extensive process. The simplest of the procedures is entombing the radioactive waste source at the site itself. After containment and disposal of lower-level radioactive spent fuel sources, the entombment process of high-level radioactive parts of the plant may begin. The {{first step is to}} cover the area with a protective shield which is usually made up of radioactive-resistant materials, this allows workers to continue working with a significantly lower radioactive environment. The next step is the most crucial and time consuming, it involves encasing the site in cement, absorbent grout, or infills. Each layer of cement, grout or infills must set and cure before the next layer is added and thus, time and proper testing is required to ensure the safe containment of radiation. Once the encasement is complete the final step is often to surround the site in a clay or sand/gravel mixture and then the soil is laid on top of the site. The use of many layers allows for the maximum shielding of radioactivity. The site must be routinely checked for breaches in the <b>containment</b> <b>barrier</b> for decades. Therefore, entombment is often considered as a last resort solution to the decommissioning of a Nuclear Power Plant or nuclear disaster site. An example would be a waste disposal facility in El Cabril Spain that uses a multi-concrete barrier concept. The concept includes placing the radioactive waste drums inside concrete boxes and placing those boxes inside a reinforced concrete vault. The Vault is then sealed with a waterproof coating to prevent any hazardous liquid from escaping the drums.|$|E

However, despite their effectiveness in the short-term, all of these barriers exhibit geochemical or geomechanical instability over the long-term resulting in degradation of the barrier {{and its ability to}} contain waste.

40|$|Between 1952 and 1970, DOE buried mixed {{waste in}} pits and {{trenches}} that now have special cleanup needs. The disposal practices used decades ago left these landfills and other trenches, pits, and disposal sites filled with three million {{cubic meters of}} buried waste. This waste is becoming harmful to human safety and health. Today's cleanup and waste removal is time-consuming and expensive with some sites scheduled to complete cleanup by 2006 or later. An interim solution to the DOE buried waste problem is to encapsulate and hydraulically isolate the waste with a geomembrane barrier and monitor {{the performance of the}} barrier over its 50 -yr lifetime. The installed containment barriers would isolate the buried waste and protect groundwater from pollutants until final remediations are completed. The DOE has awarded a contract to RAHCO International, Inc.; of Spokane, Washington; to design, develop, and test a novel subsurface barrier installation system, referred to as a Subsurface Containment System (SCS). The installed <b>containment</b> <b>barrier</b> consists of commercially available geomembrane materials that isolates the underground waste, similar to the way a swimming pools hold water, without disrupting hazardous material that was buried decades ago. The barrier protects soil and groundwater from contamination and effectively meets environmental cleanup standards while reducing risks, schedules, and costs. Constructing the subsurface <b>containment</b> <b>barrier</b> uses a combination of conventional and specialized equipment and a unique continuous construction process. This innovative equipment and construction method can construct a 1000 -ft-long X 34 -ft-wide X 30 -ft-deep barrier at construction rates to 12 Wday (8 hr/day operation). Life cycle costs including RCRA cover and long-term monitoring range from approximately $ 380 to $ 590 /cu yd of waste contained or $ 100 to $ 160 /sq ft of placed barrier based upon the subsurface geology surrounding the waste. Project objectives for Phase I were to validate the SCS construction equipment and process, evaluate the system performance, validate the barrier constructability, and assess the barrier effectiveness. The objectives for Phase 11, which is a full-scale demonstration at a DOE site, are to perform an extensive characterization of the test site, to demonstrate the equipment and the installation process under site-specific performance and regulatory requirements, to validate the operational performance of the equipment, and to perform long-term verification of the barrier using monitoring wells. To date, significant progress has been made to establish the technical and economical feasibility of the SCS. This report describes the SCS conventional and specialized equipment, barrier materials, and construction process. It presents results of the specialized equipment Factory Test, the SCS Control Test and the SCS Advance Control Test at the RAHCO facility.

The alcove is designed with sufficient space to entomb 12 experiment vessels. Each experiment in the OBOE {{series of experiments}} is composed of one experimental package. Each experimental package will have high explosive (HE) and special nuclear material (SNM) in a subcritical assembly. Each experimental package will be placed in a steel experimental vessel within the OBOE zero-room.

The containment plan for the OBOE series of experiments utilizes a two containment vessel concept.

While it is likely that the experiment vessel will contain the SNM from an experiment, the containment plan for the OBOE series only assumes that the steel experiment vessel provides shock mitigation and is a heat sink for the heat produced by the detonation of the HE. It is possible that one or more of the experimental vessels may seep SNM in the zero-room from a failure of a seal on the vessel.
