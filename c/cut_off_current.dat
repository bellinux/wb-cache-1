40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), Sunpower Inc., and NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) {{have been}} {{developing}} an Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) for potential {{use as an}} electric power system for space science missions. This generator would {{make use of the}} free-piston Stirling cycle to achieve higher conversion efficiency than currently used alternatives. NASA GRC initiated an experiment with an ASRG simulator to demonstrate the functionality of a Stirling convertor on a mobile application, such as a rover. The ASRG simulator made use of two Advanced Stirling Convertors to convert thermal energy from a heat source to electricity. The ASRG simulator was designed to incorporate a minimum amount of support equipment, allowing integration onto a rover powered directly by the convertors. Support equipment to provide control was designed including a linear AC regulator controller, constant power controller, and Li-ion battery charger controller. The ASRG simulator is controlled by a linear AC regulator controller. The rover is powered by both a Stirling convertor and Li-ion batteries. A constant power controller enables the Stirling convertor to maintain a constant power output when additional power is supplied by the Li-ion batteries. A Li-ion battery charger controller limits the charging current and <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>current</b> of the batteries. This paper discusses the design, fabrication, and implementation of these three controllers...|$|E
50|$|When the {{electromagnetic}} clutch {{is used in}} automobiles, {{there may be a}} clutch release switch inside the gear lever. The driver operates the switch by holding the gear lever to change the gear, thus cutting <b>off</b> <b>current</b> to the electromagnet and disengaging the clutch. With this mechanism, {{there is no need to}} depress the clutch pedal. Alternatively, the switch may be replaced by a touch sensor or proximity sensor which senses the presence of the hand near the lever and <b>cuts</b> <b>off</b> the <b>current.</b> The advantages of using this type of clutch for automobiles are that complicated linkages are not required to actuate the clutch, and the driver needs to apply a considerably reduced force to operate the clutch. It is a type of semi-automatic transmission.|$|R
30|$|Solid state DC circuit {{breakers}} <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the fault <b>current</b> {{at the current}} zero-crossing point, and then they disconnect the two auxiliary switches. Using this method, DC faults can be quickly removed. In addition, fast {{circuit breakers}} operate at the zero-crossing point, thus the short circuit capacity is small. As such, few IGBT devices are needed and additional energy consuming devices are not necessary. This has great application prospects.|$|R
50|$|The {{charging}} protocol (how much voltage {{or current}} for how long, {{and what to}} do when charging is complete, for instance) depends on the size and type of the battery being charged. Some battery types have high tolerance for overcharging (i.e., continued charging after the battery has been fully charged) and can be recharged by connection to a constant voltage source or a constant current source, depending on battery type. Simple chargers of this type must be manually disconnected {{at the end of the}} charge cycle, and some battery types absolutely require, or may use a timer to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> charging <b>current</b> at some fixed time, approximately when charging is complete. Other battery types cannot withstand over-charging, being damaged (reduced capacity, reduced lifetime) or overheating or even exploding. The charger may have temperature or voltage sensing circuits and a microprocessor controller to safely adjust the charging current and voltage, determine the state of charge, and <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> at the end of charge.|$|R
30|$|This study {{proposed}} {{a technique to}} identify the fault section of a ring-type LVDC distribution system by using capacitive discharge currents from DC/DC converters. The current is more suitable for gathering information {{with respect to a}} fault than that from the AC/DC converter because DC/DC converters are distributed throughout the entire system. Additionally, {{it is not necessary to}} rapidly <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the fault <b>current</b> from a DC/DC converter. Furthermore, the capacitive discharge current possesses distinct characteristics based on the fault conditions including the fault type and location.|$|R
30|$|The DC fault {{characteristics}} of voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) systems are analyzed in this paper. The phenomenon whereby the capacitor on DC side discharges quickly during a DC fault {{contributes to a}} large short-circuit fault current. Neither traditional DC breakers nor DC switches can <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the fault <b>current</b> under this condition. A fast solid state DC breaker design method is proposed in this paper. This method {{is based on the}} fault current {{characteristics of}} the inverter in multi-terminal HVDC systems (MTDC), where a fault current appears at the natural zero-crossing point near the inverter. At this point, by coordinating the AC breakers near the rectifier, the DC breaker could reliably <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the DC fault current and protect the system. A detailed model for this fast solid state DC breaker and its operation sequence are studied, based on this design method. Simulations modeling a five-terminal meshed DC grid and a fast DC breaker were carried out with PSCAD/EMTDC using this design method. The results from the simulations confirmed the validity of the design method.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of several space-charge-limited (SCL) {{magnetron}} injection gun (MIG) designs which are intended for use with a 500 kV, 500 A gyroklystron with accelerator applications. The design performances are {{compared to that of}} a temperature-limited (TL) gun that was constructed for the same application. The SCL designs yield similar values for beam quality, namely an axial velocity spread under 3 % for an average perpendicular-to-parallel velocity ratio of 1. 5. The peak electric fields and the cathode loadings of the SCL designs are somewhat higher than for the TL design. Three designs are described in this paper. In the first design the space-charge limit is achieved by recessing the emitter into the cathode. The other two designs have control electrodes to which a voltage can be applied to change the beam current independently of the beam voltage. One of these designs can accept a bias sufficiently high to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the <b>current</b> completely, so that a DC power supply with pulsed electrode operation is possible. Details of all designs as well as a discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the SCL designs as compared to the TL design are given...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrician}} pictured is {{installing a}} General Electric Ground Fault Interrupter (GFI), a device which provides {{protection against electrical shock}} {{in the home}} or in industrial facilities. Shocks due to defective wiring in home appliances or other electrical equipment can cause severe burns, even death. As a result, the National Electrical Code now requires GFIs in all new homes constructed. This particular type of GFI employs a sensing element which derives from technology acquired in space projects by SCI Systems, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama, producer of sensors for GE and other manufacturers of GFI equipment. The sensor is based on the company's experience in developing miniaturized circuitry for space telemetry and other spacecraft electrical systems; this experience enabled SCI to package interruptor circuitry in the extremely limited space available and to produce sensory devices at practicable cost. The tiny sensor measures the strength of the electrical current and detects current differentials that indicate a fault in the functioning of an electrical system. The sensing element then triggers a signal to a disconnect mechanism in the GFI, which <b>cuts</b> <b>off</b> the <b>current</b> in the faulty circuit...|$|R
40|$|The Multi-Threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) {{technology}} {{provides a}} solution to the high performance and low power design requirements of modern designs. While the low Vth transistors are used to implement the desired function, the high Vth transistors are used to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the leakage <b>current.</b> In this paper, we (i) examine the effectiveness of the MTCMOS technology for the Samsung’s 0. 18 m process, (ii) propose a new special flip-flop which keeps a valid data during the sleep mode, and (iii) develop a methodology which takes into account the new design issues related to the MTCMOS technology. Towards validating the proposed technique, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) processor has been implemented using the MTCMOS design methodology, and the 0. 18 m process. The fabricated PDA processor operates at 333 MHz, and consumes about 2 W of leakage power. Whereas the performance of the MTCMOS implementation is {{the same as that of}} the generic CMOS implementation, three orders of reduction in the leakage power has been achieved...|$|R

6000|$|The {{strata of}} {{sandstone}} {{in the low}} coast country, and likewise on the Blue Mountains, are often divided by cross or current laminae, which dip in different directions, and frequently at an angle of forty-five degrees. Most authors have attributed these cross layers to successive small accumulations on an inclined surface; but from a careful examination {{in some parts of}} the New Red Sandstone of England, I believe that such layers generally form parts of a series of curves, like gigantic tidal ripples, the tops of which have since been <b>cut</b> <b>off,</b> either by nearly horizontal layers, or by another set of great ripples, the folds of which do not exactly coincide with those below them. It is well-known to surveyors that mud and sand are disturbed during storms at considerable depths, at least from three hundred to four hundred and fifty feet (See Martin White on [...] "Soundings in the British Channel" [...] pages 4 and 166.), so that the nature of the bottom even becomes temporarily changed; the bottom, also, at a depth between sixty and seventy feet, has been observed to be broadly rippled. (M. Siau on the [...] "Action of Waves" [...] "Edin. New Phil. Journ." [...] volume 31 page 245.) One may, therefore, be allowed to suspect, from the appearance just mentioned in the New Red Sandstone, that at greater depths, the bed of the ocean is heaped up during gales into great ripple-like furrows and depressions, which are afterwards <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> by the <b>currents</b> during more tranquil weather, and again furrowed during gales.|$|R
40|$|The pure global {{buckling}} and vibration of {{four sides}} simply supported {{as well as}} clamped anisotropic laminates having an arbitrary shape <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> region that is symmetric with respect to mid-plane have been studied by treating the remaining <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions as uniform plates with reduced stiffness. The reduced variation of stiffness of the plate is represented by Fourier series. Computational solutions of the energy principle for the Ritz method in a plate having arbitrary shape of typical <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions under biaxial compressive loads are obtained. Some numerical results for the pure global buckling load prediction due to its reduced flexural stiffness for the circular <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions and elliptical <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions are presented. We find the normalized pure global buckling load ratio decreases as the <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions size increases, and the non-dimensional fundamental frequency value decreases as the <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions size increases.

Sponsored by South Carolina State Representative Billy Witherspoon, the bill would have rescinded the 2000 pact that prohibited all states except South Carolina, Connecticut and New Jersey from sending radioactive waste to Barnwell after June 2008.

In the past, on-site waste storage was considered short-term storage and, as such, was subject to minimal review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).
