40|$|Upcoming {{emissions}} regulations (Tiers 3, 4 a and 4 b) are imposing {{significantly higher}} heat loads on the cooling system than lesser regulated machines. This work was {{a suite of}} tasks aimed at reducing the parasitic losses of the cooling system, or improving the design process through six distinct tasks: 1. Develop an axial fan that will provide more airflow, with less input power and less noise. The initial plan was to use Genetic Algorithms to do an automated fan design, incorporating forward sweep for low noise. First and second generation concepts could not meet either performance or sound goals. An experienced turbomachinery designer, using a specialized CFD analysis program {{has taken over the}} design and has been able to demonstrate a 5 % flow improvement (vs 10 % goal) and 10 % efficiency improvement (vs 10 % goal) using blade twist only. 2. Fan shroud developments, using an 'aeroshroud' concept developed at Michigan State University. Performance testing at Michigan State University showed the design is capable of meeting the goal of a 10 % increase in flow, but over a very narrow operating range of fan performance. The goal of 10 % increase in fan efficiency was not met. Fan noise was reduced from 0 to 2 dB, vs. a goal of 5 dB at constant airflow. The narrow range of fan operating conditions affected by the aeroshroud makes this concept unattractive for further development at this time 3. Improved axial fan system modeling is needed to accommodate the numbers of cooling systems to be redesigned to meet lower emissions requirements. A CFD fan system modeling guide has been completed and transferred to design engineers. Current, uncontrolled modeling practices produce flow estimates in some cases within 5 % of measured values, and in some cases within 25 % of measured values. The techniques in the modeling guide reduced variability to the goal of + 5 % for the case under study. 4. Demonstrate the performance and design versatility of a high performance fan. A 'swept blade mixed flow' fan was rapid prototyped from cast aluminum for a performance demonstration on a small construction machine. The fan was mounted directly in place of the conventional fan (relatively close to the engine). The goal was to provide equal airflow at constant fan speed, with 75 % of the input power and 5 dB quieter than the conventional fan. The result was a significant loss in flow with the prototype due to its sensitivity to downstream blockage. This sensitivity to downstream blockage affects flow, efficiency, and noise all negatively, and further development was terminated. 5. Develop a high efficiency variable speed fan drive to replace existing slipping clutch style fan drives. The goal for this task was to provide a continuously variable speed fan drive with an efficiency of 95 %+ at max speed, and losses no greater than at max speed as the fan speed would vary throughout its entire speed range. The process developed to quantify the fuel savings potential of a variable speed fan drive has produced a simple tool to predict the fuel savings of a variable speed drive, and has sparked significant interest in the use of variable speed fan drive for Tier 3 emissions compliant machines. The proposed dual ratio slipping clutch variable speed fan drive can provide a more efficient system than a conventional single ratio slipping <b>clutch</b> <b>fan</b> drive, but could not meet the established performance goals of this task, so this task was halted in a gate review {{prior to the start of}} detailed design. 6. Develop a cooling system air filtration device to allow the use of automotive style high performance heat exchangers currently in off road machines. The goal of this task was to provide a radiator air filtration system that could allow high fin density, louvered radiators to operate in a find dust application with the same resistance to fouling as a current production off-road radiator design. Initial sensitivity testing demonstrated that fan speed has a significant impact on the fouling of radiator cores due to fine dusts, so machines equipped with continuously variable speed fan drives would be expected to have more radiator debris fouling problems than a machine with a constant speed fan. Filtration concepts looked at a wide range of filtration technologies, but the combination of pressure drop constraints and the small size of the debris to be filtered made this a futile exercise. The most successful technologies evaluated all incorporate some way to increase the Reynolds number inside the heat exchanger air flow path. A form of an 'air knife' concept has emerged as the most promising technology to pursue...|$|E

5000|$|The Bedford Vehicles {{engine was}} {{effectively}} two engines in horizontally opposed configuration ("flat twelve") {{on a common}} crankshaft. There were four Solex carburettors each on a separate manifold that fed three cylinders formed as a single cylinder head. The elements of the engine and ancillary components were laid out {{so they could be}} reached for maintenance through the engine deck covers. Air for the engine was drawn from the fighting compartment through air cleaners. Cooling air was drawn into the engine compartment through louvres on the sides, across the radiators and through the engine compartment by a fan driven by the <b>clutch.</b> This <b>fan</b> blew the air over the gearbox and out the rear of the hull. By opening a flap between the fighting compartment and the engine compartment this airflow could be used to remove fumes produced by firing the armament.

50|$|Development of the nine-cylinder {{engine was}} led by Capt. George Thomas Smith-Clarke. The {{prototype}} engine, called 9ARS and which weighed 693 lb and developed 450 hp, was run in December 1936. In 1938 Airspeed (1934) Ltd lent their test pilot, George Errington, and their much rebuilt Bristol Bulldog (K3183), to carry out test flights. Development was continued at a reduced pace during the Second World War and following testing in an Airspeed Oxford and an Airspeed Consul (VX587) Alvis was ready to market the engine in 1947 as the Series 500 (502, 503 and sub-types) for aeroplanes and Series 520 for helicopters. (Most helicopter engines were direct drive — no reduction gearbox — with a centrifugal <b>clutch</b> and <b>fan</b> cooling). The first production use was the Percival Prince, which flew in July 1948 and the Westland Sikorsky S-51 and Westland WS-51 Dragonfly helicopters. From 1959 the stroke was increased to 4.8 inches for the Series 530 (mainly the Mk. 531 for Twin Pioneers) rated at 640 hp. It was Britain’s last high-power production piston aero-engine when manufacture ceased in 1966.|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} to realize adaptive structures {{is of great}} interest in turbomachinery design, owing to the benefits related to enhanced performance and efficiency. To accom- plish this, a challenging approach is the employment of shape memory alloys (SMAs), which can recover seemingly permanent strains by solid phase transformations whereby the so-called shape memory effect (SME) takes place. This paper presents the develop- ment of a heavy-duty automotive cooling axial fan with morphing blades activated by SMA strips that works as actuator elements in the polymeric blade structure. Concerning the fan performance, this new concept differs from a conventional viscous <b>fan</b> <b>clutch</b> solu- tion especially during the nonstationary operating conditions. The blade design was per- formed {{in order to achieve}} the thermal activation of the strips by means of air stream flow. Two polymeric matrices were chosen to be tested in conjunction with a commer- cially available NiTi binary alloy, whose phase transformation temperatures (TTRs) were experimentally evaluated by imposing the actual operating thermal gradient. The SMA strips were then thermomechanically treated to memorize a bent shape and embedded in the polymeric blade. In a specifically designed wind tunnel, the different polymeric matri- ces equipped with the SMA strips were tested to assess the fluid temperature and surface pattern behavior of the blade. Upon heating, they tend to recover the memorized shape and the blade is forced to bend, leading to a camber variation and a trailing edge dis- placement. The recovery behavior of each composite structure (polymeric matrix with the SMA strips) was evaluated through digital image analysis techniques. The differences between the blade shape at the initial condition and at the maximum bending deformation were considered. According to these results, the best coupling of SMA strips and polymeric structure is assessed and its timewise behavior is compared to the traditional timewise behavior of a viscous <b>fan</b> <b>clutch...</b>|$|R

50|$|Most anemonefish are protandrous hermaphrodites, {{meaning they}} {{alternate}} between {{the male and}} female sexes {{at some point in their}} lives. Anemonefish colonies usually consist of the reproductive male and female and a few juveniles, who help tend the colony. Although multiple males co-habit an environment with a single female, polygamy does not occur and only the adult pair exhibit reproductive behavior. However, if the largest female dies, the social hierarchy shifts with the breeding male exhibiting protandrous sex reversal to become the breeding female. The largest juvenile will then become the new breeding male after a period of rapid growth. The existence of protandry in anemonefish may rest on the case that non-breeders modulate their phenotype in a way that causes breeders to tolerate them. This strategy prevents conflict by reducing competition between the males for one female. For example, by purposefully modifying their growth rate to remain small and submissive, the juveniles in a colony present no threat to the fitness of the adult male, thereby protecting themselves from being evicted by the dominant fish. The reproductive cycle of anemonefish is often correlated with the lunar cycle. Rates of spawning for anemonefish peak at approximately the first and third quarters of the moon. The timing of this spawn means that the eggs will hatch around the full moon or new moon periods. One explanation for this lunar clock is that spring tides produce the highest tides during full or new moons. Nocturnal hatching during high tide may reduce predation by allowing for a greater capacity for escape. Namely, the stronger currents and greater water volume during high tide protects the hatchlings by effectively sweeping them to safety. Before spawning, anemonefish exhibit increased rates of anemone and substrate biting, which help prepare and clean the nest for the spawn. In terms of parental care, male anemonefish are often the caretakers of eggs. Before making the clutch, the parents often clear an oval sized clutch varying in diameter for the spawn. Fecundity, or reproductive rate, of the females usually ranges from 600 to 1500 eggs depending on the size of the female. In contrast to most animal species, the female only occasionally takes responsibility for the eggs, with males expending most of the time and effort. Male anemonefish care for their eggs by fanning and guarding them for 6 to 10 days until they hatch. Studies have shown that, in general, eggs develop more rapidly in a <b>clutch</b> when males <b>fan</b> properly and that fanning represents a crucial mechanism of successfully developing eggs. This suggests that males have the ability to control the success of hatching an egg clutch by investing different amounts of time and energy towards the eggs. For example, a male could choose to fan less in times of scarcity or fan more in times of abundance. Furthermore, males display increased alertness when guarding more valuable broods, or eggs in which paternity was guaranteed. Females, on the other hand, display generally less preference for parental behavior than males. All these suggest that males have increased parental investment towards the eggs compared to females.|$|R
