50|$|A <b>concealed</b> <b>hinge</b> {{drilling}} jig {{is a type}} of support jig, designed for drilling 3 cm holes to fit concealed hinges into modern wardrobe doors. As many of the complementary tools used in woodworking, it uses an electric hand-drill for its operation, making a Forstner bit to turn.|$|E
50|$|A coin {{watch is}} {{typically}} made by slicing a coin into two disks, one thinner than the other; or by removing one {{face of a}} coin. A watch is then embedded into the thicker part, and the two faces joined by a <b>concealed</b> <b>hinge</b> and catch. When closed, the watch is hidden and the coin looks like any other.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Concealed</b> <b>hinges</b> are set for {{furniture}} doors (with {{or without}} self-closing feature, and {{with or without}} damping systems). They are made of two parts: One part is the hinge cup and the arm, the other part is the mounting plate. Also called [...] "cup hinge", or [...] "Euro hinge", as they were developed in Europe and use metric installation standards. Most such <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges</b> offer the advantage of full in situ adjustability for standoff distance from the cabinet face as well as pitch and roll by means of two screws on each hinge.|$|R
5000|$|In short, {{there are}} mainly {{two types of}} <b>concealed</b> <b>hinge</b> jigs, [...] "push jigs" [...] and [...] "hole {{template}} jigs". Push jigs are used to hold the Forstner bit perpendicular to the door surface and a [...] "hole template jig" [...] it is simply used for marking {{the place of the}} pit hole, placing it parallel to the door edge.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{surviving}} in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, {{where they}} are usually called armills, are those of King Charles II, and the newest were created for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. The Elizabeth II Armills were presented to the Queen by the governments of various Commonwealth nations and are single-piece round bracelets made of 22 carat gold lined with crimson velvet, with a <b>concealed</b> <b>hinge</b> and spring catch. However most British monarchs have not worn armills when crowned.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{drilling}} jig is to hold a Forstner bit in place, at a 90º angle while drilling 3 cm pit hole. The angle of the tool is critical {{for the performance of}} <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges,</b> the jig allows maintaining the 90º angle over a number of drilling sessions.|$|R
50|$|The {{first product}} was a {{horseshoe}} stud, which averts horses from slipping. Then in 1958, the first furniture hinge was produced. The construction of <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges</b> started in 1964, and this essentially {{led to the}} entry into the furniture fittings industry. Today, Blum products are exported to more than 120 countries.|$|R
50|$|Wall safes are {{designed}} to provide hidden protection for documents and miscellaneous valuables. Adjustable depth allows the maximization of usable space when installed in different wall thicknesses. Some wall safes feature pry resistant recessed doors with <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges</b> for anti-theft protection. A painting can be hung over a wall safe to hide it from public view.|$|R
5000|$|He {{developed}} {{a new form of}} case, à charnières perdues (with <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges)</b> and a fixed bezel. Since these watches were rewound and set from the rear, the movement was protected from dust by an inner case. This new arrangement had the advantage of preventing access from the dial face, thus avoiding damaging it or the hands.|$|R
5000|$|For most <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges</b> to work properly, a pit hole must {{be created}} {{on the door}} at the point where it faces the static part of the hinge which is screwed to the inside wall of the wardrob [...]To create the pit hole, the jig must be fixed in place by means of the {{provided}} clamp, spin the Forstner bit by applying an electric hand-drill to its axle. The hole is drilled by pressing the hand-drill until a satisfactory pit hole is created.|$|R

5000|$|The Mark III Mini had a {{modified}} bodyshell with enough alterations {{to see the}} factory code change from ADO15 to ADO20 (which it shared with the Clubman). The most obvious changes were larger doors with <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges.</b> Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension reverted from Hydrolastic to rubber cones as a cost-saving measure. [...] (The 1275 GT and Clubman would retain the hydrolastic system until June 1971 when they, too, switched to the rubber cone suspension of the original Minis.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The Mark III Mini was {{launched}} in 1969, which was {{an updated version of}} Mark II with a modified bodyshell. The most visible changes were larger doors with <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges.</b> The boot lid lost the original hinged number plate and its recess shape and a large rear colour-coded lamp was fitted in its place, along with larger rear side windows. Sliding windows were replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension reverted from Hydrolastic to rubber cones. as a cost-saving measure. Production at the Cowley plant was ended, and the simple name [...] "Mini" [...] completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.|$|R
5000|$|The 1940 Torpedo had larger {{windows and}} wider seats than other Pontiacs, {{front and rear}} [...] "ventiplanes" [...] on 4-door sedans and long {{gracefully}} streamlined rear decks. <b>Concealed</b> <b>hinges</b> were used on all doors. The doors were extra wide. The hood ornament had a plastic Indian head mounted in a metal base. Front end sheet metal looked like that on other Pontiacs. Eight-cylinder badges were used front and rear. The door locks had weather sealed keyholes. Gas filler tubes were enclosed under [...] "flip-up" [...] lids on the left rear fenders. The window openings were trimmed with bright metal moldings. It was only available with the Inline 8-cylinder engine and either as a 4-passenger 2-door Sedan or a 5-passenger 4-door Sedan. A heater, cigarette lighter, six-tube radios, an electric clock, and a trunk light were all optional.|$|R
5000|$|Employing its {{experience}} with the steel bodies made in short runs since 1936 by then partly-owned subsidiary Park Ward the Car Division of Rolls-Royce offered their lowest priced chassis with a factory-supplied body all-steel {{so it could be}} exported all over the world. The factory bodies with a Gurney-Nutting-Blatchley refined shape were made by Pressed Steel Ltd of Cowley and sent to the Bentley works at Crewe for painting and fitting out with traditional wood and leather. They featured rear hinged [...] "suicide" [...] doors at the front with <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges,</b> a sliding sunroof, a permanently closed windscreen with a defrosting and demisting unit hidden in the scuttle and an electrically controlled heater beneath the front passenger's seat. Twin screenwipers were fitted and provision was made for the fitting of a radio with a short and flexibly mounted aerial that could be swung up above the centre of the screen.|$|R
50|$|Sliding bookcases {{have been}} {{installed}} by homeowners and builders. Sliding bookcases {{have been used}} to conceal rooms where marijuana growing operations have occurred. In Bradford Leigh, a hamlet in Wiltshire, England, police discovered a large hidden room with 600 cannabis plants that was <b>concealed</b> by a <b>hinged</b> bookcase.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, Maud {{is shocked}} to {{discover}} Madame de la Rougierre residing at Bartram-Haugh in the employ of Silas, and she suspects also that Dudley {{may not have}} fled. Despite strong protest by Maud, Madame is charged with accompanying her first to London, {{and then on to}} Dover and across the Channel. After falling asleep during the journey and being escorted under the cover of darkness, Maud awakes to find herself again at Bartram-Haugh: she had in fact been on a round trip to London and back. Maud finds herself now imprisoned in one of the mansion's many bedrooms under the guard of Madame de la Rougierre, whilst everyone suspects she is in France. Remembering the earlier warnings of her cousin, Lady Knollys, she refuses to drink any of the drugged claret intended for her; instead, Madame de la Rougierre, ignorant of Silas' true intentions, partakes of it and promptly falls asleep on Maud's bed. Later that night, Dudley scales the building and enters the unlit room; the window he uses is set upon <b>concealed</b> <b>hinges</b> that allow it to be opened only from the outside. Hidden out of sight, Maud witnesses Dudley brutally murder Madame de la Rougierre by mistake in the near-darkness. Uncle Silas enters the room, having been waiting outside; as he does this, Maud slips out undetected. Assisted by Dickon Hawkes' daughter, whom Maud had befriended during her stay, she is swiftly conveyed by carriage to Lady Knolly's estate, and away from Bartram-Haugh.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Elf and the Hornet {{went through}} three engine versions. Initially, {{they used the}} [...] engine (engine type 8WR) with a single HS2 carburettor, {{changing}} to a single HS2 carburettor [...] version of the Cooper's [...] power unit (engine type 9WR) in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car's top speed from 71 to 77 mph. Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power {{in the form of}} front drum brakes with twin leading shoes to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with rod gear change, a.k.a. [...] "magic wand" [...] type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. <b>Concealed</b> door <b>hinges</b> were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the rod type, as seen on all later Mini type cars. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built. Production of both models ceased in late 1969.|$|R
5000|$|The arena {{itself was}} 83 meters by 48 meters (272 ft by 157 ft / 280 by 163 Roman feet). It {{comprised}} a wooden floor covered by sand (the Latin word for sand is harena or arena), covering an elaborate underground structure called the hypogeum (literally meaning [...] "underground"). The hypogeum {{was not part}} of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian. Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the hypogeum is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces <b>concealed</b> underneath; larger <b>hinged</b> platforms, called hegmata, provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.|$|R
