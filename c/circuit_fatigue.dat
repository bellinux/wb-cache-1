Through it an electric current is applied to liquid crystal display (LCD) from the main board of cellular phone. In thin Cu foils of flexible PCB fatigue cracks due to repeated bending motion generate and propagate, and they cause a short <b>circuit.</b> <b>Fatigue</b> behavior of thin Cu foils being used for flexible PCB must be evaluated and confirmed to resolve this problem. It is based on findings by several researches that the mechanical properties of thin film materials {{differ from those of}} their bulk counterparts. Thin film properties have been investigated over the last years; however fatigue behavior of thin films has not yet been studied as thoroughly as monotonic behavior. In this study fatigue properties of thin Cu foils for the application in flexible PCB are obtained. Fatigue testing was performed for two kinds of Cu foils that were made by rolling and electrochemical procedures respectively. Differences of fabrications in fatigue behavior of thin foils were distinguished. Especially for rolled Cu foils, effects of rolling directions in fatigue properties were evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Austenitic {{pipes and}} other safety-relevant {{components}} of primary circuits in pressurized water reactors {{are subject to}} thermo-mechanical load cycles. Temperature gradients, turbulences and vibrations inside the circuit cause both low and high cycle fatigue and lead to microstructural changes and microcracks in the material. As of 2012, direct monitoring of this fatigue has not been implemented in German nuclear power plants. It would therefore be desirable to develop a monitoring concept based on established non-destructive testing techniques which {{would allow us to}} detect and Interpret microstructural material changes before macro-cracks occur. Electro-magnetic ultrasonic transducers (EMATs) are a promising technology for that purpose because they are high-temperature compatible and because the ultrasonic signal is sensitive to most microstructural changes that can appear during fatigue. For several years, Fraunhofer IZFP and the Materials Science Institute of TU Kaiserslautern have been closely collaborating in several major projects dedicated to this problem. Both low and high cycle fatigue tests were performed, thus representing the real fatigue processes occurring inside the surge line of a primary <b>circuit.</b> During <b>fatigue</b> tests on austenitic specimens at realistic temperature, ultrasonic in situ measurements were carried out, In which the measured Parameters were the ultrasonic amplitude and time of flight. Characteristic changes in cyclic deformation behavior as well as in these Parameters were observed. It is shown that these results can constitute the basis for a target-oriented structural monitoring concept and proactive aging management...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of fatigue upon kicking maximal ball velocity and the target-hitting accuracy of soccer players; and also to examine the effect of the knowledge of the exercise duration upon these two parameters. Methods: Twenty-four semi-professional soccer players participated in this study and performed maximal instep kicks before and after the implementation of an exercise protocol, either with or without knowledge of the duration of this protocol. Results: A mixed model of analysis of variance showed that kicking maximal ball velocity was significantly affected (F(5, 85) [*]=[*] 11. 6; p[*]less than[*] 0. 001; η 2 [*]=[*] 0. 39) but only after just one <b>circuit</b> of the <b>fatigue</b> protocol and then remained similar. Accuracy did not change during the protocol (F(5, 75) [*]=[*] 0. 23; p[*]=[*] 0. 76; η 2 [*]=[*] 0. 03) and knowing the duration of exercitation did not affect accuracy and velocity development (F(1, 23) [*]≤[*] 1. 04; p[*]≥[*] 0. 32; η 2 [*]≤[*] 0. 06). Conclusion: These findings demonstrated the potential negative effects of fatigue on kicking ball velocity in soccer but not in the kicking accuracy and that the effect of fatigue may not be progressive over time.

40|$|IN {{the legend}} of Milo, there is a {{description}} of him lifting a calf every day until it grew into a bull. So there is evidence in ancient times that the principles of progressive resis-tance exertises and circuit forms of training were known. Subsequently much experi-mental work has proved that skeletal muscle responds to contraction against system-atically increased load by both increase in power and hypertrophy and also that the' capability of prolonged repetition of,. action is increased following circuit methods of training. -Progressive resistance exercises and progressive repetition method are now applied on a scientific basis to develop muscle power and · capability, and to increase circulo-,respiratory function, i. e. stamina, strength and endurance. The purpose of circuit training in recruit training is to develop general rather than specific muscle group fitness and also to enable large numbers of heterogeneous recruits to train together. Basic physical tr~ining in any group, should result in muscle suppleness, relaxation,' quality of movement (agility) and in the increase of power. It should also aim at the ultiinate stage in the acquisition of any skill which {{is the ability to}} still perform correctly even if <b>fatigued.</b> <b>Circuit</b> training is a form of progressive training towards this concept of acquirin...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} energy {{efficient}} microprocessors has stimulated research into nonvolatile logic design, with ferroelectrics (FE) {{as the prime}} candidate technology. In spite of the large FE polarization compared to CMOS charge, present hybrid designs show low differential signals. In this thesis, the question of signal improvement in hybrid FE-CMOS circuits is explored with physical modeling, simulations and experiments. To simulate FE behavior with arbitrary voltage or current input signals, we present a unified physical model of polarization switching based on the stochastic geometry of nucleation and growth. The model is first constructed for ideal FE capacitors with infinite area, and then extended to include the realistic effects of device scaling, domain growth anisotropy, disorder, imprint and <b>fatigue.</b> <b>Circuit</b> predictions for three classes of FE nonvolatile latches are experimentally verified. Design intuition for signal timing, sensing margins and reliability degradation in each topology is presented. The design space limitations are analysed and two new techniques with improved differential signals, mismatch and imprint tolerance as well as FE layout area requirement are proposed and experimentally verified. A novel single-transistor memory is proposed which combines the complementary characteristics of FE and flash memory. The FE polarization dynamics naturally establish a two-step process - fast FE switching followed by slow charge injection. This proposal is evaluated with simulations and verified with device fabrication and measurements. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} into fatigue under multiaxial stress, and also cumulative damage under uniaxial stress, {{are discussed in}} conjunction with the parameters relevant to the present experimental investigation. A biaxial fatigue machine is described which can subject thin wall tubes to combinations of fluctuating internal pressure and either fluctuating longitudinal tension or compression covering the complete ++ and +- stress quadrants. The machine is also provided with independent eight stage programmers in both pressure <b>circuits.</b> Constant amplitude <b>fatigue</b> tests have been carried out on thin wall aluminium alloy (2 L 65) tubular specimens over the complete,++ and +- stress quadrants. V, 4 new equation for predicting the fatigue failure of ductile metals under multiaxial stress is proposed based on the maximum range of shear stress modified for the effects of the normal stress acting on the maximum shear stress plane and of anisotropy. ý' This equation is shown to give excellent agreement with all published data on fatigue under uniaxial stress and multiaxial stress viz. combined bending and twisting and thin and thick wall cylinder data. A simplified equation, neglecting the effect of the range of normal stress, is suggested for design purposes. Two level biaxial block programme tests, at constant and two step principal stress ratio, have also been carried out on the same aluminium alloy. The results of these tests are discussed with reference to the cumulative damage theories of. failure developed for the case of uniaxial fatigue stress. A new approach to fatigue ana...|$|R
40|$|Background: Artistic Gymnastics is a sport where {{athletes are}} {{frequently}} fatigued. One element that might influence this aspect is carbohydrate, an important energy substrate for the muscles and the CNS. Our {{goal was to}} investigate the influence of fatigue over artistic gymnastics athlete's performance and the effects of a carbohydrate supplementation on their performance. Methods: We evaluated 15 athletes divided in 2 groups (control and fatigue) from 12 to 14 years old in two different experimental days. On the first day (water day), they did 5 sets of exercises on the balance beam (experimental protocol) ingesting only water, CG (control group) warmed up before the experimental protocol and FG (fatigue group) did a <b>fatigue</b> <b>circuit,</b> warm up exercises and then the experimental protocol. On the second day (carbohydrate day), we used the same protocol but CG ingested a sugar free flavored juice and FG ingested a 20 % concentration maltodextrin solution before the protocol on the balance beam. Results: We observed a greater number of falls from the balance beam from the FG on the first day (5. 40 ± 1. 14 FG vs 3. 33 ± 1. 37 CG; p = 0. 024) and a {{decrease in the number of}} falls on the second day (2. 29 ± 1. 25 FG water day vs 5. 40 ± 1. 14 FG carbohydrate day; p = 0. 0013). Carbohydrate solution was able to supply muscle demands and improve the athlete's focus showed by the reduced number of falls. © 2013 Batatinha et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Power {{electronics}} are an {{enabling technology}} {{and play a}} critical role in the establishment of an environmentally-friendly and sustainable low carbon economy. The electrification of passenger vehicles is one way of achieving this goal. It is well acknowledged that Electric vehicles (EVs) have inherent advantages over the conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles owing to the absence of emissions, high efficiency, and quiet and smooth operation. Over the last 20 years, EVs have improved significantly in their system integration, dynamic performance and cost. It has attracted much attention in research communities as well as in the market. In 2011 electric vehicle sales were estimated to reach about 20, 000 units worldwide, increasing to more than 500, 000 units by 2015 and 1. 3 million by 2020 which accounts for 1. 8 per cent of the total number of passenger vehicles expected to be sold that year. In general, electric vehicles use electric motors for traction drive, power converters for energy transfer and control, and batteries, fuel cells, ultracapacitors, or flywheels for energy storage. These are the core elements of the electric power drive train and thus are desired to provide high reliability over the lifetime of the vehicle. One of the vulnerable components in an electric power drive train is the IGBT switching devices in an inverter. During the operation, IGBT power modules will experience high mechanical and thermal stresses which lead to bond wire lift-off and solder joint fatigue faults. Theses stresses can lead to malfunctions of the IGBT power modules. A short-circuit or open-circuit in any of the power modules may result in an instantaneous loss of traction power, which is dangerous for the driver and other road users. These reliability issues are very complex in their nature and demand for the development of analytical models and experimental validation. This work is set out to develop an online measurement technique for health monitoring of IGBT and freewheeling diodes inside the power modules. The technique can provide an early warning prior to a power device failure. Bond wire lift-off and solder fatigue are the two most frequently occurred faults in power electronic modules. The former increases the forward voltage drop across the terminals of the power device while the latter increase the thermal resistance of the solder layers. As a result, bond wire lift-off can be detected by a highly sensitive and fast operating in-situ monitoring <b>circuit.</b> Solder joint <b>fatigue</b> is detected by measuring the thermal impedance of the power modules. This thesis focuses on the design and optimisation of the in-situ health monitoring circuit in an attempt to reducing noise, temperature variations and measurement uncertainties. Experimental work is carried out on a set of various IGBT power modules that have been modified to account for different testing requirements. Then the lifetime of the power module can be estimated on this basis. The proposed health monitoring system can be integrated into the existing IGBT driver circuits and can also be applied to other applications such as industrial drives, aerospace and renewable energy.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this PhD thesis work is the computational thermal hydraulic analysis of ITER and DEMO fusion reactors PHTSs; the performances of the cooling loops have been evaluated during normal operation pulsed condition (ITER) and accidental scenario (DEMO). The fusion reaction, {{which is at the}} basis of current tokamak machines, is briefly reported together with a description of the current design status for ITER and DEMO fusion reactors. Also some existing experimental facilities, aimed to test some of the fusion reactors cooling system features, are briefly presented. Then the ITER in-vessel components PHTS (IBED PHTS) is analyzed through the RELAP 5 code during plasma pulse scenario. During the pulsed plasma operation, the pressure and temperature variation within the IBED PHTS shall be controlled and maintained within an acceptable range of values to avoid both potential dangerous pressure fluctuation within the <b>circuit</b> and thermal <b>fatigue</b> to the loop piping and equipment. A set of countermeasure to control the IBED PHTS pressure and temperature and mitigate their fluctuation during the plasma operation is simulated through RELAP 5 and obtained results are shown and discussed. Finally, a temperature and pressure control strategy is proposed, also addressing possible criticalities to be carefully evaluated during the design activities. The reference PHTS layout for DEMO HCPB concept is analyzed, together with its auxiliaries systems, through a novel analytical method, the Functional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis at component level with evaluation of loss of function. The {{objective of}} the FMEA is to analyze the system and its functions and identify possible failure mode associated to the loss of function and hence define representative accidental scenarios to be further investigated. As result of this analysis a set of Postulated Initiating Events is identified and the possible accidental chain sequences discussed in detail, also specifying the severity of the events (e. g. Large and Small Break LOCA). Hence the DEMO PHTS ex-vessel LOCA, one of the identified Postulated Initiating Event in the FMEA, is analyzed by means of MELCOR code. The purpose of the analyses is to evaluate the influence of size and location of the break in terms of pressurization of the pressure confinement system of DEMO. In this section, together with the reference PHTS layout, an alternative loop configuration, whose design has been entirely developed within the thesis activities, is proposed and modeled. Here the dynamic behavior of the pressure and flow rate of the two PHTS layouts is compared, highlighting in which cases (i. e. for which break size and layout) mitigating actions, such as prompt loop isolation through safety valve activation or atmosphere detritiation, can be performed effectively. In the conclusions a rationale for the future fusion reactors PHTS is formulated {{on the basis of the}} consideration rising from the results collected in this work. Here The PHTS control strategy to be adopted to cope with the pulsed regime is discussed; some remarks on potential critical aspect associated to the pulsed operation are highlighted. Emphasis is given also to the preventive PHTS design features which might enhance the overall safety of the reactor. ...|$|R
