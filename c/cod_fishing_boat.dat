Lowensohn noted the service's speed and intelligence, {{especially}} {{in its ability to}} sort unorganized photos, as well as its photo loading times, search speeds, and simple photo editing tools. Kastrenakes compared the service's new image analysis to technology unveiled by Flickr earlier in the same month. Mossberg thought the face grouping feature was [...] "remarkably accurate", but was most impressed by the subject-based grouping. He was surprised that a search for [...] "boats" [...] found both Cape <b>Cod</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> and Venetian gondolas, but also noted errors such as a professional photograph registering as a screenshot.|$|R
5|$|Serving as {{the convoy}} {{flagship}} for Convoy HX-50, Otranto departed New York on 25 September. Six days later, {{on the evening}} of 1 October, the ship accidentally rammed the French fishing schooner Croisine off Newfoundland while the latter was returning home to St. Malo with a full load of <b>cod.</b> The <b>fishing</b> <b>boat</b> passed down the liner's port side and its masts destroyed some of the liner's lifeboats on that side. Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of the convoy, ordered the convoy to continue while Otranto stopped to rescue the 37 survivors. The derelict Croisine was now a menace to navigation and Davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening. The liner caught back up with the convoy by daybreak. The following day, the first death from the influenza pandemic occurred and the soldier was buried at sea. Only one other flu death aboard Otranto is recorded, but others may have occurred before she met her end.|$|R

50|$|In the 16th century, as a {{consequence}} of the attacks suffered in this area, or for other reasons, the whales migrated to other places. Whale hunters from Lapurdi therefore crossed the Atlantic Ocean in pursuit of them, and they spent some time in the Labrador Peninsula and in Newfoundland (island). Later, instead of hunting whales, they started <b>cod</b> <b>fishing</b> in Newfoundland. A century later, due to the ban on fishing off the coasts of America and the steely competence of English and Dutch fishermen, the number of <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> from Biarritz diminished and nowadays, the Biarritz fishing industry in these areas has come to an end.|$|R

The Northwestern {{was one of the few}} vessels to fish for Blue King Crab in 2009 after completing its Red King Crab season. During the summer, the vessel keeps busy tendering (transporting fish from the vessels at sea to the floating processors, allowing the <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> to stay on the grounds rather than make repeated trips back to port) salmon and herring, usually under the command of Edgar Hansen.|$|R

Cod fillets were stored in ice (0 ± 0. 2 °C) or partially frozen (- 3 ± 0. 1 °C) for various time intervals {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the two methods in preserving fish freshness. The criteria employed for the evaluation of biochemical deterioration were changes in (i) extractable protein, (ii) free amino acids, (iii) "extracellular area", (iv) levels of TMAO-N, TMA-N, and DMA-N, (v) free drip and (vi) cell fragility. [...] Freezing point and melting point measurements of the muscle fluids or blood plasma derived from <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> acclimated to cold temperature (0 °C) or from <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> caught in the winter months demonstrated thermal hysteresis, unlike similar samples derived from <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> acclimated to warm temperature (10 °C) or <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> maintained at ambient water temperature caught in the summer months. This finding implies that antifreeze proteins are present in the muscle fluid of <b>cod</b> <b>fish</b> when the habitat temperature is low, but absent when the habitat temperature is high. [...] Partial freezing proved to be a more effective method of minimizing biochemical damage than ice storage as judged by the capacity of the partially frozen samples (i) to retain relatively higher levels of extractable protein, (ii) to exhibit less depletion of free amino acids, (iii) to form relatively lower levels of TMA and DMA, (iv) less increase in extracellular area, and (v) to maintain better consumer acceptability during sensory evaluation studies...|$|R

25|$|Artisan <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> {{are usually}} small {{traditional}} <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> appropriately {{designed for use}} on their local inland waters or coasts. Many localities {{around the world have}} developed their own traditional types of <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> adapted to use local materials suitable for boat building and to the specific requirements of the fisheries and sea conditions in their area. Artisan boats are often open (undecked). Many have sails, but they do not usually use much, or any mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan <b>fishing</b> <b>boats</b> are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines. For example, Indonesia has reported about 700,000 <b>fishing</b> <b>boats,</b> 25 percent of which are dugout canoes, and half of which are without motors. The Philippines have reported a similar number of small <b>fishing</b> <b>boats.</b> Many of the boats in this area are double-outrigger craft, consisting of a narrow main hull with two attached outriggers, commonly known as jukung in Indonesia and banca in the Philippines.|$|R
