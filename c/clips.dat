40|$|<b>Clipping</b> {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction schemes for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Deliberately <b>clipping</b> the transmission signal degrades system performance, and <b>clipping</b> mitigation is required at the receiver for information restoration. In this work, we acknowledge the sparse nature of the <b>clipping</b> signal and propose a low-complexity Bayesian <b>clipping</b> estimation scheme. The proposed scheme utilizes a priori information about the sparsity rate and noise variance for enhanced recovery. At the same time, the proposed scheme is robust against inaccurate estimates of the <b>clipping</b> signal statistics. The undistorted phase property of the <b>clipped</b> signal, as well as the <b>clipping</b> likelihood, is utilized for enhanced reconstruction. Further, motivated by the nature of modern OFDM-based communication systems, we extend our <b>clipping</b> reconstruction approach to multiple antenna receivers, and multi-user OFDM. We also address the problem of channel estimation from pilots contaminated by the <b>clipping</b> distortion. Numerical findings are presented, that depict favourable results for the proposed scheme compared to the established sparse reconstruction schemes...|$|R
40|$|Waveform <b>clipping</b> is {{a common}} problem in digital audio signal processing. <b>Clipping</b> effect changes the audio {{amplitude}} distribution and brings noise, which results in the decrease of audio signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To estimate the degree of <b>clipping</b> effect, we propose a method for SNR estimation of <b>clipped</b> signals base on audio amplitude distribution. We first locate the <b>clipping</b> intervals of audio signal with high precision based on {{the differences between the}} amplitude probability density functions (PDFs) of normal and <b>clipped</b> audio signals. Then, the <b>clipped</b> amplitude PDF is restored using Gamma distribution to estimate the non-clipped amplitude distribution. Finally, based on the restored PDF, the estimated SNR of distorted audio signals are calculated, which can indicate the degree of <b>clipping</b> effect. Experiments on 3200 audios show that our approach can achieve a low error of 0. 017 in <b>clipped</b> values locating, and an error less than 0. 5 dB in SNR estimation.
