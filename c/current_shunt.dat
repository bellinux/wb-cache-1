5000|$|Current sense {{amplifiers}} (also called <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> amplifiers) are special-purpose amplifiers that output {{a voltage}} {{proportional to the}} current flowing in a power rail. They utilize a [...] "current-sense resistor" [...] to convert the load current in the power rail to a small voltage, which is then amplified by the current-sense amplifiers. The currents in the power rail {{can be in the}} range of 1 A to 20 A, requiring the current-sense resistor to be a resistor typically in the range of 1 to 100 mΩ. These amplifiers are designed to amplify a very small [...] "sense voltage" [...] of 10 to 100 mV, in the presence of very large common-mode voltages of 5 to 30 V. DC precision (low input offset voltage) and high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) are distinguishing characteristics of these amplifiers. Some current sense amplifiers measure current flowing in a single direction; bidirectional amplifiers measure current flow in both directions through the sense resistor.|$|E
50|$|Every {{field bus}} segment needs exactly two terminators to operate properly. The terminators are {{designed}} to be the equivalent of a 1 µF capacitor and a 100 Ω resistor in series. The terminators serve several purposes including shunting the Fieldbus current(device communication) and protecting against electrical reflections.The primary function of terminators is to act as a <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> for the control network. Fieldbus communication works by the field device modulating its current draw. When the devices need to transmit data, the FF devices will act as a current sink. The devices will draw less current to represent a high signal (1, one) and draw more current to represent a low signal (0, zero). As the modulating current of the FF devices is between 15 mA and 20 mA peak to peak, while the modulating voltage in the bus caused by this modulating current is between 0.75 V and 1 V peak to peak. This 0.75 and 1 V is simply a result of the 15 mA x 50 Ω which equal to 0.75 V and 20 mA x 50 Ω which is equal to 1 V. The 50 Ω resistor is an equivalent of two parallel resistors from the FF terminator. Because of all devices use the same cable, only one device can transmit a message at any given time. Without the proper number of terminators, the signal level will be out of specification and can disrupt the network. Because of all devices use the same cable, only one device can transmit a message at any given time.|$|E

The standards for LF {{voltage and current}} are established by assigning AC-DC transfer difference to thermal devices i. e. thermal converter (TC) or thermal transfer standard (TTS) alongwith <b>current</b> <b>shunts.</b> Automated calibration systems have been developed using Null and Budovsky's techniques for calibration of precision calibrator for LF voltage and current using thermal devices (TC/TTS) alongwith <b>current</b> <b>shunts.</b> The technique based on the Algorithm developed by Dr. Ilya Budovsky (N.

The following features were revealed. The <b>shunting</b> <b>current</b> increases with increasing transport current and with increasing crack size. At low voltage where <b>shunting</b> <b>current</b> is low, the transport current of cracked sample normalized {{with respect to the}} transport current in non-cracked state is described with the modified ratio of non-cracked area to overall cross-sectional area of superconducting layer. At high voltage where the <b>shunting</b> <b>current</b> is high, the normalized transport current becomes higher than the modified ratio of non-cracked area. The increase in <b>shunting</b> <b>current</b> with transport current (and voltage) leads to a decrease in n-value at high current (voltage). This phenomenon is enhanced by crack extension...|$|R
50|$|The {{common and}} simple {{approach}} to current sensing {{is the use}} of a shunt resistor. The voltage drop across the shunt is proportional to its current flow. Both alternating currents (AC) and direct currents (DC) can be measured with the shunt resistor.The high performance coaxial shunt have been widely used for many applications fast rise-time transient currents and high amplitudes but, highly integrated electronic devices prefer low-cost surface mounted devices (SMDs), because of their small sizes and relatively low prices.The parasitic inductance present in the shunt affects high precision current measurement. Although this affects only the magnitude of the impedance at relatively high frequency, but also its effect on the phase at line frequency causes a noticeable error at a low power factor. The low cost and high reliability make the low resistance <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> a very popular choice for current measurement system. The major disadvantage of using the shunt is that fundamentally a shunt is a resistive element, the power loss is thus proportional to the square of the current passing through it and consequently it is a rarity amongst high current measurements.Fast-response for measuring high-impulse or heavy-surge currents is the common requirement for shunt resistors. In 1981 Malewski, designed a circuit to eliminate the skin effect and later in 1999 the flap-strap sandwich shunt (FSSS) was introduced from a flat-strap sandwich resistor. The properties of the FSSS in terms of response time, power loss and frequency characteristics, are the same as the shunt resistor but the cost is lower and the construction technique is less sophisticated, compared to Malewski and the coaxial shunt.|$|E

The temperature dependency of the <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> from 5 ºC up to 50 ºC has been investigated.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of zinc-oxide material in 1968 much research has been directed towards the characterisation of the electrical behaviour of the material under various stress conditions. An aim {{of some of these}} investigations is to achieve an equivalent circuit representation, which adequately simulates the observed test results. An adequate equivalent circuit representation will aid the reliable and efficient design of the overvoltage protection and help to improve the optimisation of the protective devices. A significant impediment to the accurate characterisation of zinc oxide has been the lack of reliable test data especially for fast-rate-of-rise impulses in the microsecond and sub-microsecond range. The measurement of current impulses in this range is highly influenced by the circuit arrangement and measurement transducer characteristics. In this work, a non-inductive coaxial <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> was designed and constructed. The fast impulse tubular <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> was based on the nickel chromium resistive material with a designed value of 5 mâ„¦ and 10 kA current capability.

40|$|A B-spline neural networks-based {{adaptive}} control technique for angular speed reference trajectory tracking tasks with highly efficient performance for direct <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> motors is proposed. A methodology for {{adaptive control}} and its proper training procedure are introduced. This algorithm sets the control signal without using a detailed mathematical model nor exact {{values of the}} parameters of the nonlinear dynamic system. The proposed robust adaptive tracking control scheme only requires measurements of the velocity output signal. Thus, real-time measurements or estimations of acceleration, current and disturbance signals are avoided. Experimental results confirm the efficient and robust performance of the proposed control approach for highly demanding motor operation conditions exposed to variable-speed reference trajectories and completely unknown load torque. Hence, laboratory experimental tests on a direct <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> motor prove the viability of the proposed adaptive output feedback trajectory tracking control approach...|$|E

Published results are used to validate the simulation data of a single stack. Three setups of pipe networks are evaluated using the model. The pipe connections between the stacks give rise to external <b>shunt</b> <b>currents,</b> which also increase the amount of <b>shunt</b> <b>currents</b> within the stacks.

The electrical performance is mainly described by measuring both cell short circuit current and open circuit voltage. The measurements of this cell by using multimeters suffer from some problems because the cell has high current intensity with low output voltage. So, the solar cell short circuit current values are obtained by measuring the voltage developed across a known resistance <b>Current</b> <b>Shunt.</b> Samples of the obtained current values are accurately calibrated by using a Micropotentiometer (μpot) thermal element (TE) to validate this new measuring technique.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} effects of <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> on rats with {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy and neocortex epilepsy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A kainic acid (KA) -induced model of temporal lobe seizure and a penicillin-induced model of neocortical partial seizure were used in this study. Rats of each model were randomly allocated into two groups: control and model groups. The model group was further divided into the KA or penicillin group, sham conduction group and conduction group. The <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> was realized through the implantation of a customized conduction electrode. After surgery, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for two hours for each rat under anesthesia. Subsequently, the rats were video monitored for 72 h to detect the occurrence of behavioral seizures upon awakening. The average number and duration of seizures on EEG and the number of behavioral seizures were measured. RESULTS: In KA model, the number of total EEG seizures in conduction group (9. 57 ± 2. 46) was significantly less than that in sham conduction group (15. 13 ± 3. 45) (p< 0. 01). The duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (26. 13 ± 7. 81 s) was significantly shorter than that in sham conduction group (34. 17 ± 7. 25 s) (p =  0. 001). A significant reduction of behavioral seizures was observed in the conduction group compared with KA (p =  0. 000) and sham conduction groups (p =  0. 000). In penicillin model, there was a 61 % reduction in total EEG seizures in conduction group compared with sham conduction group (p< 0. 01), and the duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (6. 29 ± 2. 64 s) was significantly shorter than that in the sham conduction group (12. 07 ± 3. 81 s) (p =  0. 002). A significant reduction of behavioral seizures was observed in conduction group compared with penicillin (p< 0. 01) and sham conduction groups (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: <b>Current</b> <b>shunt</b> effectively reduces the onset and severity of seizures. <b>Current</b> <b>shunt</b> therapy could be an effective alternative minimally invasive approach for temporal lobe epilepsy and neocortex epilepsy...|$|E
