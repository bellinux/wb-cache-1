5|$|Samora Machel became Mozambique's first president. The Reverend Uria Simango, his wife, {{and other}} FRELIMO dissidents {{were arrested in}} 1975 and {{detained}} without trial. Within about two years, fighting resumed with the Mozambican Civil War against RENAMO insurgents plied with Rhodesian and South African military support. Industrial and social recession, Marxist-style totalitarianism, corruption, poverty, inequality and failed <b>central</b> <b>planning</b> eroded the initial revolutionary fervour. Peace returned only in 1992, when the nation achieved relative stability {{for the first time}} in several decades.|$|E
5|$|Between 1910 and 1916, Hand {{tried to}} {{translate}} his political philosophy into political action. Having read Croly's The Promise of American Life and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in {{economic and social}} issues, he joined the Progressive Party. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with {{his role as a}} judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in <b>central</b> <b>planning</b> resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.|$|E

50|$|Romberg’s {{complex and}} varied {{approach}} to the <b>central</b> <b>plan</b> suggests a secure grounding in historical precedent (a subject he taught at RMIT in the late 1940s) and possibly some knowledge of the immensely influential text by Rudolf Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism, first published in 1949 which dealt with both Palladian geometry and the <b>central</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|R
25|$|Those who {{defend the}} {{combination}} of traditional regulation and <b>central</b> <b>planning</b> for the electricity sector, like Hampton, often base their arguments on the basic premise that electricity is an essential good required for consumer well-being. According to Hampton, <b>central</b> <b>planning</b> and regulation are required to ensure reliability in both the supply and delivery and the generation and infrastructure aspects. Whereas planning under a market regime is profit-driven, <b>central</b> <b>planning</b> can ensure that Ontario's best interests are being attended to {{and not just the}} interests of private investors. Stephan Schott, for example, has stated that, at least theoretically, state ownership of the electricity sector could satisfy all of the criteria for socially efficient and environmentally sustainable electricity production. This includes fully internalizing external social costs of electricity production and pricing electricity according to demand fluctuations, even while maintaining stable supply.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{economic}} policy after independence {{was influenced by}} the colonial experience, which was seen as exploitative by Indian leaders exposed to British social democracy and the planned economy of the Soviet Union. Domestic policy tended towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialisation, economic interventionism, a large government-run public sector, business regulation, and <b>central</b> <b>planning,</b> while trade and foreign investment policies were relatively liberal. Five-Year Plans of India resembled <b>central</b> <b>planning</b> in the Soviet Union. Steel, mining, machine tools, telecommunications, insurance, and power plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s.|$|E
25|$|The GATT/WTO {{framework}} led {{participating countries}} {{to reduce their}} tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Governments shifted their economies from <b>central</b> <b>planning</b> to markets. These internal reforms allowed enterprises to adapt more quickly and exploit opportunities created by technology shifts.|$|E
50|$|In {{the period}} {{spanning}} {{the beginning of}} the Fourth Plan to the Seventh Plan, the dependence of the states on <b>Central</b> <b>Plan</b> Assistance for financing their Plan outlays has been declining for all states. Despite this trend, the low income states depended heavily on <b>Central</b> <b>Plan</b> assistance for funding their outlays, despite this assistance increasing considerably after the modification made to the Gadgil formula. Also, it has been seen that the states with a higher per capita outlay are usually the high income states. Therefore, unless the distribution of the <b>Central</b> <b>Plan</b> assistance is made sharply progressive, narrowing down of inter State differentials in per capita outlays will be impossible.|$|R

25|$|Indian {{economic}} policy after independence {{was influenced by}} the colonial experience (which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature) and by those leaders' exposure to Fabian socialism. Policy tended towards protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution, industrialisation under state monitoring, state intervention at the micro level in all businesses especially in labour and financial markets, a large public sector, business regulation, and <b>central</b> <b>planning.</b> Five-Year Plans of India resembled <b>central</b> <b>planning</b> in the Soviet Union. Steel, mining, machine tools, water, telecommunications, insurance, and electrical plants, among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s. Elaborate licences, regulations and the accompanying red tape, commonly referred to as Licence Raj, were required to set up business in India between 1947 and 1990.|$|E
