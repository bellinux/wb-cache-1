40|$|This is the Rivers Avon & Erme Salmon Action Plan Consultation {{document}} {{produced by}} the Environment Agency in 2003. This document {{is part of a}} national initiative to produce action plans for the management of all the main salmon rivers of England and Wales by 2003. The aim of this plan is (i) to assess the status of the salmon stocks and fisheries of the rivers Avon and Erme - including the use of <b>Conservation</b> <b>Limits</b> as part of this process, (ii) to identify factors which may limiting stock and fishery performance and (iii) to propose remedial measures address these factors. The report pays attention on the external consultation of the Rivers Avon & Erme Salmon Action Plan (SAP). While the stocks of both rivers have exceeded their respective <b>conservation</b> <b>limits</b> occasionally in individual years, only the Erme has achieved a period of statistical compliance since 1993. It is possible that this situation is largely normal, due to the steep nature of the rivers, obstructions to migration and dependence on suitable flow conditions occurring at the right time of year. The decline of the spring-running component of the stocks has left the populations dependent on autumn flows for the success of the late running component. Actions required to improve compliance with <b>Conservation</b> <b>Limits</b> are proposed and prioritised. The urgent actions relate to the need to improve the consistency with which adequate numbers of salmon reach and utilise fully all the accessible areas of the river systems. This document is intended to be dynamic, with opportunities for review occurring at regular intervals. For example, as the science of fisheries management improves, particularly in the setting of <b>Conservation</b> <b>Limits,</b> so the targets may be altered to reflect any improved methodology...|$|R

50|$|The Six Mile Water {{is famous}} for its trout fishing. It has brown trout, salmon and dollaghan. Salmon had {{virtually}} disappeared from the river by {{the early part of the}} 20th century. Local anglers, concerned about the poor state of the river, formed the Antrim and District Angling Association in the late 1950s. They identified the main problems as pollution, habitat degradation through drainage works and obstructions, mainly weirs built in the 19th century for water power to supply the numerous mills in the area. Regulations to control methods of fishing and number of fish caught, together with protection of the river from poaching and pollution enabled native brown trout and dollaghan numbers to improve substantially by the 1970s. By 2004 over 200 salmon were caught by anglers in that year. The run of salmon in 2004 into the river probably exceeded its <b>Conservation</b> <b>Limit</b> for the first time in over 100 years.|$|E

At present there is no means of accurately assessing the River Exe salmon run. In common with many other rivers, estimation of stock using catch statistics and rod exploitation rate is the model used, when direct assessment is not possible.

40|$|Carrier {{multiplication}} by {{generation of}} two or more electron-hole pairs following the absorption of a single photon may lead to improved photovoltaic efficiencies and has been observed in nanocrystals made from a variety of semiconductors, including silicon. However, with few exceptions, these reports have been based on indirect ultrafast techniques. Here, we present evidence of carrier multiplication in closely spaced silicon nanocrystals contained in a silicon dioxide matrix by measuring enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield. As the photon energy increases, the quantum yield is expected to remain constant, or to decrease as a result of new trapping and recombination channels being activated. Instead, we observe a step-like increase in quantum yield for larger photon energies that is characteristic of carrier multiplication. Modelling suggests that carrier multiplication is occurring with high efficiency and close to the energy <b>conservation</b> <b>limit...</b>|$|E
40|$|Angular {{momentum}} transport {{by internal}} magnetic fields {{is an important}} ingredient for stellar interior models. In this paper we critically examine the basic heuristic assumptions in {{the model of the}} Tayler-Spruit dynamo, which describes how a pinch-type instability of a toroidal magnetic field in differentially rotating stellar radiative zones may result in large-scale fluid motion. We agree with prior published work both on the existence of the instability and its nearly horizontal geometry for perturbations. However, the approximations in the original Acheson dispersion relation are valid only for small length scales, and we disagree that the dispersion relation can be extrapolated to horizontal length scales of order the radius of the star. We contend that dynamical effects, in particular angular momentum <b>conservation,</b> <b>limit</b> the maximum horizontal length scale. We therefore present transport coefficients for chemical mixing and angular momentum redistribution by magnetic torques that are significantly different from previous published values.

40|$|The use of {{management}} targets {{as a tool}} to ensure that salmon fisheries are sustainable is a core part of modern salmon fisheries management. A management target provides us with a benchmark telling us how many salmon has to spawn in a particular river so that this river fulfills its production potential in the future. In Norway, first-generation management targets in the form of spawning targets were established in 2007. In this report, we use the experience gathered from using and evaluating these spawning targets in the years since 2007 to revise the Tana/Teno spawning targets. The main goal was to establish revised spawning targets for all tributaries, both Norwegian and Finnish, and make sure that all targets were obtained {{in a manner consistent with}} the assumptions of the first-generation spawning target model.

Here, we report ultra-efficient CM in van der Waals (vdW) layered materials that commences at the energy <b>conservation</b> <b>limit</b> and proceeds with nearly 100 % conversion efficiency. A small threshold energy, as low as twice the bandgap, was achieved, marking an onset of quantum yield with enhanced carrier generation. Strong Coulomb interactions between electrons confined within vdW layers allow rapid electron-electron scattering to prevail over electron-phonon scattering. Additionally, the presence of electron pockets spread over momentum space could {{also contribute to the}} high CM efficiency.
