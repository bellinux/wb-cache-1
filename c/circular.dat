5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a <b>circular</b> stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly <b>circular</b> wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than <b>circular,</b> is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the <b>circular</b> design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century <b>circular</b> design were the <b>circular</b> design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than <b>circular</b> in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E

Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin. Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a <b>circular</b> permutation.|$|E
