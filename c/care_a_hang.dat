6000|$|As Rachel had {{no wish to}} go or to stay, Evelyn {{took her}} by the wrist and drew her out of the hall and up the stairs. As they went upstairs two steps at a time, Evelyn, who still kept hold of Rachel's hand, ejaculated broken {{sentences}} about not <b>caring</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang</b> what people said. [...] "Why should one, if one knows one's right? And let 'em all go to blazes! Them's my opinions!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The matter," [...] replied Andrew, [...] "cannot be {{dismissed}} in that way. Reasonable or not, I do undoubtedly experience sensations similar to Clarrie's. But in my love I notice a distinct ebb and flow. There {{are times when}} I don't <b>care</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang</b> for her." ...|$|E

But {{when he said}} at once, 'Mecanicien, monsieur,' I nearly {{jumped out of the}} saddle with excitement. The launch had been lying disabled and idle in the creek for three weeks. My duty to the company was clear. He noticed my start, too, and there we were {{for a minute or so}} staring at each other as if bewitched.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{inevitable}} that the girl should soon refer to the ranger, and Redfield was as complimentary of him as she could wish. [...] "Ross hasn't a fault but one, and that's a negative one: he doesn't <b>care</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang</b> about getting on, as they say over in England. He's content just to do {{the duty of the}} moment. He made a good cow-puncher and a good soldier; but as for promotion, he laughs when I mention it." ...|$|E

Believe me, you have no cause to be jealous; she does not <b>care</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang</b> about me, {{it is only the}} title and the money. If a fellow who was a lord and had a {{thousand}} a year more proposed to her to-morrow she would chuck me up and take him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>care</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang</b> {{about the}} law. That boy can't be crucified. I'll {{give her a}} double allowance, four times, anything, but he goes with me. She can follow on to California if she wants, but I'll draw up an agreement, in which what's what, and she'll sign it, and live up to it, by George, {{if she wants to}} stay. And she will," [...] he added grimly. [...] "She's got to have {{somebody}} to nag." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I felt {{a fearful}} fool, you know. I just said 'Right ho!' or something--dashed if I know now what I did say--and legged it. It's a jolly rum business, the whole thing. It isn't {{as if she}} wanted me. I could see that with half an eye. She doesn't <b>care</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang</b> for me. It's my belief, old man," [...] he said solemnly, [...] "that she's been badgered into it, I believe my uncle's been at her." ...|$|E

And dam' me I would talk back too till I roused him. He's a shadow of himself. He walks about his ship like a ghost. He's fading away right before our eyes. But of course you don't see. You don't <b>care</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang.</b> Why should you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{a gentleman}} you know at once where you are; {{but it was}} a ticklish job. The skipper was nothing to me one way or another, any more than you are at this moment, Mr. Schomberg. You may light your cigar or blow your brains out this minute, and I don't <b>care</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang</b> which you do, both or neither. To bring the skipper up was easy enough.

I don't <b>care</b> <b>a</b> <b>hang</b> for art; nature is as much as I can stand, and I guess I could show you things that would knock your old masters higher than kites. Better come, and while Josie rides the horses you can model 'em.
