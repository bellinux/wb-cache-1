40|$|The {{effect of}} argon/methane ratios on the {{characteristics}} of carbon coatings on optical fibers prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition is investigated. The argon/methane ratios are selected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Results show that if the argon/methane ratio increases from 0 to 4, the deposition process is mainly sustained by the Penning effect. The Penning effect enhances the dissociation of the hydrocarbon gas molecules. The <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> shifts to the graphite-like carbon and the surface of the <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> becomes smoother. As the argon/methane ratio increases from 4 to 8, etching becomes more important. The sp(2) C=C bonding in the <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> transforms from order into disorder. Because the disordered sp 2 C=C bonding increases, the surface of the <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> becomes rougher. When the argon/methane ratio is 4, the surface roughness of the <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> is a minimum, while the water contact angle of <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> is a maximum. At this argon/methane ratio, the <b>carbon</b> <b>coating</b> has the best ability to minimize low temperature induced delamination or microcracks, so is the best for the production of a hermetically sealed optical fiber coating.

5000|$|Graphite furnace atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy (GFAAS) (also known as Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (ETAAS)) {{is a type of}} spectrometry that uses a graphite-coated furnace to vaporize the sample. Briefly, the technique is {{based on the fact that}} free atoms will absorb light at frequencies or wavelengths characteristic of the element of interest (hence the name {{atomic absorption}} spectrometry).

50|$|These {{procedures}} aim {{to inject}} bio-compatible material {{into the walls}} of the anal canal, aiming to bulk out these tissues. This may bring {{the walls of the}} anal canal into tighter contact, raising the resting pressure, creating more of a barrier to the loss of stool, and reducing FI. Originally, this technique was described for urinary incontinence, but has since been used for FI, especially passive soiling due to IAS dysfunction. This measure has many advantages over more invasive surgery, since there are rarely any serious complications and the procedure can be carried out under local anesthetic on an out patient basis. Many different materials have been used as perianal injectable bulking agents, including: autologous fat (fat tissue transferred from elsewhere in the body), Teflon, bovine glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen (collagen from cows), carbon-coated zirconium beads, polydimethylsiloxane elastomer, dextranomer/non-animal stabilised hyaluronic acid, hydrogel cross-linked with polyacrylamide, porcine dermal collagen (collagen from pig skin), and synthetic calcium hydroxylapatite ceramic microspheres. Dextranomer in stabilised hyaluronic acid improves continence for a little over half of patients in the short term. However, future trials are required. Dextranomer is marketed as Solesta, bio-compatible Silicone is also referred to as a PTQ implant and <b>carbon</b> <b>coated</b> beads as Durasphere. The bulking material can be introduced as either intersphincteric (into the space between the IAS and the EAS) or submucosal (under the mucosal layer) injections.Ultrasonound guidance may be used during the injections, which may be more effective than the surgeon simply palpating (feeling) where to inject. A Cochrane systematic review of the efficacy of this type of treatment for FI reported that PTQ implants were the most widely used material, but that there was currently insufficient evidence to be considered to assess the effectiveness of injectable bulking agents. A randomized trial by Dehli et al. compared perianal injectable bulking agents to sphincter training and biofeedback, and found the former to be superior. Both methods lead to an improvement of FI, but comparisons of St Mark's scores between the groups showed no difference between treatments.|$|E
