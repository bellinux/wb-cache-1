40|$|Research {{libraries}} {{have entered}} {{an era of}} discontinuous change—a time when the cumulated assets of the past do not guarantee future success. Bibliographic control, <b>cooperative</b> <b>cataloguing</b> systems and library catalogues have been key assets in the research library service framework for supporting scholarship. This chapter examines these assets {{in the context of}} changing library collections, new metadata sources and methods, open access repositories, digital scholarship and the purposes of research libraries. Advocating a fundamental rethinking of the research library service framework, the chapter concludes with a call for research libraries to collectively consider new approaches that could strengthen their roles as essential contributors to emergent, network-level scholarly research infrastructures...|$|E

One of the attempts to deal with this state of affairs is associating libraries into consortia. A consortium could, through <b>cooperative</b> <b>cataloguing,</b> help optimise the processing of library material, it could help in solving the problem of rational ways of continuous education of staff and users and coordinate acquisition policy through common purchasing of information resources, from bibliographic databases to electronic journals under various licensing conditions.

40|$|FRBR is a {{conceptual}} {{model for the}} bibliographic universe and aims to simplify browsing in online library catalogues with special regard to users' needs. The data format still in use in the Austrian Library Network is MAB 2. Bibliographic records are created {{according to the rules}} for alphabetic cataloguing in academic libraries. In 2009 Primo was implemented – a software which is capable of normalizing bibliographic records for front-end display. This Master Thesis wants to highlight the possibilities in Primo for metadata display in accordance with FRBR and the problems occurring in this regard, illustrated by bibliographic records describing Franz Kafka's "Der Process" ("The trial"). The analysis focuses on three aspects: the concept of "work", expressions as valid entities and aggregates respectively multipart monographs. A short introduction into the FRBR model is followed by the attempt to create an ideal FRBR tree for the different manifestations of Kafka's "The trial". Problematic aspects within the model itself are highlighted. Subsequently bibliographic records from the Austrian <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Catalogue</b> are analyzed in order to show the FRBR capability of MAB 2 and beyond that to explain the FRBR key options in Primo. Some limitations of FRBRizing MAB 2 in Primo have been made particularly apparent: The data in MAB 2 records is not consistent enough to enable catalogue displays in accordance with FRBR. Moreover, the possibilities of clustering works and facets may improve browsing for library users, but not as FRBR would propose...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a project {{carried out by}} the German National Library, the University and State Library Sachsen-Anhalt in Halle and Semantics GmbH Aachen to establish routines of persistent identification for individual pages of web publications in order to enable and facilitate reliable and long-term valid citation practices for the academic community. The project originated in a pilot project to digitise approximately 10, 000 German imprints from the seventeenth century comprising altogether about 600, 000 pages, which had to be completed within two years. The material of the ‘Ponickau Collection’ had been catalogued in the German national bibliography of seventeenth-century imprints (VD 17), which was enriched and turned into a virtual library by adding the digitised texts. This article investigates the means of presentation and indexing of digitised imprints in order to ensure their usability. It also sketches the workflow among the various partners involved in the process. The article highlights the application of Visual Library, which contains various tools for automated creation of metadata, the implementation of persistent identifiers (URN) and the automated enrichment of catalogue entries by the regional <b>cataloguing</b> <b>cooperative</b> Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund (GBV). Special emphasis is given to questions of quality management; the quality is guaranteed by a combination of automated tools and intellectual control at various stages of the digitisation process...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{important}} reasons for the under utilization of electronic information {{is the lack of}} requisite level of working knowledge and consumption skills among customers and information intermediaries. So, the conventional user education programmes need be redefined and reengineered with more emphasis on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). It should be designed in such a way to provide confidence to the users in locating desired information. There are 38 Agricultural Universities functioning in India and they are formed by special Acts and Statutes, either of the Government of India or of different State Governments. The Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) is the only one such university in the State of Kerala. It has 10 constituent colleges, six Regional Agricultural Research Stations, 26 Research Stations, three Centres of Advanced Studies, 10 Instructional Farms and six specific Centres of Research and Studies. The KAU Library and Information System (KAULIS) has a three tier structure consisting of the University Library, College Libraries and Research Station Libraries. The University Librarian is the professional head the system. As modern libraries world over {{are on the verge of}} rapid changes, the KAULIS also had witnessed several changes in this line. Though there was some initial resistance to accept the changes and adopt the new technologies, the positive factors like easy availability, accessibility, flexibility, etc. of the digital documents have created an overwhelming response from the users and this has necessitated a total change in the tools and service procedures of the libraries. Consequently, several new skills, related to ICTs, have to be acquired by the users and staff. From the management side, the whole operations of the libraries need to be changed to suit the requirements warranted by the modern environment. The concepts such as library cooperation, centralized and <b>cooperative</b> classification and <b>cataloguing,</b> etc. have emerged in different forms. Online Journals and Library Consortia became a prominent and effective approach now. Here, the library management and professionals could play an important role to manage the changes in an effective way. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the controlling agency for agricultural universities in India, has implemented a special project with the assistance of the World Bank to modernize the Library and Information Systems of all agricultural universities and the ICAR Institutes in the country. The project included special funding, technical assistance and training for the library staff, teachers and students. Substantial improvement in the operations and performance has been achieved with this project. The university libraries could automate most of their operations and many of them developed digital libraries of theses and dissertations. Academic Role of Library and Information Professionals As part of this project, several training programmes have been conducted in KAU to orient teachers and research students in the modern methods of information management. As an ex-officio member of the Academic Council, the University Librarian is actively participates in the process of designing course curriculum, academic regulations, etc. of the university. Through this, he gets an effective chance to assist in the implementation of library centered education in the university. The information science professionals working in the constituent colleges are also take active role in the education and research programmes. The syllabus for the undergraduate, postgraduate and research courses contains modules such as library classification, cataloguing, online and CD-ROM databases, library and information technologies, information retrieval, etc. In some other agricultural universities, this education is offered as a full credit course as part of the curriculum. This is a better opportunity to educate and train the students in their effort to search and retrieve the required information. Regular and special training courses of short duration are also being conducted by the KAULIS to prepare students, teachers and library staff to orient them in the changing environment. Objective and Methodology of the Study In order to assess the effectiveness and relevance of these academic and short term programmes, a study was conducted among the teachers, students and library staff of KAU. It was also intended to review the involvement of the library and information science professionals in academic programmes. The utility of such programmes to re-design the operations of the library and information system for the modern environment is also examined. The study was mainly based on personal interview, discussions, observing the library users and staff, review of literature, etc. Data was also collected from participants of the short term courses on Information Retrieval, conducted by the university during the last three years. Records of library services and operations were also compared to validate the facts received. Major Findings 1. 	Ninety per cent of the users have some knowledge on modern ICTs and digital information resources. But, all of them are admitted that this knowledge is highly inadequate to locate desired information from CD-ROM databases or Internet. It was also disclosed by many users that lot of time is being wasted by the inefficient methods of information retrieval. 2. 	All teacher as well as student users stressed the need for regular library instruction / user orientation courses and such programmes should be more oriented towards the application of modern ICTs with topics such as database search, information retrieval, search engines, retrieval softwares, formulation of search strategies, sorting, printing and downloading of records, etc. 3. 	Seventy per cent of the total respondents revealed that these programmes had helped to increase the efficiency in searching the databases. Eighty five per cent of the students expressed that the formal academic programmes as part of course curriculum are very helpful to locate the documents from the libraries and retrieve information from digital databases. 4. 	All library staff stressed the need for formal as well as short term courses for all types of users. They felt that such courses are helpful for the users to raise the reference queries clearly. This can also provide a platform to establish close relationship with the users. 5. 	Sixty five per cent of the library staff opined that these courses helped to update their technical knowledge and service efficiency. But, fifteen per cent has pointed out the problem of increase in the work load for preparing for classes and study materials, organizing work for short term courses, etc. 6. 	There is a normal tendency by the users and staff to resist the changes in the beginning and when convinced and accustomed by sufficient induction, orientation and training programmes, all are becoming happy to adapt to the modern technologies. 7. 	Detailed study of the topics such as ICTs, content development, digital libraries, knowledge management, online journals, digital document delivery, etc. should be included in the courses designed for the users and staff. More stress should be given for practical training. It was also observed that a frequent revision is needed in the topics included in such courses. The study revealed that there is a strong relationship between the user orientation and use of information resources, particularly the digital resources. It is also realised that many of the problems created by the transition of information documents from print to electronic medium could be better managed with the help of proper user education courses with stress on ICTs. Because of this, the teachers and students have shown special interest to absorb knowledge on modern methods of information retrieval. Academic courses as part of the curriculum will add weight and importance to such programmes. The library and information science professionals are also opined that such programmes will help in re-defining and re-engineering the Library and Information System for the modern era. Their involvement as teachers and trainers will have an over all impact on improving the performance of the libraries and ultimately the user satisfaction. This paper provides a detailed account of the study and its findings.

40|$|Access to {{scientific}} and scholarly information in academic libraries is made available trough journal content. The technological evolution provides libraries with {{different forms of}} access and various types of supports to periodicals. Despite the importance of electronic journals, printed journals remain an important way of making available scientific information. The search and retrieval of information in periodicals is the most usual way {{to have access to}} the contents of articles in the academic world. The best tools to achieve it are the international indexes and abstracts databases. However, the content of Portuguese journals are seldom referenced in international search tools. We intend to characterize the actual situation and to suggest a feasible solution to provide access to Portuguese-language articles in academic libraries. The purpose of our dissertation is to examine current solutions to improve content accessibility to Portuguese journals and make a proposal to achieve it. In this work we present a survey of models of infrastructure and technologies to bibliographic data share. It describes three technical solutions to share bibliographic data, representing the models referenced above. We present national and international projects developed in this area. Simultaneously, we propose a Portuguese journal analytic <b>cooperative</b> <b>cataloguing</b> solution, based on a local trial...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the use of {{standard}} MARC (MAchine Readable Cataloging record) by university libraries that comprise the Southern region of Brazil, and is proposed to identify the use of interoperability. Therefore, {{based on the assumption}} that, despite the libraries, to choose a standard metadata to describe their collections, choosing, in the main, by default MARC such libraries do not have the primary goal is interoperability. The study considers this feature of great importance because through it is possible to maintain the standardization of databases, implement the <b>cooperative</b> <b>cataloguing,</b> reduce efforts and avoid the re-work. It advantages in the use of communication protocols combined with patterns of metadata. As for results, the survey showed that the state searched that most uses standard MARC is the Paraná (PR), where 68 % of libraries surveyed say use it, the Rio Grande do Sul (RS) is the state that uses the least default, being used by 60 % of respondents libraries. The principle of interoperability {{you can see that the}} PR uses this feature in about 85 % of libraries respondents, followed by Santa Catarina, which exports and import through MARC in 66 % of the respondents libraries. Considering that most libraries are consulted computerized (users of software managers libraries), and these make software (70 % of them) the completion of cataloguing via standard MARC, the university libraries of the South Region of Brazil still hold the interoperability of a timid; As suggestion to alleviate this low utilization and low utilization of resources from the search MARC concluded that the development of cooperatives among libraries would be one of the exits to split expenses and profits with the development of software enabling the interoperability and standardization via use of MARC...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experience {{gained from the}} creation of the Union Catalogue of the Hellenic Academic Libraries (UC). For the time being the UC contains 1. 057. 000 unique records originated from 23 Universities (one of which in Cyprus), operating five different library software programmes with four different character sets and two MARC formats. The basic needs that are covered by Union Catalogues are those of the facilitation of the cataloguing and the support of Interlibrary loan procedures. The exploitation of the UC in Greece makes it the central tool {{for the development of the}} national union catalogue, {{the creation of the}} cooperative “national authority files” and the transition from the situation of uncoordinated cataloguing to the <b>cooperative</b> <b>cataloguing.</b> The existing situation has enforced a cost ineffective practice, where “each title is catalogued so many times as the number of the libraries that acquire it”. The attempted transition permits the achievement of cost effectiveness and standardisation, provided that “each title is catalogued once and the bibliographic record is used by all the libraries that acquire the book”. The paper records the early initiatives and attempts for the development of union catalogues in Greece, preceding the UC of the Hellenic Academic Libraries. The UC consists a work package of the project “Networking of the Libraries of the tertiary Education” in the frame of the programme EPEAEK (Operational Programme for Education and Initial Training), co-funded by European Community Structural Funds and the Hellenic state. The implementation of the UC was based on the study contacted in 1998 by a working group consisted of Greek librarians and computer scientists and invited experts from abroad. They examined the existing situation in the Greek libraries and approved the creation of a natural central Union Catalogue vs. a so called virtual distributed catalogue, based on the Z 39. 50 protocol. According to the author a union catalogue exists only if provides the functions of identification and unification (merging) of the similar records. The UC is a slave type, as it is fed with records from the local libraries. The paper describes the procedures followed for the development of the UC. Comments are provided on the characteristics of the algorithms for the identification and the merging of similar records that have been developed for the needs of the UC. The pros and cons of the UC vs. the systems of join search of distributed catalogues based on Z 39. 50 protocol are presented and commented. The complementarities of the two approaches are proposed.

40|$|Introduction A Consortium {{could be}} {{described}} as a group of organizations who come together to fulfill a combined objective that usefully requires co-operation and sharing of resources. And need to have a clear mutual goal in order to ensure their success. A library Consortium formation can be local, regional, state, national and inter institutional level. According to Webster 2 ̆ 7 s 3 rd new International Dictionary, Library consortia is 2 ̆ 2 an agreement, combination, or group formed to undertake and enterprise beyond the resources of anyone member 2 ̆ 2 (Merriam Webster online dictionary. 2008) Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science (ODLIS) defines Library Consortia as 2 ̆ 2 an association of independent Libraries and/or Library systems established by formal agreement, usually for the purpose of sharing 2 ̆ 2. Membership may be restricted to a specific geographical region, type of Library (Public, Academic, and Special) or subject specialization 2 ̆ 2. (ODLIS-Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science) Consortium is the term, which has many meaning. In the beginning libraries work in the field of collection development and resource sharing in the widest sense of word. Later on <b>cooperative</b> <b>cataloguing</b> system were as consortia. As purchasing association in the network environment the term 2 ̆ 2 Consortia 2 ̆ 2 is now widely used. Review of Literature The study of related research implies locating, reading and evaluating research reports. The survey of the literature is a crucial aspect for planning of the body of research. The investigators reviewed only those studies which are related to the present study. It was revealed that majority of the users are aware about the availability of online journals. And majority of respondent indicated that they make use of online journals for their research work. It was also found that users faced problems while using online journals. A need was also felt by some research scholars regarding inclusion of some more e- journals in UGC-Infonet Consortium (Zaidi and Bharati, 2008). The users faced problem while accessing e-consortium and lack of awareness of e-resources available. It was suggested that a training programme should be conducted regularly to improve the usage of e-journal consortium. (Gupta and Rawtani, 2008) There is a need of conducting regular orientation/training programme for the UGC Infonet programme; more number of e-journals {{to be included in the}} UGC Infonet consortium (Veenapani, Singh and Devi, 2008). A high proportion of teaching and research staff are aware of the collection of electronic journals and there is an increasing preference for the electronic information sources to the detriment of the printed format. The collection of electronic journals is highly valued and most users expect to increase their use during the next few years. The results also confirm the importance of discipline and age as explanatory factors of the use of electronic journals (Borrego et. al., 2007). In a study under the title 2 ̆ 2 Preserving perpetual access to electronic journals: A Korean consortial approach 2 ̆ 2 This study describes the key findings of the Korean Electronic Site License Initiative (KESLI), established by the National Digital Science Library to develop a digital archive of electronic journals in Korea. Research and relevant activities included developing system architecture, suggesting journal selection criteria and publisher selection criteria, choosing a set of metadata elements, and addressing stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 concerns. Recommendations for further tasks have been made in order to have the system fully operating by December 2007 (Choia and Parkb, 2007). A study observes that electronic journals continue to usually be the format of choice for institutional serials subscriptions. However, in developing countries this is not always the case, due to access and connectivity issues. He found that insufficient administrative infrastructure and resources were the major contributing factors and reasons why harnessing of e-journals is not more ubiquitous and common in Nigeria. The paper offers some useful suggestions on how to tackle these problems through constant training of users on the use of internet, networking all libraries 2 ̆ 7 computer terminals, provides stand-by generator, and put in place a technical-oriented manpower. Finally, there is a need to overhaul the telecommunication industry so as to get a better result in term of Information Technology development in the developing countries (Ajegbomogun, 2007). Authors discuss the concern over the archival of electronic journals such as unprecedented pace of technological developments, hardware and software updates. Copyright issues and mergers cessation and stoppages of publishing industries. The successful operation of library consortium clearly depends upon a number of things such as good working relationship among the members and consortium headquarter clear policies and priorities, attempts to address the issue and concern etc. However, the consortia initiatives in India are not popular and the trends are slowly catching up among the professional community. Now libraries recognized that they can accomplish more by working together than they can individually (Bavakutty and Azeez, 2006). The libraries and information centers with their static financial allocations have to consider new ways to consolidate global resources amongst them in order to maximize their limited financial resources. Fortunately, availability of powerful computers at affordable cost, speed of telecommunication networks to remote areas, advent of internet, increasing interest in creating digital contents etc, are now helping the library and information professionals to give answer to the challenges occurring due to the explosion of information and knowledge, increasing cost of library materials, changing format of reading materials, shrinking library budget and increasing demand of the users for information and knowledge. Keeping in view of these factors, he discusses the concept of resource sharing and the role of library consortia as an effective collaborative approach to face challenges of modern librarianship (Bhatt, 2006) ...|$|E
