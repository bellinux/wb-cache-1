25|$|Five {{forms of}} {{elective}} monarchies exist today. The pope of the Roman Catholic Church (who rules as Sovereign of the Vatican City State) is elected {{to a life}} term by the College of Cardinals. In the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the Prince and Grand Master is elected for life tenure by the Council Complete of State from within its members. In Malaysia, the federal king, called the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or Paramount Ruler is elected for a five-year term from among and by the hereditary rulers (mostly sultans) of nine of the federation's constitutive states, all on the Malay peninsula. The United Arab Emirates also has a procedure for electing its monarch. Furthermore, Andorra has a unique constitutional arrangement {{as one of its}} heads of state is the President of the French Republic {{in the form of a}} <b>Co-Prince.</b> This is the only instance in the world where the monarch of a state is elected by the citizens of a different country.|$|E

2500|$|The French President is {{ex officio}} a <b>co-prince</b> of Andorra, where Roman Catholicism has a status of state {{religion}} (the other <b>co-prince</b> being the Roman Catholic Bishop of Seu de Urgell, Spain). Moreover, French heads of states are traditionally offered an honorary title of Canon of the Papal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, Cathedral of Rome. Once this honour {{has been awarded}} to a newly elected president, France pays for a choir vicar, a priest who occupies the seat in the canonical chapter of the Cathedral {{in lieu of the}} president (all French presidents have been male and at least formally Roman Catholic, but if one were not, this honour could most probably not be awarded to him or her.) [...] The French President also holds a seat in a few other canonical chapters in France.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was born}} {{around the year}} 1013, the eldest son of Guaimar III of Salerno by Gaitelgrima, {{daughter}} of Duke Pandulf II of Benevento.

When he died in 1018, Guaimar was made <b>co-prince.</b> In 1022, the Emperor Henry II campaigned in southern Italy against the Greeks and sent Pilgrim, Archbishop of Cologne, to attack Pandulf IV of Capua, nicknamed the [...] "Wolf of the Abruzzi", and Guaimar of Salerno. Pandulf was captured and Guaimar submitted, sending the younger Guaimar as a hostage. The emperor remanded him to Pope Benedict VIII and he was released. The younger Guaimar succeeded his father in Salerno in 1027 (at the age of fourteen or sixteen, possibly under the regency of his mother during his brief minority). He embarked then on a lifelong quest to control {{the whole of the}} southern third of the Italian Peninsula.|$|E

50|$|Before 1993, Andorra had no codified constitution, and {{the exact}} prerogatives of the <b>co-princes</b> were not {{specifically}} defined in law. In March of that year, a Constitution {{was approved by}} a vote of the Andorran people and signed into law by the two reigning <b>Co-princes</b> at the time: President François Mitterrand and Bishop Joan Martí Alanis. It clarified the continuance of the unique Andorran monarchy, and also delineated the precise role and prerogatives of the two <b>Co-princes.</b> Prior to adoption of the Constitution, Andorra paid in odd-numbered years a tribute of approximately $460 to the French ruler, while on even-numbered years, it paid a tribute of approximately $12 to the Spanish bishop, plus six hams, six cheeses, and six live chickens. This medieval custom was subsequently abandoned in 1993.|$|R

5000|$|Before 1993, Andorra's {{political}} system had no clear {{division of powers}} into executive, legislative, and judicial branches. A constitution ratified and approved in 1993 establishes Andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the President of France and Bishop of Urgell as <b>co-princes</b> and heads of state. However, the head of government retains executive power. The two <b>co-princes</b> serve coequally with limited powers that do not include an individual veto over government acts (however, a bill can in effect be [...] "vetoed" [...] if both do not sign the legislation). They are each represented in Andorra by a personal representative.|$|R
