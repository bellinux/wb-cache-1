Evaluation of protein fortified cassava was studied. Sporamin, the major protein of sweet potato, has potential for cassava fortification. One {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate effects on sporamin due to different parameters involved in cassava physiological postharvest deterioration (PPD). Model systems were designed to determine sporamin modification. Sporamin did not suffer any major degradation by PPD components: scopoletin (a hydroxycoumarin), cassava phenolic extract, peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide. Oxidation of methionine was observed at 0 and 24 h incubation with or without oxidation factors by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cassava cultivars are {{classified}} following different criteria, such as cyanogenic glucoside content or starch content. Here, flours from {{the roots of}} 25 cassava varieties cultivated simultaneously in a single plantation, were characterized in terms of starch content (SC), amylose content (AC), alpha-amylolysis index (AI) and gel formation ability. Resistant starch content (RS) was measured in 10 of the samples. RESULTS: <b>Cassava</b> <b>flours</b> exhibited high SC, low AC and low AI values, with differences among varieties. Cluster analysis based on these parameters divided the cultivars in four groups differing mainly in SC and AC. AI and AC were inversely correlated (r = - 0. 59, P < 0. 05) in 18 of the cultivars, suggesting AC as an important factor governing the susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis of starch in raw cassava. Differences in susceptibility to amylolysis, assessed by RS, were also recorded in the sample subset analyzed. Most flours yielded pastes or gels upon heating and cooling. Gels differed in their subjective grade of firmness, but none exhibited syneresis, confirming the low retrogradation proclivity of cassava starch. CONCLUSION: Some differences were found among cassava samples, which may be ascribed to inter-cultivar variation. This informationmay have application in further agronomic studies or for developing industrial uses for this crop. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R
