We apply this approach to China, where the length of road has tripled and the inventory-sales ratio has declined by three quarters since 1978.

The saved capital is equivalent to 1. 25 percent of industrial output. The implied return is comparable to that of the US in the 1980 s. This effect has occurred through two channels: reducing inventory within firms and increasing the share of firms with more efficient inventory management.

40|$|The deformation-induced {{splitting}} of isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) is systematically {{analyzed in}} a wide range of masses <b>covering</b> <b>medium,</b> rare-earth, actinide, and superheavy axial deformed nuclei. The study is performed within the fully self-consistent quasiparticle random-phase-approximation (QRPA) method based on the Skyrme functional. Two Skyrme forces, one with a large (SV-bas) and one with a small (SkP) nuclear incompressibility, are considered. The calculations confirm earlier results that, due to the deformation-induced E 0 -E 2 coupling, the isoscalar E 0 resonance attains a double-peak structure and significant energy upshift. Our results are compared with available analytic estimations. Unlike earlier studies, we get a smaller energy difference between the lower and upper peaks and thus a stronger E 0 -E 2 coupling. This in turn results in more pumping of E 0 strength into the lower peak and more pronounced splitting of ISGMR. We also discuss widths of the peaks and their negligible correlation with deformation.

40|$|Context: A {{fraction}} of active galactic nuclei (AGN) show dramatic X-ray spectral {{changes on the}} day-to-week time scales associated with variation {{in the line of}} sight of the cold absorber. Aims: We intend to model the polarization fluctuations arising from an obscuration event, thereby offering a method of determining whether flux variations are due to occultation or extreme intrinsic emission variability. Methods: Undertaking 1 - 100 keV polarimetric simulations with the Monte Carlo code STOKES, we simulated the journey of a variety of cold gas clouds in front of an extended primary source. We varied the hydrogen column density nH and size of the absorber, as well as the initial polarization state of the emitting source, to cover a wide range of scenarios. Results: For unpolarized primary fluxes, large (about 50 deg) variations of the polarization position angle psi are expected before and after an occultation event, which is associated with very low residual polarization degrees (P lower than 1 per cent). In the case of an emitting disk with intrinsic, position-independent polarization, and for a given range of parameters, X-ray eclipses significantly alter the observed polarization spectra, with most of the variations seen in psi. Finally, non-uniformly polarized emitting regions produce very distinctive polarization variations due to the successive covering and uncovering of different portions of the disk. Plotted against time, variations in P and psi form detectable P~Cygni type profiles that are distinctive signatures of non-axisymmetric emission. Conclusions: Polarization measurements are thus particularly adapted to distinguish between intrinsic intensity fluctuations and external eclipsing events, constrain the geometry of the <b>covering</b> <b>medium,</b> and test the hypothesis of non-uniformly emitting disks predicted by general relativity.

40|$|There {{is a need}} in {{the dairy}} {{industry}} for instrumentation capable of providing on-line information about the moisture content of cheese during manufacture. Present measurement techniques are usually performed off-line and can be susceptible to human error. It is demonstrated that microwave-based moisture sensing techniques offer a number of potential advantages over conventional methods due to the strong interaction of microwaves with water. The permittivity of cream cheese curd and low-fat cheddar cheese curd has been measured over a range of frequencies and moisture contents {{in order to establish}} the relationship between these variables. A vector reflection coefficient measurement engine based on a six-port reflectometer has been built and tested. A suitable sensing head has been fabricated from a short length of microstrip transmission line. Two sensor characterisation models have been developed and compared with measured data. A novel algorithm has been developed to resolve the ambiguity inherent in many permittivity measurement techniques. It has been discovered that surface waves can propagate on a grounded dielectric slab covered by a material with a higher dielectric constant, provided the loss factor of the <b>covering</b> <b>medium</b> is greater than zero. It has also been found that the dominant mode of microstrip can radiate when the line is covered by a high-permittivity material, although this can be suppressed if the covering material is sufficiently lossy. There are three principal conclusions to draw from the investigation in this thesis. Firstly, changes in the moisture content of cheese curd during manufacture produce measurable variations in permittivity. Secondly, these changes can be measured accurately and cheaply using off-the-shelf microwave hardware. Finally, considerable attention must be paid to the characterisation of the sensing head if the instrument is to achieve its full potential. Promising results have been obtained in this area, however certain issues pertaining to the propagation of multiple dominant modes and higher order modes have not been fully resolved and would repay further theoretical analysis...|$|E
40|$|Stand {{establishment}} of crops by direct drilling {{is a function}} of seed germination and seedling emergence efficacy and their interactions with the soil physical micro-environment created by direct drill coulters. Experiments conducted in two contrasting controlled climates using 0. 5 tonne undisturbed turf blocks suggested that the three coulter types compared (viz. an experimental chisel coulter, a hoe and a triple disc coulter) performed significantly differently, in terms of wheat seedling emergence, when the seed was direct drilled into a fine sandy loam soil. Overall the chisel coulter promoted highest seedling emergence (63. 5 %) followed by the hoe coulter (50. 6 %) and the triple disc coulter (27. 0 %). When the initial soil moisture potential was close to permanent wilting point, seedling emergence counts between these three coulters were highly significant with the difference between the chisel and triple disc coulters being almost six-fold. When the initial soil moisture level was adequate, seedling emergence counts from the triple disc grooves, were Still significantly lower than from the chisel and hoe coulters which themselves performed equally. When the controlled relative humidity was increased from 60 % to 90 %, seedling emergence increased but this difference was significant only at a lower level of probability of P = 0. 10. Application of pressures (using press wheels) up to 70 kPa over the covered seeds after bar harrowing had no significant effect on seedling emergence at either the low or adequate initial soil moisture levels. When similar pressures were applied directly over the uncovered seeds, seedling emergence significantly increased to 60 % in the hoe coulter grooves and to 28 % in the triple disc coulter grooves compared to the impressed seeds. No significant increase was observed from the chisel coulter groove {{as a result of these}} pressures because it had already promoted a high seedling emergence count of 58 %. Further experiments, using small undisturbed turf blocks, to examine more closely the poor performance of the triple disc coulter, indicated that smearing had not been the main cause of seedling emergence failure. When the triple disc coulter grooves were modified using combinations of pressure applications and seed covering techniques, seedling emergence was significantly improved. It appeared that this improvement in seedling emergence was a function of a modified soil physical micro-environment at the seed-soil interface. Based on these results two hypotheses were evolved. The first hypothesis suggested that the transfer of liquid soil moisture to the seed for germination (and perhaps away from the unprotected seedling after germination but prior to emergence) could be altered by the shape of the seed groove and placement and covering of the seed. This was described as "soil moisture diffusion" The second hypothesis suggested that after the germination, subterranean seedling survival depended on the availability of vapour phase moisture which was also a function of the groove shape and <b>covering</b> <b>medium.</b> This was described as "soil moisture captivity". A thermo-electric dew point hygrometer was used to measure the in-groove vapour moisture potential within the drilled grooves in the larger turf blocks, in a controlled environment. Significant and repeatable differences in the drying rates of the grooves created by the three coulter types were measured and promised to at least partly explain the underlying causes of their abilities (or lack of abilities in some cases) to promote seedling emergence. Combined counts of seedling emergence and sub-surface seedling survival were moderately correlated (r = 0. 71) with the corresponding rates of loss of in-groove soil vapour moisture. It appeared from the data that the important design characteristics for direct drilling coulters were that they must have the ability to both exploit the limited supply of sub-surface liquid moisture for germination and also retain soil moisture in the vapour form for seedling emergence and/or survival. The latter function appeared to be aided by the creation of minimum surface shattering and maintenance of a high incidence of surface mulch in the form of sod or organic matter. Field experiments suggested that when the only measured soil moisture data available was at or prior to drilling, the present state of knowledge would not permit accurate seedling emergence data to be predicted for any given coulter and covering technique. If however, soil moisture data was available for the period between drilling and seedling emergence, reasonable predictions of seedling emergence could be made, given the characteristics of the coulter types and covering techniques used. Examples of mathematical models were constructed for each of the three coulter types used, to predict seedling emergence as a function of these soil moisture data. The field experiments also confirmed that higher seedling emergence counts could be expected when the chisel coulter was used in dry soils compared with the hoe or triple disc coulters. During a typical spring-summer-autumn period in the Manawatu, when wheat seed was direct-drilled at fortnightly intervals into a "Tokomaru silt loam soil"; from 16 % of the drillings the chisel coulter promoted significantly higher seedling emergence counts than either the hoe or triple disc coulters...|$|E

This indicates that all four dimensions have a weighted or unmarked end (i. e., all are directional or polar). The strong similarities in polarity across language groups contrasted with group differences on a lexical task, for which there was little cross-linguistic agreement about which comparative words to use to describe stimulus pairs (e. g., “bigger” vs. “smaller”).

The sorption isotherm can generally be divided into a hygroscopic part <b>covering</b> low, <b>medium</b> and high RH levels, and an over-hygroscopic part close to 100 % RH. For wood, the hygroscopic part is dominated by water uptake in cell walls and the over-hygroscopic part by capillary condensed water in cell lumina and other voids within the wood structure. Moisture contents in the over-hygroscopic range are required for fungal degradation, and over-hygroscopic sorption isotherms are thus relevant input data for models describing moisture conditions in outdoor structures, i. e. models needed for service life prediction.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of literature exists regarding design strategies and methodologies for large scale chemical engineering processes. However, {{the majority of the}} effort has focussed on petrochemical industries. Consequently, design strategies have been tailored to the specific requirements of these industries. Process design for food industries presents a number of unique challenges and problems, many of which cannot be addressed by existing petrochemical-based design methods. The principles of operation of most dairy processes are well known, but procedures for their design are not published in open literature. Large scale dairy design is often a mixture of heuristic and ad hoc methods, relying heavily on the experience of the designer. This thesis compares petrochemical and dairy processes, and considers points of similarity and difference. It was identified that petrochemical processes were typically centred around reactions, whilst dairy processes were mainly focused on separation and blending of selected components. For this reason, it was determined that petrochemical methodologies were not particularly relevant to the dairy process design. This study presents a new conceptual methodology for developing and assessing dairy process flow sheets. The methodology considers possibilities for integration of material, energy, water, time and the environment, between and within processes used in the dairy industry. It also considers opportunities and requirements for integration and provides the fundamental process understanding required when developing the new conceptual design methodology. The methodology is presented using four case studies <b>covering</b> small, <b>medium</b> and large scale processing operations. These case studies illustrate that the new methodology makes it possible to develop process designs in a more structured manner. More importantly, it enables integration opportunities for all process and product lines, particularly for medium and large-scale operations where a structured approach is required to systematically identify and assess integration possibilities. This thesis lays the foundation for dairy process design by introducing the evolution of conceptual process synthesis using a top-down framework to complement subsequent detailed design when required.

40|$|A polarimetric {{scattering}} {{model is}} developed to study effects of snow cover and frost flowers with brine infiltration on thin sea ice. Leads containing thin sea {{ice in the}} Artic icepack are important to heat exchange with the atmosphere and salt flux into the upper ocean. Surface characteristics of thin sea ice in leads are dominated by the formation of frost flowers with high salinity. In many cases, the thin sea ice layer is covered by snow, which wicks up brine from sea ice due to capillary force. Snow and frost flowers {{have a significant impact}} on polarimetric signatures of thin ice, which needs to be studied for accessing the retrieval of geophysical parameters such as ice thickness. Frost flowers or snow layer is modeled with a heterogeneous mixture consisting of randomly oriented ellipsoids and brine infiltration in an air background. Ice crystals are characterized with three different axial lengths to depict the nonspherical shape. Under the <b>covering</b> multispecies <b>medium,</b> the columinar sea-ice layer is an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium composed of ellipsoidal brine inclusions preferentially oriented in the vertical direction in an ice background. The underlying medium is homogeneous sea water. This configuration is described with layered inhomogeneous media containing multiple species of scatterers. The species are allowed to have different size, shape, and permittivity. The strong permittivity fluctuation theory is extended to account for the multispecies in the derivation of effective permittivities with distributions of scatterer orientations characterized by Eulerian rotation angles. Polarimetric backscattering coefficients are obtained consistently with the same physical description used in the effective permittivity calculation. The mulitspecies model allows the inclusion of high-permittivity species to study effects of brine infiltrated snow cover and frost flowers on thin ice. The results suggest that the frost cover with a rough interface significantly increases the backscatter from thin saline ice and the polarimetric signature becomes closer to the isotropic characteristics. The snow cover also modifies polarimetric signatures of thin sea ice depending on the snow mixture and the interface condition...|$|R

The data related to number of house holds in division wise is collected from Municipal Corporation of Eluru as 39, 996. Out of the 50 divisions in Eluru Municipal Corporation based on income six divisions are selected for random survey <b>covering</b> low, <b>medium</b> and high income groups. Division maps are collected from the corporation for the sample survey divisions. The divisions selected for sampling survey are re- mapped representing minimum of 10 % houses selected in each division covering the total geographical location. House hold collection of solid waste is done physically in all the six divisions selected for estimating the per capita waste generation in the city. By physical weighment of all the waste collecting vehicles the total waste collected in the city is estimated and the same is compared by using the calculated per capita waste generation taking the total population of the city in to consideration to find out the quantity of waste generated in the corporation. Then a representative sample of the corporation using quartering method is collected from the dump yard. The representative sample of the city is sent for lab analysis at a MoEF recognized lab to estimate the calorific value and the same is compared by conducting several trials at the experimental setup designed with conventional approach on a Bomb calorimeter. It is estimated that by combusting the solid waste in ELURU Municipal Corporation it is possible to generate nearly 3 MW of power...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide space weather information, which are in {{particular}} relevant for user of communication and navigation systems, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is operating the online platform Space Weather Application Center Ionosphere (SWACI) since 2004. SWACI has started as a feasibility study and has been continuously extended and improved {{and is now a}} grown up system ready to be transformed into an Ionospheric Monitoring and Prediction Center (IMPC). The IMPC, as a permanent ionospheric weather service, will use ground as well as space based GNSS data, such as GPS and GLONASS measurements, and non-GNSS data such as vertical sounding data of ionosonde stations, radio beacons and solar wind data to provide relevant information for GNSS users in the area of telecommunication, precise radio-measurements and navigation. DLR is highly experienced in the reception, archiving, distribution and utilization of earth observation data in 24 / 7 operation mode. Therefore the IMPC is based on a dedicated infrastructure developed at DLR, where a fully automated Data Information and Management System (DIMS) is used for quality control, long-term data archiving as well as for dissemination of data to end users. A very large amount of ionospheric data <b>covering</b> high, <b>medium</b> and low solar activity periods over the globe has been captured, processed and archived since 1995. The captured data is being used for ionospheric research including modelling and characterization of ionospheric parameters and effects. This talk gives an introduction in the future IMPC. It will demonstrate samples of products, e. g. European and global maps of the total electron content (TEC) monitored by DLR and available via the SWACI/ IMPC platform in near real-time. SWACI/ IMPC provides solar wind parameters taken with the ACE satellite (and his successor DSCOVR) and models their impact within the physical interaction chain in the atmosphere to significantly increase the prediction time of hazardous perturbations. The lecture will present an overview of existing facilities and their development to an IMPC...|$|R
30|$|Focusing on access, {{the case}} of Bogotá {{suggests}} that massive interventions on public transport infrastructures need to be complemented by other planning measures. In general, the recovery of existing and unused infrastructures may complement the construction from scratch of new networks (Barco et al. 2015), while active modes of transport may be promoted in central and intermediate {{areas of the city}} for trips <b>covering</b> short and <b>medium</b> distances. Interventions in peripheral areas are more difficult, though. While new infrastructures and services are promoted to access more easily the massive public transport network, the costs of travelling—especially monetary ones—still strongly impact the travel decisions of those who live in the peripheries (Bocarejo et al. 2016). Having access in mind, a reverse approach could then be significant: valued opportunities, such as jobs, shops and services, may be brought to the areas that currently have difficulties in accessing them. This attitude would focus on what may be defined as ‘immotility’, valuing the local dimension and meaning thus stillness as social capital (Ferreira et al. 2017). The limited effectiveness of Bogotá’s TransMilenio in guaranteeing access to the city suggests thus that {{it is not possible to}} indifferently replicate the same urban mobility strategies on the whole territory of a metropolis. Rather, articulated, place-based strategies are required to improve urban access according to peculiar local needs and opportunities.|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{implication of the}} Vega/Giotto flyby missions to Halley's Comet for cometary cosmogony {{is the opportunity to}} absorb the results of the in-situ measurements as made onboard the spacecrafts. Unfortunately the exploration of ejecta form the nucleus was unable to provide an unambiguous definition of the chemical-mineralogical nature of the nucleus: it failed to provide information comparable to that which was expected from a sample return mission. However, the obtained results are significant enough to affect and redirect cosmogonical thinking. Accordingly, the understanding of the cometary-matter dichotomy is modified as deduced from the distiction of water-dominated volitiles and silicate-based non-volitiles. Organic carbon compounds emerge as a major constituent of cometary nuclei. Presently, {{it is likely that the}} revision of Whipple's classic concept of the icy conglomerate cannot be avoided. Affected by the Vega/Giotto flyby missions to Hally's Comet, cometary cosmogony seems to enter a new conceptual period. The results of the in-situ measurements (mass spectrometric, UV spectroscopic, and IR spectroscopic) appear to be of basic importance. A chemical explanation is employed to explain the occurrence inside the nuclei of the variety of species, as inferred from the mass spectrometric data, to predict the results of the processes possibly involved. A cosmochemical factor is postulated to operate behind the observed cometary phenomena. The chemistry of the interstellar <b>medium,</b> <b>covering</b> the circumstellar and interstellar dust, advances cometary cosmogony...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a mini-survey for {{associated}} HI 21 -cm absorption at z < 0. 42 with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Our targets are radio galaxies, selected on the basis that the 1216 Angstrom luminosities are below 10 ^ 23 W/Hz, above which {{there has never been a}} detection of 21 -cm absorption. Of the three sources for which we obtained good data, two are unclassified active galactic nuclei (AGN) and one is type- 2. Being a non-detection, the type- 2 object is consistent with our previous result that 21 -cm absorption in radio sources is not dictated by unified schemes of AGN. In the case of the detection, the absorption only occurs towards one of the two resolved radio lobes in PKS 1649 - 062. If the absorption is due to an another intervening galaxy, or cool HI gas in the intergalactic <b>medium,</b> <b>covering</b> only the south-west lobe, then, being at the same redshift, this is likely to be gravitationally bound to the optical object identified as PKS 1649 - 062. If the absorption is due to an inclined disk centred between the lobes, intervening the SW lobe while being located behind the NE lobe, by assuming that it covers the emission peak at 150 kpc from the nucleus, we estimate a dynamical mass of ~ 3 x 10 ^ 12 solar masses for the disk.

40|$|ABSTRACT Although it {{is known}} that alkalinized sewage sludge raises the pH of acid soils, there is limited {{knowledge}} regarding its effects on other soil fertility indicators, such as P and K availability and soil organic C content. Thus, the goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate how the application of alkalinized sewage sludge affects the fertility of acid soil. Twenty sewage treatment plants were selected throughout Paraná State (Brazil), and samples of alkalinized sewage sludge and samples of the most representative agricultural soil of the region were collected (<b>covering</b> soils with <b>medium,</b> clayey or very clayey texture). Each soil was incubated for 60 days with doses of sewage sludge (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 Mg ha- 1) from its region and equivalent doses of limestone. The alkalinized sewage sludge was superior to limestone in the correction of soil acidity (pH, Al 3 +, and H + Al 3 +) and P and Ca 2 + availability. The sludge also increased Mg 2 + availability in all soils, K+ in seven soils and organic C in three soils. The very clayey soils (higher buffering capacity) supported higher sludge doses than did clayey and medium texture soils. The alkalinized sewage sludge application in acid soils proved to be an interesting alternative to recycling this type of waste, because it improved soil fertility and could reduce costs associated with soil management and crop fertilization...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of diffuse Ly alpha emission, or Lya halos (LAHs), around star-forming galaxies at z approximate to 3. 78 and 2. 66 in the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Bootes field. Our samples consist {{of a total of}} similar to 1400 galaxies, within two separate regions containing spectroscopically confirmed galaxy overdensities. They provide a unique opportunity to investigate how the LAH characteristics vary with host galaxy large-scale environment and physical properties. We stack Ly alpha images of different samples defined by these properties and measure their median LAH sizes by decomposing the stacked Ly alpha radial profile into a compact galaxy-like and an extended halo-like component. We find that the exponential scale-length of LAHs depends on UV continuum and Ly alpha luminosities, but not on Ly alpha equivalent widths or galaxy overdensity parameters. The full samples, which are dominated by low UV-continuum luminosity Lya emitters (M-UV greater than or similar to - 21), exhibit LAH sizes of 5 - 6 kpc. However, the most UV- or Ly alpha-luminous galaxies have more extended halos with scale-lengths of 7 - 9 kpc. The stacked Ly alpha radial profiles decline more steeply than recent theoretical predictions that include the contributions from gravitational cooling of infalling gas and from low-level star formation in satellites. However, the LAH extent matches what one would expect for photons produced in the galaxy and then resonantly scattered by gas in an outflowing envelope. The observed trends of LAH sizes with host galaxy properties suggest that the physical conditions of the circumgalactic <b>medium</b> (<b>covering</b> fraction, H I column density, and outflow velocity) change with halo mass and/or star formation rates...|$|R
