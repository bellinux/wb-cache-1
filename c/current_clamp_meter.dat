50|$|The PV Analyzer PVA-1000 is an I-V curve tracer. It {{generates a}} {{variable}} load {{applied to a}} PV module or string of PV modules. It sweeps the load from open circuit to short circuit in approximately 250ms, capturing the current and voltage at 500 points. The PVA simultaneously measures the irradiance and module temperature with the SolSensor Wireless PV Reference Sensor. The wireless sensor has a range of 300 feet. The PVA-1000 measures strings up to 1000 Volts and 30 Amps.

40|$|A {{measurement}} technique to calibrate <b>current</b> <b>clamp</b> <b>meters</b> in ac <b>current</b> {{in the measurement}} range from 100 to 1500 A at 50 Hz has been developed at the National Institute of Metrological Research (INRIM) {{in addition to the}} primary reference measurement systems for ac current calibrations at INRIM. This technique is traceable to the national standards of dc resistance, dc voltage, and ac current ratio. It is based on a standard current transformer (CT), on a 50 -mΩ standard shunt, and on a 61 / 2 -digit digital voltmeter (DVM) that measures the voltage on the standard shunt inserted in a conductor, to which also the <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> is applied, whose current is supplied by a CT that can generate currents up to 1500 A. The CT is controlled by a variable transformer. The <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> is applied to a copper wire and placed on a tilting support simulating the actual operating mode of the meter. This {{measurement technique}} is applicable in industrial metrological laboratories and is an alternative to measurement practices of accredited secondary laboratories 1 involving digital calibrators and turn current coils. This measurement technique was also tested utilizing an 81 / 2 -digit high-accuracy DVM. The results of the evaluation are presented and discussed.

50|$|In {{electrical}} and electronic engineering, a <b>current</b> <b>clamp</b> or <b>current</b> probe is an electrical device with jaws which open to allow clamping around an electrical conductor.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of the implementation, programming and control of a robotic arm for fusion welding applications at Universidad San Francisco de Quito. The robotic arm is capable of automatically make welding seams following the specifications given by the user. The {{ultimate goal is to}} engage and implement the robotic arm Scorbot ER 9 Pro of the Robotics and Manufacturing Laboratory at Universidad San Francisco de Quito to perform welds using the GMAW process. The project was divided into two stages. Firstly, the coupling and system implementation were achieved for the robot to be able to perform the welding process. Once the robot was ready to work, research was carried out to achieve the optimal settings to ensure the quality of the weld. The research used various techniques to obtain experimental data, such as temperature measurement using thermocouples, measuring arc voltage and <b>current</b> with <b>clamp</b> <b>meters</b> and multimeters, and microscopy for metallographic analysis from samples. Finally, comparisons were made with valid theoretical models used in the welding industry.

5000|$|Shunts {{are rated}} by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a maximum allowable current of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120 °C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (grounded side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and <b>current</b> transformers (see <b>clamp</b> <b>meters).</b> <b>Current</b> shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|R
50|$|A <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> {{measures}} the vector {{sum of the}} currents flowing in all the conductors passing through the probe, which depends on the phase relationship of the currents. Only one conductor is normally passed through the probe. In particular if the clamp is closed around a two-conductor cable carrying power to equipment, the same current flows down one conductor and up the other; the meter correctly reads a net current of zero. As electrical cables for equipment have both insulated conductors (and possibly an earth wire) bonded together, <b>clamp</b> <b>meters</b> are often used with what is essentially a short extension cord with the two conductors separated, so that the clamp can be placed around only one conductor of this extension.|$|R
50|$|A {{relatively}} recent development was a multi-conductor <b>clamp</b> <b>meter</b> with several sensor coils around {{the jaws of}} the clamp.

40|$|Abstract—Current probes {{are widely}} {{used to measure the}} common mode {{currents}} in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) applications. Often, it is necessary to characterize the ratio of measured voltage to the common mode currents up to gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. Existing calibration methods for current probes suffer from the problem of not directly measuring the current within the <b>current</b> <b>clamp.</b> Instead they either reconstruct the current from measurements at other locations or they use assumptions regarding the geometry which allows them to use a current that is measured at a different location without applying a mathematical correction. For example, by maintaining a 50 -transmission-line impedance the current can be determined with low uncertainty. The proposed method overcomes these disadvan-tages by directly measuring the current {{at the center of the}} <b>current</b> <b>clamp.</b> This way the mechanical dimensions of the test setup are not critical anymore, i. e., one setup can be easily used to measure a large variety of clamps. The method is primarily applicable for current monitoring probes in the frequency domain.

40|$|Today, the patch-clamp {{technique}} {{is the main}} technique in electrophysiology to record action potentials or membrane current from isolated cells, using a patch pipette to gain electrical access to the cell. The common recording modes of the patch-clamp technique are <b>current</b> <b>clamp</b> and voltage <b>clamp.</b> In the <b>current</b> <b>clamp</b> mode, the <b>current</b> injected through the patch pipette is under control while the free-running membrane potential of the cell is recorded. <b>Current</b> <b>clamp</b> allows for measurements of action potentials that may either occur spontaneously or {{in response to an}} injected stimulus <b>current.</b> In voltage <b>clamp</b> mode, the membrane potential is held at a set level through a feedback circuit, which allows for the recording of the net membrane current at a given membrane potential. A less common configuration of the patch-clamp {{technique is}} the dynamic clamp. In this configuration, a specific non-predetermined membrane current can be added to or removed from the cell while it is in free-running <b>current</b> <b>clamp</b> mode. This <b>current</b> may be computed in real time, based on the recorded action potential of the cell, and injected into the cell. Instead of being computed, this current may also be recorded from a heterologous expression system such as a HEK- 293 cell that is voltage-clamped by the free-running action potential of the cell ("dynamic action potential clamp"). Thus, one may directly test the effects of an additional or mutated membrane current, a synaptic current or a gap junctional current on the action potential of a patch-clamped cell.
