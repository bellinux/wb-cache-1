5|$|A {{version of}} this story {{circulating}} in 1836, recounted by Martineau, added that the slaves were emaciated, showed signs of being flayed with a whip, were bound in restrictive postures, and wore spiked iron <b>collars</b> which kept their heads in static positions.|$|E
5000|$|A band <b>collar</b> is a {{standing}} band-shaped <b>collar</b> that encircles the neck without a full turndown or a <b>collar</b> [...] "cape". It {{can be any}} height or [...] "stand", but is usually under 2" [...] at the front, {{so as not to}} push up into the chin. Variations of the band <b>collar</b> are the clerical <b>collar,</b> the mandarin <b>collar</b> and the cadet <b>collar.</b>|$|R

5|$|They {{awake in}} a {{classroom}} in a small, vacated island, surrounded by troops, and wearing metal <b>collars</b> around their necks. A teacher, psychopathic sadist Kinpatsu Sakamochi, briefs the students: the class has been chosen {{to participate in the}} Program. They have three days to kill each other until one stands as the victor, or the metal <b>collars</b> will detonate, killing them all (as Sakamochi gleefully demonstrates on one student). The students are issued survival packs and a random weapon/tool, and sent out onto the island one by one. While most of the students receive guns and knives, some acquire relatively useless items like boomerangs, dartboard darts, or a fork. Hiroki Sugimura finds a radar device that tracks nearby students, and Toshinori Oda receives a bulletproof vest.|$|E
5|$|While {{drawing the}} series, Fujima changed his art style from one used previously, {{though he was}} asked to use his {{original}} styling. He also noted that the series was different from his other works, and was unsure of how the audience would respond to it. Free <b>Collars</b> Kingdom is licensed for English language release in the United States by Del Rey, which released the series in 2007, and in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi, which released it in 2008. It was licensed for regional release by Tong Li Publishing in Taiwan, Jonesky in Hong Kong, and Star Comics in Italy. Free <b>Collars</b> Kingdom garnered mixed reviews from critics. The series was praised for its artwork and humor, but criticized for its plot and characters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Collar</b> tie is a {{grappling}} clinch {{hold that}} is used to control the opponent. It is performed {{from the front of the}} opponent by grabbing the opponent by the <b>collar,</b> behind the neck, or behind the trapezius muscle. A <b>collar</b> tie using one hand is called a single <b>collar</b> tie, and a <b>collar</b> tie with both hands is called a double <b>collar</b> tie.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>collar</b> pin (closely {{related to}} the <b>collar</b> bar and <b>collar</b> clip) {{is a piece of}} men's jewelry, which holds the two ends of a dress shirt <b>collar</b> {{together}} and passes underneath the knot of a necktie. Functioning in a similar way as a [...] tabbed <b>collar,</b> it keeps the <b>collar</b> in place and lifts the knot to provide a more aesthetically pleasing arc to the necktie.|$|R
5000|$|... {{straight}} <b>collar</b> - or point <b>collar,</b> {{a version}} of the windsor <b>collar</b> that is distinguished by a narrower spread to better accommodate the four-in-hand knot, pratt knot, and the half-windsor knot. A moderate dress <b>collar.</b>|$|R
5|$|All winds on Venus are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide Hadley cell on Venus is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the Hadley cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar <b>collars</b> exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling. Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the <b>collars.</b> The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and low latitudes. A connection may exist between the cold <b>collars</b> and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist on Venus between 55–60° latitude.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a mysterious}} {{telephone}} call directed Harvard official Charles R. Apted to West Roxbury, {{where he was}} met by an automobile which he followed into some woods; there two young men, with <b>collars</b> up and hatbrims down, handed him the Cod (not wrapped in any flag) before speeding away.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{halfway through}} the third day, only Shogo, Shuya, Noriko, and Kiriyama remain, with Kiriyama dead set on hunting down the trio. After a frantic car chase, Kiriyama is finally gunned down - but Nanahara and Nakagawa are held at gunpoint by Shogo, who taunts them over being so naive as to trust anyone in the Program. The <b>collars</b> record gunshots and Shuya and Noriko flatlining.|$|E
50|$|A <b>collar</b> beam or <b>collar</b> is a {{horizontal}} member between two rafters {{and is very}} common in domestic roof construction. Often a <b>collar</b> is structural {{but they may be}} used simply to frame a ceiling. A <b>collar</b> beam is often called a <b>collar</b> tie but this is rarely correct. A tie in building construction is an element in tension rather than compression and most <b>collar</b> beams are designed to work in compression to keep the rafters from sagging. A <b>collar</b> {{near the bottom of the}} rafters may replace a tie beam and be designed to keep the rafters from spreading, thus are in tension: these are correctly called a <b>collar</b> tie.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2004, {{very little}} {{innovation}} {{had taken place}} with <b>collar</b> stays. Stayclip is credited with adding {{a significant amount of}} education about <b>collar</b> stays and spurring innovation in this accessory for men. For example, Stayclip invented titanium <b>collar</b> stays and the concept of using <b>collar</b> stays to shape the dress shirt <b>collar</b> - not to mention the obvious inventiveness of hanging <b>collar</b> stays on a ring (much like keys on a keychain). The use of Stayclip <b>collar</b> stays is widespread to include former US Presidents, billionaires and US military servicemen.|$|R

5|$|In his ensuing adventures, Cyan grows {{close to}} the Free <b>Collars,</b> yet still longs for Kokoro. He becomes {{frustrated}} by Siam's continued advances on East Ikebukuro and his teammates' unwillingness to mount an offensive attack. Convinced that Siam must be destroyed, Cyan confronts her and learns she was once a Free Collar until her brother, Puriam, was chased onto a road by humans and killed by a bus. Cyan is able to defeat her, and, reminded of Puriam, Siam silently wishes him farewell. Soon after, Cyan learns that Kokoro had recovered but is moving away. Saddened {{by the thought of}} leaving the Free <b>Collars,</b> he meets Kokoro at the train station and gives him his torn collar as a memento. Kokoro promises to visit Cyan, and Cyan returns to his new friends.|$|E
5|$|Unfamiliar with Miami culture, Aki Narula {{spent time}} there before filming began {{to learn how}} Miamians dressed and gave Bachachan long cargo shorts and cotton shirts in bright colours. According to the designer, the most {{interesting}} parts of his styling were the matching scarves, which resembled extended shirt <b>collars.</b> Narula gave Bachachan cargo and embroidered pants and sunglasses. The embroidery, primarily dragons and palm trees, conveyed a tropical summer look.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{illustrated}} by Fujima Takuya, the individual chapters of Free <b>Collars</b> Kingdom were first serialized in Japan in Magazine Z from 2002 to 2004. Those chapters were collected and published in three tankōbon volumes by Kodansha, with the first released on February 21, 2003 and the last on March 23, 2004. On July 27, 2010, the company Ichijinsha released a reprint of the series in two collected volumes.|$|E
30|$|The {{distinction}} between blue <b>collar</b> workers and white <b>collar</b> workers {{that is often}} used in the literature (for Germany, see e.g. Bernard and Wagner 2001) {{is no way to}} proxy human capital intensity for two reasons. First, often blue <b>collar</b> workers are high qualified skilled employees with apprenticeship (so-called Facharbeiter) while white <b>collar</b> workers include many unskilled employees. Second, the {{distinction between}} blue <b>collar</b> workers (Arbeiter) and white <b>collar</b> workers (Angestellte) is no longer used in Germany after a reform of the pension system; in the data from official statistics, for example, there is no separate information on wages (for blue <b>collar</b> workers) and salaries (for white <b>collar</b> employees) from the reporting year 2006 onwards.|$|R
25|$|<b>Collar</b> {{numbers within}} West Midlands Police are {{between two and}} five numbers long. Prior to 2006 <b>collar</b> numbers were up to four numbers in length, the {{numbering}} system was altered in 2006 to accommodate proposed changes {{that would have been}} introduced by a merger of local forces. Officers to have joined since 2006 have five figure <b>collar</b> sequential numbers starting with a 2, PCSOs have <b>collar</b> numbers starting with a 3, police staff have <b>collar</b> numbers starting with a 5, special constables have <b>collar</b> numbers starting with a 7 and transferees from other forces have <b>collar</b> numbers starting with 29.|$|R

5|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} their new shadows, the party travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that the villagers from Talta have started to head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, the party takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, the party finds the villagers attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once the villagers are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After the base is destroyed, the party heads north in search of Nene. Nene captures Kluke, and places a collar around her neck which Nene alleges will explode. After reaching Nene, Zola separates from the party to buy them time to attack Nene. When the party attempts to remove Kluke's collar, Nene absorbs the party's shadows by placing <b>collars</b> on all of them. After taking their powers and placing them in himself, he removes their <b>collars</b> and attempts to kill them before they recover. Shu, despite being drained of magical ability, unconsciously teleports the party to the distant Devour village.|$|E
5|$|Bona Allen saddles were {{available}} through the Sears mail order catalog, and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company, including cowboy actors Gene Autry, the cast of Bonanza, and Roy Rogers, who used a Bona Allen saddle on his horse Trigger. A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, <b>collars,</b> bridles, and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|Colonels wore three gold {{stars of}} the same size on their collar; the same as generals, but without the wreath. While {{lieutenant}} colonels wore two stars on their <b>collars,</b> majors wore one star, which was placed {{in the middle of the}} collar. Captains had three gold horizontal bars, first lieutenants wore two bars, and second lieutenants wore one bar. However, the Confederate Congress often created new commissions, and did not always standardize rank insignia immediately.|$|E
50|$|The <b>collar</b> is {{attached}} to the shirt by a pair of studs like those shown. The shirt has a tunic <b>collar,</b> a short upright band of fabric with a hole at the back and one on each side at the front. The stiff <b>collar</b> {{is attached}} at the back before the shirt is donned (and the tie placed under the <b>collar</b> for a turndown <b>collar),</b> then the shirt is put on, after which the front stud is pushed through the <b>collar</b> to fasten it.|$|R
25|$|A {{detachable}} <b>collar</b> is a <b>collar</b> {{separate from}} the shirt, fastened to the shirt by studs. Hannah Lord Montague invented the detachable <b>collar</b> in Troy, New York in 1827, after she snipped the <b>collar</b> off one of her husband's shirts to wash it, and then sewed it back on.|$|R
50|$|<b>Collar</b> stays {{are removed}} from shirts before dry {{cleaning}} or pressing, as they could damage the shirt in the process, and then are replaced prior to wearing. Shirts that are press ironed with the <b>collar</b> stays are vulnerable to damage, as {{this results in a}} telltale impression of the <b>collar</b> stay in the fabric of the <b>collar.</b> Some shirts have stays which are sewn into the <b>collar</b> and are not removable.|$|R
5|$|Declared {{the winner}} by Sakamochi, Shogo is escorted to his {{transport}} off the island, surrounded by soldiers. Sakamochi, however, reveals {{that he knows}} Nanahara and Nakagawa are alive and that his supposed execution of Noriko and Shuya was a ruse after he {{found a way to}} disable their <b>collars,</b> and attempts to kill Shogo. Shogo kills him as a hidden Nanahara and Nakagawa hijack the ship and kill the soldiers on board. As the boat sails towards the mainland, Shogo succumbs to his wounds sustained during the hijacking, and dies, but not before thanking Shuya and Noriko for being his friends.|$|E
5|$|Dog racing was {{originally}} {{an extension of}} hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated {{were said to be}} 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their <b>collars</b> at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing {{at the opposite end of}} the track waving towels.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast <b>collars</b> used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
40|$|Microscopic {{methods were}} used to {{investigate}} the unique <b>collar</b> structure of the gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacterium, strain DCB- 1. Polar cell growth apparently occurred from the <b>collar.</b> When the daughter cell was approximately equal in length to the mother cell and the <b>collar</b> was thus centrally located, cell division occurred within the <b>collar</b> region. Division was by a novel mechanism which conserved the <b>collar</b> of the mother cell and {{gave rise to a}} new <b>collar</b> of the daughter cell. Cells of DCB- 1 were also found to contain stacked internal membranes and glycogen bodies...|$|R

The <b>collar</b> is {{fastened to the}} shoulders with silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress). Since the <b>collar</b> signifies the Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong. The <b>collar</b> is only worn at specific occasions that warrant it.|$|R
