50|$|Although for {{the most}} part they are ignored in {{everyday}} life, it was not possible for education in the logical construction of the metric system to ignore the metric prefixes deci, <b>centi,</b> hecto and deka, since the derivation of the litre is dependent upon the knowledge that it derives from the volume of a cubic decimetre, i.e. 1000 cubic centimetres.|$|E

5000|$|Prefixes {{corresponding}} to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred. Hence 100 m is preferred over 1 hm (hectometre) or 10 dam (decametres).

However, some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre, because [...] "use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion".|$|E

5000|$|In the SI system, use of prefixes for {{powers of}} 1,000 is {{preferred}} {{and all other}} multiples discouraged.

In particular, use of the <b>centi</b> (10−2), deci (10−1), deca (10+1) and hecto (10+2) prefixes are still common. For example, in many European countries, the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of beverages (milk, beer, soft drinks, wine, etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats; decilitres are common in Switzerland and Scandinavia and sometimes found in cookbooks; centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles.

50|$|The {{show itself}} {{has now been}} {{considered}} (fictionally) by the government {{as if it were}} an illegal combat sport, and have been trying to shut down the underground organisation (led by new presenters Barney and Gemma) ever since. There are now four teams in each episode with one zook each. They take part in a street race at the beginning of each show, and the winning team gets to pick an opponent in the next game (Which is one-on-one and best of three). The two losing zooks take part in another challenge called pressure pusher with the zook that loses it being destroyed (each time a zook is destroyed, edited stock footage is used to show the considerably comical demise of each zook). The final three do a time-trial challenge, and again the losing zook is destroyed. The last two then compete in a rooftop assault course. The winner of this goes through to the next stage, as do the three losers who were fastest in the street race (The rest are destroyed). There are more house zooks too, a total of nine, These house zooks are called Mimi (she is also used as the symbol of Bamzooki in this series, and also used in the Boulder Dash and zook chicken game), The Beast, Peachy, Derek, Predator, <b>Centi,</b> Punka and Punkalicious and the winner of the series, Mean Green.The new series finished on 3 February 2010; it was broadcast at 5:15pm on the CBBC Channel.|$|E

Domestic violence is recorded as the offence in 963 claims. There has been a steady rise in the number of claims lodged where the applicant applies for statutory compensation for the compensable injury of domestic violence.j) In the year 2007/08, compensation assessors determined 1044 claims where sexual assault was recorded as the offence. Awards were made in 722 cases. Of the 944 claims for child sexual assault lodged out of time, 142 claims were lodged where the applicant is now aged 41-50 years, 65 claims where the applicant is now 51 to 60 years and 14 claims where the applicant is over 61 years.k) In recent times there has been substantial increase in the number of multiple claims lodged by some applicants - especially where sexual assaults or domestic violence is claimed. At present approximately 1000 victims have multiple compensable claims pending, generally such claims are historic.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the seismic response of Palazzo <b>Centi</b> after the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake. Built {{in the second}} half of XVIII century, Palazzo <b>Centi</b> is a three-storied building characterized by a rectangular plan with a central court. The vertical structural system is made of masonry walls arranged in plan to form a regular mesh. After the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake the building showed a widespread damage occurred in the vertical masonry structures with more intensity at upper storeys; there were also damages to non-structural parts: light masonry and fake vaults. The building case study is a paradigmatic example because during the 2009 earthquake, differently from other historical masonry buildings, it responded ‘‘reasonably’’ well in the main structural parts. The seismic behaviour was analyzed thoroughly in order to investigate the effectiveness of the, initially unknown, recent retrofit interventions carried out in 2003. These mechanical interventions proved to be the reason of the good seismic behaviour of the building and that ‘‘saved’’ it from more serious damages. On the basis of the data acquired by the authors during the post-earthquake reconnaissance activities and from the structural analyzes results, in conclusion, the case study of Palazzo <b>Centi</b> demonstrated to represent a clear example of the effectiveness of the traditional techniques in designing and retrofitting of masonry buildings...|$|E

The yield of the title compound is 75 % under the conditions that the molar ratio between acid-binding agents of triethylamine and acrylamide is 1 : 1 and the mass fraction of the catalys CuCl is 1 % of acrylamide. The optimal reaction temperature range is from 20 <b>centi</b> degree to 30 <b>centi</b> degree. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) value can reach 26. 7 % when the mass fraction of the title compound in the copolymer is 20 %.
