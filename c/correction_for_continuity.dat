40|$|The Delphi {{method is}} a means of {{structuring}} group communication process so that a group of experts can gather information or forecast future problems effectively. A primary objective of a Delphi study is to obtain consensual and consistent opinions from a group of experts in two or more successive rounds on a given research subject. Consensus and consistency are presumed to have been reached when a stopping criterion used for determining a consensus has been met.
