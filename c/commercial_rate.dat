[...] Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) {{that it will not}} flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses. [...] The World Energy Council (WEC) defines natural bitumen as [...] "oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10° API". [...] The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity. [...] Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria. According to the WEC, extra-heavy oil has [...] "a gravity of less than 10° API and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000centipoise".|$|E
