25|$|In early May 1948, the Jewish {{provisional}} government, {{known as}} Minhelet Ha'am, {{did not have}} its own postage stamps ready, so it used existing labels, both JNF labels, which otherwise have been printed since 1902 for fundraising purposes, and local <b>community</b> <b>tax</b> stamps. The JNF labels were given a Hebrew overprint meaning postage (doar), (as shown in the picture), whereas local <b>community</b> <b>tax</b> stamps were not given overprints. The JNF stamps were printed from May 3 to 14, 1948, their sale ended on May 14, 1948, with remaining stocks ordered to be returned and destroyed. Use of these stamps was tolerated until May 22, 1948. The Mandate's postal rates remained unchanged during this period.|$|E
25|$|As the Katipunan's Supremo, Andrés Bonifacio had a {{personal}} flag which depicts a white sun with an indefinite number of rays on a field of red. Below the sun are three white Ks arranged horizontally. This flag was first unveiled on August 23, 1896 during the Cry of Pugadlawin where the assembled Katipunan members tore their cedulas (<b>community</b> <b>tax</b> certificates) in defiance of Spanish authority. The flag was used later during the Battle of San Juan del Monte on August 30, 1896, the first major battle of the Philippine Revolution.|$|E

The exact date and location are disputed, but two possibilities have been officially {{endorsed by the}} Philippine government: August 26 in Balintawak and later, August 23 in Pugad Lawin. Thus, the event is called the [...] "Cry of Pugad Lawin" [...] or [...] "Cry of Balintawak". However, the issue is further complicated by other possible dates such as August 24 and 25 and other locations such as Kangkong, Bahay Toro and Pasong Tamo. Furthermore, at the time, [...] "Balintawak" [...] referred not only to a specific place, but also a general area that included some of the proposed sites, such as Kangkong.|$|E

The event, marked by the tearing of cedulas (<b>community</b> <b>tax</b> certificates) was later called the [...] "Cry of Balintawak" [...] or [...] "Cry of Pugad Lawin"; the exact location and date of the Cry are disputed. The Supreme Council of the Katipunan declared a nationwide armed revolution against Spain {{and called for a}} simultaneous coordinated attack on the capital Manila on August 29. Bonifacio appointed generals to lead rebel forces to Manila. Other Katipunan councils were also informed of their plans. Before hostilities erupted, Bonifacio reorganized the Katipunan into an open de facto revolutionary government and they named the nation and its government Haring Bayang Katagalugan (loosely translates to Tagalog Republic), with him as President and commander-in-chief (or generalissimo) of the rebel army and the Supreme Council as his cabinet.
