40|$|Suppose you and I {{belong to}} the same {{linguistic}} community and express in our public behaviour just the same <b>colour</b> <b>discriminations</b> and comparisons. Could you and I still have inverted colour experiences? Some philosophers think so. 1 In recent years, those who have doubted this have often appealed to the various &quot;asymmetries &quot; between colours as we perceive them. The argument has been roughly this: The relevant inversion requires that our colour experiences could differ with respect to their intrinsic qualities while having the same structure or form. But a close consideration of colours as we see them shows that this is not possible. For example, orange is perceived as a mix of yellow and red but red is not perceived as a mix of any two colours. A significantly darkened blue still looks blue while a significantly darkened yellow does not look yellow. Again, red is generally perceived as a warm colour while green is perceived as a cool colour. Because of these and many other differences, the intrinsic qualities of our experiences could not differ systematically while having the same structure. 2 However, the existence of such asymmetries is not the only difficulty for the view that you and I could be spectrum inverted while expressing the same <b>colour</b> <b>discriminations</b> and comparisons. Nor, I think, is it the main difficulty. I shall argue that the main difficulty is instead to give a satisfactory account of what you and I would believe and say on such a scenario. This problem is independent of any consideration regarding asymmetries. And as far as I am aware, nobody has to this day made plausible that it can be solved. In section 1, I specify the scenario I will consider. In section 2, I present an argument for its impossibility. In section 3, I consider some recent accounts of spectrum inversion.

No group differences were found in the learning of 3 pattern discriminations, but the animals with additional superior temporal sulcal lesions were more impaired than the others on 3 <b>colour</b> <b>discriminations,</b> successive reversals of an object discrimination, and a learning-set task.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{producing}} red-green and blue-yellow sinusoidal chromatic gratings is used which permits the correction of all chromatic aberrations. A quantitative criterion is adopted {{to choose the}} intensity match of the two colours in the stimulus: this is the intensity ratio at which contrast sensitivity for the chromatic grating differs most from the contrast sensitivity for a monochromatic luminance grating. Results show that this intensity match varies with spatial frequency and does not necessarily correspond to a luminance match between the colours. Contrast sensitivities to the chromatic gratings at the criterion intensity match are measured {{as a function of}} spatial frequency, using field sizes ranging from 2 to 23 deg. Both blue-yellow and red-green contrast sensitivity functions have similar low-pass characteristics, with no low-frequency attenuation even at low frequencies below 0. 1 cycles/deg. These functions indicate that the limiting acuities based on red-green and blue-yellow <b>colour</b> <b>discriminations</b> are similar at 11 or 12 cycles/deg. Comparisons between contrast sensitivity functions for the chromatic and monochromatic gratings are made at the same mean luminances. Results show that, at low spatial frequencies below 0. 5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to the chromatic gratings, consisting of two monochromatic gratings added in antiphase, than to either monochromatic grating alone. Above 0. 5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to monochromatic than to chromatic gratings...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experiments}} have revealed total loss of colour vision following removal of all inferior temporal cortex, a condition akin to complete cerebral achromatopsia in humans. Whether less extensive ablation genuinely impairs colour perception without abolishing it or retards learning involving coloured stimuli is contested. We therefore tested macaque monkeys, with total removal of temporal areas TEO and TE but sparing rostral and perirhinal temporal cortex {{and the upper}} bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Compared with three monkeys with lateral parietal ablations, the monkeys with TEO/TE lesions were impaired at learning and retention of simultaneous two-choice <b>colour</b> <b>discriminations</b> and with a nine-choice oddity discrimination whether the coloured target was embedded among grey distracters of the same luminance or among isoluminant coloured distracters. However, their performance was superior to that of an achromatopsic human subject and to that previously measured in monkeys with much larger temporal lobe ablation. They were only mildly impaired at nine-choice oddity discrimination for grey stimuli where the grey target was brighter than the grey distracters. The impairment could be exacerbated or alleviated by altering the colour of {{the background of the}} displays and by static and dynamic luminance masking of the entire display in a manner that indicates that the colour deficit reflects a change in perception rather than a disorder of learning and memory.

The only relevant previous source indicated the existence of large cells only. Lesions of the pigeon red nucleus (r. n.) effected a variety of symptoms including torticollis, abnormalities of leg muscle tone and movement, hyporeactivity, aphagia and asymmetry of pupil dilation although the latter was probably due to third nerve damage. Electrical stimulation of the r. n. produced contralateral circling and indications of staxia. Extensive investigation using electrical stimulation and evoked potential recording revealed telencephalic inputs to the r. n. from the archiastriatum medialis, hyperstriatum ventrale, parolfactory lobe, olfactory bulb and neostriatum intermedium, diencephalic projections from the lateral hypothalamus and nucleus rotundus and a cerebellar link with the nucleus lateralis. Comparison tdth mammalian connections disclosed some similarities and in addition suggested that links with amygdala and septum may exist in the mammal. Evoked potential and single unit recordings following visual, somaesthetic and auditory stimulation demonstrated that the avian r. n. and individual cells respond in a very similar manner to that of the mammal. An olfactory projection was also demonstrated by nerve stimulation.

40|$|The present work {{regards the}} {{commercial}} characterisation {{of the roman}} travertine, an ornamental stone of great value and ancient tradition, with the aim to define the existing correlations between the different commercial types and the physical and mineralogical characteristics of the stone; all this {{in order to establish}} an objective criteria for the definition of slab quality and also to conceive a common methodology for the technical and scientific characterization of the commercial aspects of ornamental stones. As a matter of fact there is no technical or esthetical method in this field that can objectively define the quality of the slabs of a certain stone from a commercial point of view. The slabs of each travertine variety were analysed from a mineralogical point of view and then aesthetically characterised through image analysis procedures, showing their homogeneity, brightness, colour index, band pattern and porosity. All parameters were then processed through the aid of multivariate statistical techniques, in order to define which of them are more significant in the stone’s esthetical characterisation. By projecting the system’s variables on the factorial planes of the statistical analysis (MCA), factor F 1 seems to be an index of the mineral composition and of the number of colours, being also able to discriminate among the various commercial types of roman travertine; F 2 represents the average brightness and bands homogeneity, discriminating at the same time among the commercial quality of the slabs; F 3 is an index for homogeneity, surface porosity, number of colours and it allows an easy discrimination among the qualities of the investigated typologies. Variations in the travertine’s commercial types are strongly related to mineral composition (contents in Sr and Mg), band pattern, brightness and colouring of the slabs. The Classico travertine is characterised by low tenors of the above mentioned elements, by average brightness and scarce colouring; the Bianco and the Alabastrino by intermediate tenors and high brightness; Noce and Striato by high tenors, low brightness and evident <b>colouring.</b> <b>Discriminations</b> within quality classes in the same commercial typology are instead related to variations in unhomogeneity, porosity and colouring of the slabs: specifically, an increase in quality for the different types is directly related to a decrease in these parameters...|$|R
