25|$|Unlike at the North Tower, initially, one of {{the three}} {{stairwells}} was still intact after Flight175 crashed into the South Tower. This was because the plane struck the tower offset from the center and not centrally as Flight 11 in the North Tower had done. Only 18 people passed the impact zone through the available stairway and left the South Tower safely before it collapsed. One of them, Stanley Praimnath, was on the 81st floor, and his office suffered a direct hit. He witnessed Flight 175 <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> him. One of the wings sliced through his office and wound up wedged in a doorway approximately 20 feet away from him.|$|E
25|$|Addison was extradited to New Hampshire, {{where he}} denied {{any role in}} the murder of Briggs. During a taped interview, Addison told his story six {{different}} times before confessing to authorities that he shot at the police officers <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> him. The Manchester District Court charged Addison with capital murder. Attorney General Kelly Ayotte sought the death penalty as murder of a police officer may be punishable by death under the state's capital punishment law. Later Addison was also charged with armed robbery, conspiracy and felony possession of a firearm in relation to a five-day crime spree that started a week before the homicide.|$|E
25|$|One day the moon, {{hearing of}} this, {{pulled on a}} black cloak over her yellow hair and went to see for herself. She fell into a pool, and a snag bound her there. She saw a man <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> the pool and fought to be free until the hood fell off; the light helped the man make his way to safety and scared off the evil creatures. She {{struggled}} to follow until the hood fell back over her hair, and all the evil things {{came out of the}} darkness, trapping her under a big stone with a will-o'-the-wyke to sit on the cross-shaped snag and keep watch.|$|E

25|$|During the shad bake {{lunch at}} Rosser's camp, two of Munford's pickets rode up {{to report that}} Union forces were {{advancing}} on all roads. Fitzhugh Lee and Pickett decided that since they could not hear an attack, due {{as it turned out}} to the thick pine forest and heavy atmosphere between the camp and Five Forks and an acoustic shadow, there was little to worry about. Soon after 4:00p.m., Pickett asked Rosser for a courier to take a message to Five Forks. Not long after that, two couriers were dispatched, the officers heard gunfire and saw the lead courier captured by Union horsemen on Ford's Road just across Hatcher's Run. Then they saw a Union Army battle line <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> the road.|$|E

2500|$|A {{supervisor}} in another building 300 yards away heard the fire alarm and walked outside. He {{had served in}} Vietnam, but said the explosion was worse than anything encountered in his war experience: [...] "I watched B-52s drop 500-pound bombs. This is the biggest explosion I ever saw and I saw some pretty good-sized ones. When it blew, the explosion kept rolling out, rolling out. We sat there and watched the ball of fire <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> us." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was then}} about three o'clock. The {{artillery}} barrage {{to the west}} had suddenly stopped. Union soldiers were surprised to see Stuart's entire force about a half mile away, <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> them, not in line of battle, but [...] "formed in close column of squadrons... A grander spectacle than their advance has rarely been beheld". Stuart recognized he now had little time to reach and attack the Union rear along Cemetery Ridge. He must make one, last effort {{to break through the}} Union cavalry.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the time}} of the {{formation}} of the Major Leagues to the 1960s, {{when it came to the}} control of the game of baseball the team owners held the whip hand. After the so-called [...] "Brotherhood Strike" [...] of 1890 and the failure of the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players and its Players National League, the owners control of the game seemed absolute. It lasted over 70 years despite a number of short-lived players organizations. In 1966, however, the players enlisted the help of labor union activist Marvin Miller to form the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). The same year, Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale – both Cy Young Award winners for the Los Angeles Dodgers – refused to re-sign their contracts, and the era of the reserve clause, which held players to one team, was <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> an end.|$|E

2500|$|Other sources {{acting as}} {{examples}} of Gunnhild's sorcery include the story of King Hákon's death in Snorri's Heimskringla, as well as instances concerning Egil in Egil's Saga,and suspicion surrounding the death of Halfdan Haraldsson [...] Heimskringla describes Hákon's ascent to the Norwegian throne after hearing of the cruelties caused by Eirík's rule. Hákon found great support among the Norwegian people, and therefore forced Eirík and Gunnhild to flee to England. Naturally many battles for the throne ensued, which ultimately led to Gunnhild getting blamed for Hákon's death, when an arrow flew towards him in battle piercing into the muscle of his upper arm. According to Heimskringla, it is stated that [...] "through the sorcery of Gunnhildr a kitchen boy wheeled round, crying: 'Make room for the king's slayer!' and let fly the arrow into the group <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> him and wounding the king." [...] Marlene Ciklamini reasons that the unusualness of the mortal wound directs the origin to possible sorcery involved, presumably by Gunnhild.|$|E
2500|$|Trigger {{got a new}} skipper, Roy S. Benson (Class of 1929), {{before her}} second war patrol, {{conducted}} from 23 September to 8 November in [...] "Empire Waters" [...] (the seas immediately surrounding Japan). In {{the early morning hours}} of 5 October, the submarine sighted smoke on the horizon and headed for it. A vessel soon appeared, <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> the submarine. As the target approached, the submarine identified it as a small ship. Trigger then surfaced and manned her machine guns. As the target neared, however, the submarine learned that the Japanese ship was larger than initially thought. Enemy shells soon began exploding close to Trigger, and the 4,000ton ship turned and accelerated in an attempt to ram the submarine. Trigger barely avoided a collision as she submerged for an attack; she launched two torpedoes and heard one hit. She then surfaced and gave chase, only to have the target again open fire. The submarine missed with three more torpedoes and then discontinued the pursuit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} of the 2011 U.S. Open against Samantha Stosur, Williams shouted [...] "Come on!" [...] as the Australian {{attempted}} to return a forehand Williams believed to be a winner. The chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the USTA's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, [...] "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed." [...] As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if she ever saw the umpire <b>coming</b> <b>toward</b> her, she should [...] "look the other way". Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki. Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, claiming, [...] "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count," [...] but added, [...] "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played really well." [...] A writer for ESPN suggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the [...] "probation" [...] on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have used profanity in addressing Asderaki during the match. In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the 2012 US Open because [...] "...Williams's conduct, while verbally abusive, [...] not {{rise to the level of}} a major offence under the Grand Slam code of conduct." ...|$|E
