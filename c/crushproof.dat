5000|$|The Ricoh WG-20 is {{a digital}} compact camera {{announced}} by Ricoh on February 5, 2014. It replaces the Pentax WG-10 and is rated as [...] "waterproof to 33 feet, shockproof from drops {{of up to}} five feet, coldproof to 14 degrees Fahrenheit and <b>crushproof,</b> withstanding up to 220 foot-pounds of force" [...] by its manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|The Olympus µ 1030 SW (also {{known as}} the Stylus 1030 SW) is 10.1 {{megapixel}} compact salt-water submersible digital camera introduced by Olympus Corporation in 2008. Shock-proof from heights of up to 2 m, waterproof up to a water pressure equivalent to 10 m depth, <b>crushproof</b> up to 100 kg, freezeproof up to -10 °C ...|$|E
50|$|The Olympus Stylus Tough TG-860 is {{a digital}} rugged compact camera {{announced}} by Olympus on February 5, 2015. It has built-in WiFi and GPS, and is waterproof {{to a depth}} of 15m (50 feet), freezeproof to -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), <b>crushproof</b> to a force of 100kg or 220 pounds. It's also shockproof against drops from up to 2.1m (7 feet) in height.|$|E
5000|$|All {{models in}} the K series have an orange bag full {{indicator}} light, and the Vulcano and Premium models also have a green [...] "mains on" [...] / standby light. K1 models have a lightweight <b>crushproof</b> hose that swivels both ends, but the K3 Vulcano and Premium have a heavier electric hose that does not swivel at the machine end, so does {{tend to be a}} slightly more unwieldy in use.|$|E
50|$|Turning {{his talents}} to other venues, Jayne {{authored}} a weekly {{column in the}} Shannon County Current Wave, in his adopted Ozark hometown of Eminence, Missouri. Jayne also hosted a radio show in Salem, Missouri at KSMO that attracted national attention for its satire, including the Snake and Tick Market Report, a regular feature that reported market prices for Hoo-Boy White Dot <b>Crushproof</b> Dry Valley Wonder Ticks and black, copperhead, coachwhip, garter and rattle snakes.|$|E
50|$|The Ricoh WG-30 is a rugged, {{waterproof}} digital compact camera {{announced by}} Ricoh on October 8, 2014. It is the successor of the Ricoh WG-20. The main advance is the backside-illuminated sensor that also increases resolution from 14 to 16 megapixels {{compared to the}} previous model. The rugged metrics have also increased, with now 40 feet rather than 33 feet of underwater depth tolerance advertised. As in the previous model, the WG-30 is shockproof to 1.5m (5ft), <b>crushproof</b> to 100kg (220lb) of force, and coldproof to -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit).|$|E
50|$|Rugged compact cameras {{typically}} include {{protection against}} submersion, {{hot and cold}} conditions, shock and pressure. Terms used to describe such properties include waterproof, freezeproof, heatproof, shockproof and <b>crushproof,</b> respectively. Nearly all major camera manufacturers {{have at least one}} product in this category. Some are waterproof to a considerable depth up to 82 feet (27 m); others only 10 feet (3m), but only a few will float. Ruggeds often lack some of the features of ordinary compact camera, but they have video capability and the majority can record sound. Most have image stabilization and built-in flash. Touchscreen LCD and GPS do not work under water.|$|E
5000|$|Horwitz {{was awarded}} the Coty Award in 1947 {{alongside}} Nettie Rosenstein, Adele Simpson, and Mark Mooring, the made-to-order designer for Bergdorf Goodman. That year, the awards were selected to reflect {{the best examples of}} each of the industry's four main branches, with Horwitz chosen to represent junior fashion. Horwitz said in 1987 that he received the award as much for his encouragement and support of his young employees as for his own work, particularly as he was conscious to hire young women who he would teach design and sales skills. Although Horwitz designed clothing, he saw himself as [...] "more of a stylist than a designer," [...] and worked closely with his young employees, choosing what to make up from their design drawings. In March 1953 LIFE ran an article showing a weekend capsule wardrobe designed by Betse Cann for Horwitz & Duberman, offering six <b>crushproof</b> outfits which could be fitted, along with underwear and accessories, into a single handbag.|$|E
30|$|Intermodal Transport Unit: a {{rigid and}} <b>crushproof</b> structure, {{generally}} unified {{in size and}} in some of its components, which is suitable for the containment and protection of goods and for mechanical transfer between different modes of transport [3]. The most common solutions are containers, which were created in particular for maritime transport, as well as swap bodies and semi-trailers, which are suitable for rail-road transport.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{structural}} {{behavior of the}} timber bridge drawn by Leonardo by Vinci in Fol. 22 r. a Atlantic Code is analyzed, which can be ascribed to a special timber arch bridge typology. In fact, the arch behavior is obtained by the spatial disposition of rectilinear joists. Based upon Leonardo’s sketch, a geometric model of the military bridge has been made, focusing upon the more interesting technological aspects of this solution: timber beams connections, made resorting to special lashings; timber beams disposition on staggered planes, making a <b>crushproof</b> spatial whole, which behaves like an arch. In such reconstruction, the technological abilities of the epoch in which the bridge {{would have had to}} be built are kept in mind. At this aim, the study of the Palladian reconstruction of Caesar’s bridge on the Rhine is particularly meaningful, in relation specifically to connections with lashings. With reference to the disposition of timber beams, it is of great interest the comparison with the bridge built in 2000 at Jinze, in the outskirts of Shanghais, as a reproduction of the ancient "rainbow bridge ", built during the Sung Dynasty (960 - 1280 A. D.) in the city of Khaifeng...|$|E
