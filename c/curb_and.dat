5|$|From {{the late}} 1840s into the 1870s, Texas stockmen drove their beef cattle through {{southern}} Arizona on the Texas–California trail. Texans {{were impressed with}} the grazing possibilities offered by the Gadsden Purchase country of Arizona. In {{the last third of}} the century, they moved their herds into Arizona and established the range cattle industry there. The Texans contributed their proven range methods to the new grass country of Arizona, but also brought their problems as well. Texas rustlers brought lawlessness, poor management resulted in overstocking, and carelessness introduced destructive diseases. But these difficulties did force laws and associations in Arizona to <b>curb</b> <b>and</b> resolve them. The Anglo-American cattleman frontier in Arizona was an extension of the Texas experience.|$|E

This entrance is {{a few feet from}} the <b>curb</b> <b>and</b> the effect was that the back of Belcourt was turned to the nouveau riche on Bellevue Avenue.|$|E

25|$|The {{stretch of}} road {{descending}} into Peekskill Hollow was very problematic. Roosevelt feared that route would take the parkway too far east. It offered a view into the valley as it descended, but to preserve existing rock outcrops {{it was necessary to}} route it so that it descended at an 8.5% grade and make the roadway so narrow that there was only a foot (30.5cm) between the <b>curb</b> <b>and</b> the wall on either side.|$|E

25|$|Originally Riselaw Road School was a hub for the {{community}}. Now, {{the local}} primary {{school has been}} amalgamated and renamed as Carisbrook School Heights Site. It has two classes on its roll. Adjacent to the school is the Riselaw Road Playcentre. Other community facilities include two public bus services, Calton Hill Community Hall, the Dunedin Public Library Book bus (which visits the suburb once a week), two children's playground areas, sports fields alongside the school, and other public infrastructure typical of a New Zealand suburb (street lights, <b>curb</b> <b>and</b> channel drainage etc.). Potential public recreation areas lie to the north with a forest reserve, and to the south with under utilised sports grounds and bordering farmland. The nearest secondary schools are Queen's High School and King's High School located in Forbury, 2–3km to the south on the boundary between South Dunedin and St Kilda. The closest commercial/retail area is in South Road, Caversham. Residents are serviced by two retail food businesses on opposite ends of Riselaw Road. There are a few home-based businesses, but the area is primarily residential.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} the boys find a girl crying on the <b>curb</b> <b>and</b> realize she is the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a parade. The {{carnival}} is out searching the streets {{for the two of}} them. The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Holloway pretends not to know the two boys whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke at her- choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Holloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves {{in the midst of a}} giant storm. Mr. Dark appears and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Holloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Holloway's heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles Holloway looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the late}} 1970s, rings were removed during {{sidewalk}} reconstruction or repair for safety purposes. In 1978, after one Portland resident complained about the disappearance of rings, Connie McCready, then a City Commissioner, announced that rings could be replaced at a homeowner's request, likely for a fee of $5. Today, the city of Portland is committed to preserving the horse rings, which are reinstalled following <b>curb</b> <b>and</b> sidewalk construction or repair. An ordinance requires rings to be replaced at their original location (or [...] "as close as practical"). Original street names are also reset or restamped into new concrete. The ring supply is monitored by the Bureau of Maintenance. Portland {{is not the only}} city to preserve horse rings. City officials in Oak Harbor, Washington, confirmed that the last in a series of horse rings would be preserved during a February 2011 sidewalk construction project.|$|E

500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} video a {{positive}} review, {{calling it a}} [...] "visual triumph", with [...] "breathtaking" [...] art direction, and a [...] "gray-blue-black color palette carefully calibrated by Gaga's vibrant lipstick and nail polish, a red painted stripe on the <b>curb,</b> <b>and</b> the gold of her jewelry and the studs on her leather, not to mention Clarence Clemons's brass." [...] The video was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel," [...] Janet Jackson's [...] "When I Think of You" [...] and [...] "The Pleasure Principle", and the film, Crimes of Passion, all of them being 1980s videos and films. He did, however, criticize Gaga's [...] "half-convincing" [...] lip-synching. Writing for The Washington Post, Sarah Anne Hughes called the video [...] "shockingly simple". Amos Barshad from New York liked the straight approach Gaga took with the video, and although he called it boring compared to Gaga's previous efforts, he felt the video worked well because of the simplicity.|$|E
500|$|The album {{contains}} the singles [...] "If I Ruled the World", which features guest vocals from Lauryn Hill, and [...] "Street Dreams". Music critic J.R. Reynolds {{wrote that the}} former has Nas [...] "rapping his way to anarchy in an imagined world where he kicks discipline to the <b>curb</b> <b>and</b> good times rule." [...] In the song, he states that he would [...] "open every cell in Attica/send them to Africa". The latter is an account {{on the impact of}} drugs in Nas's neighborhood. The song contains smooth bass lines and frail drums, and it features an interpolation of the Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). The album also features guest appearances from Mobb Deep and The Firm, a supergroup which was initially composed of Nas, AZ, Cormega and Foxy Brown. The group makes an appearance on the song [...] "Affirmative Action", a tale of robbery and three characters with mob connections. Brett Berliner of Stylus Magazine described the song's beat as [...] "extremely mafioso, sounding straight out of Goodfellas, with strings and crescendos", while he cited the song as [...] "one of the best posse tracks of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|On one account, {{sustainability}} [...] "concerns the {{specification of}} a set of actions to be taken by present persons that will not diminish the prospects of future persons to enjoy levels of consumption, wealth, utility, or welfare comparable to those enjoyed by present persons". Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and ecological consequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics represents: [...] "...a broad interpretation of ecological economics where environmental and ecological variables and issues are basic but part of a multidimensional perspective. Social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis." [...] However, the concept of sustainability is much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins. At present, the average per capita consumption of people in the developing world is sustainable but population numbers are increasing and individuals are aspiring to high-consumption Western lifestyles. The developed world population is only increasing slightly but consumption levels are unsustainable. The challenge for sustainability is to <b>curb</b> <b>and</b> manage Western consumption while raising the standard of living of the developing world without increasing its resource use and environmental impact. This must be done by using strategies and technology that break the link between, on the one hand, economic growth and on the other, environmental damage and resource depletion.|$|E
