Chief Wiggum blindly jumps {{to the conclusion that the}} vandalism at the school is the work of kids and immediately enforces a curfew on all of Springfield's children, prohibiting them from being on the streets after sunset. Bart and Lisa, as well as the other children of Springfield, are annoyed with not being allowed out after sunset. The children soon rally together to rebel and see an old drive-in horror movie which they saw advertised on television, called [...] "The Bloodening", a film recently discovered in a <b>concrete</b> <b>vault</b> after it was deemed too violent. While at the movie, the movie was interrupted as they are caught by Chief Wiggum. As a punishment, the children must clean a police billboard with Wiggum on it.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few miles}} outside {{town at the}} former Walker ranch is a [...] by [...] {{underground}} steel and <b>concrete</b> <b>vault,</b> built by the Scientology organization called Church of Spiritual Technology to hold [...] "the wisdom of the ages." [...] The Church owns over [...] of land and the facility also includes a large caretaker's house and a guard house. The vault {{is one of several}} across the U.S. and is similar to Trementina Base. [...] Prior to construction of this vault, on June 12, 1986, the oldest house in the Petrolia area was deliberately burned by the Church of Spiritual Technology to clear the way for their construction, and symbols were cut in the ground above the vault to mark its location.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{environmental}} {{concern is that}} traditional burial takes up {{a great deal of}} space. In a traditional burial, the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials. In the United States, the casket is often placed inside a <b>concrete</b> <b>vault</b> or liner before burial in the ground. While individually this may not take much room, combined with other burials, it can over time cause serious space concerns. Many cemeteries, particularly in Japan and Europe as well as those in larger cities, have run out of permanent space. In Tokyo, for example, traditional burial plots are extremely scarce and expensive,and prices so high that a burial plot in Tokyo a mere 21 feet square could easily cost $150,000. }} and in London, a space crisis led Harriet Harman to propose reopening old graves for [...] "double-decker" [...] burials.|$|E

40|$|Disposing of {{low-level}} waste (LLW) {{is a concern}} for many states throughout the United States. A common disposal method is below-grade <b>concrete</b> <b>vaults.</b> Performance assessment analyses make predictions of contaminant release, transport, ingestion, inhalation, or other routes of exposure, and the resulting doses for various disposal methods such as the below-grade <b>concrete</b> <b>vaults.</b> Numerous assumptions are required to simplify the processes associated with the disposal facility to make predictions feasible. In general, these assumptions are made conservatively so as to underestimate {{the performance of the}} facility. The objective of this report is to describe the methodology used in conducting a performance assessment for a hypothetical waste facility located in the northeastern United States using real data as much as possible. This report consists of the following: (a) a description of the disposal facility and site, (b) methods used to analyze performance of the facility, (c) the results of the analysis, and (d) the conclusions of this study...|$|R

50|$|The basic plan is {{to provide}} a {{structure}} that is very strong in physical compression. The most common purpose-built structure is a buried, steel reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>vault</b> or arch. Most expedient (makeshift) blast shelters are civil engineering structures that contain large buried tubes or pipes such as sewage or rapid transit tunnels. Improvised purpose-built blast shelters normally use earthen arches or vaults. To form these, a narrow (1-2 meter) flexible tent of thin wood is placed in a deep trench (usually the apex is below grade), and then covered with cloth or plastic, and then covered with 1-2 meter of tamped earth.|$|E

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{has a large}} {{quantity}} of low-level waste, {{in the form of}} concrete monoliths, that are stored in large <b>concrete</b> <b>vaults</b> in ORNL's Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVST). During FY 2000, a number of the monoliths were transferred from the <b>concrete</b> <b>vaults</b> to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) -certified lead-shielded cask and shipped to the Nevada Test Site (NTS) for disposal. This activity has resulted in (1) increased radiation exposure both when the monoliths were transferred to the lead-shielded cask and when they were unloaded and buried at the NTS and (2) high cask rental and shipping costs for the program, and (3) the accumulation of empty vaults at ORNL which will also have to be disposed of at NTS, adding a significant additional transportation cost. As a result, Department of Energy (DOE) [...] Oak Ridge has been exploring ways to ship the MVST cask with its monolith to the NTS for disposal as a unit. To do this, the MVST cask would have to be self-certified as meeting IP- 2 package requirements...|$|R
