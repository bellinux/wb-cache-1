A quasi-one-dimensional {{numerical}} mode 1 {{containing a}} prognostic turbulent kinetic energy parameterization and simplified approximations to horizontal gradients {{is used to}} study interactions of thermally induced nocturnal slope flows with following and opposing ambient winds. It is found that a following ambient wind causes the peak perturbation wind to be weaker and to be realized at a greater height, while an opposing ambient wind leads to a stronger perturbation wind at a lower height. The reason for this response lies in the interactions of the shears of the thermal and ambient components through the mechanical production of turbulent kinetic energy.

40|$|Mobile {{transgressive}} dune {{systems are}} often {{overlooked in the}} study of coastal morphodynamics and sediment budgets. Inundation bK sand of abutting agricultural land and infrastructure has recurred throughout the 2 ot 1 century, frequently accompanied by requests by farming communities to the government to stabilise the dunes. In addition, the association of sea-beach-coastal dunes provides an attractive setting for residential I holiday developments on dune systems. Yet {{little is known about the}} pattern of dune mobility in response to changing atmospheric conditions (rainfall, air temperature and wind speed) and their effect on dune mobility and the rate of actual and predicted dune migration. The work presented in this thesis addresses the evolution of a parabolic dune, dune mobility and migration. Quantitative data were collected to determine process-response in an actively mobile long-walled asymmetric parabolic dune located on the western coastline of northeast Tasmania, Australia. The data were acquired over a period of four years from a composite of geomorphic survey techniques that incorporated repeated surveys of the ground surface topography using kinematic GPS and arrays of erosion pins, which were linked to analysis of wind flow patterns acquired from an on-site 2 m high meteorology station, and analysis of sediment that forms the dune. Wind shear velocity (u*) and roughness length (zo) were measured close to the ground on windward slopes, and speed-up ratios were determined. Analysis oftemporallyspaced ortho-rectified and georeferenced aerial photography extended the duration of the survey by fifty years to establish the longer term evolution of the parabolic dune, including the downwind and lateral migration rates of the dune system. The level of accuracy (planimetric accuracies typically in the range of 2 - 5 cm and vertical accuracies of 3 - 10 cm) achieved in the six epochs of kinematic GPS surveys provided reliable GPS data that were used to construct three-dimensional topographic models of the dune system on 5 m x 5 m grids using kriging. The topographic models displayed the general patterns of displacement and accretion of sediment that maintain dune form. Using cross-sectional profiles, at representative locations across the dune, the pattern of process-response between wind speed I wind direction on the direction of sand movement and on morphodynamics was clearly evident. A series of morphological parameters were extracted from the kinematic GPS data to quantify dune migration rates, dune volumes, and dune reconstitution time. The measured migration rate of the parabolic dune head was 21. 5 m/yr (mean value) measured over 4 years, and 27. 3 m/yr measured from a fifty-year sequence of orthorectified, georeferenced, digitised aerial photography. The head of the dune reconstitutes at the rate of 8. 9 years, with a volume of 100, 800 m 3. Volumetric change for the study site over an interval of thirty months was in the range of 656, 400 m 3. The majority of sand transport is generated by moderate velocity wind flows which have a higher frequency of occurrence. Forty one percent of wind events occur in the moderate velocity category (4 to 12 to> 20 m/s. Measurement of flow close to the ground on windward slopes indicated that shear stress does not progressively increase from toe to <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope</b> due to interaction between flow and bed form. Some seventy percent of wind events are topographically aligned; across dune flow from the SW sector results in lateral migration of the trailing arms, with the smaller south trailing arm migrating ENE at more than twice the rate of the north trailing arm. This rate of lateral displacement maintains the 3 : 1 length to width ratio of the asymmetric parabolic dune by maintaining the dimensions of the deflation plain which in turn maintains the dynamic equilibrium of the aerodynamic envelope of the dune form. This integrated approach has provided quantitative evidence that demonstrates the dynamic feedback between the prevailing wind regime and seasonal and discrete wind flow events on the dune bed, and the influence of atmospheric conditions on dune mobility...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the data {{collected}} from the field monitoring of slope inclinometers, in place inclinometers (IPIs) and vibrating wire piezometers (VWPs) installed in a multiple retrogressive landslide are evaluated and re-interpreted. The goal {{of this research was}} to evaluate the IPIs in particular, as part of a real-time slope stability monitoring system. The real-time monitoring system was installed by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (SMHI) to monitor a multiple retrogressive landslide affecting Highway No. 302 near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. The instrumentation was connected to an automatic data collection and communication system so that data was available remotely via the ARGUS monitoring website. The instrumentation system was implemented after manual displacement monitoring confirmed high rates of movement. The automated landslide monitoring system utilized IPIs and VWPs. The instruments were installed next to Highway No. 302 at the crest of the slope and next to the North Saskatchewan River at the toe of the slope. Data was collected between September 18, 2005 and July 2, 2006. The near real-time data provided from the instrumentation was pore water pressure, river level, and lateral slope displacement at an hourly interval. Site investigation and slope inclinometer monitoring confirmed a major slip surface located in the glaciolacustrine clay deposit just above the clay/till contact. Slope inclinometer monitoring showed that the toe of the slope was moving at greater rates and magnitudes than the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> <b>slope.</b> This observation of movement was consistent in the literature regarding other multiple retrogressive landslides using manual methods of monitoring. The installation of the automated monitoring system allowed instrument data to be collected at hourly intervals. Consistent periodic reading intervals captured data from the IPIs that showed the crest of the slope was moving more quickly than the toe. This was a significant observation that may not have been captured with manual readings with a traversing slope inclinometer probe. Observations were also made by correlating displacement data from IPIs at the toe of the slope with river level. It was shown that movement began after a rise and fall in river level. This suggests that displacement of the landslide was triggered by river bank erosion due to higher seasonal flows or alternately a rapid drawdown mechanism. On October 13, 2005, 25 days after installation of the IPIs, a major disturbance in the readings at both the crest and toe of the slope occurred. After this disturbance the crest was moving at greater rates than the toe. The initial disturbance was attributed to a settling of the head assembly of the IPIs triggered by global failure of the slope. Additional disturbances were noted in the IPIs at the toe of the slope and attributed to the casing contacting the IPIs. A geometric analysis was developed to verify that the unexpected movement could have been caused by the casing contacting the IPIs. The geometric analysis included observation of the shear induced deformation profile of the slope inclinometer casing, IPIs diameter, IPIs length and the annular space between the casing and the IPIs. The geometric analysis verified that the IPIs at the toe of the slope were likely affected by the IPIs coming into contact with the casing. Casing contact could affect the IPIs orientation and depth position, resulting in unexpected data. An additional set of IPIs data from a landslide near Aylesbury, Saskatchewan was used to compare to the IPIs data from Highway No. 302. Data comparison showed that there were erratic readings from the IPIs at the Highway No. 302 site while the IPIs at the Aylesbury site generally remained stable and consistent. This data also confirmed that the IPIs at Highway No. 302 were affected by casing contact. The near real-time monitoring system was an excellent risk management tool for SMHI. Due to the rate and magnitude of movement the instrumentation was destroyed sooner than expected. The data set produced allowed for evaluation of the landslide and performance of the IPIs. In conjunction with the river data the IPIs helped identify potential failure mechanisms. Additional work is required to ensure that the data from IPIs can be used to evaluate landslide kinematics. In particular ensuring that the IPIs are not used beyond their capability and providing realistic data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A frequency-domain {{parametric}} {{study using}} generalized consistent transmitting boundaries has been performed {{to evaluate the}} significance of topo-graphic effects on the seismic response <b>of</b> steep <b>slopes.</b> The {{results show that the}} peak amplification of motion at the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> a <b>slope</b> occurs at a normalized frequency 1 t/ 2 = 0. 2, where H is the slope height and 2 is the wavelength of the motion. The importance of the natural site frequency is illustrated by the analysis of a stepped layer over a half-space. It was found that the natural frequency of the region behind the crest can dominate the response, relative to the topographic effect, for the con-ditions studied. Moreover, the effect of topography can be handled separately from the amplification due to the natural frequency of the deposit behind the <b>crest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>slope.</b> This concept <b>of</b> separating the amplification caused by topography from that caused by the natural frequency is advantageous {{to the development of a}} simplified method to estimate topographic effects...|$|R

40|$|The seismic {{stability}} <b>of</b> earth <b>slopes</b> {{has been}} a topic of considerable interest in geotechnical engineering practice {{for the past few}} decades. The failure <b>of</b> <b>slopes</b> during earthquakes can lead to the significant losses. The seismic stability <b>of</b> <b>slopes</b> is influenced by many factors and complete slope stability evaluation must consider the effects of each like geological, hydrological, topographical, geometrical, strong ground motion parameters during an earthquake and soil characteristics all influence the stability <b>of</b> a <b>slope.</b> Hence, the seismic performance of these structures requires appropriate evaluation during their design.

50|$|The {{passage of}} the {{earthquake}} waves through the rock and soil produces {{a complex set of}} accelerations that effectively act to change the gravitational load on the slope.
