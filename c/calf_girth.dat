40|$|Introduction: Compression {{garments}} (CGs) {{are becoming}} increasingly popular in many sports as they are believed to aid performance and recovery. Likewise the use of ice therapy {{is one of the}} most used recovery strategies by athletes and sports people. Purpose: The purpose of these studies was to examine the effect of CGs on physiological, biomechanical and perceptual measures of performance and recovery after 10 km running; and to assess the combined use of compression and ice on recovery post eccentric exercise. Method: Two separate studies were conducted; Phase 1 was a randomised control study in which thirteen recreationally competitive male 10 km runners (Age (median) : 26 years (19 - 48 years), Height: 178 ?? 5 cm, Mass: 76. 2 ?? 6. 5 kg, V??O 2 Max: 50 ?? 5 ml. kg- 1. min- 1) undertook four 10 km runs. The interventions were; CON (no intervention), EX (CGs during run), REC (CGs for 12 hours post run) and EXREC (CGs during and 12 hours post run). During the runs heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), blood lactate and performance time were measured. Post run (24 hours) creatine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein (CRP), <b>calf</b> <b>girths,</b> and perceived pain were measured. A separate muscle oscillations test was also performed; where participants completed two 30 second runs at 12 km. h- 1, wearing CGs (CG) and no CGs (CON). During the runs peak velocity, peak acceleration, average velocity and peak displacement of the calf muscle was measure using a 3 D infrared camera system. Phase 2 was a randomised control study in which nine healthy male volunteers (Age (median) : 23 years (20 - 27 years), Height: 178. 7 ?? 5. 3 cm, Mass: 78. 2 ?? 14. 4 kg) completed 3 trials: CON (no intervention), REC (CGs for 12 hours post run) and ICE (ice protocol and CGs for 12 hours post run). Each trial consisted of an eccentric muscle damage protocol followed by a 1 km time trial 48 hours post exercise. Perceptual measures of muscle pain, perceived ability and perceived recovery were measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours post eccentric exercise, with a questionnaire. Muscle damage (CK), <b>calf</b> <b>girths</b> and 1 km performance time were measured 48 hours post run. Results: Phase 1; there were no significant differences in 10 km run time, HR, RPE, lactate, CK, CRP, <b>calf</b> <b>girths,</b> perceived pain, peak or average calf muscle velocity, or peak acceleration of calf muscle with any application of CGs compared to the control (p > 0. 05). During the muscle oscillation test a significant reduction in calf muscle displacement was found with CGs (p < 0. 05). Phase 2; there were no significant differences in 1 km run performance, CK or <b>calf</b> <b>girths,</b> 48 hours post run (p < 0. 05). There were inconsistent improvements in muscle pain, perceived recovery and perceived maximum ability in the REC and ICE trials compared to control (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Neither CGs nor ice had any physiological effects on performance or recovery. Compression reduced the displacement of the calf muscle during running, which could lead to increased efficiency over longer duration races such as marathons. Compression garments and ice improved some perceptual measures or recovery; however, these results were inconsistent and likely to represent a placebo effect...|$|R

Twenty-eight women (mean age: 40. 21 ± standard deviation of 8. 12 years old) with one to three years of reformer Pilates experience participated in the study. The women participated in a reformer Pilates program for 16 weeks (one hour, twice per week) after 4 weeks of detraining (summer holidays) in 2012. The International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry full profile was assessed before and after the intervention program. Significant decreases (p ≤ 0. 05) from pre- to post-program were observed for triceps, iliac crest, supraspinale, abdominal, front thigh and medial calf skinfold thicknesses, six and eight skinfold thickness sums, forearm and ankle girths, waist/hip ratio, endomorphy, and fat mass.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aims of {{the present}} study were to assess {{competitive}} sprinters’ body size and composition and to determine their impact on performance. METHODS: Ninety-eight competitive male sprinters (100 m) participated in this cross-sectional study. A series of measurements was directly taken and data on muscular strength and power tests were self-reported. Body composition was assessed by skinfold method and somatotype was calculated by the Heath-Carter anthropometric method. Sprinters were classified into three groups depending on their personal best time and comparisons were performed between the athletes in the top and in the bottom tertiles. Relationships between anthropometric traits and performance were assessed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients. RE SULTS: Top sprinters had significantly greater body mass index, relaxed and contracted upper arm <b>girths,</b> thigh and <b>calf</b> <b>girths,</b> fat free mass and fat free mass index, and lower ectomorphy than the lowest tertile. Strength and power were significantly higher. Personal best time was significantly correlated with several anthropometric traits and indices of lean body mass. CONCLUSIONS: Body size, composition and somatotype differ between performance levels in speed running. Being less ectomorphic, with a greater fat free mass and strength, can explain significant differences in sprinting performances. The results presented in this study provide a point of reference about sprinter characteristics, which can help coaches and sport scientists to improve sprinter performance...|$|R

The aim of {{present study was}} to evaluate how a relatively long-term training program in 11 - 14 -year-old male Iranian students affects their anthropometric and motor performance measures. Methods: Measurements were conducted on the anthropometric and fitness components of participants (n = 28) prior to and following the program. They trained 20 weeks, 1. 5 h/session with 10 min rest, in 4 times trampoline training programs per week. Motor performance of all participants was assessed using standing long jump and vertical jump based on Eurofit Test Battery. Results: The analysis of variance (ANOVA) repeated measurement test showed a statistically significant main effect of time in <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> P = 0. 001, fat% P = 0. 01, vertical jump P = 0. 001, and long jump P = 0. 001. The ANOVA repeated measurement test revealed a statistically significant main effect of group in fat% P = 0. 001. Post hoc paired t-tests indicated statistical significant differences in trampoline group between the two measurements about <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> (t = − 4. 35, P = 0. 001), fat% (t = 5. 87, P = 0. 001), vertical jump (t = − 5. 53, P = 0. 001), and long jump (t = − 10. 00, P = 0. 001).

Twelve rugby league players (mean ± SD age, 24. 4 ± 3. 5 years) underwent a standardized 1 -on- 1 tackling drill in a 10 -m grid. Video footage {{was taken from the}} rear, side, and front of the defending player. Tackling proficiency was assessed using standardized technical criteria. In addition, all players underwent measurements of anthropometry (stature, body mass, sum of 7 skinfolds, arm, chest, waist, gluteal, thigh, and <b>calf</b> <b>girths,</b> and biepicondylar humerus and femur breadths), somatotype (endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy), acceleration (5 - and 10 -m sprint), change-of-direction speed (modified 505 test), lower-body muscular power (vertical jump), and upper-body muscular power (overhead medicine ball throw). Differences in tackling ability and physiological and anthropometric qualities between the best (N = 6) and worst (N = 6) tacklers were compared using the Cohen effect size (ES) statistic. Eta coefficients (η) were used to determine the relationships among physiological and anthropometric qualities and tackling proficiency. Better tacklers were older (ES = 1. 9), more experienced (ES = 1. 0), shorter (ES = 1. 2), lighter (ES = 2. 3), and leaner (ES = 1. 3) than players with poor tackling proficiency. Better tacklers also had greater levels of mesomorphy (ES = 0. 3), acceleration (ES = 2. 3), and change-of-direction speed (ES = 0. 5) than poor tacklers. The strongest correlates of tackling ability were age (η = 0. 70), skinfold thickness (η = − 0. 68), body mass (η = − 0. 72), waist girth (η = − 0. 79), gluteal girth (η = − 0. 74), and level of endomorphy (η = − 0. 65).

In order to evaluate the fitness of the naval servicemen, we applied a testing procedure that included measurements of 7 fitness tests and 15 body anthropometric tests. A negative correlation was found between the body fat percentage and all the analyzed sprint tests and three anaerobic power tests (r), SP 5 (r=– 0. 42), SP 10 (r=– 0. 51), SP 20 (r=– 0. 53), SJ (r=– 0. 45), CM (r=– 0. 57), SLJ (r=– 0. 67). Also a negative correlation was found between the body fat percentage and VO 2 max (r=– 0. 44). A positive correlation was found between the sprint test and the power performance test and thigh and <b>calf</b> <b>girth.</b> Spiriting ability is influenced by the strength of a person.

The animals were bred by artificial insemination (AI) to one Limousin bull to calve at 2 years of age. The BBF and LF were bucket reared while the SLF and C were single-suckled to 7 - 8 months of age. Subsequently, all animals were treated similarly. Because of {{the small number of}} C involved, information on these was excluded in breed comparisons but was included for correlations between various traits. The main findings were: • The mean liveweights at calving were 524, 521 and 583 kg for BBF, LF and SLF animals, respectively. • Measurements taken during late pregnancy showed that SLF had significantly greater wither height, pelvic height, pelvic width, cannon bone length and hind-quarter roundness than the BBF and LF which were the same. These differences tended to reflect the liveweight differences recorded. • Chest width of both the SLF and BBF was greater than for LF indicating, that despite having similar liveweights, the BBF had a wider chest than the LF. • Gestation length was longer for the SLF (294 days) than for the other two breed types (290 days). • There was no significant effect of heifer breed type on calf birth weight but when expressed as a proportion of dam liveweight, birth weights of the BBF were greater than SLF with {{no significant difference between the}} LF and the other two breed types. • Calving difficulty score was significantly higher for BBF than for SLF with LF intermediate. The incidence of caesareans was 29 %, 10 % and 0 % for the BBF, LF and SLF, respectively. Cow internal pelvic height was greater for the SLF than for the other two breed types but there was no effect of breed type on pelvic width. Pelvic areas were 272 cm 2 for BBF, 279 cm 2 for LF and 285 cm 2 for SLF. Those were not significantly different. • There was no significant relationship between cow liveweight or external skeletal measurements and calf birth weight. • Calf birth weight was positively related to cow internal pelvic width and pelvic area. • There was a close relationship between the birth weight of calves and <b>calf</b> chest <b>girth,</b> hind-quarter roundness and calf head circumference. • Calving difficulty score increased with increasing birth weight and particularly as birth weights expressed as a proportion of cow weight increased. • Increased hind-quarter roundness and increased chest <b>girth</b> of the <b>calf</b> were associated with increased calving difficulties. • Calving difficulty score decreased as cow size increased. All correlations between calving difficulty score and external skeletal measurements were negative but only those with withers height and pelvic height were significant.

40|$|Background: Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament reconstruction {{has become one}} of the most successful procedures in orthopedic medicine. Currently, the weak link lies in the fixation. The fixation must be able to resist slippage during cyclic loading of the graft during the first 2 months after surgery prior to conversion from mechanical to biological fixation. Several studies have shown Intrafix screws to work well with fixation in the femur; however, security of the fit in the tibia is still under debate. Study Design: Prospective double-blinded study Methods: In 30 patients anterior ligament reconstruction was performed using a four-stranded hamstring graft using either an Intrafix sheath and screw combination or Delta screw for tibial fixation. The subjects were then evaluated with IKDC subjective surveys, physical examinations, KT- 1000 measurements, quadriceps and <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> measurements and radiographic examinations. Results/Conclusion: No statistically significant differences in IKDC subjective reports, KT- 1000 measurements, quadriceps and calf musculature strength and girth, and postoperative radiographic examination were observed between the two different types of fixation devices. Clinical Relevance: Improvements in fixation devices, specifically the Intrafix and Delta Screws, have been proven to improve tibial fixation and reduce injury to soft tissue grafts. At this time our study shows no statistically significant difference between these fixation devices...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2016 BMJ Publishing GroupBackground: Tibial stress {{fractures}} cause {{a significant}} burden to Royal Marines recruits. No prospective running gait analyses have previously been performed in military settings. Aim: We aimed to identify biomechanical gait factors and anthropometric variables {{associated with increased}} risk of TSF. Methods: 1065 Royal Marines recruits were assessed in week- 2 of training. Bilateral plantar pressure and 3 D lower limb kinematics were obtained for barefoot running at 3. 6 m. s- 1, providing dynamic arch index, peak heel pressure and lower limb joint angles. Age, bimalleolar breadth, <b>calf</b> <b>girth,</b> passive hip internal/external range of motion and body mass index (BMI) were also recorded. Ten recruits who sustained a TSF during training were compared with 120 recruits who completed training injury-free using a binary logistic regression model to identify injury risk factors. Results: Four variables significantly (p< 0. 05) predicted increased risk of TSF (odds ratios and 95 % CI) : smaller bimalleolar width (0. 73, 0. 58 - 0. 93), lower BMI (0. 56, 0. 33 - 0. 95), greater peak heel pressure (1. 25, 1. 07 - 1. 46) and lower range of tibial rotation (0. 78, 0. 63 - 0. 96).

Exercise {{consisted of a}} 2 d/wk, 12 wk aerobic conditioning (32 〜 59 % VO 2 max) accompanied by a stretching program. Before and after conditioning phase subjects were measured Body weight, 8 parts of girth, 13 parts of skinfold thickness. The parts which had highly skinfold thickness before conditioning tend to more degrease than those which had less. % Fat was estimated by 2 methods which measured skinfold thickness and Total body water. Body weights were unchanged (52. 8 ± 5. 03, 52. 9 ± 4. 52 kg). 5 parts of girthes except arm and forearm were degreased, wherereas only <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> was increased because of muscle hypertrophy. 12 parts of skinfold thickness except a part of cheek were also degreased. % Fat was 10 % grater for the using T.

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the blood {{pressure}} profile among the Buddhist Lepchas, a tribal population, indigenous to the Sikkim Himalaya, in relation to selected biological, behavioral and sociocultural factors. The study subjects (aged 16 years and older) have been chosen from urban (Gangtok town, {{the capital of the}} State of Sikkim) and rural (Dzongu villages, about 75 km north of Gangtok) areas. The subjects inhabiting the urban area are engaged primarily in service sector, while those inhabiting the rural area are practicing agri-horticulture. The results reveal that significant age effect exists on logarithmically transformed blood pressures; sex effect is not significant. Among the anthropometric variables considered, <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> and height are found to be significantly correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. While disease status significantly affects systolic pressure, a significant effect of alcohol intake is discernible only on diastolic pressure. Furthermore, significant effects of rural/urban residence and educational level are found on blood pressures, both systolic and diastolic. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures of the urban Lepchas are found to be significantly higher compared to their rural counterparts. An increase in both mean systolic and diastolic pressures is noticed with increasing level of education, although the trend is not absolutely uniform...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. Background: Ankle inversion injuries {{are one of the most}} common and burdensome injuries in athletic populations. Research that prospectively identifies characteristics associated with this injury is lacking. This prospective study compared baseline anthropometric and biomechanical gait characteristics of military recruits who sustained an ankle inversion injury during training, with those who remained injury-free. Methods: Bilateral plantar pressure and three-dimensional lower limb kinematics were recorded in 1065 male, injury-free military recruits, during barefoot running. Injuries that occurred during the 32 -week recruit training programme were subsequently recorded. Data were compared between recruits who sustained an ankle inversion injury during training (n= 27) and a sample (n= 120) of those who completed training injury-free. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for this injury. Findings: A narrower bimalleolar width and an earlier peak pressure under the fifth metatarsal were predictors of ankle inversion injury. Those who sustained an ankle inversion injury also had a lower body mass, body mass index, and a smaller <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> than those who completed training injury-free. Interpretation: Anthropometric and dynamic gait characteristics have been identified that may predispose recruits to an ankle inversion injury during Royal Marine recruit training, allowing identification of recruits at higher risk at the start of training...|$|E

Thirty-five subjects were evaluated as follows: 13 professional ballet dancers of the Bolshoi Theater Company, six males and seven females, and 22 university physical education students, 11 males and 11 females. Body mass, height, skinfold (triceps, biceps, subscapular, chest, axilla, supraspinale, Iliac crest, abdominal, Front thigh, medial <b>calf)</b> <b>girth</b> (Arm flexed and tensed, forearm, waist, gluteal girth, Mid-thigh girth and calf) and breadth (wrist, ankle, Biepicondylar humerus and femur) were evaluated and somatotype, body fat percentage (BF%) body mass index (BMI), S 7 Skinfolds lean body mass, bone, residual and muscle mass were calculated. Dancers showed lower values for BMI, sum of seven skinfolds, BF%, body fat percentage, fat mass, residual mass (p< 0. 05). For females, lean body mass was also lower in the group of dancers. Body muscle values were lower for university physical education students of both sexes (p< 0. 05). When assessing differences between male and female dancers and male and female university physical education students, dancers appeared to be more homogeneous than students. As for somatotype, male dancers showed predominance of mesomorphy over the other components and female dancers showed predominance of ectomorphy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{correlate}} the playing ability in basketball from selected anthropometrical variables among college level male basketball players. To achieve the purpose two hundred and seventy nine Basketball players were randomly selected from various colleges in Tamilnadu state, India and their age ranged from 18 to 25 years. The subjects had past playing experience of at least three years in basketball and only those who represented their respective college teams were taken as subjects. As the performance is concerned, the anthropometrical variables play a vital role in overall performance. The researcher reviewed number of various journals, books, e-resources, unpublished theses, dissertations and coaching manuals in which they found that the standard skills of basketball may have relationship with selected anthropometrical, physical and physiological variables. Based on these observations, the investigator selected the following independent variables for this study. The Anthropometrical variables namely – Standing Height, Arm Length, Hand Length, Palm Length, Leg Length, Thigh Girth, <b>Calf</b> <b>Girth,</b> Arm Girth Relaxed Arm Girth Flexed. The playing ability is the dependant variable. It was taken as the performance factor, which was subjectively assessed by three qualified basketball coaches. The inter - relationship among the selected anthropometrical variables and basketball playing ability, were computed by using Pearson’ product-moment correlation coefficients. The results revealed that an Inter – relationship exists significantly between the anthropometrical, physical and physiological variables among male inter - collegiate basketball players...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{morphological}} characteristics and physical strength of the Malaysian cricket batsmen. Methods: Twenty four top order batsmen from the Malaysian senior, under- 19 s and under- 16 s cricket team were recruited for the study. Twenty six anthropometric, four somatotype and two physical strength variables were measured from all participants. Stature were measured by using stadiometer, calipers for skin-fold, non-stretch tape for girth, sliding caliper for segmental lengths and circumferences (breadths) and dynamometers for hand grip and back strength. Cater and heath (1990) equation was used to find the somatotype variables of height-weight ratio, endomorph, mesomorph and ectomorph. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyses significant between group differences in the variables. Results: The senior batsmen were significantly higher than under- 19 s and under- 16 s in body mass, relax and flex arm girths, forearm girth, chest girth, waist girth, <b>calf</b> <b>girth,</b> bi-acromial breadth, transvers breadth and hand grip strength. Both senior and under- 19 s batsmen were significantly higher than under- 16 s batsmen in arm span, total arm length, humerus and femur breadths. The under- 16 s batsmen were also significantly lesser than senior in hip girths, hand lengths and bi-ilocrist breadth, and from under- 19 s in sitting height and total leg length. Conclusion: Senior batsmen were significantly higher in the anthropometric measurement of girths, breadth and lengths than U- 16 because of 10 years age difference. Future research is essential to confirm the relationship between the anthropometric characteristics of batsmen with the batting technique and performance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Boxing {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} combat sports where {{different}} anthropological and fitness ability parameters determine performance. It is characterized by short duration, high intensity bursts of activity. The purpose of this research was to determine anthropometric and physical fitness profile of male elite and non-elite boxers of Manipur and to compare the two groups. Materials and Methods: Nineteen subjects were selected as elite boxers and twenty-four were non-elite boxers of Manipur. A cross-sectional study was conducted on anthropometric measurements and physical fitness ability tests on 33 subjects (elite and non-elite boxers). Statistical analysis was done using descriptive statistics, t-test and logistic regression with the help of SPSS version 15 software. Results: Results showed elite boxers have significantly reduced neck girth and <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> as compare to non-elite boxers. Elite boxers have significantly lower sub scapular skin fold (SSF) and supra iliac skin fold (SISF) than their counterparts. Higher stature, larger BTB and lower percent fat are associated with higher performance in boxing. Sit ups (SU), standing Broad Jump (SBJ), Plat taping (PT), Sit and reach (SAR) and Harvard Step Test (HST) are predicted as most contributing factors enhancing performance level among the physical fitness components. Elite boxers are found to have more functional strength (sit ups), higher explosive strength (SBJ), more agility (PT), cardio-vascular endurance and flexibility (SAR) than non-elite boxers. Conclusion: In conclusion, lower fat, higher lean body mass, larger bi-trochantric breadth, high explosive strength, agility and flexibility are significantly associated with higher performance and chance of becoming elite boxers...|$|E
40|$|As {{functional}} {{resistance training}} becomes a more popular method to improve muscular fitness, questions remain regarding {{the effectiveness of}} functional training compared to traditional resistance training. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine whether functional training has similar effects as traditional resistance training on muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, agility, balance, and anthropometric measures in young adults. In this study, 38 healthy volunteers, aged 18 - 32 years, were randomly placed into a control group [traditional (n = 19) ] and an experimental group [functional (n = 19) ]. The participants were tested prior to and after completing the 7 -week training study. The testing battery included: weight, girth measurements, flexibility, agility, lower back flexion and extension endurance, push-up test, sit-up test, one-leg balance, one-repetition maximum (1 -RM) bench press and squat. Results indicated significant (p < 0. 05) increases in push-ups, back extension endurance, 1 -RM bench press, 1 -RM squat, and one-leg balance within each group following training. Traditional training also elicited significant (p < 0. 05) increases in bicep girth, forearm girth, <b>calf</b> <b>girth,</b> and sit-ups, while the functional training group experienced significant (p < 0. 05) increases in shoulder girth and flexibility. Forearm girth and flexion test time changes following training were the only parameter where there were significant (p < 0. 05) differences between training groups. Collectively, these results suggest that both programs are equally beneficial for increasing endurance, balance, and traditional measures of strength. However, changes in various girth measures, torso flexor endurance and flexibility appear to be program-specific...|$|E
40|$|Return to {{activity}} (RTA) following Achilles tendon surgery {{assessment criteria}} {{has not been}} generally adopted. A well-defined postsurgical rehabilitation regimen with 3 distinct criteria, yet easy to measure, {{can be used to}} assess the ability of patients undergoing Achilles tendon surgery to return to activity. We studied whether if patients were able to meet all 3 criteria, would this show significance in predicting the ability to RTA within a normal range. A total of 219 patients undergoing surgery on the Achilles tendon from 1990 to 2005 were retrospectively studied to evaluate for the ability to perform 5 sets of 25 single-legged concentric heel raises, along with symmetry of <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> and ankle range of motion. Time of RTA and the ability to meet all 3 parameters was studied. If patients could meet all 3 criteria, they were allowed to RTA. This time postsurgery was recorded in weeks. Of the 219 surgeries reviewed, 149 were on males and 70 on females. Fourteen patients were unable to meet all 3 parameters evaluated above within the proposed time frames. The inability to meet all 3 criteria resulted in a delay to RTA (P =. 03). Eleven females had a delay in RTA as compared with 2 males (P <. 0001). RTA was different based on procedure. Meeting all 3 criteria was helpful in assessing if patients were able to RTA in the normal range. Patients who were unable to meet all 3 had a delay in RTA.

40|$|Exercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMC) in {{the calf}} {{are common in}} rugby league. To date, the {{etiology}} and predictors of calf cramping are poorly understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to undertake a prospective investigation to identify predictors of calf cramping in rugby league players. Demographic and anthropometric data and calf cramp and injury history were collected in the preseason. Hydration status, number of games played, and calf cramps were recorded on game days. Male rugby league players (n = 103, mean age 18. 8 ± 4. 1 years) were classified as either EAMC (experienced at least 1 incident of calf cramps in the season) or no EAMC (no calf cramps). The following were investigated as possible predictors of EAMC using logistic regression modeling: competition level, age, ethnicity, playing position, history of cramping, precramping, low back pain, foot orthotic usage, foot posture, foot strike, muscle flexibility, <b>calf</b> <b>girth,</b> hydration status, and number of games played. Half the players, n = 52, experienced at least 1 incidence of calf cramping. Playing in a senior competition level (odds ratio: 0. 21; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 06 - 0. 75; p = 0. 016), a history of calf cramping (10. 85; 2. 16 - 54. 44; p = 0. 004), and a history of low back pain resulting in missed field minutes (4. 50, 1. 37 - 14. 79; p = 0. 013) were found to predict EAMC. This study suggests that there is a high incidence of calf cramping in rugby league, especially at senior competition levels, and supports preseason screening in senior players to idetify those at risk of calf cramping and the development of possible preventative strategies...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Circulating acylated ghrelin {{concentrations}} {{are associated}} with altitude-induced anorexia in laboratory environments, but have never been measured at terrestrial altitude. This study examined time course changes in appetite, energy intake, body composition, and ghrelin constituents during a high-altitude trek. Methods Twelve participants [age: 28 (4) years, BMI 23. 0 (2. 1) kg m− 2] completed a 14 -day trek in the Himalayas. Energy intake, appetite perceptions, body composition, and circulating acylated, des-acylated, and total ghrelin concentrations were assessed at baseline (113 m, 12 days prior to departure) and at three fixed research camps during the trek (3619 m, day 7; 4600 m, day 10; 5140 m, day 12). Results Relative to baseline, energy intake was lower at 3619 m (P = 0. 038) and 5140 m (P = 0. 016) and tended to be lower at 4600 m (P = 0. 056). Appetite perceptions were lower at 5140 m (P = 0. 027) compared with baseline. Acylated ghrelin concentrations were lower at 3619 m (P = 0. 046) and 4600 m (P = 0. 038), and tended to be lower at 5140 m (P = 0. 070), compared with baseline. Des-acylated ghrelin concentrations did not significantly change during the trek (P = 0. 177). Total ghrelin concentrations decreased from baseline to 4600 m (P = 0. 045). Skinfold thickness was lower at all points during the trek compared with baseline (P ≤ 0. 001) and <b>calf</b> <b>girth</b> decreased incrementally during the trek (P = 0. 010). Conclusions Changes in plasma acylated and total ghrelin concentrations {{may contribute to the}} suppression of appetite and energy intake at altitude, but differences in the time course of these responses suggest that additional factors are also involved. Interventions are required to maintain appetite and energy balance during trekking at terrestrial altitudes...|$|E
