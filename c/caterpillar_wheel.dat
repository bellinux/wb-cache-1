40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} five years, {{researchers}} have improvised the existing in-pipe inspection robots by developing hybrid locomotion by combining two or more propulsion mechanism in achieving robust but yet flexible robot platform. In this paper, several hybrid robots have been reviewed and categorized according to their implemented locomotion system. The hybrid locomotion systems are caterpillar wall-pressed type, wheeled wall-pressed type and wheeled wall-pressing screw type. Each hybrid locomotion system is developed according to distinct design requirements for specific environment and might be not suitable for other application. The aim of this review is to highlight the current innovation of in-pipe robot for inspection. Based on the study, wall pressed type {{is the most popular}} main locomotion system in in-pipe robot development. Most of the prototypes are able to travel into branches with the same diameter as the pipe. Integration of <b>caterpillar</b> <b>wheel</b> gives more advantage in preventing motion singularity problem while surpassing branches. On the other hand, wheeled wall-pressed type provides advantage in high speed mobility. Wheeled wall pressing screw type gives the best navigation in curved pipe. None of these inventions show their ability in navigating bigger pipe to smaller branches...|$|E
60|$|It may {{be argued}} that horses can go over country that is {{impossible}} for automobiles. That is to ignore altogether {{what has been done}} in this war by such devices as <b>caterpillar</b> <b>wheels.</b> So far from cavalry being able to negotiate country where machines would stick and fail, mechanism can now ride over places where any horse would flounder.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 {{they built}} their first machine, a <b>caterpillar</b> tractor. <b>Wheeled</b> {{tractors}} began in 1953. Engines were supplied by Guldner and Slanzi. From 1956 Perkins P4 diesel engines were used.|$|R
50|$|Commandeered tracked <b>Caterpillar</b> or <b>wheeled</b> {{civilian}} Bulldozers of American and Spanish origin {{were also}} {{employed by the}} Guardia during the battles for Masaya and Managua to clear paths on rebel-held urban neighbourhoods by demolishing buildings turned into bunkers by the guerrillas.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 {{the vehicle}} was {{upgraded}} one more time, given {{a more powerful}} engine (the type of which is unknown) and new German made M113 <b>caterpillar</b> road <b>wheels.</b> The most significant upgrade to this new version is {{the addition of a}} French design fully enclosed turret mounting a 7.62 mm machine gun.|$|R
50|$|The Israeli Combat Engineering Corps uses armored <b>Caterpillar</b> 966 <b>wheel</b> loaders for {{construction}} and combat engineering missions in militarily occupied territories {{such as the}} West Bank. They are often seen building or removing road blocks and building bases and fortifications. Since 2005, they have also been used to demolish small houses. The Israel Defense Forces added armor plating to the loader to protect it against rocks, stones, molotov cocktails, and light gunfire.|$|R
5000|$|Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Porokhovschikov(Rus: Александр Александрович Пороховщиков) (1892-1941/43) was Russian {{military}} engineer, {{tank and}} aircraft inventor, known mostly {{for the development}} of Vezdekhod, the first tank (resembling modern tankette) in 1914-1915. Vezdekhod means: [...] "He who goes anywhere" [...] or [...] "all-terrain vehicle". Vezdekhod was also the first caterpillar amphibious all-terrain vehicle. Subsequently Porokhovschikov added wheels to his tank for steering, making it also the first tank design to combine <b>caterpillar</b> and <b>wheel</b> ways of movement. However the steering was ineffectual and his design rejected.|$|R
50|$|Inventors-self-taught Fyodor Abramovich Blinov and Yakov Mamin glorified Balakovo as {{the birthplace}} of the world's first <b>caterpillar</b> tractor, <b>wheel</b> {{self-propelled}} gun and Russian diesel engine. The plant of oil engines and tractors Yakov Mamin in 1915 produced 325 diesel engines, with a total capacity of 5100 horsepower. The image of the old Balakovo was created by such architects as H. F. Meyer and academician Fyodor Schechtel. Carefully preserving and restoring the historical landscape of the central part, the Balak people constantly improve the appearance of a new, young city with spacious avenues, straight as arrows, avenues, slender buildings with elegant facades.|$|R
50|$|A {{steam crane}} is a crane {{powered by a}} steam engine. It may be fixed or mobile and, if mobile, it may run on rail tracks, <b>caterpillar</b> tracks, road <b>wheels,</b> or be mounted on a barge. It usually has a {{vertical}} boiler placed at the back so that {{the weight of the}} boiler counterbalances the weight of the jib and load.|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} {{developed for}} operator-in-the-loop simulation in space teleoperation {{has been applied}} to <b>Caterpillar's</b> backhoe, <b>wheel</b> loader, and off-highway truck. On an SGI workstation, the simulation integrates computer modeling of kinematics and dynamics, real-time computational and visualization, and an interface with the operator through the operator's console. The console is interfaced with the workstation through an IBM-PC in which the operator's commands were digitized and sent through an RS- 232 serial port. The simulation gave visual feedback adequate for the operator in the loop, with the camera's field of vision projected on a large screen in multiple view windows. The view control can emulate either stationary or moving cameras. This simulator created an innovative engineering design environment by integrating computer software and hardware with the human operator's interactions. The backhoe simulation has been adopted by Caterpillar in building a virtual reality tool for backhoe design...|$|R
40|$|An Automated Digging Control System (ADCS) for a {{wheel loader}} is {{developed}} that utilizes a behavior-based control structure combined with fuzzy logic. This controller exhibits the real-time reactive responses necessary for executing digging tasks in an uncertain, unstructured and dynamic excavation environment. This paper presents field test {{results of a}} prototype ADCS that was developed and implemented on a <b>Caterpillar</b> 980 G <b>wheel</b> loader. Test {{results show that the}} performance of the automated system is comparable to that of an expert human operator {{in a wide range of}} excavation situations...|$|R
50|$|The crew {{consisted}} of three men: the commander (who also served as the gunner); the loader and the driver. In 1937, the company launched production of the BT-7 with a conical turret. The main armament remained the same, but the ammunition was increased to 44 rounds. All serving tanks now installed the DT machine gun in the rear niche. For the firing of the gun and coaxial machine gun at night, the tank was equipped with two special projector-type headlamps, and a mask placed on the gun. Subsequently, these lights were retrofitted to earlier models of the tank. Improvements were also made to the drive <b>wheels,</b> <b>caterpillar</b> tracks and gearbox by 1938.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to present}} a novel modular robot that {{provides}} a flexible framework for exploring adaptive locomotion. Design/methodology/approach – A new modular robot is presented called YaMoR (for “Yet another Modular Robot”). Each YaMoR module contains an FPGA and a microcontroller supporting {{a wide range of}} control strategies and high computational power. The Bluetooth interface included in each YaMoR module allows wireless communication between the modules and controlling the robot from a PC. A control software called Bluemove was developed and implemented that allows easy testing of the capabilities for locomotion of a large variety of robot configurations. Findings – With the help of the control software called Bluemove, different configurations of the YaMoR modules were tested like a <b>wheel,</b> <b>caterpillar</b> or configurations with limbs and their capabilities for locomotion. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates that modular robots can act as a powerful framework for exploring locomotion of a large variety of different types of robots. Although present research is limited to exploring locomotion, YaMoR modules are designed to be general purpose and support a variety of applications...|$|R
5000|$|The buyout by Mattel {{was greeted}} with {{considerable}} trepidation by the Matchbox collectors' community. The rivalry between the Hot Wheels and Matchbox brands {{was not only a}} battle fought by the companies; collectors of each of the brands felt strongly about the qualities of their brand of choice. For the typical Matchbox collector, Hot Wheels were inferior in scaling and model choice, making them less desirable. There were fears that Mattel would either impose a Hot Wheels-style philosophy on the Matchbox line, or actually fold the Matchbox line into the Hot Wheels series. Early concerns of this nature by collectors were countered by assurances from Mattel that Matchbox would continue to develop its own product line independently from Hot Wheels, and that it was intended that Matchbox represent [...] "real" [...] and traditional vehicles, while fantasy would be placed firmly in Hot Wheels territory. To demonstrate the latter commitment, some very realistic Hot <b>Wheels</b> <b>Caterpillar</b> models were actually re-branded to Matchbox, although that did not assuage concerns about the strength of the former assurance.|$|R
5000|$|Over time, the Brothers {{will reveal}} {{themselves}} {{later in the}} game. These Brothers are: Mantid, the [...] "Elder" [...] of the Brothers, who walks on stilts, and has a spear impaled in his abdomen. Whaler, who wields two blades, and his head is sewn onto his back. Pit, who is fused with a mining drill. Ironclad, who has multiple cannons that fire at the player. Tyrant, who has several limbs and heads along with three visible hearts, rolls along on a stone <b>wheel.</b> <b>Caterpillar,</b> who is connected to a rolling sphere(s) through tubes in his abdominal area. Warden, which forms a cage made of his ribs, and hangs from the ceiling like a swinging birdcage. Montgolfier, which, in the Russian version, had hair, but in the English version, doesn't. He is fused with a hot air balloon. Triumphator, who is fused with a large, gear-powered phonograph, and acts as a one-man band. And lastly, Patriarch, {{the oldest of the}} Brothers, who is similar to a senior in a wheelchair, and appears to have no head.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} {{we present a}} {{distributed}} probabilistic algorithm for coloring the vertices of a graph. Since this algorithm resembles a largest-first strategy, {{we call it the}} distributed LF (DLF) algorithm. The coloring obtained by DLF is optimal or near optimal for numerous classes of graphs e. g. complete k-partite, <b>caterpillars,</b> crowns, bipartite <b>wheels.</b> We also show that DLF runs in O(Δ 2 log n) rounds for an arbitrary graph, where n is the number of vertices and Δ denotes the largest vertex degree. 1 Introduction We discuss the vertex coloring problem in a distributed network. Such a network consists of processors and bidirectional communication links between pairs of them. It can be modeled by a graph G = (V; E). The set of vertices V corresponds to processors and the set E of edges models links in the network. To color the vertices of G means to give each vertex a color {{in such a way that}} no two adjacent vertices get the same color. If at most k colors are used, the result is called a k-coloring. We assume that there is no shared memory. Each processor knows its own links and its unique identifier. We want these units to compute a coloring of the associated graph without any other information about the structure of G. We assume that the system is synchronized in rounds. The number of rounds will be our measure of the time complexity. Such a model of coloring can be used in a distributed multihop wireless network to eliminate packet collisions by assigning orthogonal codes to radio stations [1]...|$|R
