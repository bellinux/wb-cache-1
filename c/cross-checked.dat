5000|$|<b>Cross-check.</b> When a {{check is}} {{answered}} by a check, particularly when this second check is delivered by a piece blocking the first, {{it is called}} a <b>cross-check.</b> In fact, a [...] "cross-checkmate" [...] is also possible in that way (that is, to answer a check with a checkmate) but since no such term exists, it would be called <b>cross-check</b> as well. <b>Cross-checks</b> are rather rare but are a popular theme in chess problems.|$|R
40|$|A {{characteristic}} of the news market is that consumers often <b>cross-check</b> information, i. e. observe several news outlets. At the same time, data on political media suggest that more partisan consumers {{are more likely to}} <b>cross-check.</b> We explore these phenomena by building a model of horizontal competition in newspaper endorsements. Without <b>cross-checking,</b> outlets are unbiased and minimally differentiated. When <b>cross-checking</b> is allowed, we show that cross-checkers are indeed more partisan than those who only acquire one report. Furthermore, <b>cross-checking</b> induces outlets to differentiate, and the degree of differentiation is increasing in the dispersion of consumer beliefs. Differentiation is detrimental to consumer welfare, and a single monopoly outlet may provide higher consumer welfare than a competitive duopoly. ...|$|R
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are <b>cross-checked</b> by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
5|$|Early {{into his}} fourth {{season with the}} Canucks, Kesler was <b>{{cross-check}}ed</b> in the face by Flyers forward Jesse Boulerice. The cross-check was an immediate response to Kesler hitting Flyers defenseman Randy Jones and resulted in Kesler leaving {{the game with a}} sore jaw. Boulerice was subsequently suspended for 25 games, matching the then largest suspension in NHL history. Later in the season, Kesler was involved in another violent on-ice incident when Anaheim Ducks defenseman Chris Pronger used his skate blade to stomp on Kesler's calf. Kesler was not injured on the play. Although the NHL originally announced that Pronger would not receive a suspension on the play, he later received an eight-game suspension when new video emerged of the incident. Over the course of the season, Kesler established himself as a solid two-way center, scoring what was then a career high 21 goals and 37 points and playing a regular shutdown role against opposing teams' top players and on the penalty kill with linemate Alexandre Burrows.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the Comma Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 <b>cross-checked</b> all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E

40|$|Any {{reasoning}} system is fallible, so crew members and flight controllers {{must be able}} to <b>cross-check</b> automated diagnoses of spacecraft or habitat problems by considering alternate diagnoses and analyzing related evidence. <b>Cross-checking</b> improves diagnostic accuracy because people can apply information processing heuristics, pattern recognition techniques, and reasoning methods that the automated diagnostic system may not possess. Over time, <b>cross-checking</b> also enables crew members to become comfortable with how the diagnostic {{reasoning system}} performs, so the system can earn the crew s trust. We developed intelligent data visualization software that helps users <b>cross-check</b> automated diagnoses of system faults more effectively. The user interface displays scrollable arrays of timelines and time-series graphs, which are tightly integrated with an interactive, color-coded system schematic to show important spatial-temporal data patterns. Signal processing and rule-based diagnostic reasoning automatically identify alternate hypotheses and data patterns that support or rebut the original and alternate diagnoses. A color-coded matrix display summarizes the supporting or rebutting evidence for each diagnosis, and a drill-down capability enables crew members to quickly view graphs and timelines of the underlying data. This system demonstrates that modest amounts of diagnostic reasoning, combined with interactive, information-dense data visualizations, can accelerate system diagnosis and <b>cross-checking...</b>|$|R

25|$|Use {{of certain}} {{calendar}} rules {{to determine the}} length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase allows unprotected intercourse during {{the first few days of}} the menstrual cycle while maintaining a very low risk of pregnancy. With mucus-only methods, there is a possibility of incorrectly identifying mid-cycle or anovulatory bleeding as menstruation. Keeping a BBT chart enables accurate identification of menstruation, when pre-ovulatory calendar rules may be reliably applied. In temperature-only systems, a calendar rule may be relied on alone to determine pre-ovulatory infertility. In symptothermal systems, the calendar rule is <b>cross-checked</b> by mucus records: observation of fertile cervical mucus overrides any calendar-determined infertility.|$|E

25|$|The {{research}} group, {{headed by}} Robert D.

Another major task of the group is to investigate and re-evaluate the status of the information structure primitives (topic, focus, contrast, etc.) as cross-linguistically valid categories. To achieve this, the members of the group combine extensive corpus analysis of the data in their respective languages with production experiments; all findings are further <b>cross-checked</b> through standard information structure tests (question-answer pairs, aboutness tests, association with focus sensitive items).|$|E

The Ducks trailed 3–2 going into Phoenix for game six. Kariya scored in overtime to force the franchise's first game 7 which they won. In the second round, however, they lost to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Red Wings in a four-game sweep. After the season, Wilson was fired after saying he would like to coach the Capitals. Pierre Page succeeded him. The Ducks started out slowly in 1997–98, in part because Kariya missed the first 32 games of the season in a contract dispute. He came back in December, but on February 1, he suffered a season-ending concussion when the Chicago Blackhawks' Gary Suter <b>cross-checked</b> him in the face. With Kariya playing only a total of 22 games that season, the Ducks missed the playoffs and fired Page.
