5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E

It is separated into three different sections: Member Agreement, Community Guidelines and Privacy Policy. All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service. During the period when volunteer <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> hosts and board monitors were used, <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations.|$|E
25|$|Valle faced {{a maximum}} of {{life in prison for}} the {{conspiracy}} charge, and {{a maximum of}} five years for accessing the federal National Crime Information Center database without authorization. Valle's wife testified against him during the trial. Throughout the trial, Valle claimed that the <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> communications were mere fantasy, and that {{he had no intention of}} acting on them. He was found guilty of all charges in March 2013.|$|E

25|$|Web {{sites on}} the {{mainland}} are usually more sensitive to political issues than to pornography, and for several weeks major sites such as Baidu permitted the images to be disseminated. During this time, photographs were also posted on the popular mainland China <b>chat</b> <b>room,</b> Tianya Club, and had been viewed nearly 20million times a day. Around 20 February however, mainland sites took action to prevent access to the photos.|$|E
25|$|On 9 August, CCTV {{footage of}} the girls from {{a few minutes before}} their {{disappearance}} was released, showing them arriving at the local sports centre. On the same day, police investigated the possibility that the girls had arranged to meet up with someone from an internet <b>chat</b> <b>room,</b> but this was later ruled out. On 10 August, a reconstruction of the girls' movements was produced using two child actresses to encourage witnesses to come forward.|$|E
25|$|In December 2002, Electronic Arts shipped the Maxis-developed The Sims Online, {{which was}} later named EA Land. This online game recreates The Sims as an MMOG, where actual human players can {{interact}} with each other. This spin-off did not achieve {{the same level of}} success as the original. Reviews for The Sims Online were extremely lacklustre. Many reviewers likened The Sims Online experience to an enormous <b>chat</b> <b>room.</b> On August 1, 2008, EA-Land's shops were closed permanently.|$|E
5000|$|WBS {{featured}} browser-based chat, real-time discussion, with moderated <b>chat</b> <b>rooms</b> {{in addition}} to user-created private <b>chat</b> <b>rooms.</b> Common to webchat, its <b>chat</b> <b>rooms</b> required no software download to use. [...] It allowed users to upload their own images into chat sessions and had three chat modes: streaming, frames, and no frames. [...] In addition to images users could add audio, video, and hotlinks to conversations. WBS also featured other services, such as email, and allowed users to create and maintain personal web pages. Membership was free.|$|R

25|$|On October 25, 2012, Valle {{was arrested}} and charged with {{conspiracy}} to commit kidnapping. The arrest occurred after his wife reported to police that she had found in his Internet search engine history a series of <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> communications on Dark Fetish Net, a forum dedicated to sexual fetishes and fantasies involving torture, rape, murder and cannibalism. Valle had been chatting with another user about torturing and murdering her, as well as murdering and cannibalizing more than 100 other women.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{functionality}} {{was available}} to most mainframe users, which might be considered a sort of ultra-local BBS when used in this fashion. Commercial systems, expressly intended to offer these features to the public, became available in the late 1970s and formed the online service market that lasted into the 1990s. One particularly influential example was PLATO, which had thousands of users by the late 1970s, many of whom used the messaging and <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> features of the system {{in the same way}} that would become common on BBSes.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{evidence}} presented by Kevin Andrews in {{his press conference}} of 31 July was an opinion authored by the Commonwealth Solicitor-General. This opinion contains exactly five direct quotes from source material (translated from Hindi into English) and several paraphrases of source material. The material presented is not a direct transcription of the translated <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> conversation. The highly selective nature of the quotations and paraphrases has drawn considerable criticism from media commentators, politicians and the legal community. The Minister has also been criticised for failing to mention in his assessment any mention of source material that was supportive of Haneef's claims of innocence.|$|E

25|$|This {{screening}} {{process is not}} limited to the viewing of Web sites, however. It also blocks users from discussing these forbidden keywords on chat programs such as Internet Relay Chat. Once these keywords are mentioned or certain individuals identified as undesirable enter the <b>chat</b> <b>room,</b> the user will be kicked off the discussion. When Tory Christman worked as an operative for OSA, other OSA operatives removed the program from her computer to allow her to analyze what critical material was being spread on the internet about Scientology. Some time after the software was removed, Christman encountered the Operation Clambake Web site and had online discussions with its operator Andreas Heldal-Lund, which eventually led to her leaving Scientology through a public announcement on Alt.religion.scientology.|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{can also}} be {{exploited}} for activities such as terrorism, internet fraud and pedophilia. In recent years, {{there has been an}} increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and Internet Relay Chat (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous. These conspiracies carry concerns for security and protection. From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> child protection procedure based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task. In other areas, it is observed that the Semantic Web has been involved in tasks such as personal data protection, which helps to prevent fraud.|$|E
25|$|Investigations {{include the}} 1999 Operation Cathedral which {{resulted}} in multi-national arrests and 7 convictions as well as uncovering 750,000 images with 1,200 unique identifiable faces being distributed over the web; Operation Amethyst which occurred in the Republic of Ireland; Operation Auxin which occurred in Australia; Operation Avalanche; Operation Ore based in the United Kingdom; Operation Pin; Operation Predator; the 2004 Ukrainian child pornography raids; and the 2007 international child pornography investigation. A three-year Europol investigation, dubbed Operation Rescue, based on the activities of boylover.net, a popular pedophile <b>chat</b> <b>room,</b> netted over 150 arrests and the rescue of 230 children in 2011. The principal of boylover.net, Israeli-born Dutch citizen Amir Ish-Hurwitz, was jailed 17 March 2011 in the Netherlands. Hundreds of additional suspects remain at large.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chat</b> <b>rooms</b> {{and instant}} {{messaging}}: Forums differ from chats and instant messaging in that forum participants {{do not have}} to be online simultaneously to receive or send messages.

25|$|Social norms {{can also}} be {{observed}} everywhere people interact, not only in physical spaces but in virtual communities on the Internet. Lawrence Lessig describes how social norms can regulate behavior in cyberspace: through an individual's perceptions from the (physical or virtual) surrounding community. For example, if a disabled person boards a crowded bus, everyone expects that some able-bodied person will volunteer their seat. The same social norm, although executed in a different environment, {{can also be}} applied to the Internet. If a user enters a discussion in a <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> and continues to use all capital letters or to make personal attacks ("flames") when addressing other users, the culprit may realize he or she has been blocked by other participants. As in real life, users learning to adapt to the social norms of cyberspace communities provide a public good—here, not suffering disruptive online behavior—for all the participants.|$|E
25|$|Child molester John Santos (Ray Torres) {{is found}} dead {{in a house that}} is being sold, the third such victim. Since a serial killer is suspected, the FBI is called in to assist with the investigation. Meanwhile, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) prepares for his {{upcoming}} mission to the International Space Station, which he learned that he would be a participant some time earlier. Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), Larry's friend and colleague, returns Larry's lucky t-shirt, which Larry gave to Charlie to keep during Larry's mission. FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) calls in Charlie and Larry. The team learns that the three victims have been using a <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> to lure their victims and have all contacted the same chatter. FBI Special Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr) interview the first victim's wife, Mrs. Elaine Tillman (Robin Weigert), who denies any knowledge of her husband's online activities. Charlie suggests using a multi-attribute composition model to find the type of house that the killer would most likely use.|$|E
25|$|While Charlie, Larry, and Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's {{girlfriend and}} colleague, develop their model, Larry {{receives}} {{a phone call}} informing him that {{he is no longer}} a part of the mission. At Charlie's house, Charlie and Amita learn from Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Don and Charlie's father, that a MIT professor had asked NASA to look into Larry's recent behavior. As a result of Larry's homelessness, NASA decided to pull Larry from the mission. FBI Special Agent David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) and Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) take Brendan McCrary (George Newbern), a frequent visitor in the <b>chat</b> <b>room</b> that the molesters used, into custody. When the team questions McCrary, they learn, and further investigation confirms, that McCrary joined an online group which attempts to peacefully catch child molesters after his daughter was raped and murdered by one. While working on their model, Charlie tells Amita that he feels bad for being happy that Larry was not going to space, and Amita tells Charlie that he should not beat himself up over his emotions. Their analysis soon reveals that the killer's preferred houses are located in Megan's Law and Jessica's Law zones.|$|E
