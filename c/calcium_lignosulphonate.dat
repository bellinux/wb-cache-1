Controlling these properties is crucial for some downstream processes. The present study assesses the effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> on the particulate processes taking place during the reduction of nickel ammine sulphate solutions by hydrogen gas. Reactions were carried out in an autoclave operated at 28 bar and 180 °C under stirring conditions of 850 rpm.

40|$|Abstract: Since the {{inception}} of metal precipitation by hydrogen, it has been recognized that adding some organic compounds to the reduction solution accelerates the reaction, inhibits plating and helps control the resulting powder properties such as morphology, microstructure and particle size distribution, to name but a few. The powder properties are directly linked to the particulate processes taking place during reduction. Controlling these properties is crucial for downstream processes. For instance, in fuel cell technologies, the porosity of materials used to construct the electrodes is a critical parameter amongst others. However, {{in addition to their}} relatively high cost, additives’ function and mechanism of action are not well understood. Furthermore most of the additives are used on a trial and error basis. Since additives constitute one of the major operational costs, it becomes evident their use should be optimized. One of the most plausible options to achieve this is to develop an understanding of their mechanism of action. This dissertation assesses the effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> and ethylene maleic anhydride on the particulate processes taking place during the reduction of nickel ammine sulphate solutions by hydrogen gas. Reactions were carried out in an autoclave operated at 28 bar and 180 °C under stirring conditions of 850 rpm. Five densifications were performed for each additive at the dosage of 2, 5, 7 and 10 mg/L. Particulate processes were studied by analysing the particle size distribution and the corresponding normalized moments. These were further validated by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen physisorption analyses. The powder phase identification and purity were determined by means of X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence respectively. Both <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> and ethylene maleic anhydride acted as reduction catalysts under experimental conditions. <b>Calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> promoted growth and by extension agglomeration which was more pronounced at 10 mg/L. At lower concentrations of <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate,</b> the system was found to be dominated by breakage as validated by scanning electron micrographs. Although {{there was no significant difference}} in the nickel content of the powder obtained in the presence and absence of <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate,</b> the powder obtained at 10 mg/L additive dosage resulted in the highest sulphur content.

40|$|The {{growth and}} lignin decomposing {{properties}} of 106 cultures of wood destroying and soil fungi {{have been studied}} on a synthetic <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> medium. Certain species of Fusarium and Alternaria, decomposing a maximum of 12 and 18 % lignin, respectively, were the most effective in utilizing the lignosulphonate.

40|$|Ammonia (NH$ sb 3 $) {{volatilization}} from manure {{can represent}} a major {{process through which}} nitrogen (N) is lost from the soil-plant-animal system. Reductions in NH$ sb 3 $ volatilization have significance both in economic and ecological aspects. <b>Calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> (CaLS), an acidic, water-soluble organic waste product of the pulp and paper industry, is expected to reduce NH$ sb 3 $ volatilization from liquid hog (Sus scrofa dometicus) manure (LHM) and consequently increase fertilizer value of LHM. Reduction of NH$ sb 3 $ loss from LHM was studied using added CaLS at 0, 6 % 12 % and 18 % CaLS (based on fresh LHM weight) during 21 d incubation. Cumulative losses of NH$ sb 3 $-N ranged between 0 to 46 % of initial total N. Compared to untreated LHM, the 6 % CaLS treatment control N loss for 7 d and promoted N loss thereafter, while 12 % and 18 % CaLS treatments effectively reduced N losses throughout the 21 d incubation period. The N availability {{and the effect of}} CaLS-LHM mixtures on ryegrass (Lolium multiform Lamb.) growth were assessed on two soils mapped as St. Amable (sandy loam) and Ste. Rosalie (clay loam) from eastern Canada. <b>Calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> showed adverse effect on ryegrass plant growth, while as an amendment it did not reduce the effectiveness of LHM-N for ryegrass dry matter yield (DMY) and chemical composition at application rate up to 12 % of LHM for the sandy loam soil and 18 % of LHM for the clay loam soil. These findings suggested that CaLS may be used as an amendment for controlling N losses from animal manures...|$|E

In this study, {{the effect of}} 1. 5 % v/v <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> (Ca-Ls) amendment to two commercial potting mixes (peat + coconut fibres; PC; and municipal compost + peat + pumice; MCPP) on the viability of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum sclerotia was investigated. Sclerotia were buried in the Ca-Ls amended substrates for 30 days. Non-amended PC and MCPP, sterile sand and sterile PC with and without Ca-Ls were used as controls. The viability of sclerotia recovered from PC and MCPP amended with Ca-Ls was reduced by 50 and 42 % respectively compared to control treatments. Ca-Ls amendment decreased sclerotial viability by enhancing {{the activity of the}} indigenous mycoparasitic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum, Mucor spp. and Trichoderma spp. The biocontrol ability of Ca-Ls against sclerotia was due to the stimulation of microbial activity and is, therefore, strictly dependent on the microbial composition of the substrate. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEucalyptus lignin was {{isolated}} from kraft black liquor through acidification by using H 2 SO 4. To effectively utilize black liquor waste from pulp plant, lignin was converted into sulphonated hydroxymethylated phenolized sulphuric acid lignin compound (SHP-SAL), which is soluble in water. SHP-SAL was obtained through {{the sequence of}} (1) phenolation of sulphuric acid lignin (SAL) into phenolized sulphuric acid lignin (P-SAL), (2) hydroxymethylation of P-SAL into hydroxymethylated phenolized sulphuric acid lignin (HP-SAL), and (3) sulphonation of HP-SAL into SHP-SAL. The derived lignin of SHP-SAL characterized by infrared spectrometry showed a significant absorption at 630 cm- 1, which indicates the presence of S−O bond, and absorption at 1118 and 1059 cm- 1, which are characteristics of C−O bonds in lignosulphonates. Assessment of SHP-SAL as a dispersant in gypsum paste was done according to C 230 - 90 ASTM standard. The synthesized SHP-SAL has approximately 60 % higher dispersability than those of commercial sodium lignosulphonate (comm. SLS) and commercial <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> (comm. CLS).

The experimental work was carried out with representative samples from post-consumer waste packages collected at drop-off-points. Previous to froth flotation, PET selective wetting was achieved by alkaline treatment followed by surfactant adsorption. For this purpose, an aqueous solution of NaOH and an industrial detergent commonly used for waste plastic washing were tested as alkaline treatment, and <b>calcium</b> <b>lignosulphonate</b> and Hostaphat were tested as surfactants. An enriched product with 98. 9 % grade in PET and only 0. 6 % in PVC was recovered in the nonfloated product. The PET recovery in this product was 97 % while 96 % of PVC and 91 % of PS were recovered in the floated product. An analytical method was developed for the quantification of the waste plastic composition. The method {{was based on the}} selective dissolution of the plastics in the mixture.

40|$|In Bacchus March Boral Quarry {{the sand}} is excavated, washed, graded to sizes and then stockpiled {{on the site}} to dry. In the quarry plant {{the whole process of}} {{producing}} a 10 m to 12 m high sand stockpile takes about 7 days and then another 7 to 8 days before the sand dries and reaches the saleable 5 - 6 % moisture content (volumetric). The drying period has been the concern of the quarry. A method to enhance the drying process would improve the quarry productivity. The aim of this research is to evaluate the viable options for an enhanced drainage of the sand piles in the quarry. Three methods have been proposed for this research is: i) the use of Surfactants, ii) the use of Drainage System (Spiral Drain) and iii) the use of surfactant and Spiral drain. Several sample piles of fine and medium sands of 60 cm heights were constructed in the RMIT Hydraulics Lab for subsequent testing. Two moisture probes and two tensiometers were placed at two different levels inside the sand pile to monitor the changes of moisture and suction pressure, respectively. A weighing scale was also place {{at the bottom of the}} pile setup to monitor the changes of weight due to drainage and evaporation. All these sensors recorded the data at five minutes intervals for several days. Two surfactants, namely Naphthalene Sulphonate Formaldehyde Condensate (NSFC) and <b>Calcium</b> <b>Lignosulphonate</b> (CL) were used to the sample piles in different doses and the moisture changes were monitored. These two surfactants are in common use in the concrete industry. In the second method a porous spiral drain was procured to place under the sample sand stockpiles at RMIT Lab. The suction system consisted of a small vacuum pump attached to a small container to separate water from incoming air-water mixture entered into the porous spiral pipe at the base of the sand stockpile. The surfactants it did not improve the drainage considerably as assumed initially. The saving of time was not significant in the process. The results from medium sand showed that the moisture have reduced to 14 % and 13 % for CL (525 ml) and NSFC (100 g) application respectively, in 12 days from the initial 32 % at the base of the pile. It is to note that the free draining (i. e., without the use of spiral drain and surfactants) process for the same medium sand took 14 days to reduce the moisture to 16 % level. In contrast, the results from the spiral drainage system showed a substantial improvement on the moisture reduction. The drying time has reduced to 3 to 4 days to bring the moisture to 8 % level for both fine and medium sands. The spiral drain found to be the optimum methods for drying the sand pile. A test was also run with the use of spiral drainage and surfactant combined. The result was close to the spiral drainage system. Adding surfactant did not show significant improvement over the suction system...|$|E
