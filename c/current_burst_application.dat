40|$|Anodically {{dissolving}} semiconductor electrodes show {{a wealth}} of pattern formation phenomena in time and space. This paper reviews these phenomena and attempts a general explanation {{in terms of the}} so-called <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> model. The <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> model asserts that current flow through anodically dissolving semiconductor electrodes is localized in space and time. The only relevant parameters of the model are probability functions for current “on ” and “off”. It will be shown that interactions between <b>current</b> <b>bursts</b> in space and time account quantitatively, or at least qualitatively, for {{a wealth of}} the pattern formation phenomena observed on semiconductor electrodes that can be classified as oscillations in time and space (= pore formation) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} {{with the potential to}} account for all processes of the reactive Si – liquid inter-face including, e. g., current oscillations, and the formation of nano-, meso, and macropores with their specific dependence on crystal orientation. The model assumes that current flow is spatially and temporally inhomogeneous- current thus flows in current "lines " occurring in current "bursts". The mean cycle time between correlated <b>current</b> <b>bursts</b> is mostly given by the kinetics of oxide dis-solution and hydrogen passivation (which introduces a strong surface orientation dependence). Structure generation at the Si electrode (current oscillations in the time domain or pore formation in the space domain) under these assumptions is a self-organized process resulting from an interplay of synchronizing and desynchronizing mechanisms. Synchronizing mechanisms always couple the nucleation of a new <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> in a specific area to the history of that area, desynchronizing mechanisms may also depend on the interaction of <b>current</b> <b>burst.</b> Examples for synchronizing mechanisms are enhanced nucleation probabilities on (100) surfaces, response to local oxides from another <b>current</b> <b>burst,</b> or coupling of <b>current</b> <b>bursts</b> by space charge region effects. Desynchronisa-tion results, e. g., from quantum wire effects, or local reduction of reactants or potential by a current line. The model accounts qualitatively for most if not all observed phenomena, gives a number of quantitative relations, and makes numerous predictions...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{formation}} of macropores in n-Si (100) substrates for different etching times of 20, 40 and 60 min at a constant current density of 25 mA/cm 2 under front-side illumination in HF:ethanol (1 : 4) solution. After etching for 20 min, four-branch-shaped pores of various sizes were observed at discrete locations. Etching time of 40 min led to {{the formation of}} highly connected four-branch-shaped pores as the branches of adjacent pores appeared to connect to each other. As the etching time was increased further to 60 min, the density of interconnected branches increased remarkably. The macropore formation process occurred in three consecutive phases. The <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> model was used to discuss this process. Formation of four-branch-shaped pores at random locations were observed because <b>current</b> <b>bursts</b> are more likely to nucleate where other <b>current</b> <b>bursts</b> took place initially...|$|R
40|$|The salient {{features}} of the <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> model for the Si – electrolyte interface is presented in a short overview. In the <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> model, charge transfer at the Si – electrolyte interface is localized {{in space and time}} and intrinsically sto-chastic; all phenomena encountered in Si electrochemistry then are manifestations of the nucleation probabilities for <b>current</b> <b>bursts,</b> which depend on the system parameter in an unambiguous way. One of the unique {{features of}} the model is the existence of an internal time constant (equal to the average duration of a current pulse) which ultimately is the reason for the observed oscillations of the current in time and in space – the latter case describing pores. For pores, the intrinsic time constant is expressed as an intrinsic length scale which is determined by the interaction of <b>current</b> <b>bursts</b> within the same cycle, i. e. by the size of synchronized domains. The pore morphology {{is the result of the}} interaction of the intrinsic length scale with external length scales, e. g. the space charge region depth; smooth macropores are ob-tained when the relevant length scales are similar. The existence of an intrinsic time constant and length scale will be demonstrated by resonance phenomena which were observed for the first time in pore growth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDGs) are dwarfs {{undergoing}} <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> of {{star formation}} (SF). In our work, we determine {{the ages of the}} underlying old stellar population to be ∼ 4 Gyr that is dominating the mass of the galaxy, underlying the <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> of SF. An intermediate population of ∼ 500 Myr which dominates the stellar light from the galaxy is also detected. The burst of SF at the present epoch spans ∼ 10 Myr as estimated from various age estimators like Hα, diagnostic diagrams and colour-colour diagrams. BCDGs undergo a burst of SF for a longer dura-tion (of about a few 100 Myr to a Gyr) followed by a short/long quiescence. The amount of column density of localized neutral hydrogen required for the <b>current</b> <b>burst</b> to occur seems to be 1021 cm− 2. This could be the thresh-old required for SF. Radio continuum emission reveals that the emission is coincident with the star forming regions. The star formation rates (SFR) estimated from Hα match well with the SFR estimated using non-thermal radio emission for individual star forming regions, but are ∼ 6 − 7 times less as compared to the SFR calculated from far-IR (FIR) emission...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} is used {{in order}} to restore nerve mediated functions in patients with neurological disorders, but its applicability is constrained by the invasiveness of the systems required to perform it. As an alternative to implantable systems consisting of central stimulation units wired to the stimulation electrodes, networks of wireless microstimulators have been devised for fine movement restoration. Miniaturization of these microstimulators is currently hampered by the available methods for powering them. Previously, we have proposed and demonstrated a heterodox electrical stimulation method based on electronic rectification of high frequency <b>current</b> <b>bursts.</b> These bursts can be delivered through textile electrodes on the skin. This approach {{has the potential to}} result in an unprecedented level of miniaturization as no bulky parts such as coils or batteries are included in the implant. We envision microstimulators designs based on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that will be flexible, thread-like (diameters < 0. 5 mm) and not only with controlled stimulation capabilities but also with sensing capabilities for artificial proprioception. We in vivo demonstrate that neuroprostheses composed of addressable microstimulators based on this electrical stimulation method are feasible and can perform controlled charge-balanced electrical stimulation of muscles. We developed miniature external circuit prototypes connected to two bipolar probes that were percutaneously implanted in agonist and antagonist muscles of the hindlimb of an anesthetized rabbit. The electronic implant architecture was able to decode commands that were amplitude modulated on the high frequency (1 MHz) auxiliary <b>current</b> <b>bursts.</b> The devices were capable of independently stimulating the target tissues, accomplishing controlled dorsiflexion and plantarflexion joint movements. In addition, we numerically show that the high frequency <b>current</b> <b>bursts</b> comply with safety standards both in terms of tissue heating and unwanted electro-stimulation.

40|$|We have {{theoretically}} analyzed coherent nuclear-spin dynamics {{induced by}} electron transport through a quantum-dot spin valve. The hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins in a quantum dot {{allows for the}} transfer of angular momentum from spin-polarized electrons injected from ferromagnetic or half-metal leads to the nuclear spin system under a finite voltage bias. Accounting for a local nuclear-spin dephasing process prevents the system from becoming stuck in collective dark states, allowing a large nuclear polarization to be built up in the long-time limit. After reaching a steady state, reversing the voltage bias induces a transient current response as the nuclear polarization is reversed. Long-range nuclear-spin coherence leads to a strong enhancement of spin-flip transition rates (by an amount proportional {{to the number of}} nuclear spins) and is revealed by an intense <b>current</b> <b>burst,</b> analogous to superradiant light emission. The crossover to a regime with incoherent spin flips occurs on a relatively long time scale, on the order of the single-nuclear-spin dephasing time, which can be much longer than the time scale for the superradiant <b>current</b> <b>burst.</b> This conclusion is confirmed through a general master equation. For the two limiting regimes (coherent/incoherent spin flips) the general master equation recovers our simpler treatment based on rate equations, but is also applicable at intermediate dephasing. Throughout this work we assume uniform hyperfine couplings, which yield the strongest coherent enhancement. We propose realistic strategies, based on isotopic modulation and wavefunction engineering in core-shell nanowires, to realize this analytically solvable "box-model" of hyperfine couplings.
