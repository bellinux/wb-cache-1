40|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} {{has become}} a prominent research tool with wide applications in medical diagnostics and bio-imaging. However, the realization of combined high-performance, portable, and low-cost spectroscopic sensors still remains a challenge, which has limited the technique to the laboratories. A fluorescence lifetime measurement seeks to obtain the characteristic lifetime from the fluorescence decay profile. Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and time-gated techniques are two key variations of time-resolved measurements. However, commercial time-resolved analysis systems typically contain complex optics and discrete electronic components, which lead to bulkiness and a high cost. These two limitations can be significantly mitigated using <b>contact</b> <b>sensing</b> and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) implementation. <b>Contact</b> <b>sensing</b> simplifies the optics, whereas CMOS technology enables on-chip, arrayed detection and signal processing, significantly reducing size and power consumption. This paper examines recent advances in <b>contact</b> <b>sensing</b> and CMOS time-resolved circuits for the realization of fully integrated fluorescence lifetime measurement microsystems. The high level of performance from recently reported prototypes suggests that the CMOS-based <b>contact</b> <b>sensing</b> microsystems are emerging as sound technologies for application-specific, low-cost, and portable time-resolved diagnostic devices...|$|E

40|$|The basic mathematic {{relationships}} of intrinsic (or force based) <b>contact</b> <b>sensing</b> are discussed. While conventional tactile sensing devices {{are designed to}} provide information about local phenomena caused by contact, intrinsic <b>contact</b> <b>sensing</b> detects a few global quantities relating to the interactions of two bodies in contact. The author addresses the geometric-mathematical problem of detecting these quantities starting from force/torque measurements and from the geometric description of one of the contacting surfaces. Two methods for solving the intrinsic <b>contact</b> <b>sensing</b> problem are discussed. The first method is able to give exact results for contacts of the hard-finger type, while it is shown to be only approximate for soft-finger contacts. A formula for estimating the extent of such approximation error is provided. A second, novel solution method is presented, which applies to soft fingers with ellipsoidal surface and is capable of yielding exact solutions to the problem.

Without tactile-perception capability, a robot cannot be expected to effectively grasp objects.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{present a}} novel and {{minimally}} invasive approach to intraocular pressure (IOP) monitoring {{based on a}} <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens. METHODS. The key element of this measurement method is a soft contact lens with an embedded microfabricated strain gauge allowing the measurement of changes in corneal curvature correlated to variations in IOP. A prototype of this <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens was adapted and tested on enucleated porcine eyes. To verify the measurement principle of the device, the posterior chamber of the pig eyes was cannulated and connected to a syringe pump and a pressure sensor for precise control of IOP. The measurements of the contact lens were then compared to the ones from the pressure sensor, while pressure variations were induced through the cannula. RESULTS. Enucleated porcine eyes were stimulated with increasing and decreasing ramps of IOP. Measurements from the <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens and from the pressure sensor showed very good correlation, proving the high potential of this new measurement principle. In this study, a typical signal from the <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens obtained during the experiments is presented and discussed. CONCLUSIONS. The <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens shows the potential for continuously monitoring IOP in enucleated porcine eyes.

The mechanical and dynamic heat transfer properties of porous polymeric materials, which describe the sensations during the contact process between porous polymeric materials {{and parts of the}} human body, such as the hand, primarily influence comfort sensations and aesthetic qualities of clothing. A multi-sensory measurement system and a new method were proposed to simultaneously sense the contact and characterize the mechanical and dynamic heat transfer properties of porous polymeric materials, such as textile fabrics in one instrument, with consideration of the interactions between different aspects of contact feels. The multi-sensory measurement system was developed for simulating the dynamic contact and psychological judgment processes during human hand contact with porous polymeric materials, and measuring the surface smoothness, compression resilience, bending and twisting, and dynamic heat transfer signals simultaneously. The <b>contact</b> <b>sensing</b> principle and the evaluation methods were presented. Twelve typical sample materials with different structural parameters were measured.

Special attention is paid to hedonic reversals, in which innately negative sensory hedonic responses become positive (for example, the case of chili pepper).
