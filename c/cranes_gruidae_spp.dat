40|$|With {{recently}} derived algorithms, it {{is possible}} to calculate the relative phylogenetic distinctiveness of taxa with respect to patterns of phylogenetic branching. We extended this approach by exploring the relative extent to which taxa represent phenotypic biodiversity. We devised a method, based on the use of independent contrasts, that measures the amount of phenotypic change that occurs when lineages diverge. We use this method to quantify {{the extent to which a}} taxon represents the phenotypic diversification that has occurred in the past. We applied our method to an analysis of variation in clutch size across 133 avian families. All families did not contribute equally to representing clutch size diversification. The top 10 avian families in terms of representing clutch size diversification were the mesites (Mesitornithidae), <b>cranes</b> (<b>Gruidae),</b> bustards (Otidae), new world quail (Odontophoridae), seriemas (Cariamidae), finfoots (Heliornithidae), swallows (Hirundinidae), megapodes (Megapodiae), and guans (Cracidae). The 217 species in these 10 families (2. 3 % of all bird species, 7. 5 % of families) represented 19. 3 % of diversification in clutch size. Seventeen percent of overall clutch size diversification was represented by taxa threatened with extinction. The 10 families that represent the greatest proportion of overall clutch size diversification threatened by extinction were the mesites (Mesitornithidae), kagu (Rhynochetidae), <b>cranes</b> (<b>Gruidae),</b> kiwis (Apterygidae), new world quail (Odontophoridae), megapodes (Megapodiae), cassowaries (Casuariidae), finfoots (Heliornithidae), guans (Cracidae), and logrunners (Orthonychidae). The 42 threatened species (0. 5 % of all bird species, 3. 8 % of all threatened bird species) in these 10 families encompassed 53 % of the clutch size diversification whose representation was threatened with extinction. Our results suggest that this type of analysis could potentially help prioritize species-based conservation efforts by identifying those taxa that contribute most toward representing the evolutionary processes that lead to current phenotypic biodiversity...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are only}} two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds {{traditionally}} classified as Gruiformes. Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and sungrebe (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and <b>cranes</b> (<b>Gruidae)</b> compose the suborder Grues and are termed [...] "core-Gruiformes" [...] (Fain et al. 2007). These are the only true Gruiformes. The suborder Eurypygae includes the kagu (Rhynochetidae) and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), button-quails (Turnicidae), Australian plains-wanderer (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and bustards (Otididae) each represent distinct and unrelated lineages. Many families known only from fossils have been assigned to the Gruiformes, e.g., Ergilornithidae, Phorusrhacidae, Messelornithidae, Eogruidae, Idiornithidae, Bathornithidae, {{to name just a}} few (see below). Though some of these are superficially 'crane-like' and the possibility that some may even be related to extant families traditionally included in the Gruiformes, there are no completely extinct families that can be confidently assigned to core-Gruiformes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cranes</b> (<b>Gruidae)</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the world, have lived on Earth for several million years, and currently reside on five continents. Archaeological evidence and historical references suggest that humans have interacted with and been captivated by cranes for many thousands of years (e. g., Leslie 1988, Muellner 1990). A glimpse of our reverence for these birds {{can be found in}} A Chorus of Cranes by Paul A. Johnsgard, with photographs by Thomas D. Mangelsen. Many species of cranes are currently identified as threatened or endangered, and their future will likely rest in the hands of humans; this book presents their plight and some of the measures that have been taken to conserve them. Dr. Johnsgard, an emeritus professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, is a prolific writer, having written more than 60 books in ornithology and other topics. This book serves as the latest update of previous efforts concerning crane biology, conservation, and management. A review without making comparisons to his past works is difficult, yet this assessment will primarily focus on the content of the current book, with little reference to past endeavors...|$|R

40|$|Here, we {{test whether}} these {{threatened}} species are simply {{a random sample}} of birds, or whether there is something about their biology that predisposes them to extinction. We ask three specific questions. First, is extinction risk randomly distributed among families? Second, which families, if any, contain more, or less, threatened species than would be expected by chance? Third, is variation between taxa in extinction risk associated with variation in either body size or fecundity? Extinction risk is not randomly distributed among families. The families which contain significantly more threatened species than expected are the parrots (Psittacidae), pheasants and allies (Phasianidae), albatrosses and allies (Procellariidae), rails (Rallidae), <b>cranes</b> (<b>Gruidae),</b> cracids (Cracidae), megapodes (Megapodidae) and pigeons (Columbidae). The only family which contains significantly fewer threatened species than expected is the woodpeckers (Picidae). Extinction risk is also not distributed randomly with respect to fecundity or body size. Once phylogeny has been controlled for, increases in extinction risk are independently associated with increases in body size and decreases in fecundity. We suggest that this is because low rates of fecundity, which evolved many tens of millions of years ago, predisposed certain lineages to extinction. Low-fecundity populations take longer to recover if they are reduced to small sizes and are, therefore, more likely to go extinct if an external force causes an increase in the rate of mortality, thereby perturbing the natural balance between fecundity and mortality. 1...|$|R

40|$|Summary in English. Bibliography: p. 221 - 242. The <b>cranes</b> (<b>Gruidae)</b> and {{bustards}} (Otididae) {{are highly}} threatened taxa. Many species {{are on the}} brink of extinction due to anthropogenic factors. On the positive side, several species show a remarkable ability to adapt to man-modified environments. If the cranes and bustards are to survive through the coming century, research on the aspects of their biology directly relevant to understanding their conservation requirements is a high priority. Without a reliable and relevant base of knowledge, no successful conservation management plan can be devised for each threatened species. This thesis presents information on three threatened members of these taxa in southern Africa, the Blue Crane Anthropoides paradiseus, and Ludwig's Neolis ludWigii and Stanley's N. denhami stanleyi Bustards. This information furthers our understanding of their conservation status. The thesis begins with a detailed review of the phylogeny, general biology and conservation status of cranes. This is necessitated by the absence of any thorough and recent review being available. The review provides a point of reference for the research results on the Blue Crane presented in the following seven chapters. Research on the Blue Crane largely focuses on the southwestern Cape and Karoo regions. The past and present distribution of the species in southern Africa is outlined and related to various vegetation types and the effect of various anthropogenic influences. Its colonization of the southwestern Cape is a particularly interesting finding. The abundance of the species in various parts of South Africa is discussed, largely based on road counts and bird atlas data. The total population size in South Africa is estimated and the previously unrecognised importance to the species of the southern Cape coastal plain between Botrivier and Mossel Bay is highlighted. The scarcity of Blue Cranes {{in the western part of}} the southwestern Cape, compared with the southern part, is quantified. The reasons for this anomolous dichotomy in abundance betweep these two superficially similar areas are unclear and worthy of further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Sarus cranes (Grus antigone) are {{the tallest}} {{members of the}} <b>crane</b> family, <b>Gruidae.</b> They are found in four {{geographically}} distinct regions: northwest India (Indian Sarus- Grus antigone antigone), southeast Asia (Burmese Sarus- Grus antigone sharpei) and northern Australia (Australian Sarus- Grus antigone gillae). Although the three subspecies are morphologically distinct, their genetic distinctness is unclear. In this study, I focused on control region sequences of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to assess the genetic and phylogeographic distinctness of Sarus subspecies. I used samples from four fragmented populations, seven from India, 16 from southeast Asia, five from Myanmar and eight from Australia. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using two Brolga crane sequences (G. rubicunda) as outgroups. All phylogenetic trees had low resolution, but AMOVA showed that all four Sarus populations are differentiated from each other. Nested clade phylogenetic analysis showed {{that most of the}} southeast Asian haplotypes are found at the center, suggesting that the Thai population includes the maximum number of ancestral haplotypes. Sarus cranes probably originated in southeast Asia and migrated both north towards India and south towards Australia during the last glacial maximum...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} 2 new species of coccidia (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) parasites isolated from the feces of corncrake (Crex crex) (Gruiformes: Rallidae), bred in captivity in the U. K. Oocysts of Eimeria crecis n. sp. were approximately spherical and measured 15. 3 μm (13 - 18) × 14. 3 (12 - 16), providing an oocyst shape index of 1. 1. A micropyle and oocyst residuum were absent, but a polar granule was present. Oocysts of Eimeria nenei n. sp. were ellipsoidal and measured 23. 6 (21 - 26) × 18. 1 (17 - 20), providing an oocyst shape index of 1. 3. A micropyle and polar granule were present. Surveying free-living, wild adult corncrakes in Scotland (U. K.) demonstrated both parasite species to be widespread. These are the first species described to infect the corncrake, and they are distinct from those previously found to infect members of the closely related <b>crane</b> family (Gruiformes: <b>Gruidae).</b> Partial amplification and sequencing of the 18 S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer 2 indicated a close relationship between the 2 proposed new species as a group distinct from the Eimeria species known to infect cranes. These newly identified parasite species {{have been associated with}} enteric disease in corncrakes being prepared for reproduction in captivity and reintroduction into England (U. K.) ...|$|R
