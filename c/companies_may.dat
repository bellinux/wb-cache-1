5|$|The American music {{industry}} includes {{a number of}} fields, ranging from record companies to radio stations and community orchestras. Total industry revenue is about $40 billion worldwide, and about $12 billion in the United States. Most of the world's major record companies are based in the United States; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The major record companies produce material by artists that have signed {{to one of their}} record labels, a brand name often associated with a particular genre or record producer. Record <b>companies</b> <b>may</b> also promote and market their artists, through advertising, public performances and concerts, and television appearances. Record <b>companies</b> <b>may</b> be affiliated with other music media companies, which produce a product related to popular recorded music. These include television channels like MTV, magazines like Rolling Stone and radio stations. In recent years the {{music industry}} has been embroiled in turmoil over the rise of the Internet downloading of copyrighted music; many musicians and the RIAA have sought to punish fans who illegally download copyrighted music.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping <b>companies</b> <b>may</b> be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of reasons why an {{acquiring}} <b>company</b> <b>may</b> wish to purchase another company. Some takeovers are opportunistic - the target <b>company</b> <b>may</b> simply be very reasonably priced {{for one reason or another}} and the acquiring <b>company</b> <b>may</b> decide that in the long run, it will end up making money by purchasing the target company. The large holding company Berkshire Hathaway has profited well over time by purchasing many companies opportunistically in this manner.|$|R
5|$|Private Ambulance Service – Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private <b>companies</b> <b>may</b> provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies do not provide this service. Companies such as Falck, Acadian Ambulance, and American Medical Response {{are some of the}} larger companies that provide such services. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E
