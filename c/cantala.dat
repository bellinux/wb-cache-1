40|$|<b>Cantala</b> (Agave <b>cantala),</b> plant of {{the family}} Asparagaceae and its fibers, belongs to the leaf fibers group. These fibers are made into coarse twines at about 1. 2 mm in diameter. The yarns of the <b>cantala</b> fiber are then {{interwoven}} to create textile reinforcements at two meshing size i. e. 5 x 20 mm and 10 x 20 mm. The textiles are used to reinforce polymer modified mortars to improve flexural properties of the mortars. This research aims to investigate the effect of textile reinforcement made from <b>cantala</b> fiber on the flexural behaviour of polymer modified mortar especially its strain hardening response. The parameters to be observed include strength, stiffness, thoughness, ductility and residual strength. The effect of the meshing size of the textile reinforcement on those properties are assesed. In addition, {{the efficacy of the}} <b>cantala</b> fiber textile reinforcement to improve the flexural properties of polymer modified mortar is compared with textile reinforcement made from wire mesh. The results indicate that an inclusion of short fibers could alter the post-peak behaviour of the mortar from brittle to ductile failure with softening response. Futher reinforcement of this mortar with <b>cantala</b> fiber textile would turn the softening response to a strain hardening response. The presence of <b>cantala</b> fiber textile reinforcement has minor effect on the flexural strength and stiffness. However, it significantly improve the thoughness, ductility and residual strength of the mortar. <b>Cantala</b> fiber textile reinforcement with a meshing size of 5 x 20 mm gives a greater increase on those post-peak properties compared to the the one with a meshing size of 10 x 20 mm.

The <b>cantala</b> fiber woven in 3 D angle interlock was utilized as the composite reinforcement. Surface grafting of the <b>cantala</b> fiber through chemical treatment was performed by introducing silane coupling agent to improving the compatibility with the polymer matrix. The fabrication of the composite specimens was conducted using vacuum bagging technique. The effect of additional coupling agent to the morphological appearance of surface fracture was observed using scanning electron microscopy. Meanwhile, the influence of additional silane to the mechanical properties was examined using tensile, bending and impact test. The photograph of surface fracture on the treated specimens showed the residual matrix left on the fibers in which the phenomenon was {{not found in the}} untreated specimens. Based on mechanical tests, the treated specimens were successfully increased their mechanical properties by 55 %, 9. 67 %, and 92. 4 % for tensile strength, flexural strength, and impact strength, respectively, at 1. 5 % silane coupling agent...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to reveal the morphology, physical properties and strength of the king pineapple leaf fibre (Agave <b>Cantala</b> Roxb) after fumigation treatment. The king pineapple leaf fibres (KPLF) before and after the fumigation treatment are then separated into groups. The fumigation treatment on KPLF is given in different durations, and the smoke comes from burning coconut shells. Before and after fumigation, the surface morphology, chemical content, and functional group character of KPLF were observed by SEM, XRD, and FTIR, respectively. While the physical characteristics were identified by measuring fibre density, moisture content and fibre strength were tested by a single fibre tensile strength test. The results show that chemical contents of KPLF were cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, accounting for as much as 55. 8...|$|E

The general message is that indi¤erences require attention and careful treatment, because the translation of results from a world without indi¤erences to another where agents may be indi¤erent among some alternatives is not always a straightforward exercise.

40|$|In the 1940 s, Swedish poetry saw the {{breakthrough}} of modernism. With the modernist style came {{a new kind}} of poetic aspiration towards the condition of music: semantic imitations of musical genres and attempts to create, {{with the help of the}} words' associations, an aesthetic effect similar to a musical effect. This type of intermediality, which I call semantic musicality, was inherited as a norm of poetic style by the next generation of poets, who made their debuts in the early 1950 s. These poets dealt with semantic musicality in different ways, but its impact on their poetry was paramount. Their ambivalent approaches show the difficulties of inheriting a modernist norm of poetry. In my chief example, Paul Andersson's poem Berattarna. Kantat i fyra partier for kor och soli [The Storytellers. <b>Cantala</b> in four parts for choir and soli], the impersonal, vague, and abstract style of semantic musicality was used in an attempt to write a highly personal poem, putting forth direct social and political arguments. Here, a paradox between rhetoric and content is evident which illustrates how the semantic aspiration towards the abstract, non-verbal condition of music had been developed into a norm which limited the range of poetry, and prevented it from the social and political spheres of society. From being radical and democratic, modernism and semantic musicality had made poetry an isolated and politically harmless cultural phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Abstract : In the Rhone plain in the Valais, Switzerland, {{a dynamic}} and {{productive}} {{area has been}} developed {{over the years in}} the context of the engineering works to control the river's course. This taming of nature has provided a basis for constructing an identity for the area's fruit and vegetable growers, an endeavour in une with a local vision of man seeking to control and leave his mark on the landscape. Consequently, these farmers are attached to their role as producers and to the technical skills that have been developed since the production of special crops began in the area one hundred years ago. Their relations with nature have oscillated between respect and desire to preserve a work tool that their ancestors strove to construct and a need to control the advance of a hostile and unruly natural environment. Today, the multiple activities that have recently developed in this restricted area are in conflict over how the land should be used. However, one of the main measures of the third Rhone correction project will be to widen the river's course. The proposed works are thus the opportunity for a general reflection on the future use of the area. The new fonctions attributed to agriculture do not correspond at all to the vision that most farmers have of their job. But finding compromises and working on the synergies between agriculture and other activities represents a major challenge, given that each activity depends so much on the others to ensure its long-term existence and at the same time the dynamism and health of the region. <b>Cantala</b> Estelle.

40|$|The study {{assessed}} the piscicidal activity of ten locally available plants to two freshwater fishes; Nile tilapia (O. niloticus L.) and mosquito fish (G. affinis Baird and Girard). It {{focused on the}} laboratory determination of lethal concentrations (LC 50 and LC 100) through a static bioassay test. The ten plants tested were ampalaya Momordica charantia, adelfa Nerium indicum, agave Agave <b>cantala,</b> kalamansi Citrus mitis, lagundi Vitex negundo, madre de cacao Gliricidia sepium, makabuhai Tinosphora rhumpii, neem Azadirachta indica, physic nut Jatropa curcas and sambong Blumea balsamifera. Based on the 24 -hour lethal concentration (LC 100), the plants with the strongest piscicidal activity to Nile tilapia and mosquito fish were makabuhai and kalamansi, respectively. The toxicity to Nile tilapia of the ten plants arranged {{in the order of}} decreasing toxicity is as follows: makabuhai (0. 82 ml l- 1) > adelfa (1. 06 ml l- 1) > ampalaya (2. 59 ml l- 1) > kalamansi (5 ml l- 1) > neem (12. 4 ml l- 1) > physic nut (26. 67 ml l- 1) > lagundi (31. 5 ml l- 1) > agave (74. 29 ml l- 1) > madre de cacao (90 ml l- 1) > sambong (125. 71 ml l- 1). For mosquito fish, the toxicity of the ten plants arranged in the order of decreasing toxicity is as follows: kalamansi (3 ml l- 1) > makabuhai (6 ml l- 1) > adelfa (7. 87 ml l- 1) > neem (8. 31 ml l- 1) > ampalaya (13. 5 ml l- 1) > lagundi (50 ml l- 1) > sambong (80 ml l- 1) > physic nut (81. 67 ml l- 1) > agave (102. 08 ml l- 1) >madre de cacao (117. 5 ml l- 1).
