25|$|K 174: Moorooduc, {{with the}} Mornington Railway. This engine had been plinthed at the Edinburgh Gardens in Fitzroy (near the former Fitzroy Railway Station) until 18 May 1997, {{when it was}} {{acquired}} by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc by road. The engine was in generally terrible condition, with most fittings missing and the remainder of parts damaged, except the engine frames which were in surprisingly good condition by comparison. The tender tank had fittings removed and was scrapped at Moorooduc, being beyond repair, and the tender frame and the brake gear for the locomotive demonstrated significant collision damage. The rest of the parts were placed in a pool {{to be used to}} reassemble a future engine; {{at the end of the}} project, the pool consisted of the boiler, smokebox, funnel and pony truck from 159 and 177; the loco frames, coupled wheels, axle boxes, motion gear and smoke deflectors from 159 and 174; the tender frame and bogies from 174 and 177, and the tender tank from 177 only. In 2000, the coupled wheels and motion gear from 174 was swapped with that from 176 at Seymour as the tyres from 174 required replacement, while 176's tyres were almost new; though both locomotives had poor condition axle boxes and <b>crankpins.</b> A few years later, the tender bogies from 174 were swapped with those from 191. When completed, the locomotive using K 174's frame is to be numbered K 177 and named City of Ararat, as part of the deal for parts acquisition.|$|E

2500|$|By 1912 he {{had built}} the Anzani 10, a 10-cylinder engine, {{air-cooled}} like its predecessors, which, like other Anzani engines, was made with different size cylinders. One of the more powerful versions produced about 110hp (82kW) from 12.1 litres, a British-built Anzani 10 was rated at 125hp and a smaller version with a displacement of 8.27 litres produced 80hp (60kW). [...] It was a double row engine, built with two rows of five cylinders separated along the crankshaft by about a cylinder radius, giving the engine a slimmer profile than other contemporary two-row radial engines. [...] Each half had its own crankpin, 180° apart, with the connecting rods, of chrome nickel steel, broad and flat to bring the two halves close together. [...] Cylinder heads and pistons were made of cast iron, the latter machined inside and out and fitted {{with a pair of}} rings. [...] Oil was forced through the crankshaft to the <b>crankpins,</b> then moved under centrifugal force to the cylinders and pistons from inside the crankcase which was a single light alloy casting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{central drive}} shaft, called the [...] "eccentric shaft" [...] or [...] "E-shaft", {{passes through the}} center of the rotor and is {{supported}} by fixed bearings. The rotors ride on eccentrics (analogous to <b>crankpins)</b> integral to the eccentric shaft (analogous to a crankshaft). The rotors both rotate around the eccentrics and make orbital revolutions around the eccentric shaft. Seals at the corners of the rotor seal against the periphery of the housing, dividing it into three moving combustion chambers. The rotation of each rotor on its own axis is caused and controlled by a pair of synchronizing gears A fixed gear mounted on one side of the rotor housing engages a ring gear attached to the rotor and ensures the rotor moves exactly 1/3 turn for each turn of the eccentric shaft. The power output of the engine is not transmitted through the synchronizing gears. The force of gas pressure on the rotor (to a first approximation) goes directly to the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cylinders}} are double-acting, with steam {{admitted to}} {{each side of the}} piston in turn. In a two-cylinder locomotive, one cylinder is located {{on each side of the}} vehicle. The cranks are set 90° out of phase. During a full rotation of the driving wheel, steam provides four power strokes; each cylinder receives two injections of steam per revolution. The first stroke is to the front of the piston and the second stroke to the rear of the piston; hence two working strokes. Consequently, two deliveries of steam onto each piston face in the two cylinders generates a full revolution of the driving wheel. Each piston is attached to the driving axle on each side by a connecting rod, and the driving wheels are connected together by coupling rods to transmit power from the main driver to the other wheels. Note that at the two [...] "dead centres", when the connecting rod is on the same axis as the crankpin on the driving wheel, the connecting rod applies no torque to the wheel. Therefore, if both cranksets could be at [...] "dead centre" [...] at the same time, and the wheels should happen to stop in this position, the locomotive could not start moving. Therefore, the <b>crankpins</b> are attached to the wheels at a 90° angle to each other, so only one side can be at dead centre at a time.|$|E
50|$|If {{the engine}} has a crankshaft, then the <b>crankpins</b> are the {{journals}} of the off-centre bearings of the crankshaft.

40|$|AbstractCrankpin is {{generally}} subjected to high thermal and cyclic loads when working. Surface roughness and residual stresses greatly influences the final running characteristics of <b>crankpin.</b> Path controlled grinding {{process has been}} used in automotive powertrain industry. The grinding conditions are periodically changing between grinding wheel and <b>crankpin</b> due to the existence of the eccentricity of <b>crankpin</b> and constant rotation speed of crankshaft. It leads to the variation of surface roughness and residual stresses on circumference of <b>crankpin.</b> So the optimization of grinding parameters in crankshaft grinding is essential. This paper presents an investigation to evaluate variation of surface roughness and residual stress along circumference in path controlled grinding of <b>crankpin.</b> The effects of the speed and speed ratio were analyzed in detail with constant rotation speed of crankshaft. It is found that up-grinding and down-grinding exist during one revolution cycle. The results show the surface roughness Ra always keeps below 0. 25 μm in all the grinding conditions, and the variations of surface roughness are little along circumference. The highly compressive residual stresses level after grinding is obtained on pin bearing. Compared to the variation of roughness, the variation of residual stress along circumference is large. Based on the results, the lower crankshaft rotational speed, lower grinding depth, and higher wheel speed are suggested {{to be used in the}} path controlled grinding of <b>crankpin</b> harden by induction surface hardening...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the things}} that made the {{original}} Pratt & Whitney “Wasp” so successful in 1926 when it first passed its type test was the ability to make its power at a higher RPM and a lighter weight than its competition. Key to this accomplishment was the use of a one-piece master rod and two-piece crankshaft. Though two-piece crankshafts had been built before, George Mead and Andy Willgoos chose a new construction consisting of a split <b>crankpin</b> splined to its mating <b>crankpin,</b> the whole assembly being held together with a bolt through the centre of the <b>crankpin.</b> See Figure 5. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} crossplane {{crankshaft}} for a 90° V8 engine has four <b>crankpins,</b> each serving two cylinders on opposing banks, offset at 90° from the adjacent <b>crankpins.</b> The {{first and last}} of the four crank pins are at 180° with {{respect to each other}} as are the second and third, with each pair at 90° to the other, so that viewed from the end the crankshaft forms a cross. The <b>crankpins</b> are therefore in two planes crossed at 90°, hence the name crossplane. A crossplane V8 crankshaft may have up to nine main bearings {{in the case of an}} eight throw design, and usually has five bearings supporting four throws each with a shared crank pin.|$|E

5000|$|A simple 90° V6 cannot {{achieve the}} same {{smoothness}} with only crankshaft counterweights, and if the 90° V6 uses shared <b>crankpins</b> like the V8, the engine will have uneven firing intervals, {{such as in the}} original [...] "odd-fire" [...] Buick V6 engine. This uneven firing interval results in roughness at idle and low RPM, and varying harmonics at higher engine speeds, making the [...] "odd-fire" [...] configuration unpopular with buyers, so most manufacturers now use split <b>crankpins</b> to make the firing intervals an even 120°. Therefore, designing a smooth V6 engine is a much more complicated problem than the straight-6, flat-6, and V8 layouts. Although the use of offset <b>crankpins,</b> counterweights, and flying arms has reduced the problem to a minor second-order vibration in modern designs, all V6s can benefit from the addition of auxiliary balance shafts to make them completely smooth.|$|E

5000|$|A V12 {{engine is}} a V engine with 12 {{cylinders}} {{mounted on the}} crankcase in two banks of six cylinders each, usually but not always at a 60° angle to each other, with all 12 pistons driving a common crankshaft. Since each cylinder bank is essentially a straight-six which is by itself in both primary and secondary balance, a V12 inherits perfect primary and secondary balance no matter which V angle is used, and therefore it needs no balance shafts. A four-stroke 12 cylinder engine has an even firing order if cylinders fire every 60° of crankshaft rotation, so a V12 with cylinder banks at a multiples of 60° (60°, 120°, or 180°) will have even firing intervals without using split <b>crankpins.</b> By using split <b>crankpins</b> or ignoring minor vibrations, any V angle is possible. The 180° configuration is usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "flat-twelve engine" [...] or a [...] "boxer" [...] although it is in reality a 180° V since the pistons can and normally do use shared <b>crankpins.</b> It may also be written as [...] "V-12", although this is rare.|$|E

50|$|Many older V6 engines {{were based}} on V8 engine designs, in which a pair of {{cylinders}} was cut off the front of V8 without altering the V angle or using a more sophisticated crankshaft to even out the firing interval.
