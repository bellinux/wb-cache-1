Having the player walk through the streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree of contrast pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to decide how lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E

It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study the ASEAN market, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge for Vietnam, the article stated, is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.|$|E

500|$|The Cornaro {{family had}} been {{established}} in Latin Greece for some time, acting both as the Republic of Venice's officials and on their own account, and Pietro's father Federigo was accounted {{the richest man in}} Venice in 1379. The marriage of Maria of Enghien and Pietro Cornaro coincided with an increasing Venetian interest in the region, as the Republic faced new <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunities</b> in the Aegean with the rise of the Ottomans. Possession of Nauplia would complete Venice's control of the shores of the Morea, which in turn controlled the routes from the Adriatic to the eastern Mediterranean; while Nauplia itself was valuable as an intermediate stop for the Black Sea commercial routes as well. Maria of Enghien and Pietro Cornaro were both still young when they became lords of Argos and Nauplia. In the first years of their reign, they resided in Venice, and Pietro's father Federigo acted on their behalf, securing permissions from the Venetian government to send supplies or arm a galley to defend the lordship. Following his father's death in 1382, Pietro secured permission by the Venetian government to go to Nauplia himself; by this time, in Anthony Luttrell's words, [...] "the [...] senate considered these places more or less as Venetian possessions".|$|E

500|$|Based {{on common}} misconceptions and {{stereotypes}} about men in nursing, Greg's profession is repeatedly {{brought up by}} Jack Byrnes in a negative context and the character of Greg Focker {{has come to be}} one of the best known film portrayals of a male nurse. Even though men dominated the profession in earlier times, there has been a feminization of the nursing profession over the course of the last century which has caused men in nursing to often be portrayed as misfits by the media. A common stereotype is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice, either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one. Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non-masculine attributes. Jack Byrnes is often seen openly criticizing Greg's career choice per his perception of nursing being an effeminate profession. In their book Men in Nursing: History, <b>Challenges,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Opportunities</b> authors Chad O'Lynn and Russell Tranbarger present this as an example of a negative portrayal. Commenting on the same issue but disagreeing, Barbara Cherry in her book Contemporary Nursing: Issues, Trends, & Management called the portrayal of Greg as a nurse [...] "one of the most positive film portrayals of men who are nurses" [...] and commented that Greg [...] "humorously addresses and rises above the worst of all stereotypes that are endured by men in this profession." [...] Sandy and Harry Summers in the book Saving Lives: Why the Media's Portrayal of Nurses Puts Us All at Risk postulate that Greg's character, although intelligent and firm in his defense of his profession, [...] "might have done more to rebut the stereotypes" [...] while also reporting that [...] "some men in nursing" [...] expressed their opinions that it would have been better to not present the stereotypes at all.|$|E
