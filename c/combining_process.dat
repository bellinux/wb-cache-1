50|$|The R,G,B {{signals in}} the {{receiver}} {{needed for the}} display device (CRT, Plasma display or LCD display) are electronically derived by matrixing as follows: R is the additive combination of (R-Y) with Y, G is the additive combination of (G-Y) with Y, and B is the additive combination of (B-Y) with Y. All of this is accomplished electronically. It {{can be seen that}} in the <b>combining</b> <b>process,</b> the low resolution portion of the Y signals cancel out, leaving R,G, and B signals able to render a low-resolution image in full color. However, the higher resolution portions of the Y signals do not cancel out, and so are equally present in R, G, and B, producing the higher definition (higher resolution) image detail in monochrome, although it appears to the human eye as a full-color and full resolution picture.|$|E

Laboratory studies were performed of the <b>combined</b> <b>process.</b> In particular, a laboratory experiment was conducted to implement the <b>combined</b> <b>process</b> of “rolling-pressing”, whose main purpose was to research {{the effect of the}} scheme on the deformation changes in the microstructure and mechanical properties of the original workpieces, made of copper alloy M 1.

50|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} {{works by}} varying the amplitude of the carrier wave {{according to the}} bent waveform of original video signal. In other words, when the carrier wave is combined with the video signal, frequency of the combined signal {{is the same as}} the frequency of the carrier wave while the amplitude is varied. The picture above can more directly explain how the shape is changed. In the <b>combining</b> <b>process,</b> if the video signal is at its peak (highest amplitude value), the amplitude of the varied carrier wave will be the highest and as for trough (lowest amplitude value), the amplitude of varied carrier wave will be the lowest. In other words, at the point in carrier wave that corresponds to the peak of video signal, the shape of wave will be most bulged and at the point corresponding to the trough, the shape will be most sunk. In fact, the change in amplitude of carrier wave is proportional to the amplitude of the video signal.|$|E

The cutting {{followed}} by burnishing, used like a <b>combined</b> <b>process,</b> {{leads to the}} improvement of the part surface quality (roughness, hardness, microstructure etc.) and to reduction of the costs and manufacturing times as a function of different working parameters. One of the factors and parameters that characterize the machined surface by this <b>combined</b> <b>process</b> is the residual stresses that are generated and located in the part deformed strata. The present paper analyses the results concerning the experimental determination of the residual stresses generated in the machined surfaces of parts made from magnesium alloy by the burnishing- turning <b>combined</b> <b>process.</b> The experimental investigations have shown that in the machined strata the <b>combined</b> <b>process</b> determines the occurrence of the compressive residual stresses and hence the fatigue and cracking resistances of the machined materials will be improved...|$|R

The use of ultrashort pulses in a coherent combining setup results in new challenges compared to continuous wave operation or to pulses on the nanosecond timescale, because temporal and spectral effects such as self-phase modulation, dispersion and the optical path length difference between the pulses have to be considered. In this paper {{the impact of these}} effects on the <b>combining</b> <b>process</b> has been investigated and simple analytical equations for the evaluation of this impact have been obtained.
