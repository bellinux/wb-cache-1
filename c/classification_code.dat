5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the eight}} sports contested in the first Paralympics, the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome. Both the rules for the sport and for the {{approval}} of swimmers' classifications were set by the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA). In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) formally became the governing body for disability swimming. Four different sporting bodies, the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), International Sports Federation of the Disabled (ISOD), International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (ISMWSF) and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), assisted the IPC in governing swimming at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC <b>Classification</b> <b>Code</b> and IPC Swimming govern the classification process. Classification of swimmers is performed by classifiers that are recognised by the IPC.|$|E

40|$|Subject-oriented bibliographic online searching relies in {{most cases}} {{on the results of}} verbal subject {{analysis}} (descriptors, subject headings, keywords, text of abstract). However, many bibliographic databases are also searchable by <b>classification</b> <b>codes.</b> This paper deals with the latter form of subject access, mainly pointing out the role of <b>classification</b> <b>codes</b> (class codes) as a useful enrichment to verbal online searching. Part 1 discusses the following questions: To what extent are classification schemes as a means of subject access to be found in bibliographic databases? What is the nature of these systems and their notation? Part 2 shows several advantageous applications of using <b>classification</b> <b>codes</b> in bibliographic online searching. Part 3 deals with modifications and changes of classification systems, which constitute the main problem when using them in online searching. Thus, the searcher not only has to be informed how to apply classification for improving search strategies, but also how to overcome such difficulties...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} that a visualization model {{can determine the}} effectiveness of searching a bibliographic database, when three descriptive metadata fields are compared. The Inspec database was searched to create a bibliography of articles about a broad scientific topic, interplanetary travel. We collected metadata from 823 Inspec articles and used the Sci 2 Tool to create co-occurrence networks based on subject terms, title keywords, and <b>classification</b> <b>codes</b> {{from each of the}} articles. The Watts-Strogatz clustering coefficient model was used to create molecular organization of the networks. This method identified subject domain clusters {{for each of the three}} selected metadata elements and subject <b>classification</b> <b>codes</b> were extracted from all the clusters obtained. All data obtained was converted into a common metadata element (<b>classification</b> <b>codes),</b> allowing for the comparison of data from the initial search and from all the subject clusters identified in the visualization process. A set of eight subject codes were found to describe the Main Subject Domain of interplanetary travel. The results also show that searching with <b>classification</b> <b>codes</b> produced the best outcome, the second best option is using subject terms, and the least effective search technique is using title keywords. These results, using visualization, corroborate previous studies...|$|R
