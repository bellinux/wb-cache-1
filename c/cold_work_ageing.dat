The influence of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> and <b>aging</b> conditions was examined on the underaged material for the same proof strength level. A slow quench is unfavourable both for tensile properties and SL fracture toughness due to a heavy precipitation of stable phases within grain (and subgrain) boundaries. For a same proof strength level, raising the aging temperature from 170 to 210 °C improves ductility. This effect mainly results from an increased resistance to shear rupture, which is related to changes in precipitation characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{new model}} based on least square support vector {{machines}} (LSSVM) {{and capable of}} forecasting the hardness of Cu- 3 Ti- 1 Cr alloy has been proposed. Data mining and artificial intelligence techniques were {{used to examine the}} forecasting capability of the model. In order to improve predictive accuracy and generalization ability of LSSVM model, leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) technique was adopted to determine the optimal hyper-parameters of LSSVM automatically. The forecasting performance of the LSSVM model and the partial least squares (PLS) regression integrated with radial basis function (RBF-PLS) has been compared with the experimental values. The result demonstrates that the LSSVM model is superior to the conventional RBF-PLS model in predicting the hardness of Cu- 3 Ti- 1 Cr alloy and of better generalization performance than the RBF-PLS model. The present calculated results are consistent with the experimental values. We would expect the proposed LSSVM model as a powerful tool to forecast the variation of the hardness of copper alloys with prior <b>cold</b> <b>work,</b> <b>aging</b> temperature and aging time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Investigations {{have been}} carried out on the effect of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> and {{subsequent}} <b>aging</b> on mechani-cal properties of a Cu-bearing HSLA- 100 steel microalloyed with Nb and Ti. Aging at 400 °C after various degrees of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> (25 – 70 pct) exhibits multiple hardness peaks. The treatments cause significant improve-ment in hardness and tensile strength, but at the cost of impact strength. <b>Cold</b> <b>work</b> also causes deterioration in ductility, which again improves on subsequent aging. The C 70 A treatment involving 70 pct deformation exhibits maximum response to age hardening giving a hardness of 465 VHN and a UTS of 1344 MPa, but with low values of ductility (5 pct) and impact energy (24 J). C 50 A treatment involving 50 pct <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> and <b>aging</b> results in an optimum combination of mechanical properties. This treatment in the second hardness peak stage yields a hardness of 373 VHN, UTS of 1186 MPa together with a ductility value of 11 pct and impact energy of 109 J. Scanning electron microscopic studies of fracture surfaces reveal that the impact fracture occurs by formation of dimples and nucleation and growth of voids and cracks. Fracture in tensile specimens is caused by formation of voids and cracks at high density striations. Formation of voids and cracks is also assisted by the presence of precipitated carbide particles...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the properties of copper rich Cu-Fe-Cr alloys for the purpose of developing a new cost effective, high-strength, high-conductivity copper alloy. This paper reports on the influence of <b>cold</b> <b>work.</b> The <b>age</b> hardening response of the Cu- 0. 7 %Cr- 2. 0 %Fe alloy was minimal, but the resistance to softening was superior to that reported for any commercial high-strength, high-conductivity (HSHC) copper alloy with comparable mechanical and electrical properties. For example, an excess of 85 % of the original hardness of the 40 % <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> alloy is retained after holding at 700 degreesC for 1 hour, whereas commercial HSHC Cu-Fe-P alloys have been reported to soften significantly after 1 hours exposure at less than 500 degreesC. The Cu- 0. 7 Cr- 2. 0 Fe alloy would therefore be expected to be more suitable for applications with a significant risk of exposure to elevated temperatures. Optical microscope examination of <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> and <b>aged</b> microstructures confirmed the high resistance to recrystallization for Cu- 0. 7 %Cr- 2. 0 %Fe. The Zener-Smith drag term, predicting the pinning effect of second phase particles on dislocations in <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> microstructures, was calculated using the precipitate characteristics obtained from TEM, WDS and resistivity measurements. The pinning effect of the precipitate dispersions in the peak-aged condition was determined to be essentially equivalent for the Cu- 0. 7 %Cr- 0. 3 %Fe and Cu- 0. 7 %Cr- 2. 0 %Fe alloys. A lower recrystallisation temperature in the Cu- 0. 7 %Cr- 0. 3 %Fe alloy was therefore attributed to faster coarsening kinetics of the secondary precipitates resulting from a higher Cr concentration in the precipitates at lower iron content.

40|$|Application {{prospects}} in the automotive industry have led to increasing studies on Al-Mg- Cu-Si alloys. In this thesis, nine Al-(1 - 3) Mg-(0 - 0. 4) Cu- 0. 15 Si- 0. 25 Mn (in wt%) alloys with potential applications in packaging and automotive industries have been investigated. By means of mechanical testing, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), several mechanisms was identified that influence the final strength of cold rolled alloys during ageing: solid solution, work hardening, recovery and precipitation. Microstructure analyses revealed the formation of undissolved particles consuming the small Si addition, which influences age hardening behaviour of the alloys. Tensile testing was performed to evaluate the strength and work hardening. The integrated experimental results showed that for <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> samples, b² (Mg 2 Si) contributes to age hardening of Cu-free alloys, whilst both b² and S (Al 2 CuMg) contribute to that of Cu-containing alloys. According to the experimental findings, a yield strength model has been developed to elucidate the relation between processing and the final strength. It consists of three main components: i) dissolution of intermetallic phase Mg 2 Si; ii) precipitation of two strengthening phases b² and S; iii) strengthening contributions from solution strengthening, dislocation strengthening and precipitation hardening due to the strengthening phases. The model was calibrated and tested using separate tensile data and was applied to predict the yield strength evolution of <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> samples during <b>ageing.</b> An accuracy of 8. 6 MPa (about 4 % of the total range of strengths) has been achieved. Based on {{the analysis of the}} relation of <b>work</b> hardening with <b>cold</b> <b>work,</b> composition and <b>ageing</b> time, three primary findings were obtained: i) <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> samples usually have the lowest work hardening rate (WHR); ii) WHR increases after 30 -minute ageing due to recovery and iii) WHR increases with decreasing level of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> and increasing Mg and Cu contents. Work hardening models based on the Kocks-Mecking (KM) model and the Kocks-Mecking-Estrin (KME) model have been utilized to explain the main trends.

The steel was given solution treatment at 1000 °C, followed by cold rolling to 25, 50 and 80 pct deformations and aging at 600 °C for various durations. Substantial improvement in hardness and UTS {{was observed in}} the peak aged condition of various treatments, but {{at the expense of}} ductility and impact-energy. Extensive scanning electron microscopic studies carried out on impact and tensile fracture surfaces suggest that poor impact energy and low ductility in peak aged condition could be associated with inhomog-neous deformation caused by the existence of coherent precipitates. Other parameters adversely affecting toughness and ductility in various stages of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> and <b>aging</b> may include high stress concentrati at high density dislocation network and dislocation–precipitate interface. Overaging in various treatments resulted in higher impact energy and ductility, presumably due to existence of incoherent precipitates and reduction in stress concentration at dislocation cell boundaries.

40|$|Purpose: The {{study on}} structure-property {{relations}} of heavily <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> and <b>aged</b> martensite in two high-alloy structural steels was presented. The {{aim was to}} understand properties of the sheet products better and thus extend applications of the newly developed cobalt-free maraging and precipitation hardening stainless steels. Design/methodology/approach: Mechanical tests were performed on cold rolled and aged specimens. Microstructures were analyzed using TEM and SEM. The crystallographic texture was analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction and ADC method. Findings: In the process of cold working and ageing both high alloy steels studied could develop yield strength in excess of 1600 MPa. The main strengthening mechanism was precipitation hardening, while work hardening contribution to the strength was very limited. Overaging commences after prolonged treatment above 500 ºC, and in both steels {{could be related to}} reverted austenite. The texture developed by cold working was the one known as rolling texture type. Research limitations/implications: In this study the advantage is taken of the high strength that is developed by cold working followed by ageing. Further research is needed for the sheet or strip produced by cold working and annealed before fabrication. Practical implications: The properties of the high alloy steels studied make them suitable for advanced sheet applications, e. g. as an airborne structural equipment. After welding, strength of the precipitation hardening steels could be largely restored by ageing, because their strength does not rely on strain hardening. Originality/value: Analysis of the <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> properties, microstructure and texture, allowed for better understanding of the microstructure-property relationships in the low strain hardening high alloy sheet steels.

Experi-mental evidence indicates that the excess AECC {{is due in part}} to elastic strains, i. e., residual stress, and in part to plastic strains, i. e., <b>cold</b> <b>work.</b> The very fact that the conductivity in-creases rather than decreases was originally thought to indicate that there was no significant <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> contribution to the observed AECC increase. This assumption was also supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results on fully relaxed specimens showing that the <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> in-duced widening of the diffraction beam only partially vanishes when both the residual stress and the AECC completely disappear due to thermal relaxation. However, we show in this paper that assuming that the conductivity change is entirely due to residual stress via the piezoresistivity of the material could result in an unacceptable overestimation of the magni-tude of the compressive residual stress. Therefore, we investigated the different mechanisms through which <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> could influence the AECC in surface-treated nickel-base super-alloys. It was found that neither the magnetic susceptibility nor the piezoresistivity of the material is affected significantly by <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> up to 50 % plastic strain level, but the electri-cal conductivity does substantially increase due to microstructural changes. Based on these observations, we suggest that in future research the complex variations caused by <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> should be modeled by at least two main types of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> parameters rather than by a single one in order to properly account for the otherwise contradictory effects of plastic deformation on eddy current conductivity and XRD measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates stress {{corrosion}} cracking resistance of <b>cold</b> <b>worked</b> layers of 25 Cr duplex stainless steel grade UR 52 N+. The surface layers were processed through burnishing treatment. The residual stresses at surface layers were determined using grazing angle incidence X-ray diffraction method (g-sin 2 Ψ). Corrosion tests were performed {{with the use of}} Slow Strain Rate Test technique in boiling 35 % MgCl 2 solution. It has been demonstrated that burnishing treatment increases corrosion resistance of the steel. Stress corrosion cracking resistance depends on the magnitude of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> at surface layers. High level of <b>cold</b> <b>work</b> diminishes corrosion resistance...|$|R
