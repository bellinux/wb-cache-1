5|$|In captivity, sarus cranes {{have been}} known to live for as long as 42 years. Premature adult {{mortality}} is often the result of human actions. Accidental poisoning by monocrotophos, <b>chlorpyrifos</b> and dieldrin-treated seeds used in agricultural areas has been noted. Adults {{have been known}} to fly into power lines and die of electrocution, this is responsible for killing about 1% of the local population each year.|$|E
5|$|Pest {{control of}} the jack jumper ant is {{successful}} in maintaining their populations around suburban habitats. Chemicals like bendiocarb, <b>chlorpyrifos,</b> diazinon and permethrin are effective against them. Spraying of Solfac into nests is an effective way of controlling nests {{if they are in}} a close range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity. Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies. The Australian National Botanic Gardens has an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack jumper nests.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the EPA banned most uses of methyl {{parathion}} and azinphos methyl, citing the risks they pose to children. Both {{methyl parathion}} and azinphos methyl are organophosphates. Organophosphates are pesticides that kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these pesticides {{have the same}} effect on humans. In 2000, the EPA banned another organophosphate, (<b>chlorpyrifos),</b> that was common in the agriculture industry, household cleaners and commercial pest control products, due to a study showing that <b>chlorpyrifos</b> caused weakness, vomiting and diarrhea in baby rats.|$|E
25|$|The main use of {{pyridine}} is as {{a precursor}} to the herbicides paraquat and diquat. The first synthesis step of insecticide <b>chlorpyrifos</b> consists of the chlorination of pyridine. Pyridine is also the starting compound for the preparation of pyrithione-based fungicides. Cetylpyridinium and laurylpyridinium, which can be produced from pyridine with a Zincke reaction, are used as antiseptic in oral and dental care products. Pyridine is easily attacked by alkylating agents to give N-alkylpyridinium salts. One example is cetylpyridinium chloride.|$|E
25|$|The cane beetle (also {{known as}} cane grub) can {{substantially}} reduce crop yield by eating roots; {{it can be}} controlled with imidacloprid (Confidor) or <b>chlorpyrifos</b> (Lorsban). Other important pests are the larvae of some butterfly/moth species, including the turnip moth, the sugarcane borer (Diatraea saccharalis), the Mexican rice borer (Eoreuma loftini); leaf-cutting ants, termites, spittlebugs (especially Mahanarva fimbriolata and Deois flavopicta), and the beetle Migdolus fryanus. The planthopper insect Eumetopina flavipes acts as a virus vector, which causes the sugarcane disease ramu stunt.|$|E
25|$|B. lecheguana is a known natural {{enemy of}} the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella, along with several other species of wasp {{including}} Polistes versicolor, Polybia paulista, Polybia occidentalis, Polybia scutellaris, and Protonectarina sylveirae. B. lecheguana are often used as biological controls in coffee plantations {{in order to prevent}} the proliferation of the devastating leaf miner. In order to test the effect pesticides have on the environment and to test the efficacy of using pesticides in conjunction with natural predators, the effect that several pesticides have on the health of B. lecheguana and other wasps was assayed. This wasp species is found to be highly susceptible to <b>chlorpyrifos</b> and other organophosphate pesticides. Even at half the recommended dosage of a number of these pesticides, the wasp was found to have nearly 100% mortality.|$|E
500|$|Many {{pesticides}} are enzyme inhibitors. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is {{an enzyme}} found in animals from insects to humans. [...] It {{is essential to}} nerve cell function through its mechanism of breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into its constituents, acetate and choline. [...] This is somewhat unusual among neurotransmitters as most, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, are absorbed from the synaptic cleft rather than cleaved. [...] A large number of AChE inhibitors are used in both medicine and agriculture. [...] Reversible competitive inhibitors, such as edrophonium, physostigmine, and neostigmine, {{are used in the}} treatment of myasthenia gravis and in anaesthesia. [...] The carbamate pesticides are also examples of reversible AChE inhibitors. [...] The organophosphate pesticides such as malathion, parathion, and <b>chlorpyrifos</b> irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorpyrifos</b> has a {{tolerance}} of 0.1 part per million (ppm) residue on all food items unless a different tolerance {{has been set}} for that item or <b>chlorpyrifos</b> is not registered for use on that crop. EPA set approximately 112 tolerances pertaining to food products and supplies. In 2006, to reduce childhood exposure, the EPA amended its <b>chlorpyrifos</b> tolerance on apples, grapes and tomatoes, reducing the grape and apple tolerances to 0.01 ppm and eliminating the tolerance on tomatoes. <b>Chlorpyrifos</b> is not allowed on crops such as spinach, squash, carrots, and tomatoes; any <b>chlorpyrifos</b> residue on these crops normally represents <b>chlorpyrifos</b> misuse or spray drift.|$|E
50|$|The enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) detoxifies <b>chlorpyrifos</b> oxon, {{the more}} toxic {{metabolite}} of <b>chlorpyrifos,</b> via hydrolysis. In laboratory animals, additional PON1 protects against <b>chlorpyrifos</b> toxicity while individuals {{that do not}} produce PON1 are particularly susceptible. In humans, studies {{about the effect of}} PON1 activity on the toxicity of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> and other organophosphates are mixed, with modest yet inconclusive evidence that higher levels of PON1 activity may protect against <b>chlorpyrifos</b> exposure in adults; PON1 activity may be most likely to offer protection from low-level chronic doses. Human populations have genetic variation in the sequence of PON1 and its promoter region that may influence the effectiveness of PON1 at detoxifying <b>chlorpyrifos</b> oxon and the amount of PON1 available to do so. Some evidence indicates that children born to women with low PON1 may be particularly susceptible to <b>chlorpyrifos</b> exposure. Further, infants produce low levels of PON1 until six months to several years after birth, likely increasing the risk from <b>chlorpyrifos</b> exposure early in life.|$|E
50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} the effects of combined exposure to <b>chlorpyrifos</b> and other chemical agents, and these combined exposures can result in different effects during development. Female rats exposed first to dexamethasone, a treatment for premature labor, for three days in utero and then to low levels of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> for four days after birth experienced additional damage to the acetylcholine system upstream of the synapse that was not observed with either exposure alone. In both male and female rats, combined exposures to dexamethasone and <b>chlorpyrifos</b> decreased serotonin turnover in the synapse, for female rats with a greater-than-additive result. Rats that were co-exposed to dexamethasone and <b>chlorpyrifos</b> also exhibited complex behavioral differences from exposure to either chemical alone, including lessening or reversing normal sex differences in behavior. In the lab, in rats and neural cells co-exposed to both nicotine and <b>chlorpyrifos,</b> nicotine appears to protect against <b>chlorpyrifos</b> acetylcholinesterase inhibition and reduce its effects on neurodevelopment. In at least one study, nicotine appeared to enhance <b>chlorpyrifos</b> detoxification.|$|E
50|$|Primarily, <b>chlorpyrifos</b> {{and other}} {{organophosphate}} pesticides interfere with signaling from the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. One <b>chlorpyrifos</b> metabolite, chlorpyrifos-oxon, binds permanently to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, preventing this enzyme from deactivating acetylcholine in the synapse. By irreversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, <b>chlorpyrifos</b> {{leads to a}} build-up of acetylcholine between neurons and a stronger, longer-lasting signal to the next neuron. Only when new molecules of acetylcholinesterase have been synthesized can normal function return. Acute symptoms of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> poisoning only occur when more than 70% of acetylcholinesterase molecules are inhibited. This mechanism is well established for acute <b>chlorpyrifos</b> poisoning and also some lower-dose health impacts. It is also the primary insecticidal mechanism.|$|E
50|$|As an example, {{consider}} the following determination of the RfD for the insecticide <b>chlorpyrifos,</b> adapted from the EPA's Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision for <b>chlorpyrifos.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2011, EPA {{estimated}} that, in {{the general}} US population, people consume 0.009 micrograms of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> per kilogram of their body weight per day directly from food residue. Children are estimated to consume a greater quantity of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> per unit of body weight from food residue, with toddlers the highest at 0.025 micrograms of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> per kilogram of their body weight per day. People may also ingest <b>chlorpyrifos</b> from drinking water or from residue in food handling establishments. The EPA’s acceptable daily dose is 0.3 micrograms/kg/day.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016 the EPA {{concluded}} {{years of}} research with a proposal to eliminate all tolerances for <b>chlorpyrifos</b> ("Because tolerances are the maximum residue of a pesticide that can be in or on food, this proposed rule revoking all <b>chlorpyrifos</b> tolerances means that if this approach is finalized, all agricultural uses of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> would cease."). [...] The Dow Chemical Company is actively opposed to tolerance restrictions on chlropyrifos and is currently lobbying the White House to, among other goals, pressure EPA to reverse its proposal to revoke <b>chlorpyrifos</b> food residue tolerances.|$|E
5000|$|... 3-Picoline is {{a useful}} {{precursor}} to agrochemicals, such as <b>chlorpyrifos.</b> <b>Chlorpyrifos</b> is produced from 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, which is generated from 3-picoline by way of cyanopyridine. This conversion involves the ammoxidation of 3-methylpyridine: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorpyrifos</b> in {{waterways}} {{is regulated}} as a hazardous substance under section 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and {{falls under the}} CWA amendments of 1977 and 1978. The regulation is inclusive of all <b>chlorpyrifos</b> isomers and hydrates in any solution or mixture. EPA has not set a drinking water regulatory standard for <b>chlorpyrifos,</b> but has established a drinking water guideline of 2 ug/L.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{laws and}} {{guidelines}} may apply for individual states. For example, Florida has a drinking water guideline for <b>chlorpyrifos</b> of 21 ug/L. Other states are reviewing <b>chlorpyrifos</b> following the federal government’s recommendations for pesticide surveillance.|$|E
50|$|Concentrated <b>chlorpyrifos</b> {{released}} into rivers killed insects, shrimp and fish. In Britain, the rivers Roding (1985), Ouse (2001), Wey (2002 & 2003), and Kennet (2013) all experienced insect, shrimp, and/or fish kills {{as a result}} of small releases of concentrated <b>chlorpyrifos.</b> The July 2013 release along the River Kennet poisoned insect life and shrimp along 15 km of the river, potentially from a half a cup of concentrated <b>chlorpyrifos</b> washed down a drain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorpyrifos</b> {{was used}} to control insect infestations of homes and {{commercial}} buildings in Europe until it was banned from sale in 2008. <b>Chlorpyrifos</b> is restricted from termite control in Singapore as of 2009. It was banned from residential use in South Africa as of 2010. In 2010, India barred Dow from commercial activity for 5 years after India’s Central Bureau of Investigation found Dow guilty of bribing Indian officials in 2007 to allow the sale of <b>chlorpyrifos.</b>|$|E
50|$|Acute {{poisoning}} {{is probably}} {{most common in}} agricultural areas in Asia, where many small farmers are affected. Poisoning {{may be due to}} occupational or accidental exposure or intentional self-harm. Precise numbers of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> poisonings globally are not available. Pesticides are used in an estimated 200,000+ suicides annually with 10s of thousands due to <b>chlorpyrifos.</b> Organophosphates are thought to constitute two thirds of ingested pesticides in rural Asia. <b>Chlorpyrifos</b> is among the commonly used pesticides used for self-harm.|$|E
50|$|Among 50 farm {{pesticides}} studied, <b>chlorpyrifos</b> {{was associated}} with higher risks of lung cancer among frequent pesticide applicators than among infrequent or non-users. Pesticide applicators as a whole {{were found to have}} a 50% lower cancer risk than the general public, likely due to their nearly 50% lower smoking rate. However, <b>chlorpyrifos</b> applicators had a 15% lower cancer risk than the general public, which the study suggests indicates a link between <b>chlorpyrifos</b> application and lung cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Even the {{restrictions}} that did successfully pass have been controversial. For example, in 1999 the EPA restricted {{the use of}} <b>chlorpyrifos</b> in households (under the commercial name Dursban). However, the EPA did not limit its use in agriculture. <b>Chlorpyrifos</b> {{remains one of the}} most widely used pesticides. This may soon change. On February 8, 2013 the EPA requested comment on a preliminary evaluation of the potential risks to children and other bystanders from volatilization of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> from treated crops ...|$|E
5000|$|In November 2016, the EPA reassessed its ban {{proposal}} {{after taking}} into consideration recommendations made by the agency’s Science Advisory Panel which had rejected the EPA’s methodology in quantifying the risk posed by <b>chlorpyrifos.</b> Using a different methodology {{as suggested by the}} panel, the EPA retained its decision to completely ban <b>chlorpyrifos.</b> The EPA concluded that, while “uncertainties” remain, a number of studies provide “sufficient evidence” that children experience neurodevelopment effects even at low levels of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> exposure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorpyrifos</b> is not {{regulated}} {{under international}} law or treaty. Organizations such as PANNA and the NRDC state that <b>chlorpyrifos</b> meets the four criteria (persistence, bioaccumulation, long-range transport, and toxicity) in Annex D of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and should be restricted.|$|E
50|$|When {{exposed in}} the {{laboratory}} to <b>chlorpyrifos</b> at levels roughly estimated from measurements in hives, bee larvae experienced 60% mortality over 6 days, compared with 15% mortality in controls. Adult bees exposed to sub-lethal effects of <b>chlorpyrifos</b> (0.46 ng/bee) exhibited altered behaviors: less walking; more grooming, particularly of the head; more difficulty righting themselves; and unusual abdominal spasms. <b>Chlorpyrifos</b> oxon appears to particularly inhibit acetylcholinesterase in bee gut tissue as opposed to head tissue. Other organophosphate pesticides impaired bee learning and memory of smells {{in the laboratory}}.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorpyrifos</b> {{poisoning}} {{was described}} by New Zealand scientists as the likely cause of death of several tourists in Chiang Mai, Thailand who developed myocarditis in 2011. Thai investigators came to no conclusion on the subject, but maintain that <b>chlorpyrifos</b> was not responsible and that the deaths were not linked.|$|E
50|$|Air {{monitoring}} {{studies conducted}} by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) documented <b>chlorpyrifos</b> in the air of California communities. Analyses indicate that children living in areas of high <b>chlorpyrifos</b> use are often exposed to levels that exceed EPA dosages. Advocacy groups monitored air samples in Washington and Lindsay, California, in 2006 with comparable results. Grower and pesticide industry groups argued that the air levels documented in these studies are not high enough to cause significant exposure or adverse effects, but a follow-up biomonitoring study in Lindsay showed that people there display above-normal <b>chlorpyrifos</b> levels.|$|E
