5|$|The law {{governing}} aviation in the UK {{is defined}} by the <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> Act 1982, which is updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> Act 2006. The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the operational level the independently run <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, other than in airport development, there are few aspects of the air transport industry in which the government can act in isolation.|$|E

5|$|During World War II civil {{aerodromes}} {{were taken}} over for military use, existing military airfields were expanded, and new ones were built. This {{resulted in a}} significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war. Pre-war civil aerodromes, for example Sywell, were returned to civilian use. Surplus military airfields were closed, and in some cases, for example Beccles, subsequently re-opened as civil aerodromes. The Ministry of <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> was created to regulate all <b>civil</b> <b>aviation</b> in the UK, and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until {{the establishment of the}} independent CAA in 1972.|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Air Board {{was founded}} 1919 and had {{regulatory}} control over all <b>civil</b> and military <b>aviation,</b> merging into the Department of National Defence in 1923. The Aeronautics Act of 1919 established Federal control over aviation {{and gave the}} legislative authority for air regulations. All <b>aviation,</b> <b>civil</b> and military, was under Canadian Air Force (Royal Canadian Air Force) control until 1926. In that year, the Directorate of Civil Government Air Operations (CGAO) took over responsibility for all non-military aviation regulations. In 1936, the Canadian Privy Council decided that aviation was subject to Federal regulation. This later allowed the Department of Transport, as CGAO was renamed, to become the <b>civil</b> authority over <b>aviation</b> in 1936, taking over from the Department of National Defence.|$|R

5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, any water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. The Department of <b>Civil</b> <b>Aviation</b> believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E
