What are the main factors in the social and academic spheres that impact on the educational experiences of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care?</b> 3.

40|$|This {{report is}} based on a PhD study, {{undertaken}} between 2005 and 2010, focusing on improving educational engagement and outcomes for children and young people <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> The views expressed in this report are those of the author and not those of the Department of Family and Community Services. The purpose of this report is to inform the NSW education and out-of-home care sectors about the findings and the implications for better policy and practice in this area. The poor educational performance of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care</b> has been a concern, internationally, for a number of decades. In Australia, it has received less attention even though the limited research to date indicates that <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care</b> are performing more poorly than their non-care peers and face a range of barriers in engaging with their school life. This study sought to develop an understanding of the issues impacting on the educational engagement and outcomes for <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> NSW. The research and data collection were guided by five main questions: What are the educational outcomes for <b>children</b> currently <b>in</b> <b>care?</b> What are the factors that affect the educational engagement of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care?</b> How do the various transitions <b>children</b> may experience <b>in</b> <b>care</b> affect their education and how can these transitions best be supported? What are the experiences of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> their transition to high school and how can this transition best be supported? How can the immediate environments of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care</b> facilitate positive educational engagement and outcomes?

40|$|Abstract: Placement {{in child}} {{protection}} services, or becoming a <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>care,</b> {{is associated with}} a disproportionate involvement in youth and adult criminal justice systems. While there is not extensive research on this relationship, there is evidence that many children in care have risk profiles consistent with criminal justice involvement. This article provides an overview of the prevalence of exposure to risk factors related to mental health, education, and antisocial behaviour among children in care, in addition to risk factors that are distinctive to those placed in child protection services. A recent large cohort dataset from British Columbia, Canada, is utilized to examine these risk profiles. Recommendations to identify those involved in child protection services most at risk for criminal justice involvement, with the use of risk management instruments such as the Cracow Instrument, are discussed. In addition, several other important policy themes regarding diagnostic and case management challenges are explored.

It covers how the decision is made, the factors taken into account when making it and provides important suggestions for effective decision-making. It compares the progress made by the children in relation to their safety, stability and emotional well-being.

40|$|With {{increasing}} demand {{on the role}} of being a foster carer, {{it can be difficult to}} maintain a stable placement for the <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> Resilience is a crucial factor in individuals successfully overcoming challenges and adversity, something that is ever present for foster carers. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore what factors enable and maintain resilience in foster carers, in addition to considering the challenges they face. Fourteen foster carers (2 male and 12 female) who had maintained a long term placement (for a year or more) with a looked after child, were recruited from a Local Authority in the North West of England. Foster carers were interviewed and their verbatim transcripts were analysed using a grounded theory methodology. A theoretical framework, including enabling, maintaining and resilience challenging factors, were found to emerge from the data and identified as likely in demonstrating foster carers' resilience and influencing placement stability. This theoretical framework provides an insight into clinical implications such as ensuring that foster carers receive the appropriate support when they are faced with increasing challenges, in order to maintain a stable placement.

Recent Findings: The scale of mental health problems among <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care</b> is exceptional for a nonclinical population, approaching that of clinic-referred <b>children.</b> <b>Children</b> <b>in</b> residential <b>care</b> have more mental health problems than those <b>in</b> family-type foster <b>care,</b> while those <b>in</b> kinship <b>care</b> have fewer problems. Children manifest complex psychopathology, characterized by attachment difficulties, relationship insecurity, sexual behaviour, trauma-related anxiety, conduct problems, defiance, inattention/hyperactivity, and less common problems such as self-injury and food maintenance behaviours. Summary: <b>Children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care</b> have complex symptomatology that is not well represented in present classification systems. There {{is a need for}} research into the characteristics and meaning of these complex presentations, and some re-appraisal of present taxonomies. Clinicians should consider these difficulties in their entirety, rather than as discrete disorders. It is recommended that assessment and intervention are provided by clinical teams that have specialist knowledge of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>care,</b> and that use an ecological approach to assessment...|$|R
