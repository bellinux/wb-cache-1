50|$|In the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, {{the cost of}} long {{distance}} calling decreased and more business communications were conducted by telephone. As corporations grew and labor rates increased, the ratio of secretaries to employees decreased. With multiple time zones, fewer secretaries and more communication by phone, real-time phone communications were hampered by callers being unable to reach people. Some early studies showed that only 1 in 4 phone calls resulted in a <b>completed</b> <b>call</b> and half the calls were one-way in nature (that is, they did not require a conversation). This happened because people were either not at work (due to time zone differences, being away on business, etc.), or if they were at work, {{they were on the}} phone, away from their desks in meetings, on breaks, etc. This bottleneck hindered the effectiveness of business activities and decreased both individual and group productivity. It also wasted the caller's time and created delays in resolving time-critical issues.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Several low {{earth orbit}} (LEO) {{satellite}} constellations have been proposed for mobile satellite systems (MSS’s). Due to nonstationary coverage regions of individual LEO satellites, the offered traffic load for each cell varies continuously. The variation of the traffic load essentially requires dynamic channel assignment. Furthermore, extremely frequent handover requests require specific techniques that prioritize the service of handover requests. In this paper, we suggest a new dynamic channel assignment (DCA) scheme which eliminates forced call terminations due to handover failure (call dropping). This scheme utilizes frequency spectrum efficiently, and can also provide users a high-quality premium service that guarantees the success of each handover procedure, called guaranteed handover service. This is based on position measurement. Finally, we compare our algorithm with some other DCA algorithms by computational experiments. The results of experiments show that our algorithm provides systems higher throughput (higher <b>completed</b> <b>call</b> ratio) as well as guaranteed handovers...|$|E

40|$|Aspect-oriented {{programming}} (AOP) eases {{the development}} of profilers, debuggers, and reverse engineering tools. Such tools fre-quently rely on calling context information.
