5000|$|<b>Ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> moves mucus {{and other}} {{substances}} via cilia and {{is found in}} the upper respiratory tract, the Fallopian tubes, the uterus, and {{the central part of the}} spinal cord.They are the primary target of infection for [...] "common cold viruses" [...] such as coronaviruses, influenza virus and rhinoviruses. These viruses may kill the ciliated cells or stop the cilia beating. In either case, mucus builds up and forms a good site for secondary bacterial infections, resulting in mucus. A <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> lines the lumen of the uterine tube, where currents generated by the cilia propel the egg cell toward the uterus.|$|E
50|$|The {{cartilage}} and {{mucous membrane}} {{of the primary}} bronchi {{are similar to those}} in the trachea. They are lined with respiratory epithelium, which is classified as <b>ciliated</b> pseudostratified <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> The epithelium in the main bronchi contains goblet cells, which are glandular, modified simple columnar epithelial cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. Mucus {{plays an important role in}} keeping the airways clear in the mucociliary clearance process. As branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases until it is absent in the bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a transition from <b>ciliated</b> pseudostratified <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> to simple cuboidal epithelium to simple squamous epithelium.|$|R

5000|$|The {{respiratory}} epithelium {{lining the}} upper respiratory airways {{is classified as}} <b>ciliated</b> pseudostratified <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> This designation {{is due to the}} arrangement of the multiple cell types composing the respiratory epithelium. While all cells make contact with the basement membrane and are, therefore, a single layer of cells, the nuclei are not aligned in the same plane. Hence, it appears as though several layers of cells are present and the epithelium is called pseudostratified.|$|R
50|$|The thyroglossal tract {{arises from}} the foramen cecum at the {{junction}} of the anterior two-thirds and posterior one-third of the tongue. Any part of the tract can persist, causing a sinus, fistula or cyst. Most fistulae are acquired following rupture or incision of the infected thyroglossal cyst. A thyroglossal cyst is lined by pseudostratified, <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> while a thyroglossal fistula is lined by columnar epithelium.|$|E
50|$|In females, the paramesonephric ducts {{give rise}} to the uterine tubes, uterus, and upper portion of the vagina, while the mesonephric ducts {{degenerate}} due {{to the absence of}} male androgens. In contrast, the paramesonephric ducts begin to proliferate and differentiate in a cranial-caudal progression to form the aforementioned structures. During this time, the single-layered paramesonephric duct epithelium differentiates into other structures, ranging from the <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> in the uterine tube to stratified squamous epithelium in the vagina.|$|E

50|$|The {{respiratory}} tract {{is covered in}} epithelium, which varies down the tract. There are glands and mucus produced by goblet cells in parts, as well as smooth muscle, elastin or cartilage. Most of the epithelium (from the nose to the bronchi) is covered in <b>ciliated</b> pseudostratified <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> commonly called respiratory epithelium. The cilia beat in one direction, moving mucus towards the throat where it is swallowed. Moving down the bronchioles, the cells get more cuboidal in shape but are still ciliated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{respiratory}} segment comprises most of each nasal fossa and {{is lined}} with <b>ciliated</b> pseudostratified <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> (also called respiratory epithelium). The conchae, or turbinates, are located in this region. The turbinates have a very vascularized lamina propria (erectile tissue) allowing the venous plexuses of their mucosa to engorge with blood, restricting airflow and causing air to be directed {{to the other side}} of the nose, which acts in concert by shunting blood out of its turbinates. This cycle occurs approximately every two and a half hours.|$|R
50|$|Turbinates are {{composed}} of pseudostratified <b>columnar,</b> <b>ciliated</b> respiratory <b>epithelium</b> with a thick, vascular, and erectile glandular tissue layer. The turbinates are located laterally in the nasal cavities, curling medially and downward into the nasal airway.

5000|$|Analogous to neural glial cells, the {{supporting}} cells are non-neural {{cells in the}} olfactory epithelium that {{are located in the}} apical layer of the pseudostratified <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> There are two types of supporting cells in the olfactory epithelium: sustentacular cells and microvillar cells. The sustentacular cells function as metabolic and physical support for the olfactory epithelium. Microvillar cells are another class of supporting cells that are morphologically and biochemically distinct from the sustentacular cells, and arise from a basal cell population that expresses c-Kit.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the {{cervical}} and thoracic regions {{the central}} canal {{is situated in}} the anterior third of the spinal cord; in the lumbar enlargement it is near the middle, and in the conus medullaris it approaches the posterior surface. It is filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and lined by <b>ciliated,</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> outside of which is an encircling band of gelatinous substance, the substantia gelatinosa centralis (or central gelatinous substance of spinal cord). This gelatinous substance consists mainly of neuroglia, but contains a few nerve cells and fibers; it is traversed by processes from the deep ends of the columnar ciliated cells which line the central canal.|$|E
50|$|Tube-like uterine glands, lined by <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> {{are found}} in the {{functional}} layer of the uterine endometrium. Their appearance varies during the menstrual cycle. During the proliferative phase, uterine glands appear long due to estrogen secretion by the ovaries. During the secretory phase, the uterine glands become very coiled with wide lumens and produce a glycogen-rich secretion. This change corresponds with an increase in blood flow to spiral arteries due to increased progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum. During the pre-menstrual phase, progesterone secretion decreases as the corpus luteum degenerates, which results in decreased blood flow to the spiral arteries. The functional layer of the uterus containing the glands becomes necrotic, and eventually sloughs off during the menstrual phase of the cycle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{present report}} {{describes}} an extrathoracic bronchogenic cyst in a 30 -day-old female calf. Histologically, the cyst wall was lined by {{a layer of}} <b>ciliated</b> pseudostratified <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> with peripheral arrangement of cartilage, glands, and smooth muscle fascicles. The mass was successfully removed by simple surgical excision. Key words: Bronchogenic cysts; cattle; congenital malformation; histopathologic analysis. Bronchogenic cysts are congenital cystic lesions resulting from the abnormal development of the tracheobronchial system during the embryonic period. 4 Bronchogenic cysts can be intrathoracic or extrathoracic. There are many clinical and pathologic studies of bronchogenic cysts in humans. Intrathoracic cysts usually present in the medias-tinum and lung parenchyma. 4 Extrathoracic cysts char-acteristically present with asymptomatic neck mass, often located in the anterior neck just above the sternal notch. ...|$|R

40|$|Este estudo teve por finalidade descrever o oviduto de codornas. Foram utilizadas 20 codornas na fase reprodutiva. Avaliaram-se os comprimentos do infundíbulo, do magno, do istmo, do útero, da vagina e o número de pregas no magno e no istmo. Para o estudo histológico, coletaram-se fragmentos do oviduto, os quais foram fixados em Bouin, destinados à rotina histológica e corados pela técnica de Hematoxilina-Eosina. O infundíbulo apresentou pregas longitudinais e oblíquas, revestidas por epitélio pseudo estratificado cilíndrico ciliado não-secretor, cranialmente, e secretor, caudalmente. O magno é o componente mais longo (15, 2 cm), com mucosa revestida por epitélio pseudo estratificado cilíndrico ciliado com células caliciformes. O istmo é um segmento curto, com pregas reduzidas, compostas por estruturas histológicas semelhantes ao magno. O útero é uma região de parede pregueada, com glândulas tubulares enoveladas. A vagina é um estreito tubo com musculatura espessa. O oviduto da codorna apresentou sua morfologia semelhante ao dos galiniformes, como a galinha e a perua.

50|$|Metaplasia {{occurs when}} a {{differentiated}} cell of a certain type is replaced by another cell type, which may be less differentiated. It is a reversible process thought {{to be caused by}} stem cell reprogramming. Stem cells are found in epithelia and embryonic mesenchyme of connective tissue. A prominent example of metaplasia involves the changes associated with the respiratory tract in response to inhalation of irritants, such as smog or smoke. The bronchial cells convert from mucus-secreting, <b>ciliated,</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> to non-ciliated, squamous epithelium incapable of secreting mucus. These transformed cells may become dysplasic or cancerous if the stimulus (e.g., cigarette smoking) is not removed. The most common example of metaplasia is Barrett's esophagus, when the non-keratinizing squamous epithelium of the esophagus undergoes metaplasia to become mucinous columnar cells, ultimately protecting the esophagus from acid reflux originating in the stomach. If stress persists, metaplasia can progress to dysplasia and eventually carcinoma; Barrett's esophagus, for example, can eventually progress to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus if not treated.|$|E
5000|$|The primary bronchi, in each lung, {{which are}} {{the left and right}} bronchus, give rise to {{secondary}} bronchi. These in turn give rise to tertiary bronchi (tertiary meaning [...] "third"). The tertiary bronchi subdivide into the bronchioles. They are histologically distinct from the tertiary bronchi in that their walls do not have hyaline cartilage and they have club cells in their epithelial lining. The epithelium starts as a simple <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support. The inner lining (lamina propria) of these bronchioles is thin with no glands present, and is surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle. As the bronchioles get smaller they divide into terminal bronchioles. These bronchioles mark the end of the conducting zone, which covers the first division through the sixteenth division of the respiratory tract. Alveoli only become present when the conducting zone changes to the respiratory zone, from the sixteenth through the twenty-third division of the tract.|$|E
30|$|However, the {{morphological}} analysis of choana of these bird species {{suggests that the}} ability of movement of upper jaw relative to skull (cranial kinesis) affects the type of epithelium that lining the choana. The choana of kestrel and hoopoe is lined by pseudostratified <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> This type of epithelium usually placed within the nasal passages of birds (Bang & Wenzel, 1995) and some part of respiratory system of other animals (Junqueira & Carneiro, 1980) formed the mucosa of the olfactory and respiratory tracts. The presence of pseudostratified <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> within the choana in all studied bird species may help in increasing the efficiency of smell in these bird species. In addition, in the common moorhen, there is another type of epithelium beside the pseudostratified <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> transitional epithelium type which lining the dorso-medial surface of choana. This surface of choana is more exposed to the mechanical forces during the movement of upper jaw explaining {{the presence of this}} type of epithelium in this region. The transitional epithelium has stretching ability during exposure to any pressure, if it is external (food items) or internal (mechanical performance of the feeding apparatus) pressure.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of cells composing the <b>ciliated</b> pseudostratified <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium</b> are of three types: a) ciliated cells, b) goblet cells, and c) basal cells. The <b>ciliated</b> cells are <b>columnar</b> epithelial cells with specialized ciliary modifications. Goblet cells, {{so named because}} they are shaped like a wine goblet, are columnar epithelial cells that contain membrane-bound mucous granules and secrete mucus, or epithelial lining fluid (ELF), the composition of which is tightly regulated; the mucus helps maintain epithelial moisture and traps particulate material and pathogens moving through the airway. and determines how well mucociliary clearance works. The basal cells are small, nearly cuboidal cells thought to have some ability to differentiate into other cells types found within the epithelium. For example, these basal cells respond to injury of the airway epithelium, migrating to cover a site denuded of differentiated epithelial cells, and subsequently differentiating to restore a healthy epithelial cell layer.|$|R

The Wolffian body operates as a kidney (mesonephros) in fishes and amphibians, but the corresponding tissue is co-opted to form parts of the male reproductive system in other classes of vertebrate. The paradidymis represents a remnant of an unused, atrophied part of the Wolffian body.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} {{discusses}} {{the adaptation of}} choana to cranial kinesis during feeding process in different bird species: kestrel, common moorhen, and hoopoe. Kestrel possesses a kinetic skull while the hoopoe and common moorhen have kinetic one; however, the common moorhen skull seems highly kinetic more {{than that of the}} hoopoe that properly effect on the choanal epithelium. The choana of kestrel and hoopoe are lined by pseudostratified <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium,</b> while choana of common moorhen have transitional epithelium beside pseudostratified <b>ciliated</b> <b>columnar</b> <b>epithelium.</b> The choana epithelium of each bird species provides with simple alveolar glands and numerous goblet cells.
