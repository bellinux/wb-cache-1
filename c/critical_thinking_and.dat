5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the former's library at home, {{while at the same}} time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.|$|E

40|$|PhD, Education, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in an attempt}} to determine the degree to which second year Mathematics education students consider <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes to be important and to develop a curriculum-based mediational approach based on the data, to encourage the <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes that appeared to be in need of encouragement. A literature study was undertaken to determine the positive <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes students should possess. In addition it was also determined which teaching learning approaches will benefit the development of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes the most. The advantages as well as the processes and components that should form part of the mediational approach for the development of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions were examined. A two-phase, sequential, explanatory mixed method study was subsequently undertaken with second-year Mathematics students at a South African university. The quantitative study made use of a self-developed questionnaire to determine the degree to which students consider <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes important. Data emanating from the questionnaires were analysed and questions that had to be answered in narrative format were set for each student according to their own responses on the questionnaire. Narratives formed part of the qualitative component of the study in which students had to indicate factors that influence their <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes, what could be done to improve the apparent unimportant <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes and whether they regard the <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes as important. Narratives were analysed and the results were used to explain the quantitative data. Results revealed that second year Mathematics education students do not consider <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes, in particular inquisitiveness but also judiciousness, open-mindedness, systematicity, truth-seeking, analyticity <b>and</b> confidence in <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> to be very important <b>and</b> therefore these <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes appeared to require encouragement. A curriculum-based mediational approach based on a section in the existing Mathematics module for second year education students was developed in order to encourage <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions in Mathematics. The study concluded with recommendations to encourage <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> dispositions <b>and</b> attitudes as well as proposals for future studies. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>thinking</b> is an {{essential}} component of baccalaureate nursing education today. Nursing programs are required to provide evidence that graduating students possess essential <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills. Consequently, educators are increasingly challenged to promote strategies that develop the <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> dispositions of students.

A convenience sample comprised of 125 nursing students enrolled in a baccalaureate nursing program at one public university in the Midwestern United States will be utilized.

40|$|The {{education}} quality improvement can be attained when {{teaching and learning}} processes carried out are really effective and useful. The teacher {{is one of the}} important factors in determining whether or not teaching and learning processes are successful. One of the creative and innovative steps in learning is the application or selection of an appropriate learning method. The application or selection of an appropriate learning method by the teacher is expected to improve students’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> learning achievements. This study aims to investigate whether or not there were effects of the Problem Based Learning and Active Debate methods on the students’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> Social Studies learning achievements. The success of learning through the application of the Problem Based Learning method can affect students’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skils <b>and</b> their learning achievements will improve. The application of the Active Debate method in Social Studies learning can effectively build students’ <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills <b>and</b> learning achievements.
