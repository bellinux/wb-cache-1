40|$|The sole {{reliance}} on wild <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrimps</b> {{to meet the}} increasing Nigerian demand can cause {{a number of problems}} including over fishing, destruction of shrimp fishery increased by catch problem and habitat destruction. Fresh water shrimps (Prawn) of the genus Macrobrachium is found in West African waters and is widely distributed in Nigerian waters. These shrimps are more manageable than their marine relatives. Coastland is expensive, and there are usually many legal constraints on the use of coastland. Also, construction costs are higher in coastal areas and Penaeid shrimp farms sited at the coastland destroys the rich mangrove swamp ecosystem. Freshwater shrimp farms are sited inland and are not associated with the afore mentioned problems. The culture of freshwater shrimps, which is well developed in Asian countries and America, is still at the infant stage in Nigeria. One of the factors limiting the development of this industry is lack of technical knowledge. This paper presents the methods employed for semi- intensive monoculture of freshwater shrimps. With the adoption of the method and recommendations presented in this paper, freshwater shrimp culture in Nigeria will make headway. This will lessen the fishing effort on the wild stock, provide employment opportunities, alleviate under-nutrition and poverty, enhance rural livelihoods and contribute to our foreign exchange earnings. It was recommended that more researches and pilot projects be done on the culture of these shrimps using our indigenous species. The economic viability of culturing these shrimps should be investigated and research on the hatchery production of their post larvae should be intensified...|$|E

40|$|Thesis(M. M. A.) [...] University of Washington, 1992 Most fisheries, marine or freshwater, {{commercial}} or recreational, catch other species {{in addition to}} the desired, or target, species. The <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> these additional species is termed incidental catch, or bycatch. Fishery bycatch is made up of a variety of animals, from cetaceans to seabirds to unmarketable fishes. Economic and fishery management considerations may cause the fisherman to keep the bycatch species for its commercial value, or, conversely, may require the bycatch be returned to the sea. In some fisheries, bycatch is retained because of its value in relation to the rest <b>of</b> the <b>catch.</b> For example, the target species may comprise only a small part <b>of</b> the <b>catch,</b> placing a reliance on the bycatch to provide a significant contribution to the overall revenue generated. In tropical fisheries for <b>shrimp,</b> the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrimp</b> is usually 10 percent or less of the total, whereas the bycatch of finfish and other species, which are large in size and commercially valuable, are the principle component <b>of</b> the <b>catch</b> (Gulland 1983). In many fisheries, bycatch is discarded due to economic or management reasons. The lack of a market or suitable ex-vessel price may force discarding the bycatch. Such {{was the case with the}} bycatch of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in the gillnet and trap fishery for Columbia River salmon prior to commercial exploitation in the early 1880 s (Bricklemeyer et al. 1989).

40|$|Bycatch, or the {{incidental}} <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> nontarget organisms during fi shing operations, is a {{major issue}} in U. S. shrimp trawl fisheries. Because bycatch is typically discarded at sea, total bycatch is usually estimated by extrapolating from an observed bycatch sample to the entire fleet with either mean-per-unit or ratio estimators. Using both field observations <b>of</b> commercial <b>shrimp</b> trawlers and computer simulations, I compared five methods for generating bycatch estimates that were used in past studies, a mean-per-unit estimator and four forms of the ratio estimator, respectively: 1) the mean fish <b>catch</b> per unit <b>of</b> effort, where unit effort was a proxy for sample size, 2) the mean of the individual fish to shrimp ratios, 3) the ratio <b>of</b> mean fish <b>catch</b> to mean shrimp catch, 4) the mean of the ratios <b>of</b> fish <b>catch</b> per time fished (a variable measure of effort), and 5) the ratio <b>of</b> mean fish <b>catch</b> per mean time fished. For field data, different methods used to estimate bycatch of Atlantic croaker, spot, and weakfish yielded extremely different results, with no discernible pattern in the estimates by method, geographic region, or species. Simulated fishing fleets were used to compare bycatch estimated by the fi ve methods with “actual” (simulated) bycatch. Simulations were conducted by using both normal and delta lognormal distributions <b>of</b> fish and <b>shrimp</b> and employed a range of values for several parameters, including mean <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> fish and <b>shrimp,</b> variability in the <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> fish and <b>shrimp,</b> variability in fishing effort, number of observations, and correlations between fish and shrimp catches. Results indicated that only the mean per unit estimators provided statistically unbiased estimates, while all other methods overestimated bycatch. The mean of the individual fish to shrimp ratios, the method used in the South Atlantic Bight before the 1990 s, gave the most biased estimates. Because of the statistically significant two- and 3 -way interactions among parameters, it is unlikely that estimates generated by one method can be converted or corrected to estimates made by another method: therefore bycatch estimates obtained with different methods should not be compared directly...|$|R

Two experimental studies, conducted for this thesis, evaluated the <b>catch</b> characteristics <b>of</b> innovative, modified fishing gears designed to mitigate ecological concerns specific to each study’s respective fishery. In the first study, the Newfoundland cod pot was modified in an attempt to target flatfish species while avoiding the capture of snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio). Major findings include the importance of artificial light and entrance shape in capturing American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). Also, non-baited pots that contained only artificial light were successful in capturing plaice while greatly reducing the capture of snow crab. In the second study, at-sea <b>catch</b> characteristics <b>of</b> northern <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus borealis) and non-targeted bycatch species were compared between two trawls, one containing a traditional rockhopper ground gear currently used in the northern shrimp fishery, the other containing an experimental ground gear designed to reduce seabed contact. Catch rates and size <b>of</b> <b>shrimp</b> were found to be comparable between trawls however the experimental trawl captured significantly more bycatch...|$|R
40|$|To obtain sone foundmental {{information}} on the phase of fishery in Shibushi Bay, some investigations were made into the small-trawl fishery, {{one of the most}} important fisheries in Shibushi Bay. Auther examined the catch, its composition and its fishery-ground. 1. In the composition <b>of</b> <b>catch,</b> <b>shrimp</b> is conspicuous in autumn and squid is remarkably conspicuous in winter. 2. It was ascertained that the concentration of fishery was not confined to a specific area but was transferred to a few areas with an interval of short period. This seemed to be caused by the impossibility to carrt on a specific area. 3. Productivity in the offshore area was more stable than that in the coastal area. The coastal area seemed to be anursery ground of marine animals living in Shibushi Bay.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss rules for {{deciding}} Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for Icelandic cod. For this purpose, a bioeconomic model describing harvesting and processing of cod, capelin, and shrimp in the Icelandic marine ecosystem is constructed and estimated. The model is used to analyze the probable effects of harvesting strategies on biomass, catch, and economic benefits from the exploitation of these species. Simulations are used to investigate probability profiles of biological and economic variables, taking into account inaccuracies in assessments and uncertainties in predictions. Optimal harvesting strategies are also investigated using a deterministic version of the model and taking into account problems of unemployment, overcapacity, and aversion to fluctuations in consumption. The analysis shows that it is beneficial to reduce fishing from the cod stock in order to allow the stock to recover to its optimum size. This increase in the cod stock will result in big decreases in the <b>catch</b> <b>of</b> capelin and <b>shrimp.</b> Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
