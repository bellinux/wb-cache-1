Getting cows in calf has always been a concern for dairy farmers. The term "close to profit" describing a cow as being <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> and earning an income sums up the need to get cows "in-calf". Maximising the number of cows in calf or pregnant also maximises farmers opportunity to cull cows for other less desirable traits. In recent years there has been much concern about the supposed increasing rate of empty cows, with reports of empty cows reaching 20 - 25 % in some herds. This issue is addressed in this report with consideration focusing on genetics, feeding and stock management. Reference is made to survey conducted enquiring upon farmers mating management practises (refer appendix one). There were 53 respondents to this survey...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring the {{locomotion}} and posture behaviour {{of pregnant}} cows <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> {{is essential in}} determining {{if there is a}} need for human intervention to assist parturition. In this study an automatic real-time monitoring technique is described in detail which allows identifying the locomotion and posturing behaviour of pregnant cows prior to calving. For this purpose video surveillance images of eight cows for the last 24 h prior to their calving were analysed. Data on seven different variables with time were obtained for each cow using an automatic real-time monitor. These were namely: x-y coordinates of the geometrical top view Centre point of the cow; walking trajectory; distance walked; orientation of the main axis; body width/length ratio; hip length and back area. These variables were then used to classify specific behaviours such as standing or lying (including incidences of motion during lying), and eating or drinking. On average 85 % of the standing and lying and 87 % of the eating or drinking behaviour of the eight cows during the last 24 h before calving could be correctly classified. However, the developed technique needs to be further validated with additional tests in the field. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Determination of plasma {{concentrations}} of pregnancy associated glycoproteins (PAG) {{has been used}} for early pregnancy diagnosis in cows. However, this is complicated by the presence of PAG in plasma for an extended period postpartum. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the postpartum elimination rates of pregnancy associated glycoproteins (PAG) in sheep, goats and cows in order to gain background information applicable to the use of PAG for pregnancy diagnosis in domestic ruminants. A second objective was to investigate whether PAG are transferred to the foetus and newborn, by measuring plasma PAG concentrations in calves, lambs and goat kids before and after colostrum feeding. PAG in the blood at parturition were eliminated by a first order process in the cows and ewes, while a two-step log-linear decline occurred in the goats. Estimated postpartum half-life of plasma PAG in the cows and ewes was 9 and 4. 5 days, respectively. In the goats, half-lives were 3. 6 and 7. 5 days in the initial fast and terminal slow phase. Basal levels were reached 80 - 90 days postpartum in cows. Plasma PAG concentration can be used for pregnancy diagnosis from day 28 after AI, provided that the time interval from <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> AI is > 60 days. Using a heterologous antibody RIA, we found 4 ng/mL to be the appropriate cut-off. Due to the presence of PAG residues from the previous gestation, the interval from AI to pregnancy diagnosis should increase by approximately 0. 5 days beyond 28 days for each day of AI <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> than 60. Measurements in newborn ruminants suggested that PAG enter the foetal blood in utero and that colostral PAG are transferred to the newborn. Following the peak plasma concentration observed 1 day after birth in most of the animals, PAG were rapidly eliminated in a log-linear fashion. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In herd A, heifers were introduced into existing groups of cows 2 – 4 weeks prior to calving. They were kept in a group housing system with deep bedding. All animals were hornless. In herd B, heifers were kept separated from the cows from 2 – 4 weeks a. p. in a three-row cubicle barn. In contrast to herd A, all animals had horns. The animals´ reactions regarding the milking process and MED were analysed during the first four milkings p. p. We evaluated the correlation between social rank, group size and frequency of group changes in the antepartal period and the occurrence of MED. 12 % of the animals in herd A and 47 % of the animals in herd B showed MED. In herd A, lowranking heifers had significantly more often MED than higher-ranking heifers. A correlation between low rank, increasing strain due to rank order fights and increasing frequency of MED can be assumed here. In herd B, a correlation between stocking rate and frequency of MED could be observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of today’s dairy has increased {{due to the}} growing number of cows per herd and the production of pounds of milk per cow. Increased milk production however has resulted in a reduction of conception rates causing a loss of income for the dairy producer since the dairy industry relies heavily on milk production, which is caused by good conception rates. Many reproductive disorders like dystocia, metritis, endometritis, and retained placenta affect conception rates, and can lead to metabolic diseases like rumen acidosis, milk fever, and displaced abomasums. Recurrent metabolic diseases can eventually lead to culling of the herd. Many of these metabolic disorders can be the cause of poor nutrition and management during the close-up period and after parturition. Cows in the close-up pen undergo many stressors such as temperature fluxuations, overcrowding, moving from pens, changes in ration, decreased dry matter intake, or metabolic disease which causes cortisol to be released from the adrenal gland. Cortisol suppresses the immune system making the animal more susceptible to metabolic and reproductive diseases that can overall impact production. Cortisol levels are also increased by low blood calcium during the close-up period. Overall, it is the dairy producer’s responsibility to have a sufficient management program in place to treat and prevent the reproductive and metabolic diseases of the herd in order to optimize maximum productivity. The management program should work closely with a nutritionist in order to supply an appropriate feeding program for the transition cow when she is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> and after parturition. It is also crucial for the dairy producer to implement a disease treatment and prevention program with their veterinarian and herd managers...|$|E
40|$|Pro-inflammatory cytokines (PIC: IL- 1, IL- 6 and TNF-) raise body temperature, induce anorexia, {{increase}} catabolism {{and cause}} several endocrine and metabolic changes. PIC play key {{roles in the}} regulation of acute phase response (APR). However, in transition cows the relation between inflammation and health conditions and the link between PIC, inflammation start, APR, liver function and metabolic state need to be further investigated. Therefore, 10 multiparous cows were studied 4 wk before and after calving. Cows were daily monitored for health status, feed intake (DMI), milk yield, rectal temperature; body weight and BCS were measured every 2 wk. Blood was also frequently sampled and assayed for a wide metabolic and inflammatory (including IL- 1 and IL- 6; ELISA methods) profile. One cow died 3 days after calving and was evaluated separately. The remaining 9 were retrospectively classified into 2 groups according to IL- 6 plasma values peak: less (LOIL, 6 cows) or greater (UP-IL, 3 cows) than 650 pg/ml. Data were analyzed by the MIXED repeated procedure of SAS. Generally, IL- 1 and IL- 6 were already higher 2 - 4 wk before calving, in absence of clinical symptoms. The died cow had {{the highest levels of}} IL- 6 (2000 pg/ml). Both PIC tend to decrease thereafter, showing a short-lived increase at parturition. A rise of PIC was also noted in association with clinical events <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving,</b> while very low levels were observed in cows with mild ketosis. UP-IL cows suffered more severe diseases (e. g. mastitis), had lower DMI before calving, lost more body reserves and produced less milk. Moreover, UPIL (vs LO-IL) cows showed higher haptoglobin, bilirubin and urea and lower albumin and Zn levels in the wk before and after calving. Thus, high PIC values in dry period seem related to some subclinical events as confirmed by lower DMI as well as to critical metabolic and inflammatory conditions at calving time and thereafter (e. g. more severe diseases and APR) ...|$|E

Single-channel geophone data recorded over {{several months in}} 2009 and 2010 are combined with eleven days of direct visual observations of the glacier front. We apply a processing scheme which combines conventional seismic event detection using a sensitive trigger algorithm and unsupervised clustering of all detected signals based on their waveform characteristics by means of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). We are able to distinguish between false detections, instrumental artifacts, and three classes of signals which are, with different degrees of uncertainty, emitted by calving activity. About 10 % of the directly observed <b>calving</b> events <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the geophone (< 1 km) can be correlated with seismic detections. By extrapolating the interpretation of seismic event classes beyond the time period of visual observations, the temporal distribution of glacier-related events shows an increase in event rate in autumn, particularly for the class which is clearly related <b>to</b> iceberg <b>calving.</b> Using the seismic event distribution in this class {{as a proxy for}} the calving rate and measurements of glacier velocity and glacier front position, we discuss the relationship between glacier dynamics and calving processes. On the seasonal time-scale, the well-marked glacier acceleration in spring is not accompanied by an increase in calving related seismicity. With a slowdown in glacier velocity in autumn, however, a remarkable increase in calving related seismicity is observed. The rate of seismic events due <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> seems thus <b>to</b> behave rather independently from the actual glacier speed, suggesting a complex and indirect dynamical link between the two quantities...|$|R

Clarification concerning the viscous supply of ice <b>to</b> the <b>calving</b> front is sought following the empirical calving law of Alley and others (2008), derived from a similar but smaller dataset, and the scaling analysis of Hindmarsh (2012). The dataset is analysed and good agreement is observed between the expected theoretical scaling and geophysical data for the flow of ice near the calving front {{in the case of}} ice shelves that are laterally confined and have uniform rheology. The lateral confinement ensures flow is aligned in the along-shelf direction, and uniform rheological parameters mean resistance to flow is provided by near-stationary ice in the grounded margins.

40|$|In pasture-based systems, {{cows are}} {{generally}} thinner {{at the end}} of lactation than cows fed total mixed rations and, as a result, over-feeding of metabolizable energy (ME) during the far-off nonlactating period is a standard management policy <b>to</b> achieve optimum <b>calving</b> body condition score (BCS). An alternative would be to manage cows to gain BCS through late lactation, such that cows ended lactation <b>close</b> <b>to</b> optimum <b>calving</b> BCS and maintenance of BCS through <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> We sought <b>to</b> quantify the effect of moderate or excessive ME intakes during the far-off nonlactating period in cows that had been managed to gain or maintain BCS through late lactation and whether the far-off management strategy interacted with close-up level of feeding. Effects on milk production and circulating indicators of energy balance and metabolic health in early lactation were evaluated. A herd of 150 cows was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 feeding levels in late lactation to achieve a low and high BCS at the time of dry-off (approximately 4. 25 and 5. 0 on a 10 -point scale). Following dry-off, both herds were managed to achieve a BCS of 5. 0 one month before calving; this involved controlled feeding (i. e., maintenance) and over-feeding of ME during the far-off dry period. Within each far-off feeding-level treatment, cows were offered 65, 90, or 120 % of their pre-calving ME requirements for 3 wk pre-calving in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement (i. e., 25 cows/treatment). Body weight and BCS were measured weekly before and after calving, and milk production was measured weekly until wk 7 postcalving. Blood samples were collected weekly for 4 wk pre-calving and 5 wk postcalving, and on d 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 relative <b>to</b> <b>calving,</b> and analyzed for indicators of energy balance (e. g., blood fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate), calcium status, and inflammatory state. No interaction was observed between far-off and close-up feeding levels. Over-feeding of ME to low BCS cows during the far-off nonlactating period reduced blood fatty acid and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in early lactation, and increased blood albumin to globulin ratio compared with cows that were dried off <b>close</b> <b>to</b> recommended <b>calving</b> BCS and control-fed during the far-off dry period. Cows consuming 65 % of their ME requirements during the close-up period had lower fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in early lactation, but produced less milk, particularly during the first 21 d of lactation, had more than 3 -fold greater concentration of haptoglobin immediately postcalving, and had a lower blood cholesterol concentration and albumin to globulin ratio, when compared with cows offered 90 or 120 % of their ME requirements.

40|$|Welfare {{of animals}} in {{livestock}} houses is usually monitored manually by the farmer or ethologists by performing some standardized measures on chosen welfare indicators. Focusing on a single iceberg indicator {{is not sufficient to}} detect welfare by itself. On the other hand, a large set of measures need increased workload on manual observers or stockmen in order to provide a useful indication of an animals quality of life. The objective of this thesis was to show that mathematical modelling and control techniques applied on sensor data lead to more frequent monitoring of health and welfare related responses of livestock animals. Animal responses were monitored with increasing frequency of data sampling, from manual observation once in a growth period to automatic capturing of one data point per second. It was aimed to prove that automated measurements give way to early warning systems as well as prediction of future conditions. In Chapter 2, the welfare of broiler chickens in terms of ease of locomotion was determined by experts going into poultry houses and assessing animals by an animal-based measure called gait score. Measurements were done manually by visual inspections at slaughter age. Assessing at the slaughter age was not an ideal way of monitoring animal welfare on farms. Therefore in chapter 3, measurements were done more frequently once per week during the growth period of the animals. In this chapter thermal comfort of broiler chickens were studied using measurements of a thermal camera. In Chapter 4, measurement frequency was increased to once per second in order to capture the dynamics of the variables under consideration. A camera system was used to detect locomotion and posture parameters of pregnant cows <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> A computer vision technique was developed to monitor the body variables of animals automatically. Images were acquired and analysed giving way to classify specific behaviours related to calving. In Chapter 5, real-time mathematical models were developed to describe the relation of the growth response of a broiler chicken to the feed intake. Weights of broiler chickens were measured by an automatic weighing scale with an increased measurement frequency of ten times per second. Feed intake was also measured continuously by a feeding system. The developed models enabled prediction of future weight responses of animals. In Chapter 6, responses of young chicks to temperature and ventilation changes were studied. Measurements were carried out once per second using a camera. It was shown that the mathematical modelling of dynamic responses not only enabled more frequent welfare assessment and anticipation but also could give an insight to the process of thermo-regulatory behaviour of broiler chicks. In Chapters 7 and 8, continuous weight response and feed intake of animals were used to develop a growth control procedure in an attempt to ensure that the chickens were following a desired growth trajectory. The idea behind was to test the control theory and also to explore the effects of early feed restriction on health, welfare and performance of broiler chickens. It was shown that active control of the growth of broiler chickens in commercial houses was possible. nrpages: 244 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Antarctica is {{surrounded}} by a variety of large, medium and small sized ice shelves, glacier tongues and coastal areas without offshore floating ice masses. We used the mosaic of the Radarsat- 1 Antarctica Mapping Project (RAMP) Antarctic Mapping Mission 1 (AMM) to classify the coastline of Antarctica in terms of surface structure patterns <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>calving</b> front. With the aid of an automated edge detection method, complemented by manual control, the surface structures of all ice shelves and glacier tongues around Antarctica were mapped. We found dense and less dense patterns of surface structures unevenly distributed over the ice shelves and ice tongues. Dense surface patterns are frequent on fast flowing ice masses (ice streams), whereas most ice shelves show a dense surface pattern only <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the grounding line. Flow line analyses on ten ice shelves reveal that the time of residence of the ice along a flow path and—associated with it—the healing of surface crevasses can explain the different surface structure distribution <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the grounding line and the calving front on many ice shelves.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and development of}} crevasses provides great insight into the overall dynamics of a calving glacier, in particular because the formation of crevasses reflects glacier stretching, the same process that leads <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> If a crevasse opens to the water-line then a calving event normally occurs. Thus outlining where and when crevasses form and how fast they open up, can be very important in detecting pre-conditions for calving events. Detecting crevasses from satellite imagery is an efficient way of tracking their movement, but manual techniques for identifying individual features and monitoring their evolution are time-consuming. In addition, most optical data is subject to inconsistent illumination due to time of day or season, long periods of darkness during winter, and cloud cover. High-resolution radar imagery provides an alternative that does not rely on illumination by the sun and is independent of weather constraints. This study uses a series of TerraSAR-X images of Tunabreen, a grounded calving glacier in Svalbard, taken between February 2013 and July 2014, to automatically detect and delineate crevasses <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>calving</b> front. Feature tracking techniques are {{used to measure the}} relative strain taken up by these crevasses in relation to the ‘inter-crevasse’ ice between them, as the glacier approaches the calving margin.

The model includes an improved daily temperature parameterization as compared with a previous version and is run at 1 km rather than 5 km resolution. The improvements lead overall to higher SMB with the same forcing data. We also compare our model with results from two regional climate models (RCMs). While there is good qualitative agreement between our PDD model and the RCMs, it usually results in lower precipitation and lower runoff but approximately equivalent SMB: mean 1979 – 2012 SMB (± standard deviation), in Gt a− 1, is 382 ± 78 in the PDD model, compared with 379 ± 101 and 425 ± 90 for the RCMs. Comparison with in situ SMB observations suggests that the RCMs may be more accurate than PDD at local level, in some areas, although the latter generally compares well.

During the Radarsat- 1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) Antarctic Mapping Mission- 1 (AMM- 1) a mosaic of Antarctica and the adjacent ocean zone was compiled from more than 3000 high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The mosaic offered the unique opportunity to determine spatial distributions of icebergs sizes along the entire coastline of Antarctica. A combination of automated iceberg detection and visual control as well as a correction of false detections resulted in identifying nearly 7000 icebergs with areas between 0. 3 and 4717. 7 km 2. Their spatial distribution showed correlations with coastline classes. These classes are based on the spatial distribution of surface features on ice shelves <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>calving</b> front.

The Nansen Ice Sheet (shelf) covers an area of about 1800 km 2.

The highest velocities are <b>to</b> be found <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the ice barrier where the ice shelf spreads out. Between 1972 and 1988 the ice barrier advanced causing an increase of the ice shelf of about 56 km 2 at an average rate of 3. 5 km 2 /yr. The surface velocity of the small Larsen Ice Tongue is comprised between 115 and 170 m/yr. The ice tongue surface increased about 19 km 2 over the period 1957 - 1988. Hells Gate is a small ice shelf more than 70 km 2 wide, extending between the Northern Foothills, Vegetation Island and Inexpressible Island.

However, the mechanisms controlling glacier-front location and the role played by external forcings (e. g., meltwater input and tidal oscillation) in basal motion and fracture formation leading <b>to</b> iceberg <b>calving</b> are poorly understood. Today it is known that glaciers generate seismic and infrasound signals that are detectable at local and teleseismic distances and can be used to monitor glacier dynamics. Here, we present examples of data recorded by a temporary network of seismic and infrasound instruments deployed at a tidewater glacier (Bowdoin Glacier, Greenland) in July 2015. Some stations were installed on ice at distances as close as ～ 250 m from the calving front, representing the <b>closest</b> deployments <b>to</b> the <b>calving</b> front that have been made to date.

Surface speeds reached up to 3. 2 m d − 1 near the calving front of Kronebreen in summer 2013 and 2. 7 m d − 1 at Kongsbreen in late autumn 2012. Additional velocity fields from Radarsat- 1, Radarsat- 2 and TerraSAR-X data since December 2007 together with continuous GPS measurements on Kronebreen since September 2008 revealed complex patterns in seasonal and interannual speed evolution. Part of the ice-flow variations seem {{closely linked to the}} amount and timing of surface meltwater production and rainfall, both of which are known to have a strong influence on the basal water pressure and hence basal lubrication.

In 2011 the retreat of Kronebreen of up to 850 m, responsible for a total area loss of 2. 8 km 2, was triggered after a phase of stable terminus position since ~ 1990. Retreat is {{an important component of the}} mass balance of both glaciers, in which frontal ablation is the largest component. Total frontal ablation between April 2012 and December 2013 was estimated to 0. 21 – 0. 25 Gt a − 1 for Kronebreen and 0. 14 – 0. 16 Gt a − 1 for Kongsbreen...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{intramammary}} infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, contagious major pathogens and environmental major pathogens in early lactating heifers were evaluated at the herd, heifer and quarter levels. In total, 764 quarters of 191 dairy heifers in 20 randomly selected farms in Flanders (Belgium) were sampled. Quarter milk {{samples were collected}} between 1 and 4 days in milk and between 5 and 8 days in milk for bacteriological culture. Data were analyzed using multivariable, multilevel logistic regression analysis. Higher average herd milk somatic cell count (> 200, 000 cells/mL), not having an effective fly control strategy, contact with lactating cows prior <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> and moderate <b>to</b> severe udder edema prior <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> increased the odds of intramammary infections caused by contagious major pathogens. Poor heifer hygiene and lack of mineral/vitamin supplementation prior <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> were risk factors for intramammary infection caused by environmental major pathogens. Teat apex colonization with coagulase-negative staphylococci prior <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> seemed <b>to</b> protect quarters against intramammary infections caused by major pathogens. Poor heifer hygiene before calving, a non-clipped udder and not practicing of teat dipping prior <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> increased the odds of intramammary infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci. Although management {{is important in the}} prevention and control of intramammary infections in early lactating heifers, most variation in the prevalence of intramammary infections resided at the heifer and quarter levels, indicating that the susceptibility for intramammary infections around calving is mainly determined by heifer and quarter characteristics...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the aim was}} to {{evaluate}} the presynch-ovsynch protocol on the intervals from <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> first insemination, <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> pregnancy, <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> in postpartum lactating cows. Lactating Holstein cows (n= 104, 3 - 5 years old, 450 - 500 kg BW, 27 ± 3 kg/day average milk yield) were enrolled in the study 26 - 41 days postpartum. Fifty of them were taken as the control group and 54 of them were the treated experimental group. The control group was not treated and the cows in estrus were inseminated. In the treated group the cows were injected with two PGF 2 α for presynchronization twice at every 14 days. Fourteen days after the second PGF 2 α, ovsynch protocol was initiated (GnRH, day 0; PGF 2 α, day 7; GnRH, day 9) and cows were inseminated 12 - 16 hours after second GnRH injection. Following AI, cows returning to estrus were inseminated at detected heat. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed by ultrasonography at 33 - 38 days after AI. <b>Calving</b> <b>to</b> first AI (days), <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> pregnancy (day), the number of AI per pregnancy, calving interval (days) for control cows were 96. 08 ± 8. 20, 147. 58 ± 9. 95, 2. 19 ± 0. 20 and 430. 50 ± 10. 90 and for the treated group 70. 13 ± 1. 13, 101. 76 ± 5. 70, 1. 85 ± 0. 12 and 386. 80 ± 5. 70, respectively. Compared to the control group, <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> first AI interval was shorter by 26 days, <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> pregnancy interval by 46 days and the calving interval by 44 days (p 0. 05). As a result, by using the presynch-ovsynch protocol, the need for estrus detection was eliminated and inseminations were performed at a fixed time. Therefore, <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> first AI, <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> pregnancy, <b>calving</b> intervals and the number of AI per pregnancy were improved to the benefit of the farm...|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{producers}} feed {{a variety}} of liquid feeds <b>to</b> young <b>calves</b> after the initial colostrum. These liquid feeds include surplus colostrum, whole milk, transition milk, waste or discard milk, and milk replacer. Waste or discard milk is milk that can-not be sold for human consumption because it comes from cows treated with antibiotics for mastitis or other illnesses. Discarded milk losses range from 48 to 136 pounds of milk per cow per year. To reduce some of the economic loss, 38 % of dairy producers feed waste milk <b>to</b> <b>calves.</b> Many dairy producers avoid feeding waste milk <b>to</b> <b>calves</b> for fear of increasing calf morbidity or increasing the incidence of heifers calving with mastitis or blind quarters.
