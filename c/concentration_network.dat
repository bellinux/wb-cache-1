40|$|The Abacus switch [1] we {{proposed}} has size limitation due {{to excessive}} routing {{delay in the}} switch fabric. Here, we suggest three different approaches to increase {{the capacity of the}} Abacus switch to, for instance, 1 Tb/s with existing CMOS technology. The first approach uses a memoryless multi-stage <b>concentration</b> <b>network</b> (MMCN), which reduces the routing delay and increases the capacity of the Abacus switch. The second approach uses a buffered multistage <b>concentration</b> <b>network</b> (BMCN), which uses a funnel concept and an input-buffered concentration modules (CMs) to relax the memory speed constraint. A new priority assignment scheme is proposed for the input-buffered CM to maintain the cell sequence of a virtual connection. The third approach allows the arbitration cycle exceeding a cell slot and thus resequences cells at the output ports. It is proved that the maximum degree of out-of-sequence is bounded in the worst case...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the process parameters of the Biosphere Energy Transfer HYdrology (BETHY) model to choices of atmospheric <b>concentration</b> <b>network,</b> high frequency terrestrial fluxes, and the choice of flux measurement network is investigated by using a carbon cycle data assimilation system. We use BETHY-generated fluxes as a proxy of flux measurements. Results show that monthly mean or low-frequency observations of CO 2 concentration provide strong constraints on parameters relevant for net flux (NEP) but only weak constraints for parameters controlling gross fluxes. The use of high-frequency CO 2 concentration observations, {{which has led to}} great refinement of spatial scales in inversions of net flux, adds little to the observing system in the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) case. This unexpected result is {{explained by the fact that}} the stations of the CO 2 <b>concentration</b> <b>network</b> we use are not well placed to measure such high frequency signals. Indeed, CO 2 concentration sensitivities relevant for such high frequency fluxes are found to be largely confined in the vicinity of the corresponding fluxes, and are therefore not well observed by background monitoring stations. In contrast, our results clearly show the potential of flux measurements to better constrain the model parameters relevant for gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP). Given uncertainties in the spatial description of ecosystem functions, we recommend a combined observing strategy...|$|E

The policy of mobile phone number portability reduced on-net prices and substantially increased consumer's surplus. In contrast to some previous research, this policy was pro-competitive in Serbia. We have also determined that users of the network with the largest market share benefit the most from call externalities. Finally, one network does not price discriminate between outgoing and incoming roaming calls, which implies that users of this network have higher level pecuniary externalities in roaming compared to users of price discriminating networks...|$|E

The ATM transport network is an economical way of providing the ATM public network and a virtual path service for enterprise users. This paper exemplifies {{the effectiveness of a}} VP grooming function in the ATM transport system by comparing it to the network costs with direct fiber connection, an alternative to VP grooming. Main and junction module architecture for the ATM cross-connect system is proposed to realize an economical network that supports small to large traffic.

40|$|Abstract — A high {{performance}} packet switching archi-tecture called the Pipeback switch is proposed. This archi-tecture ensures lossless packet delivery while maintaining linear buffer complexity. The Pipeback switch improves upon the popular Knockout switch proposed by Y. Yeh et al. Both switches use an N × N space division fabric with output queuing and both designs {{are motivated by}} the observation that the probability of more than L packets arriving in a given timeslot being destined for one partic-ular output port sharply decreases as L is increased. This probability {{is comparable to the}} packet loss probability due to transmission errors for L N. While the arrival of more than L packets destined for a single output in a single timeslot in the Knockout switch results in dropped packets due to buffer blocking, the Pipeback switch avoids such loss by maintaining a separate shared buffer architecture common to all the output ports. This common architecture consists of a novel Pipeback <b>concentration</b> <b>network</b> and a buffer pool. The buffer pool accommodates all the knocked out packets that the Knockout switch would have dropped as a result of buffer blocking, and pipes them back to a separate input line. We further show that the use of buffer pool leads to a {{reduction in the number of}} separate output buffers required at each output port. I...|$|E

We consider the Brazilian air transport industry of the 2000 s, in which <b>network</b> <b>concentration</b> rapidly increased and {{was followed by a}} period of massive flight delays and cancelations, which resulted in the “big blackout” of 2006 – 2007. We develop an econometric model of <b>network</b> <b>concentration,</b> accounting for demand, cost and competition variables that may affect the propensity of carriers to concentrate flights and passenger connections on a few airports of a network. The main focus of the paper is on the relation between networks leading to the problems of the blackout episode. We investigate the dynamic pattern of the evolution of concentration before and after the abnormal period of operations and find that concentration began to rise at least six quarters before, and persisted at a high level until two quarters after the blackout – and then plunged steeply {{toward the end of the}} decade.

40|$|In {{traditional}} infrastructural wireless {{local area}} network (WLAN), the mobile node (MN) makes the decision of choosing an access point (AP). The MN creates a list of APs in range along with the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). It then solely uses the RSSI as a decision metric for selecting an AP to connect to as this is the only information available at the MN. We argue that a MN is not the correct entity in WLAN for making the choice of an AP when many APs are available as it does not have the complete view of the environment. Secondly, choosing an AP {{solely on the basis of}} RSSI is not an efficient algorithm. This can lead to concentration of MNs at single AP resulting in a decreased average throughput for every MN associated to that AP. In this thesis, we propose to transfer this decision to the AP in a transparent manner. While our solution exists for single administrative domain with a centralized controller, we propose a completely distributed architecture for personal WLANs where APs select to serve MNs based on the MN <b>concentration,</b> <b>network</b> load, throughput and effect of serving a new MN on the network. The APs in different networks collaborate among one another in a completely decentralized manner to provide unified network access to MNs with focus on maximizing the system capacity.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} design {{complexity of}} modern circuits challenges {{our ability to}} verify their correctness. Therefore, various errors {{are more likely to}} escape the pre-silicon verification process and to manifest themselves after design tape-out. To address this problem, effective post-silicon validation is essential for eliminating design bugs before integrated circuit (IC) products shipped to customers. In the debug process, it becomes increasingly popular to insert design-for-debug (DfD) structures into the original design to facilitate real-time debug without intervening the circuits’ normal operation. For this so-called trace-based post-silicon validation technique, the key question is how to design such DfD circuits to achieve sufficient observability and controllability during the debug process with limited hardware overhead. However, in today’s VLSI design flow, this is unfortunately conducted in a manual fashion based on designers’ own experience, which cannot guarantee debug quality. To tackle this problem, we propose a set of automatic tracing solutions as well as innovative DfD designs in this thesis. First, we develop a novel trace signal selection technique to maximize the visibility on debugging functional design errors. To strengthen the capability for tackling these errors, we sequentially introduce a multiplexed signal tracing strategy with a trace signal grouping algorithm for maximizing the probability of catching the propagated evidences from functional design errors. Then, to effectively localize speedpathrelated electrical errors, we propose an innovative trace signal selection solution as well as a trace qualification technique. On the other hand, we introduce several low-cost interconnection fabrics to effectively transfer trace data in post-silicon validation. We first propose to reuse the existing test channel for real-time trace data transfer, so that the routing cost of debug hardware is dramatically reduced. The method is further improved to avoid data corruption in multi-core debug. We then develop a novel interconnection fabric design and optimization technique, by combining multiplexor network and non-blocking network, to achieve high debug flexibility with minimized hardware cost. Moreover, we introduce a hybrid trace interconnection fabric that is able to tolerate unknown values in “golden vectors“, at the cost of little extra DfD overhead. With the fabric, we develop a systematic signal tracing procedure to automatically localize erroneous signals with just a few debug runs. Our empirical evaluation shows that the solutions presented in this thesis can greatly improve the validation quality of VLSI circuits, and ultimately enable the design and fabrication of reliable electronic devices.

40|$|AbstractThe {{origins of}} clot {{rheological}} behavior associated with network morphology and factor XIIIa-induced cross-linking were studied in fibrin clots. Network morphology was manipulated by varying {{the concentrations of}} fibrinogen, thrombin, and calcium ion, and cross-linking was controlled by a synthetic, active-center inhibitor of FXIIIa. Quantitative measurements of network features (fiber lengths, fiber diameters, and fiber and branching densities) were made by analyzing computerized three-dimensional models constructed from stereo pairs of scanning electron micrographs. Large fiber diameters and lengths were established only when branching was minimal, and increases in fiber length were generally associated with increases in fiber diameter. Junctions at which three fibers joined were the dominant branchpoint type. Viscoelastic properties of the clots were measured with a rheometer and were correlated with structural features of the networks. At constant fibrinogen but varying thrombin and calcium concentrations, maximal rigidities were established in samples (both cross-linked and noncross-linked) which displayed a balance between large fiber sizes and great branching. Clot rigidity was also enhanced by increasing fiber and branchpoint densities at greater fibrinogen <b>concentrations.</b> <b>Network</b> morphology is only minimally altered by the FXIIIa-catalyzed cross-linking reaction, which seems to augment clot rigidity most likely by the stiffening of existing fibers...|$|R
