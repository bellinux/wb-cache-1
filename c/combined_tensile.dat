Tests were performed on four alloys: 2219 -T 87 aluminum, 5 Al- 2. 5 Sn (ELl) titanium, 6 Al- 4 V beta STA titanium and high strength 4340 steel. Tests were conducted in room air, gaseous nitrogen at - 200 F (144 K), liquid nitrogen and liquid hydrogen. Flat center cracked and surface flawed specimens, cracked tube specimens, circumferentially notched round bar and surface flawed cylindrical specimens were tested. The three-dimensional photoelastic technique of stress freezing and slicing was used to determine stress intensity factors for surface flawed cylindrical specimens subjected to tension or torsion. Results showed that proof load/temperature histories used in the tests have a small beneficial effect or no effect on subsequent fracture strength and flaw growth rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} is to present the formulation of numerically integrated modified virtual crack closure integral technique for concentrically and eccentrically stiffened panels for computation of strain-energy release rate and stress intensity factor based on linear elastic fracture mechanics principles. Fracture analysis of cracked stiffened panels under <b>combined</b> <b>tensile,</b> bending, and shear loads has been conducted by employing the stiffened plate/shell finite element model, MQL 9 S 2.

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a new variation of Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) that aims to <b>combine</b> <b>tensile</b> ductility with self-sensing ability is described. ECC is a new type of high-performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite that exhibits strain-hardening under applied tensile load while resisting fracture localization. The self-sensing ability is achieved by incorporating a small dosage of carbon black (CB) into the ECC system (hereafter known as CB-ECC) to enhance its piezoresistive behavior while maintaining its tensile strain-hardening behavior. The tensile stress-strain response of CB-ECC is studied with an emphasis on its tensile stress and strain capacity, as well as its cracking pattern. In addition, the piezoresistive behavior of CB-ECC under uniaxial tension is investigated. Specifically, the effect of carbon black content on the electrical properties of ECC including the sensitivity of changes in its bulk conductivity under applied tensile strain are explored in detail...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{develop an}} acoustomechanical theory for {{semicrystalline}} polymers and demonstrate that acoustic radiation force {{is capable of}} causing giant deformation in these materials. When a polymer layer is subjected to <b>combined</b> <b>tensile</b> mechanical force in plane and acoustic force (sound pressure) through thickness, it becomes initially homogeneously thin but soon inhomogeneous when the two forces reach critical conditions. Critical conditions for such acoustomechanical instability are theoretically determined based on the J 2 -deformation theory. We demonstrate that pull-in instability can be acoustically triggered even if the in-plane mechanical force is fixed. Bifurcation in the critical condition for acoustomechanical instability occurs when the polymer exhibits sufficiently large hardening.

A probabilistic failure criterion {{is needed to}} quantitatively predict reliability in critical applications, such as man-safe, deep-sea and air structures, and as an objective function for use in optimum design. Composites are multi-phased and anisotropic, which gives rise to failure in different modes with different probabilistic occurrences that are dependent on the applied stress tensor. Statistical representation of combines stress failure is practically impossible. Probabilistic modeling {{must be based on}} the failure modes. This investigation examines the underlying features required in a probabilistic failure criterion for unidirectional fiber-composite structures via Monte Carlo simulations.

In this study, the tissue response to and the calcification of these scaffolds were evaluated. In particular, the hypothesis was tested that calcification, a common phenomenon in biomaterials, {{may be due}} to microfibrils within the elastic fibre, and that these microfibrils might generate a tissue response. Four scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted, viz. collagen, collagen + pure elastin, collagen + microfibril-containing, and collagen + pulverised elastic ligament (the source for elastin). Explants were evaluated at day 3, 7 and 21. In young Sprague Dawley rats, collagen + ligament calcified substantially, whereas collagen + elastin (with and without microfibrils) calcified less, and collagen did not. Calcification started at elastic fibres. In both Sprague Dawley and Wistar adult rats, however, none of the scaffolds calcified. Mononuclear cell infiltration was prominent in young and adult Sprague Dawley rats. In adult Wistar rats, this infiltration was associated with the presence of microfibrils. Degradation of scaffolds and new matrix formation were related with cellular influx and degree of vascularisation. In conclusion, absence of microfibrils from the elastic fibre does not prevent calcification in young Sprague Dawley rats, but does reduce the tissue response in adult Wistar rats. Cellular response and calcification differs with age and strain and therefore the choice of animal model is of key importance in biomaterial evaluation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A bar of {{circular}} cross-section is modelled with two-dimensional plane-stress finite elements. The bar has a crack at its edge, the front {{of which is a}} circular arc. The ends of the bar remote from the crack are subjected to either an axial load or a bending moment in the plane of symmetry of the cracked section. The strain energy release rate of the crack is determined from a finite element model as the rate of change of elastic energy in the bar for successive positions of the circular arc crack front. The values of strain energy release rate so determined are found to be comparable with existing results obtained from three-dimensional finite element analyses. The effect of curvature is found to cause a reduction in the strain energy release rate compared to that for a straight fronted crack of the same maximum depth in a bar under the same loading conditions. The results obtained are superimposed to obtain strain energy release rates for the circular arc crack edge subjected to a <b>combined</b> <b>tensile</b> load and a bending moment. ...|$|E

The results of our GPS inversions for these two earthquakes are consistent with the seismic mechanisms and aftershock locations, and the GPS mechanisms successfully forward predict the observed regional seismograms. The 1 July earthquake, located near the northwest tip of the dike, has a large opening component and a geodetic moment about 5 times larger than that inferred from the seismic data alone. The source process for this event consists of tensile failure, which occurred quickly, and a much slower accumulation of shear slip.
