40|$|This {{paper was}} {{concerned}} with the spin-momentum correlation in single-particle quantum states, which is described by the mixed states under Lorentz transformations. For convenience, instead of using the superposition of momenta we use only two momentum eigen states (p 1 and p 2) that are perpendicular to the Lorentz boost direction. Consequently, in 2 D momentum subspace we show that the entanglement of spin-momentum in the moving frame depends on the angle between them. Therefore, when spin and momentum are perpendicular the measure of entanglement is not observer-dependent quantity in inertial frame. Likewise, we have calculated the measure of entanglement (by using the concurrence) and has shown that entanglement decreases {{with respect to the}} increasing of observer velocity.

This contrasts with the ergonomic view of the activity, which recommends leaving operators leeway (margins for manoeuvre) in performing their task, while safeguarding their health. Following a brief analysis of design practices in the car industry, we detail how the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) approach is implemented in this sector. We then suggest an adaptation that enables designers to consider real work situations. This new protocol, namely work situation FMEA, allows experience feedback to be used to defend the health standpoint during designer project reviews, which usually only address quality and performance issues. We subsequently illustrate the advantage of this approach using two examples of work situations at car parts manufacturers: the first from the literature and the second from an in-company industrial project we followed...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a logical {{understanding}} of <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> for delimited (partial) continuations, in particular, Danvy and Filinski's shift/reset. Starting with a simple type system for a static analogue of the shift/reset operators, we analyze the type structure in a logical way, which gives rise to <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> for delimited continuations. The resulting <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> nicely behave in the sense that it satises strong normalization and other nice properties, and we can use them with a higher order types.

40|$|In this study, a {{framework}} {{to model the}} effects of stress on a process <b>control</b> <b>operator</b> is proposed. There exists many cognitive models, each of which attempts to model a specific class of human behaviour. One major effect of stress {{is the cause of}} errors, both physical and cognitive. In order to model the effects of stress, two cognitive models, a cognitive model of human errors and a cognitive model of process <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> are examined in detail. In this thesis, the basic functions of the human cognitive system, its organization and a cognitive model of error commission are first examined. The behaviour of a process <b>control</b> <b>operator</b> and a cognitive model of the behaviour of the operator are then discussed. The known effects of stress on the process <b>control</b> <b>operator's</b> behaviour are described and {{a framework}} for modelling the behaviour of process <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> under stress is proposed. The inadequacies associated with existing cognitive models for process <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> are explained and a modified cognitive model is proposed, which takes into account the cognitive model of error. Finally, an architecture design for the implementation of the cognitive model is provided and suggestions for the next step forward are proposed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe CPS {{hierarchy}} of Danvy and Filinski is a {{hierarchy of}} continuations that allows for expressing nested control effects characteristic of, e. g., non-deterministic programming or certain instances of normalization by evaluation. In this article, we present a comprehensive study of a typed version of the CPS hierarchy, where the typing discipline generalizes Danvy and Filinski's type system for <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> shift and reset. To this end, we define a typed family of <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> that give access to delimited continuations in the CPS hierarchy and that are slightly more flexible than Danvy and Filinski's family of <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> shift_i and reset_i, but, as we show, are equally expressive. For this type system, we prove subject reduction, soundness {{with respect to the}} CPS translation, and termination of evaluation. We also show that our results scale to a type system for even more flexible <b>control</b> <b>operators</b> expressible in the CPS hierarchy...|$|R
