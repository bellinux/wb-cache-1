This capability was proven when Singapore Airlines briefly offered A380 flights to Beijing in August 2008 during the Summer Olympics.

25|$|The Burlington Concert Band {{has been}} in {{operation}} since 1908. The band, composed of local volunteer musicians, plays {{a wide variety of}} musical styles and repertoire. It primarily performs to raise money for charitable causes. The Burlington Concert Band is a participating member of Performing Arts Burlington as well as the Canadian Band Association. The band maintains an open membership policy, allowing anyone who feels they <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> music competently to join without an audition. Its primary venue has been the Burlington Performing Arts Center since it opened in 2011. Zoltan Kalman directs the Burlington Concert Band that is led by an elected board headed by Steven Hewis.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the early}} trovadores, such as Manuel Corona (who worked in a brothel area of Havana), {{composed}} and sang guarachas as a balance for the slower boleros and canciones. The satirical lyric content also fitted well with the son, and many bands played both genres. In the mid-20th century the style was {{taken up by the}} conjuntos and big bands as a type of up-tempo music. Today it seems no longer to exist as a distinct musical form; it has been absorbed into the vast maw of Salsa. Singers who <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> fast lyrics and are good improvisors are called guaracheros or guaracheras.|$|E

25|$|All eleven {{terminal}} gates have jet bridges, numbered 21 through 29, 31 and 32. Gate 30, next to gate 29, is {{used for}} apron buses. The terminal is constructed so that all {{can be used for}} domestic traffic, but if Gate 21 {{is used for}} domestic, all others must too. In ordinary use, 21 and 22 are used solely for international traffic, 23 through 27 are used for either, and 28 through 32 are used solely for domestic. Gate 21 and 23 can be used both for Schengen Area and non-Schengen flights, while Gate 22 is solely used for non-Schengen. Gate 24 has the largest parking space and can take category E aircraft (such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747), the rest are category C (such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320), although gates 21 and 22 are slightly larger and <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> Boeing 757. There are a further twenty-one remote parking places on the apron.|$|E
25|$|Although Venezuelan {{extra-heavy}} oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of {{the difference}} is due to temperature. Once the oil {{comes out of the}} ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, <b>can</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>The</b> upgraders have a combined capacity of , which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems – {{as a result of the}} country's economic crisis -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{has become much}} more positive in recent years. Film critic James Berardinelli summed this up in his review of the movie: [...] "with the exception of one production aspect, [...] is by far the best entry of the long-running James Bond series. The film contains some of the most exhilarating action sequences ever to reach the screen, a touching love story, and a nice subplot that has agent 007 crossing (and even threatening to resign from) Her Majesty's Secret Service. The problem is with Bond himself... George Lazenby is boring, and his ineffectualness lowers the picture's quality. Lazenby <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> action sequences, but that's about all he masters." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} a dip in {{readership}} as of 2011, primarily due to the increase of technology-related blogs and Twitter feeds. In 2002, approximately 50% of Slashdot's traffic consisted of people who simply check out the headlines and click through, while others participate in discussion boards and {{take part in the}} community. Many links in Slashdot stories caused the linked site to get swamped by heavy traffic and its server to collapse. This is known as the [...] "Slashdot effect", a term which was first coined on February 15, 1999 that refers to an article about a [...] "new generation of niche Web portals driving unprecedented amounts of traffic to sites of interest". Today, most major websites <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> surge of traffic, but the effect continues to occur on smaller or independent sites. These sites are then said to have been [...] "Slashdotted".|$|E
500|$|Motolla {{selected}} Cory Rooney as {{the executive}} producer of Irresistible. Most of the recording and mixing works were done at Sony Music Studios, New York City and was completed over a time span of eight months. Rooney also coordinated the recording process while Robert Williams miked the vocals. Sony's C-800G Tube Condenser Microphone, equipped with a dual large diaphragm and electronically selectable pick-up pattern, was used to record the vocals. In an interview with Sony's SoundByte magazine in 2002, Williams said of his choice: [...] "In the studio, it comes down to what you hear. [...] She has such a big range, from a whisper to really belting it out, and you need a microphone that <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> range without distortion." [...] He had used the microphone for Simpson's first album and felt that it suited her well. He also noted that on ballads, [...] "the S's and wet sounds of lips" [...] are important to the texture of the song. According to him, as Simpson's vocals tended to be [...] "bright", he edited the lower ends of her voice to equalize the track.|$|E

Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the [...] "tone change" [...] in the episode was [...] "a bit abrupt", but noted that [...] "viewers who <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> twists and turns will be intrigued". James Poniewozik gave a mixed review of the episode, noting that the show is [...] "setting itself up to be largely a bad-guy-of-the-week show" [...] and that its success will [...] "depend on how interesting Reddington and Keen’s backstories become". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said the episode was [...] "stylish and expertly paced", saying that [...] "it is never boring". Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the episode, saying that the episode [...] "reaches undeniably satisfying levels of menace".|$|E
