The {{microarray}} kit II (AM II) {{is capable}} of detecting several compounds belonging to different families of antibiotics: quinolones, ceftiofur, thiamphenicol, streptomycin, tylosin and tetracyclines. The performance of this innovative system was evaluated {{for the detection of}} antibiotic residues in new matrices, in muscle of different animal species and in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products.</b> The method was validated according to the European Decision No. EC/ 2002 / 657 and the European guideline for the validation of screening methods, which represents a complete initial validation. The false-positive rate was equal to 0 % in muscle and in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products.</b> The detection capabilities CCβ for 12 validated antibiotics (enrofloxacin, difloxacin, ceftiofur, desfuroyl ceftiofur cysteine disulfide, thiamphenicol, florfenicol, tylosin, tilmicosin, streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline) were all lower than the respective maximum residue limits (MRLs) in muscle from different animal origins (bovine, ovine, porcine, poultry). No cross-reactions were observed with other antibiotics, neither with the six detected families nor with other families of antibiotics. The AM II kit could be applied to <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products</b> but with higher detection capabilities from those in muscle. The detection capabilities CCβ in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products</b> were respectively at 0. 25, 0. 10 and 0. 5 of the respective MRL in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products</b> for enrofloxacin, tylosin and oxytetracycline.

40|$|SUMMARY- The {{international}} trade of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products</b> to increase food production and income {{has been an}} established practice since last century. The practice generates controversy with regard to protection of native biological diversity, spread of disease, and socio-economics. The impact and benefits of such trade are unclear, however, planning, regulating and monitoring the {{international trade}} of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products</b> {{appears to have been}} poor. It is recommended that this situation be corrected through adherence to international and national codes of practice in order to maximize the benefits from the use of <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products.</b> Many of the issues related to the food product safety and quality of the results of aquaculture are covered by the existing FAONVHO Internationally Recommended Codex Standards and codes of Practices for Fish and Fishery Products.

In order to preserve natural fish stocks and to {{contribute to the development of}} a sustainable worldwide aquaculture, fishmeal as a source of proteins is more and more replaced by vegetable crop products.

The present article is principally focused on the presence of environmental contaminants and medicinal substance residues in <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products,</b> fishery products and fish feed sampled in Belgium between 2004 and 2006.

40|$|Sustainable {{methods of}} {{aquaculture}} have evolved {{as a response}} to negative impacts of overfishing of the oceans and problems associated with conventional aquaculture. The German fish market is characterised by a multitude of different labels and claims for sustainable production and fishing methods. However, little is known about how consumers in Germany evaluate and interpret the different food labels and claims of sustainably produced <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products.</b> This paper presents results of think aloud protocols about consumers’ fish-buying decision making and in-depth interviews on consumer preferences for different sustainability labels and claims. Results indicate that not only product attributes, e. g. Origin, Production methods, Organic production, and the sensory Taste of the fish product were relevant for the consumers, but also Skepticism and a Lack of knowledge about procedures of aquaculture were important. When asked to evaluate the sustainability of the products, the organic labels were the most recognized and trusted sources of information. The sustainability claims presented in the in-depth interviews were mainly rejected as being too imprecise. In order to communicate the value of sustainable <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products</b> the knowledge gap between consumers and producers about the production processes needs to be closed. Consumers prefer local aquaculture production and a clear labeling of the product origin. Communication should therefore include information about the origin of the <b>aquaculture</b> <b>product</b> and, at best, the whole production chain. All information on product packages should be easily accessible to consumers. Claims about sustainability should be precise and certification schemes must be trustworthy...|$|R

40|$|Different seafood {{products}} {{based on}} Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fisheries and freshwater aquaculture of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) and black pacu (Colossoma macropomum), contribute at different scales to the socio-economic development, environmental degradation and nutrition of the Peruvian population. Various indicators {{have been used}} in the literature to assess the performance of these industries regarding different aspects of sustainability, notably their socio-economic performance. In this study, a novel set of indicators is proposed to evaluate the sustainability performance of these industries in Peru, based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and nutritional profiling, as well as on energy and socio-economic assessment approaches. The emphasis is put on the potential of different products to contribute to improving the nutrition of the Peruvian population in an energy-efficient, environmentally friendly and socio-economically sound way. The set of indicators includes biotic resource use (BRU), cumulative energy demand (CED), energy return on investment (EROI), production costs, gross profit generation, added value, and nutritional profile in terms of vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids; {{as well as a number}} of life cycle impact assessment indicators commonly used in seafood studies, and some recently proposed indicators of resource status (measuring the impacts of fish biomass removal at the species and ecosystem levels). Results suggest that more energy-intensive/highly processed products (cured and canned anchoveta products) represent a higher burden, in terms of environmental impact, than less energy-intensive products (salted and frozen anchoveta <b>products,</b> semi-intensive <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products).</b> This result is confirmed when comparing all products regarding their industrial-to-nutritional energy ratio. Regarding the other attributes analysed, the scoring shows that salted and frozen anchoveta products generate fewer jobs and lower gross profit than canned and cured, while <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products</b> maximise them. Overall, it was concluded that less energy-intensive industries (anchoveta freezing and salting) are the least environmentally impacting but also the least economically interesting products, yet delivering higher nutritional value. <b>Aquaculture</b> <b>products</b> maximise gross profit and job creation, with lower energy efficiency and nutritional values. The proposed set of sustainability indicators fulfilled its goal in providing a multi-criteria assessment of anchoveta direct human consumption and freshwater <b>aquaculture</b> <b>products.</b> As often the case, there is no ideal product and the best trade-off must be sought when making decision regarding fisheries and seafood policy. No threshold for performance of the different indicators is offered, because the goal of the comparison is to contrast the relative performance among products, not of products against reference values...|$|R
