5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to <b>close</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops to <b>close</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide {{the best way to}} get in and out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to <b>close</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies to get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{perception}} of visual motion modulates postural control, it is unknown whether illusory visual motion elicits postural sway. The present study examined the effect of illusory motion on postural sway in patients with migraine, {{who tend to be}} sensitive to it. We measured postural sway for both migraine patients and controls while they viewed static visual stimuli with and without illusory motion. The participants’ postural sway was measured when they <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> either immediately after (Experiment 1), or 30 seconds after (Experiment 2), viewing the stimuli. The patients swayed more than the controls when they <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> immediately after viewing the illusory motion (Experiment 1), and they swayed less than the controls when they <b>closed</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> 30 seconds after viewing it (Experiment 2). These results suggest that static visual stimuli with illusory motion can induce postural sway that may last for at least 30 seconds in patients with migraine...|$|R

25|$|Proprioception, the {{kinesthetic}} sense, {{provides the}} parietal cortex {{of the brain}} with information on the movement and relative positions of {{the parts of the}} body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to <b>close</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.|$|E

25|$|Contact lenses are {{typically}} {{inserted into the}} eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may {{be placed on the}} sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may <b>close</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.|$|E

[...] She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for [...] "tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up." [...] Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do [...] "homework" [...] from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for [...] "all the terrible things she did to me", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will [...] "renovate" [...] her life. [...] During the following day of [...] "The Plan", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to [...] "renovate their homes" [...] together.

500|$|Disney had {{originally}} considered casting actress Jodi Benson, who famously voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid, as Belle, but ultimately {{felt that she}} sounded [...] "too American" [...] and young, opting for a [...] "more classical ... womanly" [...] voice instead. Describing the character as [...] "a woman that was ahead of her time," [...] the filmmakers wanted Belle to sound [...] "more like a woman than a girl." [...] However, Benson voiced Belle in a few episodes of Disney's House of Mouse. Director Kirk Wise was particularly interested in casting an actress capable of [...] "creat a character completely with her voice", envisioning a voice {{similar to that of}} American entertainer Judy Garland. American actress and singer Paige O'Hara was performing on Broadway when she first read about Disney's then-upcoming animated project Beauty and the Beast in an article in The New York Times. Upon discovering that the studio was holding auditions for the lead role of Belle and, at the behest of lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken, specifically recruiting Broadway performers, O'Hara immediately insisted that her agent get her an audition. Familiar with O'Hara's Broadway stint as Ellie May Chipley in the musical Show Boat; Ashman had already been eyeing O'Hara for the part. O'Hara auditioned for the role five times, competing against approximately 500 other actresses. First auditioning solely for casting director Albert Taveres, O'Hara's next two auditions simply required the actress to mail audio recordings of her voice to the studio in Los Angeles. Required to perform a song of her choice, O'Hara sang [...] "Heaven Help My Heart" [...] from the musical Chess. At her first legitimate audition, O'Hara spoke and sang in a higher register than her own in an effort to mimic Snow White from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but the filmmakers insisted that she use her own voice instead. In addition to Ashman and Menken, O'Hara's last few auditions were attended by directors Wise and Gary Trousdale, and producers Katzenberg and Don Hahn. O'Hara recalled that the songwriters would first <b>close</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and listen to her before finally watching her perform. An hour after her fifth and final audition, O'Hara received a telephone call from Disney on her birthday informing her that she had been cast. The actress was fairly confident that the role was hers before she was officially cast, and credits the fact that Ashman enjoyed her performance on the cast recording of the musical Show Boat. O'Hara admitted, [...] "I'm not usually confident about auditions ... but I just understood (Belle) so much." ...|$|E

2500|$|Absolute pitch (AP) is {{the ability}} to produce or {{recognize}} specific pitches without reference to an external standard. People boasting AP have internalized pitch references, and thus are able to maintain stable representations of pitch in long-term memory. AP is regarded as a rare and somewhat mysterious ability, occurring in as few as 1 in 10,000 people. A method commonly used to test for AP is as follows: subjects are first asked to <b>close</b> <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> and imagine that a specific song is playing in their heads. Encouraged to start anywhere in the tune they like, subjects are then instructed to try to reproduce the tones of that song by singing, humming, or whistling. Productions made by the subject are then recorded on digital audio tape, which accurately preserves the pitches they sing avoiding the potential pitch and speed fluctuations of analog recording. Lastly, the subjects' productions are compared to the actual tones sung by the artists on the CDs. Errors are measured in semitone deviations from the correct pitch. This test, however, does not determine whether or not the subject has true absolute pitch, but rather is a test of implicit absolute pitch. Where true absolute pitch is concerned, Deutsch and colleagues have shown that music conservatory students who are speakers of tone languages [...] have a far higher prevalence of absolute pitch than do speakers of nontone languages such as English. For a test of absolute pitch see the [...] developed by Deutsch and colleagues at the University of California San Diego.|$|E
