40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical fatigue life study {{was performed on}} the Grainex Mar-M 247 disk used in NASA s Turbine Seal Test Facility. To preclude fatigue cracks from growing to critical size in the NASA disk <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> due to cyclic loading at severe test conditions, a retirement-for-cause methodology was adopted to detect and monitor cracks within the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> using eddy-current inspection. For the NASA disk material that was tested, the fatigue strain-life to crack initiation at a total strain of 0. 5 percent, a minimum to maximum strain ratio of 0, and a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> temperature of 649 C was calculated to be 665 cycles using - 99. 95 percent prediction intervals.

40|$|Three-dimensional finite-element thermal-stress {{models are}} applied to predict temperature, {{distortion}} and residual stress in a continuous casting mold for steel slabs. The model predictions of temperature, distortion during operation, and residual distorted mold shape match plant observations. During operation, the copper faces bend towards the steel, with a maximum outward distortion {{on the order of}} 1 mm, found just above the center of the wide faces. Distortion during operation increases with increasing mold temperature, increasing strand width, and decreasing water jacket rigidity. Mold <b>clamping</b> forces, <b>bolt</b> prestress, friction, and ferrostatic pressure have little effect on this behavior. Constraint generated by the temperature gradients and the sides of the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> in the steel water jackets generate stresses and creep in the copper hot face during operation. This leads to permanent distortion and residual stress after cooling to ambient. Residual stress and distortion increase with repeated thermal cycling over a campaign, higher temperatures, smaller water-jacket <b>bolt</b> <b>holes,</b> non-uniform water slot depth, and higher clamping forces. Increased residual distortion requires increased remachining, which reduces mold life. Increased residual stress increases the probability of a catastrophic crack failure. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{construction}} field, the bolting robot provides convenience and reduces a process time of assembling steel frames. When assembling steel frames, the bolting robot finds a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> {{with the help}} of camera. If the light conditions are either too bright or too dark, however, it is hard to find a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> in the input image because the contrast between <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> and background is vague. In order to improve detection accuracy in such environment, this paper proposes the image processing algorithm using template matching (TM). First, the input image is converted from RGB to YCbCr in order to reduce influence of shadow. Then we separate Y channel of image in darkness or extract edges from Cb and Cr channel of image in brightness. Template image is created with the radius which can be calculated with the distance to a steel frame. We used TM to create the normalized cross correlation (NCC) image which shows correlation between processed image and template. Finally, <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> are extracted from the high-correlation part of NCC image. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to detect <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> under various illumination conditions...|$|R
