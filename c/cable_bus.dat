50|$|ControlNet cables {{consist of}} RG-6 coaxial cable with BNC connectors, though optical fiber is {{sometimes}} used for long distances.The network topology is a bus structure with short taps. ControlNet also supports a star topology if {{used with the}} appropriate hardware.ControlNet can operate with a single RG-6 coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>bus,</b> or a dual RG-6 coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>bus</b> for cable redundancy. In all cases, the RG-6 should be of quad-shield variety.Maximum cable length without repeaters is 1000m and maximum number of nodes on the bus is 99. However, there is a tradeoff between number of devices {{on the bus and}} total cable length. Repeaters can be used to further extend the cable length. The network can support up to 5 repeaters (10 when used for redundant networks). The repeaters do not utilize network node numbers and are available in copper or fiber optic choices.|$|E

From pages 2 and 3 of IEN 96:The Cable-Bus SystemThe MITRE/Washington Cablenet system {{is based on}} a technology developed at MITRE/Bedford. Similar cable-bus systems are in operation at a number of government sites, e.g. Walter Reed Army Hospital, and the NASA Johnson Space Center, but these are all standalone, local-only networks.The system uses standard Community Antenna Television (CATV) coaxial cable and microprocessor based Bus Interface Units (BIUs) to connect subscriber computers and terminals to the cable. ... The <b>cable</b> <b>bus</b> consists of two parallel coaxial cables, one inbound and the other outbound. The inbound cable and outbound cable are connected at one end, the headend, and electrically terminated at their other ends. This architecture takes advantage of the well developed unidirectional CATV components. The topology is dendritic (i.e. branched like a tree)....The BIUs contain Radio Frequency (RF) modems which modulate a carrier signal to transmit digital information using 1 MHz of the available bandwidth in the 24 MHz frequency range. The remainder of the 294 MHz bandwidth can be used to carry other information channels, such as off-the-air TV, FM, closed circuit TV, or a voice telephone system, or, other digital channels.

Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory was developing sub-systems for the upgrade of the LHC final focus magnet systems. Part of the upgrade called for various lengths of superconducting power transmission lines known as SC Links which were up to 100 m long. The SC Link electrically connects the current leads in the Distribution Feed Boxes to the interaction region magnets. The SC Link {{is an extension of}} the magnet bus housed within a cryostat. The present concept for the bus consists of 22 power cables, 4 x 13 kA, 2 x 7 kA, 8 x 2. 5 kA and 8 x 0. 6 kA bundled into one bus.
