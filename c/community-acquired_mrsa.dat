Postulated resistance mechanisms include overproduction of conventional penicillinases, production of an inducible, plasmid-mediated, membrane-bound methicillinase, and in some cases, point mutations of penicillin-bindingproteins (4). The clinical importance of BORSA is unknown since early clinical/animal data suggest treatment efficacy of PRP (against strains with MIC < 2 mg/L) (4, 6, 9).

40|$|Many efficacious {{antimicrobial}} agents have beem {{developed in the}} latter half of the 20 th century, and this has enabled us to overcome bacterial infections. However, various drug-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been emerging.

Therefore, MRSA infections must be controlled by rapid detection of these strains, appropriate diagnosis of infections, followed by effective antimicrobial therapies and infection control measures. Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) was first isolated in Japan in 1976 and soon afterward was reported in other countries. In addition, two cases of MRSA infections due to vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) having vanA gene from vancomycin-resistant enterococci were first reported from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2002.

During the period of study, the MRSA prevalence was 44. 1 %, and 389 MRSA strains were included. The prevalence of MRSA was found to be significantly higher in the patients of Indian ethnicity (P < 0. 001). The majority (92. 5 %) of the isolates belonged to ST- 239, spa type t 037, and possessed the type III or IIIA SCCmec. The arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) arcA gene was detected in three (1. 05 %) ST- 239 isolates. We report the first identification of ACME arcA gene-positive ST- 239. Apart from this predominant clone, six (1. 5 %) isolates of ST- 22, with two related spa types (t 032 and t 4184) and a singleton (t 3213), carrying type IVh SCCmec, were detected {{for the first time in}} Asia.

40|$|Background and objective: Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) strains are {{primarily}} associated with skin and soft tissue infections; however, they are increasingly causing more invasive infections including severe community-acquired pneumonia. The {{objective of this}} study was to describe the clinico-pathological characteristics of <b>community-acquired</b> <b>MRSA</b> pneumonia. Methods: A retrospective analysis of case records from January 2002 to August 2008 was performed on patients admitted with <b>community-acquired</b> <b>MRSA</b> pneumonia to two large teaching hospitals. Results: Sixteen patients with <b>community-acquired</b> <b>MRSA</b> pneumonia were identified. Their age ranged from 11 months to 86 years (median age; 30 years). Duration of symptoms before hospital presentation ranged from one to 21 days. Most patients had productive cough, fever and dyspnoea. The most common radiological presentation included multilobar consolidation (8 / 16), necrotizing consolidation (7 / 16) and empyema (5 / 16). Seven patients required intensive care support; four required ionotropic support and five required mechanical ventilation for a mean duration of 53 h and 6. 6 days, respectively. Six patients underwent surgery (VATS or open thoracotomy). There was a mean delay of approximately 69 h (range; 18 h to 11 days) after presentation before appropriate MRSA antimicrobial treatment was initiated. Three patients died of complications from pneumonia, all within 72 h of presentation. Among survivors, the average length of hospital stay was 23. 8 days (range; 10 - 49 days).

Little is known of the clinical features, the epidemiology, and the antibiotic treatment of these strains. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting to Emergency Departments or Dermatology Clinics with staphylococcal infections. Patients were stratified into three groups, non-multiresistant ORSA (NORSA), multiresistant ORSA (MORSA) and oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus, and clinical comparisons made. Strains of NORSA and MORSA were typed using antibiograms, phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Antimicrobial studies were performed to compare different methods of detecting resistance to oxacillin and to non-beta-lactams. Time-kill studies were performed with one drug to explore killing kinetics. The interaction between drug combinations was examined using disk approximation and time-kill methodologies. A single point pharmacodynamic analysis was performed. Results: There was an increase in infections with NORSA, MORSA and OSSA. NORSA strains appeared to be more virulent than OSSA and MORSA strains. NORSA was strongly associated with skin and soft tissue infections and with Polynesians. Most of the NORSA strains were related to New Zealand ¡°Western Samoan Phage Pattern¡± (WSPP) isolates, and unrelated to <b>community-acquired,</b> non-multiresistant <b>MRSA</b> strains from Western Australia. Two patients were found to have British EMRSA- 15 strains. NORSA strains were unrelated to MORSA strains.

In Taiwan, ST59 strains, {{some of which are}} resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics, have arisen as common causes of skin and soft tissue infections in the community. In a remote region of Alaska, unlike most of the continental U.S., USA300 was found rarely in a study of MRSA strains from outbreaks in 1996 and 2000 as well as in surveillance from 2004-06.|$|R

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is an {{important}} pathogen causing bacteremia, primarily affecting hospitalized patients. We studied the epidemiology of S. aureus bacteremia, comparing two periods (early and mid 1990 s) and developed a predictive model of mortality. A nested case-control was done. All 251 patients over 14 years old with positive blood cultures for S. aureus were selected. MRSA (methicillin resistant S. aureus) was isolated in 63 % of the cases. When comparing the two periods <b>MRSA</b> <b>community-acquired</b> bacteremia increased from 4 % to 16 % (p= 0. 01). There {{was no significant difference}} in the mortality rate between the two periods (39 % and 33 %, p= 0. 40). Intravascular catheters provoked 24 % of the cases of bacteremia and were associated with the lowest rate of mortality. In a logistic regression analysis, three variables were associated with death: septic shock, source of bacteraemia and resistance to methicillin. The probability of dying among patients with MRSA and those with methicillin sensitive S. aureus bacteraemia ranged from 10 % to 90 % and from 4 % to 76 %, respectively, depending on the source of the bacteraemia and the occurrence of septic shock. The MRSA found in Brazil may be a particularly virulent strain...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the clinical characteristics of patients with septic arthritis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and tried to identify the risk factors for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) arthritis. Between January 2008 and December 2011, patients with septic arthritis caused by S. aureus were identified from the computerized databases of a regional hospital and a medical center in southern Taiwan. The medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 93 patients with S. aureus arthritis were identified, and MRSA arthritis was found in 38 (40. 9 %) cases. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 58 years, and 86 (92. 5 %) episodes were classified as community-acquired infections. Diabetes mellitus (n = 41, 44. 1 %) was the most common underlying disease, followed by chronic kidney disease and liver cirrhosis. Patients with MRSA arthritis were more frequently elderly and found in the setting of healthcare-associated infection than patients with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) infections. No other significant differences in clinical manifestations and outcomes were noted between these two groups of patients. Overall, the in-hospital mortality rate was 5. 4 %, and diabetes mellitus was the only risk factor for mortality. MRSA is emerging in the setting of <b>community-acquired</b> septic arthritis. <b>MRSA</b> septic arthritis is more likely to develop in the elderly and in healthcare-associated infections than MSSA septic arthritis...|$|R
40|$|In {{medicine}} {{there are}} many methods for studying of formation of biofilms. Cultivation in dynamic systems allows to create the conditions {{as much as possible}} close to that exist in the macroorganism. The majority of experimental methods are based on building of static culture conditions of microorganisms, most often for this purpose use 96 -well plastic microplates in various modifications. Using microplates even one manufacturer leads to different results of the study, which is due to physical and chemical characteristics. In addition, the formation of biofilms using this method affects the composition of culture media (micronutrient and electrolyte) and aeration degree. To quantify biofilm formation in microplates researchers use the various wavelengths of the photometer: 450 nm, 540 nm, 562 nm, 630 nm, 650 nm, etc. Thus, this method is quite common, but its basic lack is that there are no standards that would allow it to unify all laboratories. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimize the test parameters to detect the ability of film formation MRSA and MSSA strains. Materials and methods. We used staphylococcus strains: S. aureus ATCC 25923, strains from the laboratory of the museum with a certain in previous studies of methicillin-sensitive and recently received S. aureus strains from patients with purulent-inflammatory diseases of different localization. Defining the properties of a biofilm forming staphylococcus culture plates was performed by D. Christensen. Results and discussion. In this experiment nutrient broth (HiMedia, India) was used with different volume fractions ingredients: 2 % glucose, 6 and 7 % NaCl. Microplates were incubated 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours at 35 ˚C. Optical density of formed biofilm evaluated by the color intensity of spirit on a photometer (StatFax 303 Plus). This method was studied biofilm-forming properties of staphylococcus obtained from all 36 patients with <b>community-acquired</b> methicillin-resistant (<b>MRSA)</b> (n = 16) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) (n = 20) strains.
