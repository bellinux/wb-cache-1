5000|$|The Special Drawing Rights Act of 1968, , {{likewise}} {{provided that}} any {{special drawing rights}} (SDRs) allocated by the International Monetary Fund or otherwise acquired by the United States are resources of the ESF. In accordance with the Act, SDRs can be [...] "monetized" [...] (i.e., converted into dollars) by having the Secretary of the Treasury issue Special Drawing Rights Certificates (SDRCs) to the Federal Reserve System. The amount of SDRCs are limited to the dollar value of the ESF's SDR holdings. The dollar proceeds of such monetizations are assets of the ESF, and the SDRCs are a <b>counterpart</b> <b>liability</b> of the ESF. Treasury has a written understanding with the Fed that the SDRCs will be redeemed when ESF dollar holdings {{appear to be in}} excess of foreseeable requirements. Treasury does not pay interest on SDRCs.|$|E
40|$|Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are {{emerging}} as developing Asia's main policy tool for handling the region's excess foreign exchange reserves. SWFs represent a strategic shift of excess reserves from low-risk, low-return investments to high-risk, high-return investments, and {{are subject to}} a wide range of downside risks. The underlying nature of Asia's reserves, which are the consequence of the central bank's purchases of foreign exchange, means that those reserves have <b>counterpart</b> <b>liabilities</b> in the commercial banks that form the backbone of the region's financial systems. This suggests that the realization of SWFs' downside risks may have serious adverse effects on the region's domestic financial stability. The broader implication is that the transformation of Asia into a major exporter of capital raises the possibility that capital outflows can also be a direct source of financial instability in the region...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} an intensity-based model of euro-area sovereign spreads. To identify liquidity-pricing effects, we exploit {{the information contained}} in the spreads between bonds issued by a German agency (KfW) and their sovereign <b>counterparts.</b> KfW's <b>liabilities</b> being guaranteed by the German government, these spreads are essentially liquidity-driven. Liquidity effects are found to account for a sizeable share of spreads' fluctuations. After having filtered risk premiums out of the spreads, we estimate the physical default probabilities of eleven countries. Physical probabilities of default are lower than risk-neutral ones, consistently with the existence of a nondiversifiable euro-area sovereign credit risk...|$|R
40|$|Under the Uniform Securities Act (Act or USA), {{in-house}} accountants, analysts, attorneys, {{and other}} inside gatekeepers may {{be held responsible}} for running afoul of the secondary liability provisions of the USA, while their outside <b>counterparts</b> will escape <b>liability.</b> As a result, an inherent inequity in treatment exists between inside and outside actors in private state securities litigation...|$|R
30|$|Securitized {{bonds are}} {{backed by a}} pool of assets and will not absorb losses coming from other {{concepts}} (i.e., losses from loans not belonging to that pool of assets, losses from tradable securities, etc). As well, Almazán et al. (2015) show that Spanish banks deployed securitization not to transfer risks (they offered credit enhancements and kept the worst tranches) but to exclusively obtain liquidity as a complement instrument to debt. Indeed, Spanish banks accounted the <b>liability</b> <b>counterpart</b> of securitization as deposits because Spanish regulation did not let them remove securitized assets from their balance sheet.|$|R
40|$|Liability of foreignness {{has been}} one of the {{building}} blocks of multinational enterprise theory development, but we have limited knowledge about the liability of foreignness in the context of multinationals operating in developing countries. This study suggests that in a developing country like China, foreignness may still exist, but its negative impact on foreign firms’ performance may have become insignificant. Local Chinese firms were found to enjoy significant location-based advantages over their foreign <b>counterparts,</b> contributing to <b>liability</b> of foreignness. However, the adverse effects of liability of foreignness on foreign firms appear to be off-set by the foreign firms’ superior firm-specific and multinationality advantages over local Chinese firms. Further, the location-based advantages that foreign firms have built up over time further serve to strength their overall competitive position in China...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{governments have}} {{recently}} moved from cash accounting to accrual accounting. In doing {{so they have}} made simultaneous use of two rival accrual accounting frameworks: AAS 31 and GFS. AAS 31 and GFS operating result measures differ significantly. To date, the AAS 31 framework has enjoyed primacy. This paper evaluates these two frameworks, and suggests that GFS is superior. Accrual accounting has been accompanied at the national government level {{by the introduction of}} a new key fiscal policy measure: the ‘fiscal balance’. This paper explains and evaluates this new fiscal measure. It concludes that, given the present fiscal policy of the Australian government, fiscal balance is a superior fiscal policy measure to the 'cash' budget balance measure which it replaced. However, from the alternative ‘golden rule’ policy standpoint, fiscal balance is not a 1 meaningful fiscal policy measurealthough its stock <b>counterpart,</b> net financial <b>liabilities,</b> is...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{the second part of}} a study on the {{determinants}} of the broad money aggregate M 4, following a similar analysis of the personal sector developed in Working Paper No 61. It models the broad money holdings of both industrial and commercial companies (ICCs) and other financial institutions (OFIs) in the UK, and examines what role they play in the transmission mechanism. ICCs are shown to have both a transactions and a portfolio motive for holding money. A three-equation model of money, investment and the cost of capital is estimated, and the results suggest the existence of a corporate sector liquidity channel whereby firms' "excess" money balances have a negative influence on the cost of capital and a positive impact on investment spending. OFIs' money holdings are shown to depend upon wealth and relative rates of return, in line with standard portfolio models of money demand. But as OFIs are the chief <b>counterparts</b> to banks' <b>liability</b> management activity, their money holdings are also modelled jointly with deposit rates. ...|$|R
