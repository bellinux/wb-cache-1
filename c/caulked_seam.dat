50|$|Some {{complications}} from wood deterioration {{can be solved}} through tight fitting seals around windows and doors, gutter systems, <b>caulking</b> of <b>seams</b> and joints, and sloping away of decking from the structure. Regular cleaning of the surface may also help reduce accumulated residues on the wood thereby prolonging its usable life.

The wind had fallen much during the night, and had worked round to the east, and under sails and oars the Bonito left the island, none of the pirates venturing to follow in pursuit. The oars were soon laid in, and the men, with mallets and chisels, set to work to <b>caulk</b> the <b>seams</b> through which the water was making its way.

50|$|Bryant and {{his crew}} set out to {{navigate}} up {{the east coast of}} Australia, passing between the Great Barrier Reef and the mainland, through the Torres Strait and across the Arafura Sea to Timor. They had to make frequent landings to find food and fresh water and <b>caulk</b> the <b>seams</b> of the boat. Sometimes they were watched by Aborigines, at first just curious, but as they went further north, more hostile. The cutter had two sails, and six oars that had to be used when the wind dropped. Before they reached the more sheltered waters of the Great Barrier Reef the weather deteriorated and they survived two storms, at one time being blown out to sea without site of land for eight days. Sailing up the Great Barrier Reef they were able to stop on uninhabited islands and replenish their food stocks with fresh turtle and shellfish. After sailing through the Torres Straits into the Gulf of Carpentaria they encountered a hostile reception from natives who on occasion pursued them in canoes.|$|R
50|$|Also in the 18th century, {{the style}} of {{panelling}} changed from a floor-to-ceiling covering to one in which only {{the lower part of}} the wall was covered. Hence wainscot or wainscoting became a panelling style applied to the lower 90 to 150 cm of an interior wall, below the dado rail or chair rail, and above the baseboard or skirting board. It is traditionally constructed from tongue-and-groove boards, though bead-board or decorative panels, such as a wooden door might have, are also common. New manufacturing techniques are capable of milling large panels from one sheet, reducing <b>seams,</b> <b>caulking,</b> and expansion/contraction cracks that have plagued traditional construction. Wainscoting may also refer to other materials used in a similar fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Bermuda {{depicts a}} red lion holding a shield that has a {{depiction}} of a wrecked ship upon it. The red lion {{is a symbol of}} Great Britain and alludes to Bermuda’s relationship with that country. The wrecked ship is that of a French ship under the command of Captain M. de la Barbotiere, not the Sea Venture, the flagship of the Virginia Company. On 30 November 1593, Captain de la Barbotiere sailed from Laguna, Hispaniola, and on 17 December of that same year, at midnight, the ship struck the north-west reefs off of Bermuda and were so badly damaged that out of fifty-five men, only twenty-six reached the shore alive. Henry May and Captain de la Barbotiere were among the survivors. It is the wreck of this French ship on the Bermuda coat of arms. The crew cut down Bermuda cedar trees and built a seaworthy craft of eighteen tons. They <b>caulked</b> her <b>seams</b> with lime salvaged from the ship and oil extracted from local turtles they caught for food. They ate turtle meat, fish, birds - and wild hogs.|$|R
6000|$|To {{take one}} of the {{examples}} given, the construction of a ship. The shaping of the timbers undoubtedly gives them a value (for a shipbuilder) which they did not possess before. When they are put together to constitute the framework of the ship, there is a still further addition of value (for a shipbuilder); and when the outside planking is added, there is another addition (for a shipbuilder). Suppose everything else about the hull is finished, except the one little item of <b>caulking</b> the <b>seams,</b> {{there is no doubt that}} it has still more value for a shipbuilder. But for whom else has it any value, except perhaps for a fire-wood merchant? What price will any one who wants a ship--that is to say, something that will carry a cargo from one port to another--give for the unfinished vessel which would take water in at every seam and go down in half an hour, if she were launched? Suppose the shipbuilder's capital to fail before the vessel is caulked, and that he cannot find another shipbuilder who cares to buy and finish it, what sort of proportion does the value created by the labour, for which he has paid out of his capital, stand to that of his advances? ...|$|R
6000|$|The great {{difficulty}} being thus overcome, the work progressed rapidly. A large hard stone served for an anvil, {{and a small}} stone, perforated, with a handle affixed to it, did duty for a hammer. A pair of carpenter's pincers served for tongs, and charcoal, made from the cocoanut and other trees, did duty for coals. In order to obtain planks, the missionary split trees in half with wedges and then the natives thinned them down with adzes extemporised by fitting crooked handles to ordinary hatchets. When a bent or twisted plank was required, having no apparatus for steaming it, he bent a piece of bamboo to the required shape, and sent natives to scour the woods {{in search of a}} suitable crooked tree. Thus planks suited to his purpose were obtained. Instead of fastening the planks to the timbers of the ship with iron nails, large wooden pins, or [...] "trenails," [...] were used, and driven into augur holes, and thus the fabric was held together. Instead of oakum, cocoanut husk was used, and native cloth and dried banana stumps to <b>caulk</b> the <b>seams,</b> and make them watertight. The bark of a certain tree was spun into twine and rope by a rope-machine made for the purpose, and a still more complex machine, namely, a turning-lathe, was constructed for the purpose of turning the block sheaves; while sails were made out of native mats, quilted to give them sufficient strength to resist the wind.|$|R
500|$|Michael Flecker, {{the chief}} {{excavating}} archaeologist at the site, compared the wrecked ship to {{three types of}} the same period {{and concluded that the}} wreck most resembled [...] "lashed-lug" [...] ships of south-east Asia—first used in the 5th century. He said that fully stitched boats were found from the African coast, Oman, in the Red Sea, on the Indian coast, {{and as far as the}} Maldives. He notes that Roman references by Procopius in the 6th century tell of boats with planks stitched together in a similar fashion used in [...] "Indian Seas". Though Arabian ships of this type have not been found before, they are mentioned in text including the late-Tang Ling biao lu yi ("Strange Things Noted in the South"). According to John Guy, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the book [...] "describes the ships of foreign merchants as being stitched together with the fiber of coir-palms and having their <b>seams</b> <b>caulked</b> rather than using iron nails to secure their planks".|$|R
5000|$|Robert Benjamin Lewis held three United States patents, {{making him}} one of the few nineteenth century African American inventors who were able to patent their inventions or {{improvements}} to existing manufacturing processes. In his application for a United States Patent dated April 11, 1836, Lewis stated that “I, Robert Benjamin Lewis of Hallowell, in the county of Kennebec, and state of Maine, have invented a new and useful machine for the picking of oakum and hair.” “Oakum” is defined as “loosely twisted hemp or jute fiber impregnated with tar or a tar derivative.” During the days of the sailing ship, hemp ropes were used as rigging on board. Although coated with pine tar and varnish, the coating would eventually wear out and the rigging would have to be replaced. Since little was wasted, the old rope would be recycled by unraveling the strands until the rope itself was reduced to single threads and then loosely rewound, resulting in “oakum,” which was used to <b>caulk</b> the <b>seams</b> of wooden ships in order to make them watertight. “Picking oakum”—the actual business in unraveling the strands of rope so that they could be prepared for caulking—was a tedious, sticky job generally delegated to those workers lowest in the pecking order. The machine would do the work of the picker—essentially teeth on a cylinder turned by a crank would separate the strands of the old rope to produce oakum. The patent was awarded on June 25, 1836 [...] The “hair picker” became a mainstay of Maine shipyards, the original design being reworked and refined over the years.|$|R
5000|$|The canoes were {{typically}} {{made out of}} planks split from redwood (Sequoioideae) or pine driftwood washed up on the shore. This driftwood was usually chosen because it was available and usually knot free and easy to work with. Some of these driftwood logs were selected, cut to length, split, shaped and then their split out planks [...] "sewn" [...] {{together to form a}} canoe. The side planks and canoe bottom were split out of straight knot free logs utilizing whalebone and antler Wedges driven by rock mallets. The planks were then shaped, trimmed and leveled using flint and seashell tools and shark hide sandpaper. Where planks needed to be connected holes were bored in the planks using wood drills tipped with chert or bone. These drilled planks were then connected by [...] "sewing" [...] split and shaped knot free planks together on their ends to get the necessary length. They {{were typically}} fastened together with red milkweed (tok) fiber cords. After the planks had been shaped and sewn together for length they were carefully shaped, bent and mounted six to eight planks vertically to form the canoe's sides around a large split bottom plank that formed the bottom of the canoe. Over 20 pieces of shaped wood are used to make a typical tomol. Once the planks were bent, fitted and lashed together the heart of dry tule rush was forced into the cracks between the planks {{on the outside of the}} canoe hull to act as <b>caulking.</b> All <b>seams</b> between planks, plank ends and holes for cords or thongs were then caulked with 'yop', a mixture of hard tar and pine pitch melted and then boiled. In many respects their boat construction technique mirrored that utilized for making small wooden boats around the world. The lack of metal tools and fasteners forced them to use stone age tools and materials.|$|R
50|$|Warships {{of the age}} of sail {{were highly}} {{vulnerable}} to fire. Made of wood, with <b>seams</b> <b>caulked</b> with tar, ropes greased with fat, and stores of gunpowder, there was little that would not burn. Accidental fires destroyed many ships, so fire ships presented a terrifying threat. With the wind in exactly the right direction a fire ship could be cast loose and allowed to drift onto its target, but in most battles fire ships were equipped with skeleton crews to steer the ship to the target (the crew were expected to abandon ship at the last moment and escape in the ship's boat). Fire ships were most devastating against fleets which were at anchor or otherwise restricted in movement. At sea, a well-handled ship could evade a fire ship and disable it with cannon fire. Other tactics were to fire at the ship's boats and other vessels in the vicinity, so that the crew could not escape and therefore might decide not to ignite the ship, or to wait until the fire ship had been abandoned and then tow it aside with small maneuverable vessels such as galleys.|$|R
6000|$|In a sea-going frigate {{that has}} all her {{armament}} and stores on board, {{the floor of the}} berth-deck is partly {{below the surface of the}} water. But in a smooth harbour, some circulation of air is maintained by opening large auger-holes in the upper portion of the sides, called [...] "air-ports," [...] not much above the water level. Before going to sea, however, these air-ports must be closed, <b>caulked,</b> and the <b>seams</b> hermetically sealed with pitch. These places for ventilation being shut, the sick-bay is entirely barred against the free, natural admission of fresh air. In the Neversink a few lungsful were forced down by artificial means. But as the ordinary wind-sail was the only method adopted, the quantity of fresh air sent down was regulated by the force of the wind. In a calm there was none to be had, while in a severe gale the wind-sail had to be hauled up, on account of the violent draught flowing full upon the cots of the sick. An open-work partition divided our sick-bay from the rest of the deck, where the hammocks of the watch were slung; it, therefore, was exposed to all the uproar that ensued upon the watches being relieved.|$|R
