5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a <b>cadaver</b> did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
25|$|There are {{studies that}} use {{specific}} <b>cadavers</b> including obese <b>cadavers,</b> and children <b>cadavers.</b> Also, studies show how <b>cadavers</b> {{have been used}} to modify different parts of a car such as the seatbelt Each new car that is made provides a different structural impact which provides the conclusion that <b>cadavers</b> and crash test dummies will be useful for a long time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cadavers</b> {{have contributed}} to body science and medical {{students}} often use <b>cadavers</b> to study anatomy. <b>Cadavers</b> are often used to verify surgical techniques {{before moving on to}} living patients. While many schools have moved to using technology and surgical models to teach students, <b>cadavers</b> are still needed for hands on learning. Appendectomies, the removal of the appendix, are performed 28,000 times a year in the United States and are still practiced on human <b>cadavers</b> and not with technology simulations. Gross anatomy, a common course in medical school studying the visual structures of the body, gives students the opportunity to have a hands-on learning environment. The need for <b>cadavers</b> has also grown outside of academic programs for research. Organizations like Science Care and the Anatomy Gifts Registry help send bodies where they are needed most.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Studying anatomy through {{dissection}} {{of human}} <b>cadavers</b> requires a regular supply of human bodies. Tanzanian medical schools depend entirely on collecting unclaimed bodies in hospital mortuaries. This method {{is no longer}} reliable. This study aimed at evaluating sources and profile of <b>cadavers</b> in Tanzanian medical schools and addressing challenges and suggests appropriate lasting solutions. Methods. Seven spreadsheets were sent electronically to seven medical schools in Tanzania to capture data related to sources and profiles of <b>cadavers</b> received. Only 2 out of 7 responded timely. Results. 100 % of all <b>cadavers</b> in Tanzanian medical schools are unclaimed bodies of black population. Female <b>cadavers</b> accounted for 0 – 20 %. About 9 days elapse before embalmment of <b>cadavers.</b> Conclusion. It {{is the time to}} jump onto body bequest wagon...|$|R
5|$|On 16 September 2008, {{the body}} of British {{politician}} and diplomat Sir Mark Sykes was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern H5N1 bird flu. Sykes had been buried in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus. However, the coffin {{was found to be}} split because of the weight of soil over it, and the <b>cadaver</b> was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining in situ in the grave during this process.|$|E
5|$|The {{body was}} found inside a plastic garbage bag on the {{shoreline}} of Deer Island in Boston, Massachusetts. A woman walking her dog discovered Bond's remains {{on the afternoon of}} June 25, 2015, when the dog stopped at the plastic bag. After the {{body was found}}, the public placed flowers near the scene. She wore only a pair of white leggings designed with a black polka-dot pattern. A zebra-print blanket was also inside the bag. Initially, police were unsure if there would be additional bodies at the scene, so they attempted unsuccessfully to use <b>cadaver</b> dogs to locate any other possible remains.|$|E
5|$|Although {{missing person}} cases are {{normally}} handled by {{local and state}} police, the FBI joined the investigation ten days after she disappeared. The FBI interviewed family from Massachusetts, and the Haverhill police chief disclosed that the search was now nationwide. Ten days after her disappearance, New Hampshire Fish and Game conducted a second ground and air search, using a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera, tracking dogs and <b>cadaver</b> dogs. Murray's older sister discovered a ripped white pair of women's underwear lying in the snow on a secluded trail near French Pond Road on February 26, but DNA tests found that the underwear {{did not belong to}} Murray.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Direct {{application}} of insect <b>cadavers</b> infected with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) can successfully control target pest insects. Little {{is known about}} the effects of environmental factors (desiccation and temperature) on the production process for infective juveniles (IJ) in insects. RESULTS: We examined the effects of desiccation time and cold storage (6. 7 °C) on IJ production of the nematode Steinernemacarpocapsae in Galleriamellonella <b>cadavers</b> at 30. 8 and 57 % humidity. Under desiccation, the IJ yield in <b>cadavers</b> increased gradually and reached a maximum on day 5. IJ yield gradually declined from day 6 onwards and was almost zero by day 15. In general, cold storage at 6. 7 °C caused negative effects on IJ production in desiccated <b>cadavers.</b> Approximately 56 h post infection was the time at which nematodes were most sensitive to low temperatures during development in <b>cadavers.</b> Five-day desiccated <b>cadavers</b> generated higher mortality and more rapid death of Galleriamellonella larvae than using newly (day 0) desiccated <b>cadavers.</b> CONCLUSION: This study describe methods of optimizing rearing techniques such as desiccation and cold storage to promote the mass production and {{application of}} EPN- infected host <b>cadavers</b> for the field control of insect pests. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a <b>cadaver.</b> Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
5|$|In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe (Mark Damon) {{is a young}} nobleman {{who finds}} a {{beheaded}} corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, {{who has not been}} seen for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of the}} family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living <b>cadaver</b> who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car.

Eddie, the <b>cadaver</b> dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes and the Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, {{dissection}} remained entirely prohibited {{until the}} 16th century, when {{a series of}} royal edicts gave specific groups of physicians and surgeons some limited rights to dissect <b>cadavers.</b> The permission was quite limited: by the mid-18th century, the Royal College of Physicians and Company of Barber-Surgeons {{were the only two}} groups permitted to carry out dissections, and had an annual quota of ten <b>cadavers</b> between them. As a result of pressure from anatomists, especially in the rapidly growing medical schools, the Murder Act 1752 allowed the bodies of executed murderers to be dissected for anatomical research and education. By the 19th century this supply of <b>cadavers</b> proved insufficient, as the public medical schools were growing, and the private medical schools lacked legal access to <b>cadavers.</b> A thriving black market arose in <b>cadavers</b> and body parts, leading {{to the creation of the}} profession of body snatching, and the infamous Burke and Hare murders in 1828, when 16 people were murdered for their <b>cadavers,</b> to be sold to anatomists.

40|$|Background: Changes in UK {{legislation}} {{allow for}} surgical procedures {{to be performed}} on <b>cadavers.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to assess Thiel <b>cadavers</b> as high-fidelity simulators and to examine their suitability for surgical training. Methods: Surgeons from various specialties were invited to attend a 1 day dissection workshop using Thiel <b>cadavers.</b> The surgeons completed a baseline questionnaire on cadaveric simulation. At the end of the workshop, they completed a similar questionnaire based on their experience with Thiel <b>cadavers.</b> Comparing the answers in the pre- and post-workshop questionnaires assessed whether using Thiel <b>cadavers</b> had changed the surgeons’ opinions of cadaveric simulation. Results: According to the 27 participants, simulation is important for surgical training and a full-procedure model is beneficial for all levels of training. Currently, there is dissatisfaction with existing models and a need for high-fidelity alternatives. After the workshop, surgeons concluded that Thiel <b>cadavers</b> are suitable for surgical simulation (p = 0. 015). Thiel were found to be realistic (p < 0. 001) to have reduced odour (p = 0. 002) and be more cost-effective (p = 0. 003). Ethical constraints were considered to be small. Conclusion: Thiel <b>cadavers</b> are suitable for training in most surgical specialties...|$|R

5|$|Filmmaker George A. Romero {{was brought}} in with {{a vision of a}} zombie-style horror movie similar to Night of the Living Dead, but which also relied heavily upon {{elements}} of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II. Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens {{as a result of his}} preserved <b>cadaver</b> having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. The script then progresses to a fish-out-of-water story when Imhotep, having regained his youthful appearance, recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from. Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities, Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum. After escaping into the city sewer system, Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb. Romero's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers.|$|E
