5|$|The <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> the Common Pleas was {{the head}} of the Court of Common Pleas, also known as the Common Bench or Common Place, which was the second-highest common law court in the English legal system until 1875, when it, along with the other two common law courts and the equity and probate courts, became part of the High Court of Justice. As such, the <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> the Common Pleas was one of the highest {{judicial}} officials in England, behind only the Lord High Chancellor and the Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> England, who headed the Queen's Bench (King's when the monarch was male).|$|E

5|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The Court of Common Pleas thus ceased to exist, except as the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a quirk of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for {{the abolition of the}} Common Pleas Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> the Common Pleas becoming Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|In 1867 a {{commission}} {{was created to}} look into issues with the central courts, and the outcome were the Judicature Acts, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature, with the three central common law courts becoming {{three of the five}} divisions of the Supreme Court; this was not designed to be permanent, but rather to avoid having to retire or demote two of the three Chief Justices to allow a single head of the Supreme Court, as this would have violated the constitutional principle that senior justices were irremovable. By sheer chance Fitzroy Kelly and Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> England respectively both died in 1880, allowing the merger of the common law divisions of the Supreme Court into a single division, the Queen's Bench Division, under John Coleridge, who had been Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> the Common Pleas and became Lord <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>of</b> England, by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880.
