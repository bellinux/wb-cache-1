Luraschi was an Upstage veteran and had been a fringe member of Dr. Zoom.

The Shakes based their sound on Motown and Memphis and have been described as [...] "one of the great unsigned Asbury Park bands of the mid-1970s". In 1977 Lopez briefly moved to Maine where he reunited with Bill Chinnock and played on the latter's Badlands album.|$|R

30|$|For smallâmedium {{foundries}} (handling {{less than}} 2, 000 Â t per month of good casting), <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> cupolas (which uses the blast at atmospheric pressure and at normal environmental temperature) are common. In {{order to reduce}} the CO emission and increase the energy efficiency, the conversion of <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> furnaces to hot blast furnaces may be considered (this is economically justified only for bigger plants operating continuously). In hot blast cupolas, the combustion air (the âblastâ) is preheated typically by a recuperative heat exchanger. This involves the transfer of the residual heat of the flue gases (that can be at 900 â 1, 000 Â Â°C) to the combustion air by means of post-combustion of exhausts (collected {{at the top of the}} furnace, mixed with sufficient air and then burned in a unit) and the following heat exchange in a recuperator. Typically, the blast air is heated at temperatures of 500 â 600 Â Â°C. Above these temperatures, problems arise with the sintering of furnace dust on the surface of the recuperator. The effect of air preheating on thermal efficiency can be in the order of 5 Â % (the coke quality may affect the overall blast efficiency) [14, 15].|$|R
5000|$|The {{genesis of}} Shelby Iron Works {{also known as}} Shelby Iron Company dates back to December 29, 1842 when Horace Ware was able to {{purchase}} land south of Columbiana, AL from Green B. and Sara Seale. Today this site {{is known as the}} town of Shelby, Alabama. Horace Ware was also able to acquire timberland and hematite ore properties throughout Shelby County. With the acquisition of these materials Horace Ware began to build a <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> iron furnace. The Shelby Iron Works Company started with meager beginnings by only producing 5 tons of <b>cold</b> <b>blast</b> iron a day because of its capacity. The lone furnace stack was built out of brick and stone and only stood 30 feet high. [...] During the American Civil War, iron plating from the iron works was used on the CSS Tennessee, CSS Huntsville, and CSS Tuscaloosa, and in making cannons and shells manufactured by Churchill and Sons in Columbiana. The ironworks was connected to Columbiana by the Shelby Iron Company Railroad, which allowed the iron works to be connected to the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad. A detachment of General Emory Upton's division of Wilson's Raiders destroyed the ironworks on March 31, 1865.|$|R
