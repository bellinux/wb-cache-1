5000|$|Colors in the NCS {{are defined}} by three values, {{expressed}} in percentages, specifying the degree of blackness (= relative visual similarity to the black elementary color), <b>chromaticness</b> (= relative visual similarity to the [...] "strongest", most saturated, color you can think of), and hue (= relative similarity {{to two of the}} chromatic elementary colors red, yellow, green and blue, expressed in at most two percentages). No hue is considered to have visual similarity to both hues of an opponent pair; i.e. there is no [...] "redgreen" [...] or [...] "yellowblue". The blackness and the <b>chromaticness</b> together add up to {{less than or equal to}} 100%—their remainder from 100%, if any, gives the amount of whiteness.

40|$|To {{design a}} {{lighting}} environment, horizontal illuminance is generally {{used as the}} brightness of a room. But it is reported that a subjective brightness does not always match the horizontal illuminance. For example, the room furnished with high saturated colored objects is perceived brighter than the room furnished with achromatic objects, even though the horizontal illuminance is the same. To investigate a effect of interior <b>chromaticness</b> on space brightness, we conducted the experiment in four miniature rooms that were different in terms of <b>chromaticness</b> of interior decorating surfaces, but kept lightness of surfaces constant. Subjects were asked to set the illuminance of reference room, that is furnished with achromatic objects, to equate {{the brightness of the}} test room, that is with chromatic objects. Four of seven subjects needed less illuminance to get the equality of space brightness if the test room had a saturated objects. The illuminance ratio of test to reference room was about 1. 4. Other three subjects set the illuminance of reference room almost equal to test room. Thus, there are differences between individuals so further work would be needed to estimate the quantitative effect of interior <b>chromaticness</b> on space brightness...|$|E
40|$|An {{explanation}} of the Bezold-Brücke phenomenon is given {{in the framework of}} the Young-Helmholtz theory. It is assumed that the responses of the three independent receptor systems gradually increase to an end value with increasing stimulation. The sensitivity curves of the three systems are assumed to be those derived by Pitt. To account for the law of additivity of brightness it is necessary to make a distinction between a brightness information and a <b>chromaticness</b> information channel. The nonlinear relationship between response and stimulation of the several systems has to be applied in the latter channel. For wavelengths at the crossing points of Pitt's curves no hue change can be expected. This explains the invariable hue at 570 mμ. To account for the invariable hue at 476 mμ it is necessary to assume that the contribution of the blue system to <b>chromaticness,</b> its <b>chromaticness</b> valency, is about 10 times its brightness contribution. The third invariable hue at 508 mμ has to be considered as the hue at which the tendencies of the greens to shift toward yellow and toward blue are in balance. The theory is in accordance with the results of some measurements done in the purple region of the color diagram, where an invariable hue was also found...|$|E

This system can process a fuzzy input to a tone triangular system and output to a color on the RGB triangular system. Three input fuzzy sets (not black, white, and light) are applied to the tone triangle relationship.

40|$|In {{the project}} Greyness and spatial {{experience}} 1 we have studied visual qualities in grey/greyish colours “on location” in the - spatial - world around. We have {{carried out a}} number of observation series not only aiming to investigate variation of greyness in different spatial situations but also to develop a methodology and equipment for such studies. In this paper perception of greyness is discussed in relation to our own observations and to scientific and scholarly references. We make some basic reflections on colour in spatial context and in relation to traditional colour theory. In spatial context colours with low <b>chromaticness,</b> near the grey-scale, play a more significant role than distinctly chromatic colours; hence they are very important in design of built spaces, both exterior and interior. The logically balanced distribution of greyness in shadows and in surfaces against the light produces a spatial feeling of coherency, and greyish inherent colours generally form a subordinated background to colours with high <b>chromaticness.</b> Simultaneously greyness to a high degree conduces to differentiation of spatial experience; an over-all spatial experience of greyness normally offers subtle but distinct contrasts of hue. In the field of colour most scientific research deals with colour phenomena as such. If focusing on colour as spatial phenomenon, colour theory can be given theoretical connection to intuitive understanding of the world around and be part of a wider field of aesthetic research.  Grey Colours and Spatial Experience/ Konstfack, Research and development in the art...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that {{one and the same}} {{interior}} colouring will appear different in rooms with windows facing north or facing south, but it is not known how natural daylight from these two compass points affects perceived colour {{and the ways in which}} colour is experienced. The objective is to describe the perceived colours to be expected in rooms with sunlight and diffused light, and thus develop a tool for colour design. Two empirical investigations provide the basis for six attached papers. The model is exploratory with a qualitative character. One hundred and ninety-one studies were carried out with 79 observers in full-scale rooms, with double-glazed transparent room windows facing north or south. The NCS colour sample collection and colour terminology were used, with three yellow, red, blue and green hues in two nuances: whitish 1010 and more chromatic 1030. The walls were painted in a total of 23 selected inherent colours with each colour observed in up to 10 studies. Colour matching was achieved using a colour reference box and results were analysed with the aid of the terms inherent colour and identity colour. The colour reference box was tested in a separate study to investigate any methodological problems. Room character was described using semantic differentials, and data was processed using the SPSS statistics program. Verbal description using own words was applied in a descriptive and reflecting method to find sensory differences and precise, yet ordinary descriptions. Colour differences between rooms were assessed using verbal description of hue and nuance, and a supplementary method with specified colour samples. Emotional impressions of colour and rooms were assessed using a method describing primary emotions and the results were compared with results from another study using small colour samples. The colouring that enhanced or neutralised room light situation was compared as regards emotional impression and thereafter compared with results from another study. Daylight from the different compass points caused a clear shift in hue and nuance. The perceived colour was consistently more chromatic and more blackish than the inherent colour used. Nuance 1010 shifted more in <b>chromaticness</b> than nuance, while 1030 instead increased most in <b>chromaticness.</b> Even minor colour differences resulted in major differences in colour experience. The north-facing room in yellowish colours shifted towards reduced yellowishness in both hue and <b>chromaticness.</b> Indications were that north-facing rooms in reddish blue become more reddish than south-facing rooms.

40|$|In {{the first}} {{experiment}} {{we found that}} the apparent stratification of two superimposed diamonds, i. e. which of the two diamond appears transparent and in front, can be inverted by changing the hue and/or the <b>chromaticness</b> of the intersection area, and that the apparent stratification significantly depends on the chromatic similarity between the colour of this area and the colours of both the adjacent areas. The hue of the background seemed to have no effect in the diamond stratification. In the second experiment results confirmed that the chromatic aspects of the background colours are irrelevant in determining the stratification of the diamonds, but only rather large luminance differences are necessary to affect it, in agreement with the results by Masin (2000). We can then concluded that in phenomenal transparency the luminance channel plays a predominant role as respect to the chromatic one, but when colours are equiluminant chromatic similarity is crucial in the intersection area of the two overlapping figures...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} part of {{the research}} project Greyness and spatial experience. Its main objective is to discuss the concept of neutral grey and to investigate the preconditions for perceiving neutral grey colours in different situations. Neutral grey is defined as having similarity only to black and white, not to the chromatic elementary colours. Greyish colour samples have been observed with different backgrounds and in different light. One of these series is presented in detail in the paper, the conclusions from others are considered in the discussion, together with relevant literature. Greyish colours are seldom perceived as neutral, but rather tend to get a perceived hue, which depends on the observation situation. Inherent neutral grey colours are not found in nature. In production of materials and artefacts no tolerance level can assure a total lack of hue. In conclusion we suggest that neutral grey {{should be considered as}} an abstraction, its unique but in practice unobtainable quality lying in its absolute lack of hue and <b>chromaticness.</b>  Greyness and Spatial Experience/ Konstfack, Research and development in the art...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on our own}} {{observations}} and on scientific and scholarly references this paper discusses the appearance of colour constancy and the adaptation of colour and lightness in space. It presents {{part of an ongoing}} work, the aim of which is to formulate a spatially based colour knowledge. Our scientific approach is holistic and mainly directed towards colour and light phenomena as such, not towards underlying physiological processes. Earlier research has discussed lightness perception in colours very near neutral grey, with so low <b>chromaticness</b> that you can ignore the hue. In our research we have found that surfaces with nominally chromatic colours under special circumstances can be perceived as white and thus serve as anchors for perception of other colours in the field of vision. We also discuss how distinctions are made between perceived colours caused by on the light colour and such caused by the surface qualities. What we call adaptation is not limited to basic perception. Experience of colour in space is both perceptive and cognitive, as part of interaction between the individual and the world on many levels.  SYN-TES: Human colour and light synthesis.

40|$|Part I of {{this article}} found, inter alia, that chroma resembles log {{inverted}} luminance. This article develops three math models of Munsell chroma and associated colorfulness from (1) inverted luminous reflectance Y, (2) inverted chromatic luminance, and (3) inverted chromatic luminance combined (over the mid-spectrum 480 – 580 nm) with the unimodal curve for spectral absorptance of M cones. The first two models are simple but of limited accuracy and demonstrate that inverted luminance (of any form) cannot fully account for varying relative chroma around the hue cycle, particularly the minor minimum and maximum about 490 and 520 nm (which also feature in B:L functions). The third model is rather complex but very accurate, apparently the only accurate model of Munsell chroma or other experimentally based scales of relative <b>chromaticness</b> in the literature. It adjusts to any level of luminance or purity, as demonstrated for several levels. Three models of brightness (B:L ratio) for 2 ⁰ field aperture colors are given, based on either Munsell chroma or log inverted chromatic luminance. The former provides two accurate and simple models of the CIE B:L function: (1) log chroma = B:L ratio ± 0. 1, and (2) (chroma/k) x = B:L ratio ± 0. 1. The latter also predicts B:L for nonspectral colors and those of lower purities, e. g., object colors. The results finally solve the relationship between brightness and chroma and demonstrate that B:L ratio (a contrast in constant luminance) arises directly from chroma (also a form of contrast in constant luminance), or the reverse. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The Amish {{religious}} movement {{have its}} roots in the Protestant Reformation in the 16 th century. The Amish people are anabaptists and have strict rules for their way of life. They were persecuted in Europe and Amish groups emigrated to Pennsylvania. Today the most traditional part of the movement – the Old Amish People – lives in Lancaster County west of Philadelphia, USA. This paper describs a study of the colours in Old Amish Quilts, traditional Amish patchwork quilts used as bed covers. The patches are single-coloured fabric pieces forming clear symmetrical patterns with deep and strong colours. The quilts are important in Amish culture; they are made for the bride’s wedding chest. Nowadays traditional Amish quilts also are made for turists as wall decorations – “wallhangings”. The selection of quilts for my survey consists of five Old Amish Quilts from Lancaster Heritage Museum and The American Quilt Study Group, 15 quilts, at that time, belonging to The Esprit Collection and eight new quilts with traditional patterns (wallhangings). The colour analysis was carried out using Natural Colour System (NCS) with the aim of identifying general principles for selection of colours. The analysis shows that most hues are located in {{the lower part of the}} colour circle ・from red (R) to green (G), and most nuances - with relatively high degree of blackness or <b>chromaticness</b> - in the lower part of the colour triangle. Colour choice is often dependent on moral or religious preferences. For example, in quilts from Lancaster County, yellowish colours are - as representing ・hochmut・ (arrogance) - regarded as bad colour choice. The strong colours in Old Amish Quilts have no counterpart in public life. In Lancaster county Amish people wear black, brown and dark blue clothes and their wagons are black; colourfulness is restricted to the bedrooms and the private sphere...|$|E
40|$|Four studies {{including}} ten experiments adresses {{interrelations between}} some major and classical issues in visual perception: 3 -D perception, colour constancy, colour perception and colour vision deficiencies. The main experimental paradigm {{to investigate the}} issues is within that of simulated shape from shading. 3 -D impressions are induced by projecting space-modulated illuminations onto flat surfaces (displays), varying the colours and layout of the displays and the colour and modulation of the illumination. Study I includes four experiments investigating three types of space- modulated illumination. All experiments confirmed earlier findings that chromatic colour and complex display layout with reflectance edges crossed by illumination edges enhances shape from shading. In Study II the impressions of shape from shading and real 3 -D objects were compared between persons with deutan colour vision deficiencies and normals. As predicted, the deutans show fewer and less distinct 3 -D impressions in situations with their specific "problem colours" red and green. They also show a generally lower tendency for 3 -D impressions, interpreted as a generally weaker colour constancy. Study III presents the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon; a novel twofold ambiguous shape from shading situation, continuously alternating between two different 3 -D impressions coupled with different colour attributions. One solution is of an object with two clear surface colours, the other one of an object with greyish (desaturated) colours in coloured illumination which means classical colour constancy. The phenomenon illustrates the visual processes of separating reflectance and illumination characteristics and may provide a useful experimental setting to study colour constancy. In Study IV the AMBEGUJAS phenomenon {{is found to be}} robust as to <b>chromaticness</b> and different luminance contrasts for both normals and deutans. However, the deutans show slower shifts between percepts and a less pronounced desaturation of colour, which indicates a weaker colour constancy. The studies add evidence to the contribution of colour to 3 -D shape perception, validated in a novel way by the results on "colour-blinds". The AMBEGUJAS phenomenon provides further support that the factors affecting shape from shading and the deutans different impressions are to be understood with reference to colour constancy. The deutans different impressions compared to normals are remarkable per se, but probably with very limited implications to everyday life. Diss.

40|$|This {{research}} project has two goals. One {{is to understand}} the third dimension of colour scales describing the extent of chromatic contents such as saturation, vividness, <b>chromaticness</b> and colourfulness, which are less widely used than the other dimensions, e. g. lightness and hue. With that in mind, the first aim of this work is to derive new models that may serve {{as an alternative to}} the third-dimension scale of colour appearance on the basis of colorimetric values. The second goal is to develop important scales, blackness and whiteness. They are widely used because of the popularity of the NCS system. To achieve the first goal, a psychophysical experiment for scaling 15 attributes (Korean corresponding words of “bright”, “light-heavy”, “active-passive”, “fresh-stale”, “clean-dirty”, “clear”, “boring”, “natural-not natural”, “warm-cool”, “intense-weak”, “saturated”, “vivid-dull”, “distinct-indistinct”, “full-thin” and “striking”) using the NCS colour samples was carried out with Korean observers. Each sample was presented in a viewing cabinet in a darkened room. Naive observers were asked to scale each sample using a categorical judgement method. From the results, two scales widely used to represent the third dimension were identified: saturation and vividness. The same samples were assessed by British observers using these two scales. There was a great similarity between the results of the British and Korean observers. Subsequently, more samples were included to scale not only the new third dimension scales (saturation and vividness) but also whiteness and blackness scales. In total, 120 samples were scaled for saturation, vividness and whiteness experiments, and 110 samples were scaled for a blackness experiment. Four sets of models were developed for each of the three colour spaces (CIELAB, CIECAM 02 and CAM 02 -UCS). Type one was based on the ellipsoid equation. Type two was based on the hue-dependent model proposed by Adams (called “the hue-based model”). Each of the above two types was used to fit the present experimental (Cho) data and the NCS data, which were measured using a spectrophotometer. In total, 39 models were developed. The newly developed models were tested using the Cho and NCS datasets. The models that were based on the present visual data were tested using the NCS data. Similarly, the models developed from the NCS data were tested using the present visual data. The results showed that both types of models predicted visual data well. This means that the two sets of data showed good agreement. It is also proposed that the four scales (saturation, vividness, blackness and whiteness) based on CIECAM 02 developed here are highly reliable...|$|E
