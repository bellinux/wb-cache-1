40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{work is to}} discuss the various forces/ factors that affect the business environment of Ghana which impacts investing in marketing and processing of cocoa beans in Ghana. In order to determine or classify Ghana as an attractive destination or otherwise to invest in <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing there {{is the need to}} discuss the prevailing macro business environmental forces which little is known about to investors, managers and policy makers in cocoa trade. These mentioned parties have been under increasing pressures to assess the various forces prevailing in Ghana before considering investing in <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing in Ghana. The work therefore looks as the various macro environmental factors Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Physical Environment and Legal (PESTEL) forces in Ghana’s business environment which impacts <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing which makes Ghana an attractive base or otherwise to invest in <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing.   Research Questions: The specific questions that the research aims at solving are as follows: what are the external and environmental forces that will influence investing in <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing in Ghana? Is Ghana a safe and attractive base to invest in <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing?   Research method: In carrying this research I made use of both secondary and primary data. Primary data was gathered through face interviews and administrating questionnaires to illicit response from stakeholders in Ghana’s cocoa. The paper also presents a review of literature on PESTEL which has influence or features in Ghana’s business environment which are important in <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing.   Research Findings: Empirical findings and review of PESTEL model reported in the work suggests that the PESTEL will impact on the strategy of organizations and policy makers who are into <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing. Also gives suggestions on how the various environmental forces (PESTEL) will be applied to further improve upon the business environment which makes marketing and processing of cocoa in Ghana attractive.   Research Implications and Limitations: The discussions and analyses of the macro environmental forces prevailing in Ghana’s business environment which impacts <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> produces a frame work to analyze current threats and opportunities in Ghana’s business environment which impacts <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing for people contemplating on investing in marketing and processing of cocoa in Ghana as well as other practical lessons for policy makers in cocoa. The work overlooks the micro environmental forces in Ghana that impacts <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> and processing. Further research into such area will help give an understanding of the micro factors that impact the business environment of Ghana. Also the work has a limited empirical data base as most information gathered were inconsistent and unreliable which raises concerns about investment information.

The main issue {{in improving the}} quality of cocoa, primarily in Blitar, and Jembrana, lies not in the lack of capacity of the processing industry, but rather on a strong commitment to implement fermentation seriously. Research objectives were to know the management of cocoa products, the marketing of cocoa at the farm level, and possible vertical integration between traders and farmers. Determining the location of the research used the purposive methods. There were in Blitar, and Jembrana, the both were center cocoa production areas in the East Java and Bali province. The sampling method used the snowing ball method. Data analysis was used the descriptive analysis and vertical integration of market used the concentration ratio analysis. The result of the research showed that most small farmers who do fermentation, the main factor, there were no pricing incentive for fermented cocoa.

40|$|Ghana’s <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> {{system has}} {{performed}} impressively {{over the past}} decade. Cocoa production has reached record high levels. Farmers receive a relatively large share of export earnings. Product quality is world renowned, and it regularly exceeds the most stringent international standards. Exports are handled professionally and efficiently. International loans are repaid reliably. Internal marketing is relatively uncorrupt and effective. This is a home-grown success story, under the stewardship of a state-run marketing board – the Cocobod – which manages almost {{all aspects of the}} internal <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> process and maintains a monopoly on cocoa exports. Given the dismal history of African commodity marketing boards in general, and of Ghana’s <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> board in particular, this success demands explanation. It was not the result of radical transformation but of relatively subtle changes in the system that maintained the undoubted benefits of a centralised monopoly while minimising its damaging consequences. Success resulted from (1) building on the underlying strength of certain elements in the system, notably quality control and export management, (2) an episode of well-directed reform, and (3) effective policies and organisational structures that protected the farmers’ share of the cocoa revenues over time and inhibited the Cocobod returned to the politicisation it suffered in the past. The case accords with the much-touted but oft-neglected lesson that both context and institutions matter for organisational performance. In particular, complementary contexts and institutions can produce valuable synergies. More substantively, it suggests that poorly performing organisations in Africa may be turned around without radical measures.

40|$|Within {{the last}} twenty years the link between market {{organisation}} and development has come under increased scrutiny in response to the implementation of World Bank liberalisation policies across many of sub-Saharan Africa's agriculture markets. Under the neoliberal teachings of the Washington Consensus, liberalised markets have replaced systems of government control, with disappointing results. Recognising the challenges created by the universal implementation of liberalisation policies, the attention of development economists, including the World Bank, has now turned to alternative modes of market organisation. In light of this, the following study aims to contribute to the post Washington Consensus understanding of market development through a detailed exploration of the Ghanaian <b>cocoa</b> <b>market</b> as an alternative model for market organisation within sub-Saharan agriculture. The Ghanaian <b>cocoa</b> <b>market</b> has been selected because, in contrast with its fully liberalised cocoa producing neighbours, Ghana has only undergone partial liberalisation. The Ghanaian Cocoa Board [Cocobod] maintains control over several functions across both the domestic and international dimensions of the Ghanaian cocoa chain. Given the span of the Cocobod's influence along the Ghanaian cocoa chain, it has been necessary to develop a cross disciplinary theoretical framework, using New Institutional Economics for a microanalysis of the domestic cocoa chain, and Global Value Chain analysis for a macro-analysis of the international cocoa chain. Building on a critique of the universalism inherent within the Washington Consensus, methodologically this study has attempted to achieve an in-depth understanding of the Ghanaian <b>cocoa</b> <b>market.</b> In line with the ontological approach of critical realism, this has involved the use of semi-structured qualitative interviews, throughout two independent rounds of research in Ghana. Interview data has been systematically organised and interpreted using the approach of template analysis. Based on the construction of six final templates it has been possible to deduce that direct government intervention in the areas of quality control, enforcement and a monopoly over cocoa exports appear to be having a positive impact upon market development in Ghana. Equally, it has been observed that the Cocobod may be failing to leverage the potential of private sector investment, as it struggles to adapt to partial liberalisation. In closing it is recommended that future research into models of partial liberalisation should be pursued {{based on the results of}} this study. ...|$|E

Planting and short-run supply equations are estimated for each producer country in addition to the world demand equation. Using these estimates, a partial-equilibrium model of the global <b>cocoa</b> <b>market</b> is developed to analyze alternative export tax regimes and their implications for welfare in cocoa-producing countries. Although a move to free trade in cocoa would benefit consumers of chocolate, producer countries can increase their welfare substantially by following Nash strategy in setting export taxes. Finally, it is shown that producing countries cannot afford to ignore the reactions of other countries when contemplating different policy options...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the effects of export {{instability}} on post-war Ghana by seeking to identify the mechanism through which fluctuations were transmitted from the export to the domestic sector. This involves the construction and estimation of a macroeconomic model over the period 1956 to 1969, and the analysis of its dynamic properties by means of simulation. It is intended to extend our knowledge in this area of development economics by switching the focus of analysis to a time-series basis and demonstrating how the consequences of fluctuations in exports depend critically on the structural characteristics of an economy and the assumptions made about behaviour under uncertainty. We believe that this provides both the basis of an alternative methodology to the one currently in use, and a detailed investigation of one particular economy. In chapter 1 we present some background to the debate and outline the methodological framework employed. It includes a critical review of the literature, some historical background on Ghana, the reasons for its selection as a case-study; and an explanation of the-Methodology adopted in this study. In chapter 2 the general nature of the <b>cocoa</b> <b>market</b> is discussed, a model of the <b>cocoa</b> <b>market</b> is constructed and estimated, and its linkages with the Ghanaian economy explLained. In chapter 3, a macroeconomic model for Ghana is estimated and discussed in the light of hypotheses about the transmission of e sport fluctuations. In chapter 4, this model is simulated to investigate its dynamic properties and to quantify the implications of export market fluctuations.

50|$|Historically Nigeria's <b>cocoa</b> {{production}} was <b>marketed</b> through a monopsony by marketing boards {{created by the}} government.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} market {{participants}} called into question {{the efficiency of the}} price discovery mechanism in commodity futures markets. They believe that speculators move commodity futures markets away from their fundamentals by distorting prices and exacerbating volatility.

In the last decades, speculators open interest is increased by nearly 4 times, fuelling the apprehension of practitioners and market analysts. This paper evaluates the efficiency of the price discovery mechanism in <b>cocoa</b> futures <b>markets.</b> Results show that the price discovery mechanism in both LIFFE and NYBOT <b>cocoa</b> futures <b>markets</b> is efficient. In addition, they rule out the existence of any casual relationship between speculative activity and cocoa prices (i. e. level and volatility) at the least for the NYBOT. This evidence supports the hypothesis that successful speculators are reacting quicker than any other market participant to new information emerging from the market. That is why profitable speculative buying (selling) occurs just before the market makes a move. futures markets, efficient market hypothesis, speculation, Marketing,...|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} of Sulawesi's <b>cocoa</b> <b>market</b> is a {{counterpoint}} to investigations of highly regulated markets - agricultural and otherwise. The Indonesian island's rapid expansion surprised the world <b>cocoa</b> <b>market,</b> especially because it came mostly from smallholders. The authors examine the smallholders'production and marketing systems and the government policies implemented for smallholders to identify any policy lessons that might be useful for other countries. Following is {{a brief description of}} what they found: 1) the following factors contributed to the rapid expansion: the availability of suitable land, low production costs, a highly competitive marketing system, relatively good transport infrastructure, favorable macroeconomic policies, and the smallholders'entrepreneurship; 2) until the recent imposition of a value-added tax, Indonesia's government left cocoa marketing and distribution freer of government interventions than many other commodities. Other commodities were affected by direct involvement of the National Logistics Agency, price controls, and exclusive trade licensing requirements; 3) {{as a result of the}} competitive cocoa marketing system, the farmgate price of cocoa in Indonesia is about 90 percent of the f. o. b price - a much higher share than cocoa produced in other countries and than other commodities produced in Indonesia. This relatively free marketing and distribution system must be maintained for cocoa to develop further; and 4) some general government policies have benefited the cocoa subsector as well as others. Exchange rates have been kept competitive, such as the absence of export tax and the building of basic infrastructure in the outer islands. Several issues must be addressed for cocoa to be further developed: the quality of cocoa, the adding-up problem (export revenues not increasing in proportion to export quantities), the recently imposed value-added tax, the cocoa pod-borer, export marketing, research, retribution, local repressing, environmental problems, and governmental interventions now being discussed for cocoa sector. Government and industry must also resist the natural temptation for current players to become more conservative, to protect their interests.

40|$|Liberalization of West African <b>cocoa</b> <b>markets,</b> {{following}} {{structural adjustment}} reforms, {{resulted in the}} elimination of parastatal marketing boards to promote greater pass-though of world prices to farmers. Concerns about subsequent effects on farmgate prices, farmer income, and marketing channel competitiveness have been raised. This research estimates the extent of non-competitive behavior in West African <b>cocoa</b> <b>markets</b> and investigates implications of these findings on policy prescriptions. ^ Cameroon served {{as a case study}} to examine farmgate transactions. A survey was conducted to collect data to investigate price transmission. Imperfect price transmission was found between world and farmgate prices. Regression results suggest that marketing margins are significantly influenced by institutional variables, indicating that the farmgate market is not competitive. Itinerant buyers exert market power against farmers while marketing cooperatives have significant countervailing power. ^ A conjectural variations approach was adopted to estimate the degree of market power present in <b>cocoa</b> <b>markets</b> of Ivory Coast and Nigeria. Evidence of market power was found between buying centers and ports in Ivory Coast. Market power, exercised in part by multinational exporters, must be considered in concert with the Ivorian government, which still collects non-trivial export taxes. Ivorian civil war appears to have rent-reducing effects. No evidence of market power was found in Nigeria. ^ Suggested policies to increase farmer income, such as export taxes, Fair Trade, and cooperatives were examined in a partial equilibrium framework. The model incorporated prevailing market conditions; variants compared outcomes under competitive, imperfectly competitive, and price transmission cases. These initiatives suffer from problems common to agricultural policies. If policies provide incentives for supply expansion, then farmgate prices are driven downward (Fair Trade). Fair Trade type premiums help farmers more if decoupled from supply and demand. Farmers benefit only partially from export tax reduction in a large country (Ivory Coast), but lose when a small country (Cameroon) introduces export taxes. Cooperatives {{have a positive effect on}} member income, but at the expense of non-members. Consumers stand to gain more than farmers if demand is indeed more inelastic than supply. While these policies may benefit targeted farmers, market interactions diminish benefits to farmers overall. ...|$|R

40|$|Some part of {{this study}} was covered by Dr. S. O. Adeyeye. His work {{published}} in 1978 concentrated on a general overview of cooperative movement in Nigeria. Since his work, there has been remarkably little or no research into the development of <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Marketing</b> Cooperatives' policies. A review of this study shows that Adeyeye carried out a historical work which did not account for the emergence of <b>cocoa</b> <b>marketing</b> policies {{during the early years of}} self government in Nigeria and what effect these policies had on the cooperatives' ability to practice their principle of democratic control. Our study is an attempt to fill in this important part of Marketing Coperatives' history. The theoretical part reviewed the conceptual framework of cooperative ideals and principles which enabled us to examine the operational policies of <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Marketing</b> Cooperatives in Nigeria, against the cooperatives' principle of democratic control. Our finding is that the adoption of cooperatives' principle of democratic control was not encouraged by the Governments who took the responsibility of promoting cooperatives in Nigeria, There was no provision for basic training in democratic procedure which is essential for any cooperative to be an independent viable organisation. The absence of cooperative education culminated in corruption and inefficient administration of the cooperative which was widespread over the period under study. Finally, the study acknowledges the difficulties of applying the cooperative principles in a real world, but recommended that it is of the utmost importance that cooperative organisations as they try to survive in a real world, should find new ways of putting principles into practice because the principles enable any cooperative organisation to fulfil the basis of its formation, that is, the promotion of members interests. The principle of democratic control to some extent indicates who the members are and allows them the right to determine for themselves what is their common need and how the need would mutually be met. The idea of the cooperative was born out of ideally felt need of members. It is a means of self help through mutual help, hence members should participate actively in all activities of the organization. The methodology applied to this study includes descriptive analysis, field work, archival and documentary research, informal discussion and the author's personal observations...|$|R
