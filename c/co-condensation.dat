5000|$|The {{other two}} {{synthesis}} methods used for these materials are post-synthetic grafting and <b>co-condensation.</b> [...] In {{the case of}} post-synthetic grafting, organic functional groups, typically organosilanes or alkoxyorganosilanes, are reacted with the assembled silicon mesostructure {{with or without the}} surfactant template present. If the template is still present, the grafting process will involve simultaneously removing the template and attaching the functional group. However, the pores of the material can be blocked during this process so a one-pot synthesis using the necessary components is more advantageous. This one-pot synthesis is known as <b>co-condensation,</b> in which the desired organosilyl functional groups are combined with the surfactant or other structure-directing agent. In this method, the material becomes structured and functionalized. <b>Co-condensation</b> gives rise to periodicity with the mesostructure, and it accommodates larger organic groups as well as larger pore sizes because of the one-step assembly process. Most PMOs have been made using the <b>co-condensation</b> method. The most recent method developed builds on <b>co-condensation</b> by combining multiple reactive organic precursors to form a new functional group, which is still combined with the framework molecule and copolymer. [...] Mesoporous organosilicate materials have been made using bridged organic precursors, in which an organic fragment is positioned between silicon-containing fragments. Single precursor syntheses are typically done with bridged organosilane groups. When only one bridged organic precursor is used, there is a homogeneous distribution of the molecule in the framework. This phenomenon is referred to as molecular-scale periodicity. Chiral precursors can also be introduced into the material framework, and using acidic conditions in the hydrolysis and condensation process proves better for chiral precursors because no racemization occurs. <b>Co-condensation</b> of multiple organosilane precursors can create multi-functional organosilica materials. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) is a common silicon precursor used in <b>co-condensation</b> reactions.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{methods used}} to make {{mesoporous}} organosilicas are evaporation-induced self-assembly, surfactant-mediated synthesis, post-synthetic grafting, and <b>co-condensation.</b> Organosilicas with amorphous structures are typically made by functionalizing organic groups rather than directly integrating the functional groups in the framework, which produces a periodic structure. [...] Furthermore, basic hydrolytic conditions typically produce a periodic structure because of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between hydrolyzed precursors that then self-assemble.|$|E
50|$|Early {{mesoporous}} organosilicas developed had organic groups attached terminally to {{the silica}} surface. They were prepared either by grafting of organic group onto the channel walls or by template-directed <b>co-condensation.</b> For example, by modifying the channels of PMSs with alkanethiol groups that could sequester heavy metals. However, {{there were some}} major limitations like, inhomogeneity of the pores compared to PMSs, and limited organic content (around 25% {{with respect to the}} silicon wall sites).|$|E
5000|$|Surfactant-mediated {{synthesis}} {{has been}} widely used {{for the production of}} mesoporous materials in general, and PMOs specifically,. [...] It involves the addition of a surfactant or copolymer to a specific molecular precursor. The surfactant directs the structure of the material by interacting with the precursor {{in such a way that}} is dependent on the properties of the precursor. After the bulk structure is assembled, the surfactant is removed, leaving pores, or channels, embedded in the material framework. The surfactant template can be removed by solvent extraction or ion-exchange mechanisms. An aging process is usually performed at high temperature before removal of the surfactant. [...] During surfactant-mediated synthesis, hydrolysis and polycondensation, or <b>co-condensation,</b> are used to fuse precursor molecules in a framework. [...] Acidic or basic conditions are used for the hydrolysis depending on the precursor being introduced.|$|E
50|$|Ionosilicas are {{synthesized}} by hydrolysis-polycondensation reactions or post synthesis grafting procedures involving ionic precursors. Due {{to their}} mixed mineral-ionic nature, ionosilicas are {{situated at the}} interface of silica hybrid materials and ionic liquids. Similarly to conventional functional silica based materials, two classes of ionosilicas can be distinguished, depending {{of the way the}} ionic group is anchored to the silica support and where it is located. Surface functionalized ionosilicas contain ionic groups located on the materials’ surface and can be obtained either via ‘one-pot’ <b>co-condensation</b> reactions or post grafting procedures. On the other side, periodic mesoporous ionosilicas, belonging to the PMO family, are produced starting from oligosilylated ionic precursors. Ionosilicas are synthesized via hydrolysis-polycondensation reactions involving ionic precursors. The ionic nature of these compounds has deep influence on the mechanism of the formation of the solid. Ionosilicas with regular architectures are often formed in the presence of anionic surfactants. This behaviour displays the formation of precursor-surfactant ion pairs in the hydrolysis polycondensation mixture.|$|E

40|$|Snowpack is a {{multiphase}} (photo) chemical reactor that strongly {{influences the}} air composition in polar and snow-covered regions. Snowpack plays a special {{role in the}} nitrogen cycle, {{as it has been}} shown that nitrate undergoes numerous recycling stages (including photolysis) in the snow before being permanently buried in the ice. However, the current understanding of these physicochemical processes remains very poor. Several modelling studies have attempted to reproduce (photo) chemical reactions inside snow grains, but these have relied on strong assumptions to characterise snow reactive properties, which are not well defined. Air–snow exchange processes such as adsorption, solid-state diffusion, or <b>co-condensation</b> also affect snow chemical composition. Here, we present a physically based model of these processes for nitrate. Using as input a 1 -year-long time series of atmospheric nitrate concentration measured at Dome C, Antarctica, our model reproduces with good agreement the nitrate measurements in the surface snow. By investigating the relative importance of the main exchange processes, this study shows that, on the one hand, the combination of bulk diffusion and <b>co-condensation</b> allows a good reproduction of the measurements (correlation coefficient r [*]=[*] 0. 95), with a correct amplitude and timing of summer peak concentration of nitrate in snow. During winter, nitrate concentration in surface snow is mainly driven by thermodynamic equilibrium, whilst the peak observed in summer is explained by the kinetic process of <b>co-condensation.</b> On the other hand, the adsorption of nitric acid on the surface of the snow grains, constrained by an already existing parameterisation for the isotherm, fails to fit the observed variations. During winter and spring, the modelled concentration of adsorbed nitrate is respectively 2. 5 and 8. 3 -fold higher than the measured one. A strong diurnal variation driven by the temperature cycle and a peak occurring in early spring are two other major features that do not match the measurements. This study clearly demonstrates that <b>co-condensation</b> is the most important process to explain nitrate incorporation in snow undergoing temperature gradient metamorphism. The parameterisation developed for this process can now be used as a foundation piece in snowpack models to predict the inter-relationship between snow physical evolution and snow nitrate chemistry...|$|E

30|$|Two {{commonly}} applied {{methods for}} {{the introduction of}} functional groups onto the silica surface are <b>co-condensation</b> and post-grafting of functional silanes. Both the methods have certain drawbacks associated with them. The post-synthesis grafting method results in inhomogeneity of the functional group {{on the surface of}} the nanoparticles. This is because the organic moieties (functional groups) are concentrated near the entries of the mesopores and the exterior surfaces [18]. The second most commonly used for functionalization of nanoparticles is the co-hydrolysis of organosilanes with a tetraalkoxysilicate. Using the co-hydrolysis techniques, silica particles with surface vinyl [19, 20], carboxylate [21], amine [22], dihydroimidazole [23], pyridine [15], and quaternary amine [15] have been developed. <b>Co-condensation</b> reactions of organotrialkoxysilanes and TEOS at various molar ratios were carried out by Mann and co-workers [24] to covalently link organo-functionalities such as phenyl, allyl, mercapto, amino, cyano, perfluoro, or dinitrophenylamino moieties to the core-shell nanostructures of Au coated with functionalized silica.

This method allows the introduction of organic fluorophore with the preservation of uniform mesoscale channels, high specific, surface areas, and large pore volumes.

30|$|The idea of {{the present}} {{research}} was to use the possibility of β-cyclodextrin activation under mild conditions for preparing functionalized MCM- 41 -type silica materials with hexagonally ordered mesoporous structure. Here, two principal methods were exploited for β-cyclodextrin-containing MCM- 41 silicas producing: postsynthesis attachment to the support by covalent bond formation or sol-gel synthesis using β-cyclodextrin-containing silane.

FT-IR, NMR, TG and elemental analysis results confirm the incorporation of both the bridging ethylene group and the pendant aminopropyl group in the materials. XPS analyses show that most of the protonated amine groups can be converted to free amine groups by base treatment. Moreover, the highly ordered structure was retained after the base treatment. The hybrid materials show high activity in the nitroaldol reaction of benzaldehyde with nitromethane (conversion > 99 %, selectivity > 98 %) and can be recycled. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
