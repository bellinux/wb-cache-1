500|$|The initial design had two islands {{with the}} flight deck running between them. Each island {{contained}} one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were <b>connected</b> <b>by</b> <b>braces</b> and the bridge was mounted {{on top of the}} bracing, which left a clear height of [...] for the aircraft on {{the flight deck}}. Fairly early in the design process, {{the decision was made to}} delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.|$|E
40|$|Semi-submersible {{floating}} platforms used in {{the offshore}} deepwater environment have hull structures that are comprised of vertical cylinders (columns) <b>connected</b> <b>by</b> <b>braces,</b> pontoons, etc. Several of the connections between these various members are susceptible to fatigue damage. In fatigue damage assessment or fatigue reliability analysis, a global structural response analysis is typically carried out using a finite element model where internal forces or stresses in the various members are evaluated for specified sea states of interest at the site. Of specific interest {{in this study is}} the fatigue reliability analysis of brace-column connection details in a semi-submersible hull unit for selected Brazilian environmental conditions. Stress concentration factors for the selected critical hot spots are applied to the nominal component stresses due to axial forces and biaxial bending. The hot-spot stress response spectra are used with various spectral methods—referred to as Rayleigh, Modified Rayleigh (with bandwidth correction), and Dirlik—to estimate fatigue damage using Miner’s rule. Uncertainty estimates in fatigue damage rates and life based on the various methodologies are discussed and critical sea states are identified, highlighting dynamic and quasi-static influences on the predicted fatigue...|$|E

These abutments were originally made for a timber truss superstructure, which lasted only 33 years. The timber deck has a single layer of longitudinal planking on timber cross beams, which are bolted to the flanges of the truss top chords. The single span is 29 metres long with a deck 6.1 metres wide, later widened to 7.3 metres. The wrought-iron lattice-girder trusses are of unusually light construction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} make the actual state of the bridge into the ideal state of maximum, we make {{real-time}} monitoring in the key parts of the bridge, and adjust to the design of the data to ensure the safety and reliability of arch bridge in the course of construction. Combined with the construction monitoring of the Sihe Bridge, this paper introduces the main bridge construction process on the large span tied arch bridge. Based on the construction monitoring of Sihe Bridge, this paper introduces the main contents and methods of monitoring point location, monitoring control of construction process, and discussed the construction monitoring technology of long-span X-style tied arch bridge. 1 Engineering Survey The main bridge of Sihe Bridge consists double-basket handle tied arch and V type rigid frame bridge pier. The bridge adopts symmetrical layout of 30 m+ 120 m+ 30 m. The main arch rib is seated on the vertical plane, and the rise-to-span ratio is 1 / 3. 85. The side arch rib is located in the inclined plane which intersects the vertical plane at 8 °, and the rise-to-span ratio is 1 / 3. 81. The V type rigid frame of the bridge pier contains the main and the auxiliary rigid frame, which <b>connected</b> <b>by</b> beam on lateral aspect. The main and the auxiliary arch rib <b>connected</b> <b>by</b> lateral <b>braces</b> are <b>connected</b> to the beams of the V type rigid frame at the position of arch springing. Traffic lane girder with a span of 4. 2 m adopts precast reinforced concrete π type beam, whose way of connection is simple-supported after consolidation. The beam is of variable cross-section prestressed concrete structure, the length range from 55 m as the longest to 47. 9 m as the shortest Suspender. The overall layout of the bridge is show...|$|R
