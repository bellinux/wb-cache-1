40|$|AbstractStonecutters and Sutong Bridge {{have pushed}} the world record for main span length of {{cable-stayed}} bridges to over 1000 m. The design of these bridges, both located in typhoon prone regions, is strongly influenced by wind effects during their erection. Rigorous wind tunnel test programmes have been devised and {{executed to determine the}} aerodynamic behaviour of the structures in the most critical erection conditions. Testing was augmented by analytical and numerical analyses to verify the safety of the structures throughout construction and to ensure that no serviceability problems would affect the erection process. This paper outlines the wind properties assumed for the bridge sites, the experimental test programme with some of its results, the dynamic properties of the bridges during free <b>cantilevering</b> <b>erection</b> and the assessment of their aerodynamic performance. Along the way, it discusses the similarities and some revealing differences between the two bridges in terms of their dynamic response to wind action...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the last}} century the {{interest}} in wind-induced loads over civil engineering structures has {{become more and more}} important, the reason being that the development of new construction techniques and materials has allowed engineers and architects to design new structures far from the traditional concepts, and in many cases wind actions over these singular structures are not included in the existing codes of practice. In this paper the windinduced static loads over bridges constructed by the double <b>cantilever</b> method during <b>erection</b> stages are considered. The aerodynamic load over a double cantilever bridge under a yawing-angled wind produces a yawing (torsional) moment on the bridge deck, which can lead to undesirable rotation of the deck about the supporting pier. The effects of the wind yaw angle and the length of the deck are analysed. The wind action caused by the presence of sliding concrete forms at the ends of the deck is also studied...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{balanced}} <b>cantilever</b> method of <b>erection,</b> the cable-stayed bridge during its critical construction phase resembles a long overhanging cantilever structure. This type of structure is {{particularly vulnerable to}} wind-induced buffeting instabilities because of its low natural frequencies and low overall stiffness. In the past, the critical buffeting case for both vertical and horizontal excitation was assumed to occur when the wind was incident perpendicular to the bridge's axis. Recent observations in some cable-stayed bridges during construction revealing higher lateral responses at yaw angles other than perpendicular have triggered interest in the lateral vibration case. Buffeting instabilities are affected mainly by the aerodynamic damping term. Experimental research for the vertical aerodynamic damping resulted in the cosine approximation. In the absence of available experimental data for lateral vibration, the cosine approximation is extended from the vertical case and assumed to be valid for the lateral aerodynamic term. The experimental section of this thesis attempts to clarify {{the validity of the}} cosine approximation for the lateral aerodynamic damping case. Cantilever-type section models are triggered into vibration under various wind speeds and over a range of yaw angles, the aerodynamic damping is calculated, and the results are studied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{put forward}} an {{optimizing}} calculation method {{to optimize the}} cable initial force of cable-stayed arch bridge while in arch rib cantilever erecting. The arch rib <b>cantilever</b> <b>erection</b> of cable-stayed arch bridge has the construction process of cable removal. It is different in cable-stayed bridge or arch bridge. Therefore common influence matrix cannot be used directly. And the optimizing method in the paper is developed by modifying influence matrix. Also the paper develops a program by using ANSYS APDL language. The program is applied in Lian-cheng Bridge. The calculation result is similar to sequential forward algorithm. Finally the arch rib enclosure deviation is within 5 mm. The whole arch curve meets the design request...|$|E
40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} arch bridges {{are ideal}} to span over river valleys or deep ravines. However, {{the construction of}} the arch rib is very often the most crucial aspect that may influence the feasibility of the bridge. Casting concrete in situ on formwork and falsework supported directly on the valley is often out of the question. One method that is gaining popularity in recent years is to use precast concrete segments erected by the cantilever construction method with tiebacks. As the tiebacks are temporary and therefore recoverable, the method is considered to be very economical. This paper describes a method for construction control. It uses the concept of influence matrix in the adjustment of cable forces to keep the stresses in the arch rib within acceptable limits as well as to ensure that the arch rib is constructed to line and level. It is observed that the required minimum tieback forces vary during the progress of <b>cantilever</b> <b>erection.</b> Various strategies of tensioning the tiebacks have been studied, and it is found that a two-stage tensioning method gives acceptable results. The recent application of the proposed method and the results are also described. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In a {{developing}} country like Sri Lanka, {{it is very important}} to develop infrastructure to facilitate investments. In this context special emphasis should be given to the road development sector. Therefore highway projects playa major role in infrastructure development. Southern Transport Development Project is a major ongoing highway project in Sri Lanka. Package 2 of that project having 22 highway bridges and five of them are multi span structures. The intermediate supports of those structures are hammerhead piers which are having pier heads in the range of 4 - 5 m <b>cantilever</b> lengths. After <b>erection</b> of post tensioned girders the deck slab and the diaphragms were cast in stages to make the deck slab continuous over the piers. During construction cracks of significant widths were appeared at both ends of the pier heads. In investigating the causes for cracking it was found that, 75 % of main reinforcement and 65 % of shear links were curtailed in the pier head over the stem area by the designer according to the instructions of the Engineer of the project. Therefore this research focuses on the curtailment of main reinforcement and shear links of a hammerhead pier. Further, the other aspect of this study is to discuss different strengthening solutions which can be applicable to this type of under-reinforced hammerhead pier. In this regard, different cantilever lengths of three dimensional hammerhead pier models were analysed with shell elements in two different orientations using the structural analysis package SAP 2000. The reinforcement and shear link requirement of the pier cross head over the stem-area was calculated and the percentage of curtailment possible is presented in this report. Finally, different solutions for strengthening a hammerhead pier are-also discussed...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of the rapid progress of cable-stayed bridges in recent decades is the development of the construction techniques that made their erection possible. Cantilever method and temporary support method are the most common procedures to build such bridges. The temporary support method is the fastest way of building cable-stayed bridges because conventional construction techniques may be used. This fact simplifies the erection task and leads to lower costs. However, when environmental factors or the requirements of the foundations or the sea or river crossing prevent the placement of temporary supports during construction, the <b>cantilever</b> <b>erection</b> method is commonly used. Focus on the research has been mainly devoted to the structural behavior of these structures under construction or service conditions, but the erection procedures and their calculations are not so studied. This paper aims to present practical tools to be used by the designer or the contractor for construction control of the tensioning process of the stays. Namely, a procedure to calculate the stress to be given to the first strand when the strand by strand tensioning technique is used and a procedure to update rationally the tensioning process of a cable stayed bridge when divergence between the foreseen stresses in the stays and the actual ones are noticeable.

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} phenomena effects {{might play}} an important role in the structural behavior of a cable-stayed bridge during construction and in service. In fact, because of these effects the target state of stresses (Objective Service Stage, OSS) can only be achieved at a certain target time. In the literature, a number of software have been presented to study creep and shrinkage effects during <b>cantilever</b> <b>erection</b> of cable-stayed bridges. Nevertheless, the effects of these phenomena in the alternative erection technique, the temporary support erection method, have received little attention. Furthermore, none of the presented software are able to: (1) Define a determined OSS for a given time including the time-dependent phenomena effects and the evolutionary erection of the superstructure. (2) Simulate the construction process assuring the achievement of a given OSS without the need of an overall iterative process taking into account time-dependent phenomena. (3) Provide the prestressing sequence in such a way that no additional tensioning operations are required to correct creep and shrinkage effects in service. To fill all these gaps, a new algorithm, the Forward-Direct Algorithm (FDA), is formally presented in this paper to simulate the construction process of cable-stayed bridges built on temporary supports. The main innovation of this algorithm consists of introducing the time-dependent phenomena effects into the unstressed length of the stays concept to calculate the prestressing strains to be introduced during the last re-tensioning operation. The application of the unstressed length concept has major advantages both in the simulation (as the OSS can be achieved without any overall iterative process) and in service (as re-tensioning operations to correct time-dependent phenomena effects can be avoided). To illustrate the creep and shrinkage effects during the construction and in service the FDA is applied to a real cable-stayed bridge. Furthermore, an analysis to define the optimum time to achieve the OSS is presented. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
