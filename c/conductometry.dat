50|$|<b>Conductometry</b> is a {{measurement}} of electrolytic conductivity to monitor a progress of chemical reaction. <b>Conductometry</b> has notable application in analytical chemistry, where conductometric titration {{is a standard}} technique. In usual analytical chemistry practice, the term <b>conductometry</b> {{is used as a}} synonym of conductometric titration, while the term conductimetry is used to describe non-titrative applications. <b>Conductometry</b> is often applied to determine the total conductance of a solution or to analyze the end point of titrations that include ions.|$|E
50|$|Conductive {{measurements}} {{began as}} early as the 18th century, when Andreas Baumgartner noticed that salt and mineral waters from Bad Gastein in Austria conducted electricity. As such, using <b>conductometry</b> to determine water purity, which is often used today to test the effectiveness of water purification systems, began in 1776. Friedrich Kohlrausch further developed <b>conductometry</b> in the 1860s when he applied alternating current to water, acids, and other solutions. It was also around this time when Willis Whitney, who was studying the interactions of sulfuric acid and chromium sulfate complexes, found the first conductometric endpoint. These finding culminated into potentiometric titrations and the first instrument for volumetric analysis by Robert Behrend in 1883 while titrating chloride and bromide with HgNO3. This development allowed for testing the solubility of salts and hydrogen ion concentration, as well as acid/base and redox titrations. <b>Conductometry</b> was further improved with the development of the glass electrode, which began in 1909.|$|E

40|$|Glass batch melting {{has been}} studied by many {{researchers}} on various scales and under various conditions but no comprehensive understanding has been reached. In view of this situation, {{a major part of}} this work was devoted to the improvement of five new experimental methods suitable for the investigation of batch melting. These are: <b>conductometry,</b> thermal diffusivity, heating microsopy, batch free time (BFT) and weight loss measurement. Firstly, as for the development of <b>conductometry,</b> three meaningful ways to present batch reactions in terms of "DTA", "voltage drop", and "electrical conductivity" were concluded. It was also possible to determine the duration of stages characterized by foaming. Secondly, for thermal diffusivity, an optimized output signals at a frequency of 50 Hz with time interval of 150 s was applied. It showed good measurment results. As a conclusion, the grain-to-grain contact in model calculations should be taken into account by a dimensionless shape factor of 2. 5 to 3. 5. Local <b>conductometry</b> combined with temperature measurement allowed to measure simultaueously the electrical conductivity and the local temperature in a melting batch. The measurement of the local thermal diffusivity was performed by an evaluation of the runtime of a periodically generated heat pulse. Thirdly, for the heating microscope, a new way to present the effect of gas release from glass batches prior to refining was developed. It was found that minor batch additions additions have a large influence. Fourthly, the BFT results show that the reaction behavior of container flint and green glass batches was more sluggish than that of crystal glass batches. By observation through a silica tube furnace, the beginning of batch reactions with cullets at the surface deep into the glass melt were observed. After 2 minutes foam was formed and decreaed within 10 minutes. Finally, weight loss determination for samples up 200 g was developed. It was found that the mass loss of soda ash detected in a vertical tube furnace started at a lower temperature and was completed at a higher temperature than suggested by the results measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These new characterization methods not only open concepts for the presentation and interpretation of batch reactions, but also close the experimental gap between conventional lab scale characterization and the behavior actually observed in industrial production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Honey is the {{ingredient}} of most industrial products for sweetening and improving its food composition. The study is therefore {{based on the}} determination of physical parameters such as electrical conductivity and acidity. The instrumentation and apparatuses used in the work are <b>conductometry</b> and titration apparatuses. Honey samples obtained from different areas with respect to Tepi town have been analyzed and the result obtained is {{on the basis of}} <b>conductometry</b> and acidity measurement. Hence 20 g of each anhydrous honey sample was weighed and dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water in order to prepare 20 % (w/v) solution to measure conductivity. The acidity is detected after 10 g of each honey sample is dissolved in 75 mL of deionized water. The conductivity in summer honey determined to be 0. 097 mS/cm, 0. 153 mS/cm 0. 117 mS/cm and 0. 337 mS/cm in Korcha, Mexi, Sheko and Gobito respectively. Acidity is found to be 17, 28. 67, 29 and 25 miliequi/Kg. The conductivity in winter honey is detected to be 0. 123, 0. 186, 0. 103 and 0. 246 mS/cm. The acidity in winter honey is 3. 36 - 4. 26 and 18. 3 - 25. 3 meq/Kg from pH meter and titration respectively. The conductivity of darker honey is slightly greater than lighter honey, which indicated that the darker honey has more mineral content; and acidity of three honey samples is almost similar.

40|$|CAE {{surfactants}} (carboxylic acid end-standing triblock copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) –poly(propylene oxide) –poly(ethylene oxide)) are amphiphiles {{that are}} able to bind multivalent cations thermoreversibly; a property {{that can be used to}} develop new environmentally friendly separation and ion exchange applications. The analysis of the binding of multivalent ions to CAE micelles is more difficult as compared to conventional surfactants because of its thermo-responsive micellization behavior and its low CMC at room temperature. Conventional analysis techniques like <b>conductometry</b> and surface tensiometry are highly sensitive to temperature and are therefore very difficult to apply in surfactant solutions with strong temperature dependent micellization behavior. For this reason, binding of multivalent ions to CAE micelles has been investigated using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and an alternative conductometric analysis method. <b>Conductometry</b> was used to construct ‘Eisenberg’ plots, which show the binding and release behavior of monovalent ions in the presence of multivalent ions. Regarding the CAE- 85 (modified Pluronic P 85) micellar system, both methods provide information about the exchange of multivalent cations for monovalent ions above the critical micellization temperature (CMT) of CAE- 85. ITC results confirm that dehydration of multivalent ions plays a dominant role in the observed heat effect during the titration of multivalent chloride salts to CAE- 85 solutions. The multivalent ions investigated in this study are Ca²¿, Cu²¿, Zn²¿, Co²¿, Mg²¿, Ba²¿, Mn²¿ and La³¿.
