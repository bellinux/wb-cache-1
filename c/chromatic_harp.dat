50|$|The inline <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp</b> is {{generally}} a single-course harp with all 12 {{notes of the}} chromatic scale appearing in a single row. Single course inline chromatic harps have been produced at least since 1902, when Karl Weigel of Hanover patented a model of inline <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pedal harps are {{essentially}} diatonic instruments which are fitted with the double-action pedal mechanism to allow chromatic alterations and key changes. No {{matter how the}} pedals are set, the pedal harp still has only seven strings per octave. Smaller harps, often called folk, lever or Celtic harps, are equally diatonic instruments (also with seven strings per octave) and use a mechanical lever on each string which must be moved manually to obtain chromatic alterations. The only completely <b>chromatic</b> <b>harps</b> are the double (arpa doppia) and triple (Welsh) harps and the cross-strung harp.|$|R

5000|$|Henry Greenway (Birmingham, England, 1833 - St. Louis, Missouri, 1903) was an English-born American harp maker. He {{created a}} type of <b>chromatic</b> cross-strung <b>harp</b> {{displaying}} X-shaped double pilar and double neck. His workshop was at 545 Atlantic Street in Brooklyn, N.Y.|$|R
50|$|The Koch <b>Chromatic</b> and Slide <b>Harp</b> {{are both}} {{designed}} {{in the same fashion}} as chromatic harmonicas, but possess the Richter tuning found in typical 10-hole diatonic harmonicas. Like the Educator 10, both are also 10-hole and built on a pearwood comb. The Slide Harp has been discontinued.|$|R
50|$|There was a <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp</b> {{developed}} in the late 19th century that found {{only a small number}} of proponents, and was mainly taught in Belgium.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 19th century, the Pleyel firm {{produced}} the first <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp.</b> In the early 20th century, at the behest of Wanda Landowska, it helped to revive the harpsichord.|$|E
50|$|An inline <b>{{chromatic}}</b> <b>harp</b> is a harp {{where the}} strings for all 12 chromatic {{notes of the}} octave are placed in one row (the same way strings are placed on a standard concert harp), as opposed to their being placed {{in two or three}} (parallel or crossing) courses.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980 Hankin {{made his}} way to Europe {{settling}} in West Berlin performing in concert halls, radio, television and theater. He performed with several early [...] music ensembles and collaborated with several instrument makers commissioning obscure instruments such as string drum (used alongside the tabor pipe) and <b>chromatic</b> jaw’s <b>harps.</b> Over the next 20 years, he expanded his instrument collection to over 400 items composing music specifically for them. It was in Berlin he first worked with Meredith Monk at the Schabühne am Lehliner Platz (Dir. Peter Stein) and became her music director over a 15-year period.|$|R
50|$|Hering Harmonicas, hand {{maker of}} {{diatonic}} and chromatic harmonicas, located in Blumenau, Santa Catarina, Brazil, started producing in about 2009 a popular model bearing Harper's name: The Stan <b>Harper</b> <b>Chromatic</b> 56, a three-octave, 14-hole instrument with 56 brass reeds sealed by a pearwood body bolted to a hardwood comb with chrome-plated cover plates, mouthpiece and slide assembly.|$|R
5000|$|Hankin {{has written}} more than 300 pieces of music. His best-known {{compositions}} included [...] "Salmon Springtime", composed for 18 <b>chromatic</b> trumps (Jews <b>harps)</b> and [...] "The Spirit Shall Return" [...] for two sopranos and chamber ensemble. Other works utilized lesser known instruments including shawms, dulcians, crumhorns, rauspfieffes, renaissance flutes, recorders, gemshorns, western bagpipes and other period instruments.|$|R
50|$|Some harps, {{rather than}} using pedal or lever devices, achieve {{chromaticity}} by simply adding additional strings to cover the notes outside their diatonic home scale. The Welsh triple harp is one such instrument, and two other instruments employing this technique are the cross-strung harp and the inline <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp.</b>|$|E
50|$|Single course inline {{chromatic}} harps {{have been}} produced {{for at least the}} past 110 years: in 1902 Karel Weigel of Hanover (Germany) patented a model of inline <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp.</b> He built at least one 54 string (4 octaves and a fourth) model which is now housed in the Deutsches Museum (Munich).|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, the English-born American harp builder Henry Greenway built several {{copies of}} his {{peculiar}} cross-strung <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp</b> model featuring X-shaped pillar and two necks. One of them is displayed at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City and another at the National Music Museum, Vermillion, South Dakota.|$|E
5000|$|The {{skill of}} harp making in Wales {{had all but}} been lost for some 60 years until John Weston Thomas (MBE), a talented wood and metal worker, revived the craft, making Celtic, <b>chromatic</b> and triple <b>harps</b> {{until his death in}} 1992. A {{memorial}} prize, [...] "Tlws Coffa John Weston Thomas" [...] was subsequently instigated at the National Eisteddfod, to encourage competition in the traditional folk style. He passed on his skills to three apprentices: Allan Shiers, Brian Blackmore and Alun Thomas, his son. Alun still makes triple and Celtic harps in his workshop just outside Fishguard. Brian Blackmore no longer makes triple harps, but Allan Shiers has continued the tradition in Wales and founded Telynau Teifi Harps in Llandysul, Ceredigion.|$|R
50|$|Renié was {{critical}} {{in promoting the}} double-action harp of Sebastian Erard, and inspired {{the creation of the}} <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp</b> through an offhand complaint about pedals to Gustave Lyon, who worked for a manufacturer of musical instruments, including harps. Ironically, Renié demonstrated the rival Erard harp at the Brussels World's Fair, and was the major cause of its demise.|$|E
50|$|Blues harp man Carey Bell was essential. Like Muddy, Bell {{was born}} in Mississippi and {{came of age in}} Chicago; Like Lawhorn, he was a long-time member of Waters band, having {{previously}} worked with John Lee Hooker, Eddie Taylor and Earl Hooker, among others. Bell alternated between a standard Marine Band harp and the big double-key <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp</b> which is his specialty.|$|E
5000|$|His {{compositions}} {{included a}} youthful opera Maître Martin, the opéra-comique La Reine dort, the overture Attila, preludes, studies and fantasies for piano (including a Grande Fantaise on Bizet's Carmen), a piano quintet, and songs. There {{is also a}} Scherzetto for <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp.</b> [...] He also edited some of Alkan's music. [...] Camille Saint-Saëns' Piano Concerto No. 3 was dedicated to Delaborde.|$|E
5000|$|To {{show off}} its new <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp,</b> the Pleyel company {{commissioned}} Claude Debussy in 1904 {{to write his}} Danse sacrée et danse profane for harp and orchestra. The Érard company responded by commissioning Maurice Ravel to write a piece to display the expressive range of its double-action pedal harp. [...] Ravel completed his Introduction and Allegro for a septet of harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet in June 1905, dedicating it to Albert Blondel, director of Maison Érard. He wrote it at breakneck speed, as he had to complete it before embarking on a boating holiday with friends.|$|E
5000|$|While {{recording}} Made In England with John at Air Studios in London, Birch {{was sitting}} in the studio lobby reading a magazine during a break and he noticed a shadow blocking his light. As he looked up, he instantly recognized Beatles producer George Martin. George asked Bob if he “would be up for playing on a couple of tracks he was doing with <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp</b> ace Larry Adler's album The Glory of Gershwin. After Bob “picked his jaw off of the floor”, he answered yes. Yet another highlight of his career was building a musical relationship with producer and songwriter David Harris. Harris asked Bob to play on Brian Doerksen’s Juno Award winning album, which was put together with drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and Toto singer Joseph Williams. That led to the opportunity to co-write as well as play on a song for Joseph Williams’ solo album, This Fall. Bob said that [...] "being a huge Toto fan, it was an honor to be involved with Joseph. Seeing my name on an album alongside my all-time heroes David Paich, Steve Lukather, Steve Porcaro, and Bobby Kimball was obviously an added rush”.|$|E
40|$|The {{sixteenth century}} brought {{increased}} English military occupation and settlement to Ireland. Members of the invading nobility, who consequently {{came into contact}} with the native culture, were seduced by the sound of the Irish harp and took the instrument from its roots in Gaelic society and placed it in the setting of European courtly music. My aim is to examine this process, the resulting developments which took place {{in the evolution of the}} Irish harp, and compositions associated with its usage in the 'art' music of England and the Continent. Particular reference is made to the 'Harpe' Consorts of William Lawes together with their sources and resulting implications when considering the capabilities of the instrument employed. The harp's role within this music is also analysed and a complete set of transcriptions of Lawes' consorts is included. Works by other musicians associated with the Irish harp during the period 1550 - 1650 are also discussed with specific reference to the compasses and accidentals of the instruments required by the composers where appropriate. Transcriptions of works attributed to Cormack MacDermott and the anonymous harp parts located at the back of Ch Ch Mus MS 5 are included. Martin Peerson's 'Mottects or Grave Chamber Music' and a collection of works for 'Treble Bass Viol and Harp', included in the back of the 1687 edition of Christopher Simpson's A Compendium of Practical Music are also discussed. A major part of the research involved the reconstruction of an Irish <b>chromatic</b> <b>harp</b> (presented as part of this thesis) capable of playing the music examined. An account of this is given in a report which looks at the decisions and processes involved, difficulties encountered, as well as some recommendations for future experimental directions...|$|E
