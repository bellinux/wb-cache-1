5|$|<b>Cardiac</b> <b>surgery</b> was {{developed}} at the university's Variety Club Hospital, where by 1957, more than 200 patients had survived open-heart operations, many of them children. Working with surgeon C. Walton Lillehei, Medtronic began to build portable and implantable cardiac pacemakers about this time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} heart transplantation {{was performed in}} 1967 by the South African surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town. This marked an important milestone in <b>cardiac</b> <b>surgery,</b> capturing the attention of both the medical profession and the world at large. However, long-term survival rates of patients were initially very low. Louis Washkansky, the first recipient of a donated heart, died 18 days after the operation while other patients did not survive {{for more than a}} few weeks. The American surgeon Norman Shumway has been credited for his efforts to improve transplantation techniques, along with pioneers Richard Lower, Vladimir Demikhov and Adrian Kantrowitz. As of March 2000, more than 55,000 heart transplantations have been performed worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Mancera {{has been}} married twice. His first {{marriage}} was to a woman named Martha in the early 1990s, with whom lived in civil union for a year. They divorced two years later, and after six years Mancera married Magnolia, {{with whom he had}} two children, Miguel and Leonardo. After a decade, he divorced Magnolia. Mancera has a daughter out of wedlock, but he has said the child's mother does not want Mancera to see her. In September 2007, two assailants on a motorcycle intercepted and attempted to rob him while he drove his BMW in Periférico Sur. His bodyguard intervened and shot one of the robbers, killing him. From 2008 to 2009, Mancera dated Alejandra Barrales, who was the president of the PRD party at that time, and also she intended to become the PRD candidate for Mayor of Mexico City in 2012. In his spare time, he practices multiple sports, including Krav Maga, indoor cycling and weight lifting, hunting and aviation. On October 31, 2014, Mancera had a <b>cardiac</b> <b>surgery</b> because three months before a cardiac arrhythmia was detected. During the surgery, he had a cardiac perforation. He recovered two weeks later.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the safety and efficacy of routine CXR after chest drain removal in patients undergoing <b>cardiac</b> <b>surgeries.</b> In a Prospective, randomized, clinical investigation, a total of 315 consecutive patients were randomly categorized into routinely and clinically indicated CXR groups, prospectively. Demographic information, type of <b>cardiac</b> <b>surgeries</b> and presence of any co morbidities were recorded. In non-routine CXR group, patients underwent radiographic evaluation if clinical signs or symptoms of complicated chest drain removal were detected. CXR findings and therapeutic interventions were also recorded for each patient. Two categories were obtained with 157 and 158 patients as routine and non-routine CXR group, respectively. Age, gender, type of <b>cardiac</b> <b>surgeries</b> and co-morbidities were comparable in both groups. Both groups did not differ significantly with respect to the frequency of signs or symptoms (p = 0. 38), CXR findings (p = 1. 00) and therapeutic interventions (p = 1. 00). The difference between hospital stay duration in both groups and the frequency of readmissions were negligible. We detected no value of routine CXR after chest drain removal in postoperative cardiac patients and omission of this practice could be considered...|$|R
