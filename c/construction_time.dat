5|$|While {{the exact}} reason for such {{prolonged}} <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> is not known, {{it is believed}} that reduction of the French Navy's budget after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and out-of-date work practices in French dockyards were likely causes.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{acquisition}} project organisers originally {{planned for the}} first submarine to be constructed overseas, the Cabinet decided {{as part of the}} project's approval that all six submarines would be built in Australia; the increases in <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> and cost from not building the lead ship in the winning designer's home shipyard was considered to be offset by the additional experience provided to Australian industries. Even so, two sections of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums' shipyard in Malmo, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|During {{this entire}} period, BE1 was insolvent. The bank {{therefore}} {{required that the}} entire sales price of Hamar stadion be transferred to BG, even though NOK50 million {{was to go to}} the construction of Børstad Idrettspark (BIP). Therefore, Hamar Municipality decided to finance BIP to secure sufficient funding for Briskeby, essentially subsidizing Briskeby with a further NOK50 million. In 2007, BG paid NOK3.4 million in compensation to Ham-Kam for lost ticket sales during the <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> and for the club house, which would be demolished.|$|E

5|$|Ohio had {{completed}} the stretch of highway between I-70 to just before the SR7 interchange by 1976, but due to budget deficiencies work did not resume in Ohio until 1981. Construction of the bridge linking the two portions of highway {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 1981, but construction did not begin until that year. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to fund the project again. Bids for construction work on the remainder of the Ohio portion of the freeway were solicited in 1981, with an estimated <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> of 37months for the stretch between I-70 and the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Richelieu {{was laid}} down at Toulon in 1869 and {{launched}} on 3 December 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> is not known, {{it was probably}} due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy's budget which was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time, which were not suitable for the Industrial Age. The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875, but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron, of which she became flagship, until 10 February 1876. She was placed in reserve on 3 December 1879.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{used the}} basic {{design of the}} Cerberus-class breastwork {{monitors}} to reduce design and <b>construction</b> <b>time.</b> Their hulls were completed very quickly, but the pace of building reduced as the likelihood of their immediate use diminished. They were delivered to the Royal dockyards in 1872 and commissioned for fitting out, {{but a number of}} years elapsed before that process was completed as little sense of urgency remained.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{addition}} of gates at airports {{is subject to}} growth rate uncertainties about demand, costs, <b>construction</b> <b>times,</b> interest rates and other factors. An analytical model is developed for minimizing total gate expansion costs, by optimizing the timing and number of new gates, subject to uncertainties of demand and <b>construction</b> <b>times.</b> Using estimations of parameters from interval data, three interval models combining the concepts of auto-correlated random demand are proposed for expressing such uncertainty measurements. According to the analyses of interval uncertainties, potential benefits {{can be obtained by}} adjusting preplanned projects to advance or postpone gate construction...|$|R

5|$|The {{site was}} {{approved}} in 1934, {{under the supervision}} of CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency. Work by the contractor Chanel of Antibes began in 1935 at a cost of 14.5 million francs. A second phase was planned to add an artillery block. This was scaled back to a pair of separate artillery casemates. A separate entrance block was proposed in April 1940, linking to the casemates. As the initial confrontation with Germany was already underway, {{it was too late to}} be built, with a projected <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> of 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Friedland {{was laid}} down at Lorient in January 1865 and {{launched}} on 15 October 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> is not known, {{the budget for}} the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the industrial age. The ship began her sea trials on 1 May 1875, but was not completed until 20 June 1877. Friedland joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1878 and the ship bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax from 6–16 July 1881 {{as part of the}} French occupation of Tunisia. She was reduced to reserve in 1887 and decommissioned in 1893. Friedland returned to active duty in 1893, but was paid off in 1898 and condemned in 1902.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, HSA sold Briskeby {{to a new}} company, Briskeby Gressbane AS (BG), {{which was}} owned 50 percent each by Ham-Kam and HSA. Another company, Briskeby Eiendom 1 AS (BE1), was {{established}} and owned 66 percent by HSA and 34 percent by BG. The latter was also given 50 percent of the shares in Hamar stadion. BG was non-commercial and was to own the stadium itself, while BE1 was commercial and was to rent out the commercial property. The two shared board, managing director and accountant. In May 2007, NCC was awarded the contract to build the new venue by BG and BE1. Although NCC was NOK8 million {{more expensive than the}} cheapest bid, they offered four months shorter <b>construction</b> <b>time.</b> Briskeby's lot needed to be expanded, which was done by purchasing neighbor lots for NOK34 million. Hamar stadion and the neighbor lot Fuglsetmyra were sold for NOK295 million in June 2007, of which NOK9 million was paid to BG and another NOK175 million was a guarantee which would be paid after the lot was re-regulated.|$|E

5|$|In early 1997, Paramount's Carowinds began {{consultations}} with roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard about {{adding a new}} ride to their park. During 18 months of discussions, several designs and themes for the ride were developed, including theming it to the Godzilla franchise. In July 1998, the park announced the addition of Top Gun: The Jet Coaster for the 1999 season. At a cost of $10.5 million, {{it would be the}} single biggest investment in the park's history. The announcement followed Paramount Parks adding Top Gun-themed inverted and suspended roller coasters to several of their parks throughout the 1990s, including Paramount's Great America, Paramount Canada's Wonderland, and Paramount's Kings Island. To construct the attraction at Carowinds, the park's Bayern Kurve ride, Wild Bull, had to be removed. The park intended to keep the ride in storage for a potential relocation elsewhere within the park. The removal of Wild Bull shortened <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> because no trees or buildings had to be removed. Construction began in late July 1998, with the first track arriving in August. Testing was completed in January 1999.|$|E
5|$|Kreml, {{named after}} the Kremlin, was ordered on 20 April 1863 when a {{contract}} was signed with the Russian shipbuilder Semiannikov & Poletika for a total cost of 898,000 rubles. Construction had not yet begun when the Russian Admiralty Board amended the contract on 20 July to shorten the <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> by one year for a payment of an extra 48,000 rubles {{in response to the}} adverse foreign reaction to the brutal Russian suppression of the revolts in Poland and Lithuania that year. Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards in the belief that they could be completed more quickly so that progress on Kreml slowed to a crawl once construction began on 2 October. The ship was not formally laid down until 23 December and she was launched on 26 August 1865.|$|E
5|$|La Galissonnière {{was laid}} down at Brest on 22 June 1868 and {{launched}} on 7 May 1872. While the exact reason for such prolonged <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> is not known, {{the budget for}} the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the industrial age. The ship began her sea trials on 20 April 1874 and was not commissioned until 18 July 1874. She became flagship of the Pacific Squadron on 16 May 1874 {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Perigot. She return to Brest on 19 March 1877, having circumnavigated the world via the Suez Canal. The ship was placed in reserve upon her return until she recommissioned on 15 August 1878 in preparation for a commission as flagship of the Caribbean Squadron which began on 6 October under Rear Admiral Peyron. Two years later she sailed to Cherbourg and was reduced to reserve on 13 May 1880.|$|E

5|$|Nevadas {{construction}} was authorized by an Act of Congress on 4 March 1911. The contract went to Fore River Shipbuilding Company on 22 January 1912 {{for a total}} of $5,895,000 (not including the armor and armament), and the time of {{construction was}} originally to be 36 months. A secondary contract was signed on 31 July 1912 for $50,000 to cover the additional cost of a geared cruising unit on each propeller shaft; this also extended the planned <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> by five months. Her keel was laid down on 4 November 1912, and by 12 August 1914, the ship was 72.4% complete. Nevada was launched on 11 July 1914; she was sponsored by Miss Eleanor Anne Seibert, niece of Governor Tasker Oddie of Nevada and a descendant of the first Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin Stoddert. The launch was attended by several prominent members of the government, including Governor Oddie, Governor David I. Walsh of Massachusetts, Senator Key Pittman of Nevada, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, who would later become the 32nd President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened on 10 June 1908, {{along with the}} rest of the central portion of the Bergen Line. The station {{building}} was of the Mountain Station Variant 1 type, designed by Paul Due. This made it identical to Mjølfjell Station, and with only slight variations to Haugastøl Station, Finse Station and Myrdal Station. During construction, NSB built several buildings for their staff. Two of the houses and an assembly building have been preserved. They were built in 1900 and represent an example of buildings from the <b>construction</b> <b>time.</b> One is partially built in stone, partially in wood, while the other two are entirely in wood. All are now used as cabins. The sick ward for the navvys was bought by Kari Maristuen in 1909 converted to a hotel, named Fjellstova.|$|E
5|$|Trident, {{named after}} the weapon that symbolized mastery of the seas, was laid down in April 1870 in Toulon and {{launched}} on 9 November 1876. While the exact reason for such prolonged <b>construction</b> <b>time</b> is not known, {{it is believed that}} reduction of the French Navy's budget after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and out-of-date work practices in French dockyards were likely causes. The ship was completed on 1 November 1878 and became the flagship of the second-in-command of the Mediterranean Squadron the following month. Trident, together with her sister ship , bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax on 15–16 July 1881 as the French occupied Tunisia. She was disarmed and placed in reserve in 1886–89, but was recommissioned on 17 February 1889 and resumed her role as flagship until she was again placed in reserve in 1894. The ship served as a gunnery training ship until she was condemned on 5 March 1900. Trident was renamed Var in 1904 and was sold for scrap five years later.|$|E
