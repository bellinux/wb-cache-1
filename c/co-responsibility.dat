2500|$|Although Yen Bai was the exception, {{this did}} not mean that the SRM ran {{smoothly}} or that the performance standards could not be higher. A month after the mutiny, General Commandant Superior Aubert circulated SRM Notice 660, on March 11, 1930, to describe (and prescribe) the morale and techniques needed for an effective intelligence service. It stressed the importance of understanding the objectives and organisational structure of anti-colonial parties and then advised on {{the ways in which the}} revolutionary threat could be nullified. The note also deemed it necessary to remind its recipients about two earlier intelligence communications [...] of February 25 and October 17, 1929 [...] thus indicating that they had not been taken on board completely. One of the reasons given for this was what was seen as the complacent attitude of many officers, in assuming that they could [...] "preserve [...] units from revolutionary propaganda" [...] and related to this, the low morale of many European warrant officers who regarded [...] "their [...] role as ending when their working hours are over". Apart from indicating what officers should be giving their due diligence, Aubert's note also indicated the means by which critical intelligence information could be obtained. This largely depended on close collaboration with Vietnamese warrant officers who had an important intelligence role in their position as a conduit between their French masters and their Vietnamese troops. The flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not as smooth as desired. The French were often not tactful and discreet enough, and many were not, due to a lack of language skills or interest, [...] "in real contact with the indigenous warrant officers." [...] On the other hand, the Vietnamese were not very open with regard to the provision of information, and thus did not take (<b>co-)responsibility</b> [...] "for the maintenance of the troops' good spirit". Despite the air of good appearance and behaviour of the Vietnamese warrant officers and tirailleurs, they often misled ltheir French superiors about their knowledge of subversive activities. This posed a major problem in intelligence gathering, necessitating the cross-checking of information, as well as threatening harsh penalties if information was withheld.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{increasing}} prominence of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) in the development agenda of many developing countries, this Country Study provides an analytic overview of the challenges faced by El Salvador?s CCT programme, Red Solidaria, (Solidarity Network). The purpose is to generate an information base for comparative studies on the prospects and potential difficulties of implementing CCTs in country settings {{different from those of the}} pioneer programmes, such as in Brazil and Mexico. The study describes Red Solidaria´s origins and components and discusses major aspects of its design and implementation. A particular emphasis is placed on the programme?s <b>co-responsibilities,</b> exit rules and targeting strategy. The study also covers the topics of institutional structures, intersectoral coordination and political support for such programmes. The conclusion is that Red Solidaria is an informative example of how a small country with limited resources can successfully set up a complex CCT programme. Still, the study notes that there are pending issues and remaining challenges for the programme. These relate, in particular, to strengthening mechanisms of local participation; coordinating the CCTs with other dimensions of Red Solidaria, such as productive projects; lengthening the duration of benefits for meeting human-capital objectives; clarifying eligibility requirements and how changes in family conditions can affect such requirements; and distinguishing conditionalities from ordinary programme <b>co-responsibilities.</b> An issue of overriding importance is to develop a broader long-term social protection strategy for El Salvador, with which CCTs would be integrated instead of being regarded as a stand-along programme.

The details {{of the past and}} current programmes are examined closely, with special attention paid to what can be learned from the experiences. While the programme was originally intended to compensate poor households for the hardships imposed by structural adjustment, it has evolved into a programme focused on human capital development. In this respect, it is similar to other conditional cash transfer programmes. However, its history and the dual nature of the programme (one part based on an external loan and the other domestically driven) have hindered institutional transformation. Although there have been attempts to make the domestic programme more closely resemble the externally financed version of PRAF, this process has been hindered on several occasions. In fact, domestic programme <b>co-responsibilities</b> have been neither emphasized nor enforced in the past. While the current alignment of political and economic forces, {{both inside and outside the}} country, has given the programme the opportunity to positively transform itself, other factors run counter to this goal. Although the outcome of this transformation is yet to be fully determined, several important lessons can be learned from the experience of PRAF in Honduras. These relate to topics that include organizational alignment, targeting methodology, administration of transfers, programme evaluation, enforcement of <b>co-responsibilities</b> and supply-side complements to the programme.

40|$|Mexico’s {{conditional}} {{cash transfer}} program Oportunidades first began in 1997 in highly impoverished rural communities. Since then, the program has expanded throughout Mexico and has been copied by governments worldwide. The program aims to interrupt the intergenerational transmission of poverty by providing cash transfers to parents for sending their children to school, receiving regular check-ups, and complying with various other <b>co-responsibilities.</b> Initial evaluations of the program were positive, but research on its long-term impacts has, thus far, been limited. This paper uses the Mexican Family Life Survey to analyze the long-term impact of Oportunidades {{on the health of}} young adults who have aged out of the program. Difference in difference estimators and the fixed-effect regression model are employed to measure the difference in health caused by increased exposure to the program. It is found that longer exposure to Oportunidades does have a statistically significant, positive impact on the health of young adults. These findings suggest that Oportunidades continues to impact former recipients after they age out of the program and support the theory that the program could help break the intergenerational cycle of poverty...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} {{the debate on}} {{corporate}} citizenship {{and the role of}} business in global governance. In the debate on political corporate social responsibility it is assumed that under globalization business is taking up a greater political role. Apart from economic responsibilities firms assume political responsibilities taking up traditional governmental tasks such as regulation of business and provision of public goods. We contrast this with a subsidiarity-based approach to governance, in which firms are seen as intermediate actors who have political <b>co-responsibilities</b> in society endowed upon them by (inter) national governmental institutions. We argue that both approaches face conceptual and empirical problems, and do not make clear the content and scope of political corporate responsibility. Based on Iris Marion Young’s account of political responsibility we argue that corporate actors and governmental actors have a shared responsibility to tackle societal problems. Taking political corporate responsibility not only entails engaging in private action or engaging in public–private partnerships, but it also includes aiding governmental actors to remedy injustice or even create public institutions where they do not yet exist. By adding this perspective we contribute to the debate on responsibility in corporate citizenship and clarify the political role business can play in global governance. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a lively}} global debate {{on how to}} target {{beneficiaries}} of Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programmes. In this Evaluation Note we analyze alternative targeting methods for Paraguay?s CCT programme, Tekoporã. The major practical choice for Paraguay is between a multidimensional quality-of-life index and a proxy-means test for income. We focus on the efficiency and efficacy of these approaches by examining primarily the trade-off between leakage and coverage. Tekoporã is a CCT programme that is being scaled up in Paraguay. Like other recent CCT programmes, it was designed {{in the context of}} a national strategy for combating poverty, as part of the general effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its pilot started in August 2005, covering 4, 500 households in five districts of two departments. Tekoporã is gradually expanding and intends to cover 35 districts by 2008. These districts were selected from the pool of 66 districts that had been judged to have the most vulnerable populations, according to a scoring system based on a Geographical Prioritization Index (IPG). Tekoporã?s objective is to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty by means of the cash transfer and follow-up activities for beneficiary households. This follow-up consists of the monitoring of <b>co-responsibilities</b> (between beneficiaries and the programme) with regard to the supply and use of health and education facilities and the development of related family-support activities.

40|$|An {{increasing}} interest is emerging in ecological compensation or biodiversity offsets {{as an instrument}} for slowing down the rate of biodiversity losses, with programs ongoing in more than 40 countries. Adhering to the polluter-pays principle, the instrument requires the intervening party to compensate for environmental degradation that has occured {{as a result of}} development. However, its use is contested as the instrument may facilitate a ‘license to trash’ if more development permits are allowed under the assumption that the degradation can simply be compensated. This paper increases the understanding of whether existing programs for ecological compensation effectively addresses the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. A literature review is conducted with five case studies of ecological compensation programs representing middle- and high- income countries. We begin by describing the different approaches of designing compensation programs in Australia, England, Germany, South Africa and the U. S. Key issues in the program design are reviewed: policy goals, adherence to the mitigation hierarchy, weighting of losses and gains, and monitoring activities. We then evaluate the programs’ outcomes, in terms of the ecological and social benefits provided. From these case studies, we find three design aspects that may contribute towards improving the compensation programs’ outcomes: (1) integration of compensation programs with conservation landscape planning, (2) adequate commensurability of ecosystem functions and (3) an open access centralised reporting system. We also identify four safeguards to contribute towards protecting the ecological and social benefits: (1) allocate <b>co-responsibilities</b> of equivalence weighting and monitoring to an independent, external organisation, (2) consider local livelihoods at both the impact and proposed compensation site, (3) ensure access to recreation and (4) stakeholder participation from the general society and consultation of the directly affected community. We highlight that the use of this controversial instrument requires considerable regulation and capacity, with democratically decided performance criteria.

40|$|D. Ed. This {{thesis is}} a report of a {{research}} project conducted in a Technikon within the higher education sector of South Africa. Teachers in this sector are facing major challenges due to the transformation of higher education, {{as well as the}} introduction of an Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) paradigm. Teachers thus need to adapt their teaching practice to include the principles and practices of this educational paradigm and are continuously required to improve their teaching practice to face the aforementioned challenges. This study was aimed at investigating how teachers could be assisted to improve their teaching practice. It primarily aimed at seeking a way to assist lecturers of the Technikon to improve their teaching practice, while it was hoped that I would also improve my own practice. An action research project was conducted during which I was planned, designed and implemented a teaching skills programme. Literature on teaching and learning, with specific emphasis on theories and approaches that support learners' meaningful learning, was reviewed. Furthermore, literature on staff development policies, approaches, practices and the OBE paradigm provided the theoretical foundation for the various phases in the action research project. After conducting a needs analysis to determine the perceived teaching needs of lecturers, all lecturers at the Technikon were invited to attend the teaching skills programme as a staff development initiative. Data of what was experienced, observed and learnt during the process were noted in my research journal. After I had analysed and interpreted the data gained I reflected on the experiences and learning, {{as well as on the}} value of the programme. From the research notes I learnt more about the participants, the programme and the process, while I learnt more about myself as a teacher and as a researcher. These reflections informed the findings, namely that insufficient focus is placed on teaching and learning initiatives. Furthermore, it was found that staff development policies did not seem to provide sufficient support for such initiatives. Literature indicated that these findings were not unique to the Technikon, but also seemed to be experienced in other higher education institutions. Based on the above findings it was concluded that teachers could be assisted in improving their teaching practice by focusing on their learners' meaningful learning and by continuously updating their teaching knowledge and skills. It was therefore recommend that staff development policies be revised and that teachers and managers in higher education refocus on the core business of higher education institutions, namely, teaching and learning. Finally, it was recommended that managers, teachers and staff development units accept coresponsibility for improving teaching practice in higher education and work in synergy to achieve this common goal. The <b>co-responsibilities</b> of role-players in academic staff development have been presented diagrammatically within a framework. The importance of all role-players taking their responsibilities is illustrated. The resulting coresponsibility amongst role-players is argued to emphasise the importance of synergy amongst them towards achieving improved practice. I argued that all three role-players needed to collaborate and support one another if they were "to move in the same direction" towards improved teaching practice. The scholarly contribution of this study lies firstly within my living theory, which is a culmination of the learning journey as well as the results thereof.

Delineou-se uma pesquisa qualitativa com dados quantitativos, com aspectos interpretativos e descritivos, por meio dos quais se planejou uma análise de conteúdo constituída junto a 186 estudantes de cursos de Engenharias e Licenciaturas, matriculados em uma Universidade Pública Federal. A coleta de dados ocorreu em três abordagens, sendo a primeira e segunda reveladoras de hipóteses subjetivas identificáveis a partir dos relatos dos sujeitos investigados, e a terceira, conduzida por representações exteriorizadas em Mapas Conceituais Iniciais. Concluiu-se que a experiência em aulas de Cálculo 1 tem sentidos de reciprocidade, na ação de mão dupla que engloba conteúdos e sujeitos da experiência; de unicidade, pela subjetividade e identidade de cada sujeito; de imprevisibilidade, pelas incertezas, perigos e possibilidades da experiência; de temporalidade, pois prescinde o reconhecimento de tempos e espaços distintos aos sujeitos da experiência. Os sujeitos investigados deixaram transparecer aspectos aparentemente contraditórios, que, todavia, denotaram complementaridades. Apontaram que estudantes com uma base mais fraca em Matemática alcançaram tanto resultados positivos quanto negativos, e que buscas pessoais contribuíram em favor da adaptação e desenvolvimento na disciplina, demonstrando aspectos de corresponsabilidades, embora não unânimes entre os sujeitos, revelando também marcas de um processo {{particular}} de escolhas. Ainda, evidenciou-se que o fortalecimento de mecanismos de transparência e de comunicação institucionais pode contribuir para o processo de formação desses sujeitos.

A qualitative with quantitative data survey was delineated having interpretative and descriptive aspects through which a content analysis was planned Bardin and carried out with 186 students majoring engineering, mathematics, physics and chemistry enrolled in a Public Federal University. The data collection was done through three different approaches, the first and the second revealed subjective hypothesis identified from the investigated subjects talk, and the third, conducted by representations shown in Initial Concept Maps. It was concluded that the experience in Calculus 1 classes has been of reciprocity, in a two-way action that includes contents and subjects of the experience; of singleness, by the subjectivity and identity of each subject; of unpredictability, by the uncertainties, dangers and possibilities of the experience; of temporality, because it dispenses the recognition of distinct time and space to the subjects of the experience. The investigated subjects showed aspects apparently contradictory that however, denoted complementarities. They showed that students who had a weaker base in mathematics reached as many positive results as the negative ones, and that personal goals contributed to the adaptation and development in the school subject, showing aspects of <b>co-responsibilities</b> although they were not the same among the subjects, revealing marks of a process particular in choices as well. Yet, it was highlighted that the strengthening of the transparency mechanism and institutional communication could contribute to the process of development of those subjects.

This dissertation {{has as its}} theme {{those factors}} involved in the sustainability of health promotion initiatives, most especially in the alliances consolidation in the perspective of intersector action {{for the creation of}} healthy environments. The study addresses the theoreticalethic- political ideation, seeking to focus on those conceptual displacements that characterize the paradigmatic rupture translated by this movement, outlining the extended health conception which embeds the social determinants thematic, updating the discussion over inter-sectors in the commitment consolidation with equity and social justice. It discusses controversies and political-ideological implications expressed in the plurality of views over such strategy, focusing on distinctions and conceptual approaches among health promotion, prevention and health education. The qualitative research was adopted as a strategy, with typical descriptive and interpretative case study methodological approach. The empirical basis was developed in one of the SESC regional departments, with well succeeded experience of the ???Transando sa??de project??? (???Dealing with Health Project???), and its analysis focus is on strategies of inter-sector mediation and articulation, in this context. The project in question is of initiative of the Health Education Activity and is turned to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and Aids, with actions in the school and local work settings through the establishing of inter-sector alliances and the use of peer education methodology. In the performed investigation, it was made a cut in the analysis unit, opting for this latter setting. The triangulation technique was used in the data collection through documental research, direct observation and semi- structured interviews.
