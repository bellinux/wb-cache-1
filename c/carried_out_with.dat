5|$|British Expeditionary Force {{commander}} General Douglas Haig and Second Army commander General Herbert Plumer both {{believed it}} necessary to expel the Germans from the captured positions. In view of the preparations for the Somme offensive, Haig {{did not wish to}} divert more forces than were necessary. Support was limited to a number of additional artillery units and an infantry brigade from the 20th (Light) Division. It was suggested that the next counterattack be <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the infantry available, with a particularly large emphasis placed on artillery.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1917, Haig was {{planning}} an offensive in the heavily defended Ypres region of Flanders. His plan involved {{a series of}} steps, {{the first of which}} was the capture of Messines Ridge by II ANZAC Corps. The New Zealand Division, already in the Messines sector, was given the task of capturing Messines Village and it began intensive training for the forthcoming battle under the close supervision of Russell. Extensive preparatory work was <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> transportation infrastructure laid down and ample supplies of shells brought forward for the artillery.|$|E

5|$|Early {{improvement}} was <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the traditional tools, but new technology was increasingly important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first {{adopted in the}} south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E
5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> the first train running in 1919.

St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing flashing lights were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, Westland's {{experience}} with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental Rotor Program (BERP), in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which applied innovations in composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter rotor. Initial trials <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> active Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP rotor, including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well.|$|E

The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the uranium met the copper jacket. In practice, the uranium was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> alloys of uranium with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from uranium through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E

Although nominally a lesser command, it would be the spearhead of the Australian Army in subsequent operations. The staff was that of Morshead's former II Corps, as the I and II Corps headquarters had exchanged names. In February 1945, Morshead received word that his objective would be Borneo. General Douglas MacArthur placed I Corps under his direct command for the operation. Morshead had to make a series of landings at Tarakan, North Borneo and Balikpapan on the east and north west coasts of the island. These were <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> great efficiency, achieving their objectives with low casualties.|$|E
5|$|NSB uses Gardermobanen for {{express and}} some {{regional}} trains north of Oslo. This includes five daily departures to Trondheim (including one NSB Night Train).

These services is <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Type 74 for R10 and R11, and Type 75 for line L12. Both trains are capable of 200km/t operation.
