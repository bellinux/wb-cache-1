40|$|Recent {{experience}} using ANOPP {{to predict}} turbofan engine flyover noise {{suggests that it}} over-predicts overall EPNL by a significant amount. An improvement in this prediction method is desired for system optimization and assessment studies of advanced UHB engines. An assessment of the ANOPP fan inlet, fan exhaust, jet, combustor, and turbine noise prediction methods is made using static engine component noise data from the CF 6 - 8 OC 2, E(3), and QCSEE turbofan engines. It is shown that the ANOPP prediction results are generally higher than the measured GE data, and that the inlet noise prediction method (Heidmann method) {{is the most significant}} source of this overprediction. Fan noise spectral comparisons show that improvements to the fan tone, broadband, and <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> models are required to yield results that more closely simulate the GE data. Suggested changes that yield improved fan noise predictions but preserve the Heidmann model structure are identified and described. These changes are based on the sets of engine data mentioned, as well as some CFM 56 engine data that was used to expand the <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> database. It {{should be noted that the}} recommended changes are based on an analysis of engines that are limited to single stage fans with design tip relative Mach numbers greater than one...|$|E

Acoustic spectra taken in the acoustically-treated inlet plenum, are presented for five operating points at each of two speeds, corresponding to relative rotor tip Mach numbers of about 1. 01 and 1. 12 (60 and 67 percent design speed). These spectra are analyzed for low and high frequency broadband noise, blade passage frequency noise, <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> and "haystack' noise (a very broad peak somewhat below blade passage frequency, which is occasionally observed in engines and fan test rigs). These types of noise are related to diffusion factor, total pressure ratio, and relative rotor tip Mach number.

The <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> from an airfoil has been received much attentions since 1970 s.

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> based on Helmholtz theory encounter essential interpreting difficulties, which the most known {{example is the}} anomalous behaviour of the <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> 2 f 1 -f 2. Without doubt the phenomenon of <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> is connected with nonlinear phenomena in the human ear. Therefore, it is generally assumed that the explanation of this phenomenon is possible {{on the level of}} the ear. This paper proposes different approach, which assumes the existence of an additional mechanism beyond the ear. The aim of this mechanism is to diminish sensitivity of the auditory process to nonlinear distortions by appropriate decoding of sound information. The general rule of construction and the mathematical model of such a mechanism is proposed, which allows for the explanation of many problems associated with <b>combination</b> <b>tones.</b> As a consequence an unexpected result is obtained with regard to a <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> 2 f 1 -f 2 that it can originate already from the nonlinear distortion of the second order.

50|$|The {{frequencies}} of the harmonic series, being integer multiples {{of the fundamental}} frequency, are naturally {{related to each other}} by whole-numbered ratios and small whole-numbered ratios are likely the basis of the consonance of musical intervals (see just intonation). This objective structure is augmented by psychoacoustic phenomena. For example, a perfect fifth, say 200 and 300 Hz (cycles per second), causes a listener to perceive a <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> of 100 Hz (the difference between 300 Hz and 200 Hz); that is, an octave below the lower (actual sounding) note. This 100 Hz first-order <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> then interacts with both notes of the interval to produce second-order <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> of 200 (300 - 100) and 100 (200 - 100) Hz and all further nth-order <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> are all the same, being formed from various subtraction of 100, 200, and 300. When one contrasts this with a dissonant interval such as a tritone (not tempered) with a frequency ratio of 7:5 one gets, for example, 700 - 500 = 200 (1st order <b>combination</b> <b>tone)</b> and 500 - 200 = 300 (2nd order). The rest of the <b>combination</b> <b>tones</b> are octaves of 100 Hz so the 7:5 interval actually contains 4 notes: 100 Hz (and its octaves), 300 Hz, 500 Hz and 700 Hz. Note that the lowest <b>combination</b> <b>tone</b> (100 Hz) is a 17th (2 octaves and a major third) below the lower (actual sounding) note of the tritone. All the intervals succumb to similar analysis as has been demonstrated by Paul Hindemith in his book The Craft of Musical Composition, although he rejected the use of harmonics from the 7th and beyond.|$|R

CFD application on turbomachinery unsteady flow is introduced and the two issues, fan <b>tone</b> <b>noise</b> and wind turbine have been reviewed. The CFD code to simulate the two different problems is introduced and its computational methodology is described. By using CFD method, the sound wave transmission in cut-on and cut-off situations are simulated and analysed. The results show that when the disturbance frequency is above the cut-off frequency, the pressure wave can propagate along the duct, when the disturbance frequency is below the cut-off frequency, the pressure wave will decay along the duct. The different decay rates depend on different cut off ratio. The mesh dependency of the computational simulations has been examined. Wind turbine blade-tower interaction is also simulated by using MB 3 D code. Adaptively pitching blade is introduced {{in order to minimize}} this interaction. The results show that with pitching blade by half degree or so, the unsteady forces on the blade can be at least halved, which can correspondingly reduce the bending moment (hence increase the fatigue life span), and improve the average power output.
