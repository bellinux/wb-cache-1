Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous <b>cadmium</b> <b>oxide</b> (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E

25|$|Cadmium is a soft, {{ductile metal}} (MH 2.0) that {{undergoes}} substantial deformation, under load, at room temperature. Like zinc, {{it has a}} crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) that is slightly distorted from the ideal. The halides of cadmium, {{with the exception of}} the fluoride, exhibit a substantially covalent nature. The oxides of cadmium in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely CdO and Cd(OH)2, are weakly amphoteric; it forms cadmates in strongly basic solutions. Cadmium forms Zintl phases such as LiCd, RbCd13 and CsCd13. When heated in air to a few hundred degrees, cadmium represents a toxicity hazard due to the release of cadmium vapour; when heated to its boiling point in air (just above 1000 K; 725 C; 1340 F; cf steel ~2700 K; 2425 C; 4400 F), the cadmium vapour oxidizes, 'with a reddish-yellow flame, dispersing as an aerosol of potentially lethal CdO particles.'

40|$|Abstract. Electrical contact {{material}} {{is a very}} important material for the electric power industry. An electrical contact material should display good structural characteristics (suitable hardness, high thermal conductivity and stabilization) as well as a good functional characteristic (low electrical resistivity). It is difficult to fabricate such a contact material with all these good performing parameters by common techniques because these physical parameters influence each other. In this paper, we report a novel investigation to design and prepare silver-metal oxide composite materials according to functionally layered and graded material (FLGM) concept and meeting requirement as electrical contact material. The silver-based composite samples characterized by layered component were prepared with conventional solid-phase sintering technique. One kind of sample consists of tin dioxide and silver material, in which SnO 2 exhibits a graded distribution. Another consists of two metal <b>oxides,</b> <b>cadmium</b> and zinc <b>oxides,</b> and silver material, in which each layer has different metal oxide. Hardness, thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity, were measured and related problems are discussed. Especially, welding resistance as an important parameter for practical application was tested. SEM analyses before and after electrical erosion were also performed. We conclude that the functionally graded material (FGM) concept as a novel designing and fabricating method has potential for electrical contact composite material...|$|R
