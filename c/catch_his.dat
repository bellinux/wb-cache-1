5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Dallas, Texas, to Eddie and Essie Banks on January 31, 1931; he was the second of twelve children. His father, who had worked in {{construction}} and was a warehouse loader for a grocery chain, played baseball for black, semi-professional teams in Texas. As a child, Banks was not very interested in baseball, preferring swimming, basketball and football. His father bought him a baseball glove for less than three dollars at a five and dime store and motivated him with nickels and dimes to play <b>catch.</b> <b>His</b> mother encouraged him to follow one of his grandfathers into {{a career as a}} minister.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E

25|$|In late 2006, Elefante {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to consider something he had never done in his career: <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> breath. Even with his reduced schedule, he needed a break. The brothers closed the label, and Elefante could finally take some {{time away from the}} industry. This proved more challenging than expected, and despite his best intentions, he served as producer on three albums in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{featured}} in films of French director/producer Luc Besson, parkour {{was first introduced}} to the British public by the BBC One station trailer Rush Hour. It featured David Belle leaping across London's rooftops from his office to home, {{in an attempt to}} <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> favourite BBC programme, and captured the imagination of many viewers, especially when they learned no special effects or wires were used. This advertisement, along with others for Coca-Cola, Nike, and Toyota, had a large-scale impact on public awareness of parkour.|$|E
25|$|George Colley, {{the man who}} Lynch saw as his successor, went to him and {{encouraged}} him to resign sooner. Colley was convinced that he had enough support to defeat the other likely candidate, Charles Haughey, and that Lynch should resign early to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> opponents on the hop. Lynch agreed to this and resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil on 5 December 1979, assured that Colley had the votes necessary to win. However, Haughey and his supporters had been preparing for months {{to take over the}} leadership and Lynch's resignation came as no surprise. He narrowly defeated Colley in the leadership contest and succeeded Lynch as Taoiseach.|$|E

25|$|O'Shaughnessy {{made his}} List A debut on 1 June 1980, in a John Player League for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Aigburth, though his {{contribution}} was minimal {{as he was}} dismissed for one and neither bowled nor held a <b>catch.</b> <b>His</b> first-class debut was just three days later, against Oxford University at The University Parks where he made an unbeaten 50 and took two catches in a ten-wicket victory. He took 3–23 in a John Player League match against Hampshire in late July, and ended the summer with seven List A wickets, but his only first-class victim of the season was Yorkshire opener Richard Lumb in late August.|$|E
25|$|As {{he himself}} {{described}} it {{in a magazine}} article he penned for Nel Cielo, his airfield was attacked by ten enemy bombers. He shot {{down one of the}} bombers in flames at 9AM. He then dueled with another for twenty minutes before it crashed. The observer leapt from the wreckage and lit it on fire to deny its capture. Unfortunately, the observer managed to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> own clothing on fire in the process. Still more unfortunately, the pilot was still pinned under the debris and burned to death. Meanwhile, Scaroni's squadron-mates shot down six more of the raiders. Scaroni capped off the day by downing another, even larger, bomber at 12:35. He thus ended the year with nine wins.|$|E
25|$|When Barton {{retired to}} become one of the {{founding}} justices of the High Court, Deakin succeeded him as Prime Minister on 24 September 1903. His Protectionist Party did not have a majority in either House, and he held office only by courtesy of the Labor Party, which insisted on legislation more radical than Deakin was willing to accept. Deakin was the first PM to call an early election, within two months of becoming the leader, to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> opponents off guard and take advantage of a large number of urban educated female voters who could cast a ballot for the first time. In April 1904, he resigned without passing any legislation. The Labor leader Chris Watson and the Free Trade leader George Reid succeeded him, but neither could form a stable ministry.|$|E

25|$|On August 20, 1057, Isaac Komnenos {{drew out}} his forces and {{arranged}} them for battle at a plain called, according to Michael Attaleiates, Polemon or Haidos. Kekaumenos commanded the left wing, Romanos Skleros the right, and Komnenos positioned {{himself in the}} centre. On the imperial side, Prince Aaron was stationed on the left wing, Basil Tarchaneiotes was positioned on the right, and the centre was commanded by Theodore the Eunuch. The imperial left wing under Prince Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing. Pursuing their troops to the rebel camp, he proceeded to capture Romanos Skleros {{and was on the}} cusp of victory when he hesitated, unsure of his next move. Komnenos, on the verge of fleeing to Nicaea, was able to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> breath and review what was happening on his left.|$|E
25|$|On January 3, 2014, Phil Everly died at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, 16 {{days before}} his 75th birthday, of lung disease. Phil's widow Patti openly blamed her husband's death on his smoking habit, which caused him to develop chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, and recounted Phil spending his final years having to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went and taking 20 different types of medications per day. She stated that although Phil had stopped smoking in 2001, his lungs had already sustained permanent damage. Phil's last public appearance was in 2011, at Buddy Holly's induction to Hollywood Boulevard's Star Walk of Fame, and he was then struggling to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> breath as he addressed the crowd. Patti established the Phil Everly Memorial COPD Foundation in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{measured}} {{radiated power}} with a thermo-pile and sensitive galvanometer read with a microscope. He {{was concerned with}} selective thermal radiation, which he investigated with plates of substances that radiated and absorbed selectively for different qualities of radiation rather than maximally for all qualities of radiation. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Helmholtz reciprocity principle (though he did not use an eponym for it). He did not in this paper mention that the qualities of the rays might be described by their wavelengths, nor did he use spectrally resolving apparatus such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium {{in which they had}} been prepared by heating to equilibrium with boiling water. His measurements confirmed that substances that emit and absorb selectively respect the principle of selective equality of emission and absorption at thermal equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} {{play of the}} game, the 10–5 Giants moved into the Patriots' red zone on a 52-yard {{completion}} from Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress. Three plays later, The Giants took the lead on a 7-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Jacobs. The Patriots responded {{with a pair of}} 14-yard completions to Moss and Welker; Welker's <b>catch,</b> <b>his</b> 102nd of the season, set a Patriots franchise record. The Patriots then converted a fourth down, and on their next fourth down, they made a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Patriots would regain the ball at midfield following a Giants three-and-out. Completions to Stallworth and Welker put the Patriots in the Giants' red zone, where Brady completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Moss, taking a 10–7 lead on the first play of the second quarter. On the play, three records were affected: the Patriots 560th point surpassed the 1998 Minnesota Vikings’s record of 556 points in a season; the touchdown pass was Brady’s 49th, tying Peyton Manning’s 2004 record; and Moss recorded his 22nd touchdown catch of the season, tying Jerry Rice's 1987 record.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Smith {{played in}} all 14 games {{for a second}} {{straight}} season. He earned ArenaBowl XVI game Ironman honors. He set single-season career-highs with 15 receptions for 234 yards finishing fifth on the team. He finished second on team with 49.5 tackles and eight passes broken up. Smith started at DS and recorded a career-high 8.5 tackles and matched his career-best with seven solo tackles at the Tampa Bay Storm. He had his first catch of the season against the Georgia Force. He was named the Ironman of the Game against the Los Angeles Avengers after recording two catches for 43 {{yards and a touchdown}} and five tackles along with a pass break up. He had his fifth career interception, and second returned for a touchdown on the road against the Orlando Predators. Smith recorded a career-long 37-yard reception on the road against the Buffalo Destroyers. He had the 20th reception of his career in Los Angeles. He was named Ironman of the Game after recording a 34-yard touchdown <b>catch,</b> <b>his</b> sixth career interception, and five tackles and two pass break ups against the Chicago Rush. Smith recorded a season-high three receptions against the Indiana Firebirds.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station in time to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms {{in a gesture of}} surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E

25|$|When the Volunteers didn't {{score on}} the first drive of the game, the Irish took advantage, with Brady Quinn leading an Irish drive that ended with his 43-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Anthony Fasano. The ensuing kickoff was fumbled by the Volunteers, and Quinn threw his second touchdown to Maurice Stovall three plays later. Volunteers' kicker, James Wilhout kicked a 26-yard field goal for their only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, on a Volunteer punt, Tom Zbikowski returned the ball 43-yards to give the Irish a 21-3 lead. After a Quinn fumble that was recovered by the Volunteers, Ainge led a 40-yard drive and threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to Bret Smith to give the halftime score of 21-10. In the second half, after a failed fourth down conversion by the Irish, Wilhout kicked a 30-yard field goal to put the Volunteers down by 8. When the Irish didn't answer, Ainge and running back Arian Foster led the Volunteers to Foster's 3-yard touchdown. With Ainge's pass to Smith completed for a two-point conversion, the game was tied at 21 {{at the end of}} the third. In the fourth quarter, however, the Irish scored 20, including two D.J. Fitzpatrick field goals, a Quinn touchdown pass to Jeff Samardzija, and a Zbikowski interception return for a touchdown. With no answers by the Volunteers, the Irish won the game 41-21. With the win, Quinn continued his Irish record touchdown passing streak to 13 games, Samardzija's touchdown <b>catch,</b> <b>his</b> 12th broke an Irish record of touchdown catches in a season, and the Irish moved up in ranking to 7th nationally.|$|E

500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to <b>catch</b> <b>his</b> flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
