5|$|The {{rights of}} the former presidents are defined by a {{parliamentary}} Act enacted in 2004, during the first term of Stjepan Mesić. Before that act was enacted, the constitution provided that the former presidents shall become members of the Chambers of Counties of the Parliament of Croatia for life, unless otherwise requested by the president. This was never exercised in practice, since Franjo Tuđman died in office and the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> was abolished {{before the end of}} the first term of Stjepan Mesić.|$|E
5|$|The oldest Sabor with extant records {{was held}} in Zagreb on 19 April 1273. This was the Sabor of Slavonia, and not of Croatia and Dalmatia. The {{earliest}} Sabor of the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia dates to 1351. The Parliament session held in 1527 in Cetin affirmed the House of Habsburg as Croatian rulers. After this, the Sabor became a regular gathering of the nobility, and its official title gradually stabilised by 1558 as the Parliament of the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. Since 1681, it has been formally called the Diet of the Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia. In 1712, the Sabor once again invoked its prerogative to select the ruler, supporting what later became the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. Since the mid-1800s, the Sabor has regularly met and its members have been regularly elected. Exercising its sovereignty once again on 29 October 1918, the Sabor decided on independence from Austria-Hungary and formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs which later joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Sabor did not meet between 1918 and 1945, except for an unelected Sabor convened in 1942. The Sabor initially reconvened as an assembly of State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH) in 1943 and evolved since through various structures following the November 1945 elections and several changes of the constitution. After the first multi-party elections since Communist rule and {{the adoption of the}} 1990 constitution, the Sabor was bicameral (Chamber of Representatives and <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties)</b> until 2001, when constitutional amendments changed it to the unicameral form currently used.|$|E

500|$|Under the Constitution of Croatia {{adopted in}} 1990, the Croatian Parliament became bicameral. The Chamber of Deputies {{had been elected}} a few months earlier, and its members enacted {{legislation}} creating a new territorial organisation of Croatia. This included 21 counties that were to be represented by the new <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> (...) [...] The first election of members to the chamber was held on 7 February 1993, with each county acting as a multi-seat constituency; three MPs were elected in each county {{on the basis of}} proportional representation. In addition, the President of Croatia appointed up to 5 more members of the Chamber of the Counties to complete its 68-strong membership.

500|$|The Parliament of Croatia (...) is a unicameral {{legislative}} body. A second chamber, the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> (...) , {{was set up}} in 1993 {{pursuant to}} the 1990 Constitution. The <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> was originally composed of three deputies from each of the twenty counties and the city of Zagreb. However, as it had no practical power over the Chamber of Representatives, it was abolished in 2001 and its powers were transferred to the county governments. The number of Sabor representatives can vary from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote and serve four-year terms. 140 members are elected in multi-seat constituencies, up to six members are chosen by proportional representation to represent Croatians living abroad and five members represent ethnic and national communities or minorities. The two largest political parties in Croatia are the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP). The last parliamentary election was held on 11 September 2016 in Croatia and on 10 and 11 September 2016 abroad.|$|E
50|$|The Speaker of the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> (Predsjednik Županijskog doma Hrvatskog sabora, {{literally}} the President of the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> of the Croatian Parliament) was the presiding {{officer of the}} <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties,</b> the upper chamber of the Croatian Parliament from 22 March 1993 until its abolition by constitution changes on 28 March 2001. The Speaker of the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> was elected {{by a majority of}} the chamber's members {{for the duration of the}} parliamentary term. In the event of a dissolution of the chamber, the speaker would continue to serve until the inauguration of his or her successor. Only two individuals held the office of Speaker of the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> during its eight-year existence: Josip Manolić (1993-1994) and Katica Ivanišević (1994-2001). Katica Ivanišević remains the only woman to have served as Speaker of either chamber of Croatian Parliament. The office became defunct upon the passing of constitutional amendments by which the <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Counties</b> was abolished and the bicameral Croatian Parliament was replaced by a unicameral parliamentary system. The lower chamber, formally known as the Chamber of Representatives (Croatian: Zastupnički dom) thus became the only parliamentary chamber and became known simply as the Croatian Parliament.|$|E
