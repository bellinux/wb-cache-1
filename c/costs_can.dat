5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, {{but less than}} Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a high-volume, year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. Set-up <b>costs</b> <b>can</b> be spread over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, {{which is not the}} case for shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E
5|$|If the broach {{is large}} enough the <b>costs</b> <b>can</b> be reduced by using a {{built-up}} or modular construction. This involves producing the broach in pieces and assembling it. If any portion wears out only that section has to be replaced, instead of the entire broach.|$|E
5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production <b>costs</b> <b>can</b> fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recounting {{introduces}} multiple pivotal {{events in}} two-candidate elections.

In envi-ronments where elections without recount fail to aggregate information efficiently, a modified election rule with small recount <b>cost</b> <b>can</b> produce asymptotically efficient outcomes with a vanishing small probability of actually invoking a recount.
