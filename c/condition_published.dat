40|$|Thermal {{stress can}} have a {{profound}} impact on the physiological responses that are elicited following environmental toxicant exposure. The efficacy by which toxicants enter the body is directly influenced by thermoregulatory effector responses that are evoked in response to high ambient temperatures. In mammals, the thermoregulatory response to heat stress consists of an increase in skin blood flow and moistening of the skin surface to dissipate core heat to the environment. These physiological responses may exacerbate chemical toxicity due to increased permeability of the skin, which facilitates the cutaneous absorption of many environmental toxicants. The core temperature responses that are elicited in response to high ambient temperatures, toxicant exposure or both can also have {{a profound impact on}} the ability of an organism to survive the insult. In small rodents, the thermoregulatory response to thermal stress and many environmental toxicants (such as organophosphate compounds) is often biphasic in nature, consisting initially of a regulated reduction in core temperature (i. e., hypothermia) followed by fever. Hypothermia is an important thermoregulatory survival strategy that is used by small rodents to diminish the effect of severe environmental insults on tissue homeostasis. The protective effect of hypothermia is realized by its effects on chemical toxicity as molecular and cellular processes, such as lipid peroxidation and the formation of reactive oxygen species, are minimized at reduced core temperatures. The beneficial effects of fever are unknown under these conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} memory deficits and re-duced hippocampal volumes in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal of the current research was to use functional neuroimaging and a validated explicit memory paradigm to examine hippocampal function in PTSD. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and a word-stem completion task to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the hippocampus in 16 firefighters: 8 with PTSD (PTSD group) and 8 without PTSD (Control group). During PET scanning, participants viewed three-letter word stems {{on a computer screen}} and completed each stem with a word they had previously encoded either deeply (High Recall condition) or shallowly (Low Recall condition). Relative to the Control group, the PTSD group exhibited significantly smaller rCBF increases in the left hippocampus in the High vs Low Recall comparison. However, this finding reflected relatively elevated rCBF in the Low Recall condition in the PTSD group. Collapsing across High and Low Recall conditions, (1) the PTSD group had higher rCBF in bilateral hippocampus and left amygdala than the Control group, and (2) within the PTSD group, symptom severity was positively asso-ciated with rCBF in hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. The groups did not significantly differ with regard to accuracy scores on the word-stem completion task. The PTSD group had significantly smaller right (and a trend for smaller left) hippocampal volumes than the Control group. The results suggest an abnormal rCBF response in the hippocampus during explicit recollection of nonemotional material in firefighters with PTSD, and that this abnormal response appears to be driven by relatively elevated hippocampal rCBF in the comparison <b>condition.</b> <b>Published</b> 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc. ...|$|E
40|$|One of the aphorisms {{that has}} become part of our folk wisdom asserts that {{knowledge}} of the past is essential for an understanding of the present. Another, equally valid and equally bromidic, holds that anyone who would predict the future had better be perspicacious about the present. We seem to have taken the latter apothegm to heart since our society may be the most self-conscious and introspective in the history of civilization if one judges by the number of analyses of its present <b>condition</b> <b>published</b> each year. I shall not presume to essay yet another analysis of the current Zeitgeist; never - the less, since any viable social institution must reflect its time, it seems to me advisable to identify a few of the trends that are presently exerting a powerful influence on library theory and development and on the public attitude toward libraries. That I must refer to these trends separately and seriatim is a consequence of my being a product of the linear, rational tradition that evolved, Professor McLuhan tells us, from Mr. Gutenberg's invention. Obviously, however, they are all closely interrelated. First of all, we seem to be more aware than any previous society of the dominance of the principle of change in human affairs. So convinced are we of the need for rapid adaptation to change that the charge of resisting it immediately puts an organization or a profession on the defensive. On occasion, mere commonsense questioning of proposed adaptations to new conditions or of the efficacy of new procedures leads to the accusation of reactionary thinking, and any profession runs the risk of being downgraded by society if it relies for public approbation on its distinguished tradition of accomplishment more than on its demonstration of receptivity toward the new and modern, even when the new and modern are untested and unproven. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} state-of-the-art tools for the regulation of complex, non-linear systems to improve the methodologies currently applied to trim comprehensive virtual prototypes of rotors and rotorcrafts. Among the several methods that have been proposed in the literature, the auto-pilot approach {{has the potential to}} solve trim problems efficiently even for the large and complex vehicle models of modern comprehensive finite element-based analysis codes. In this approach, the trim condition is obtained by adjusting the controls so as to virtually ``fly' the system to the final steady (periodic) flight <b>condition.</b> <b>Published</b> proportional auto-pilots show to work well in many practical instances. However, they cannot guarantee good performance and stability in all flight conditions of interest. Limit-cycle oscillations in control time histories are often observed in practice because of the non-linear nature of the problem and the difficulties in enforcing the constant-in-time condition for the controls. To address all the above areas of concern, in this research we propose a new auto-pilot, based on non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC). The formulation uses a non-linear reference model of the system augmented with an adaptive neural element, which identifies and corrects the mismatch between reduced model and controlled system. The methodology is tested on the wind-tunnel trim of a rotor multibody model and compared to an existing implementation of a classic auto-pilot. The proposed controller shows good performance without the need of a potentially very expensive tuning phase, which is required in classical auto-pilots. Moreover, model-predictive control provides a framework for guaranteeing stability of the non-linear closed-loop system, so {{it seems to be a}} viable approach for trimming complete rotorcraft comprehensive models in free-flight.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the revisions Samuel Richardson made to his first novel, Pamela, and its sequel, Pamela in Her Exalted <b>Condition,</b> <b>published</b> within his lifetime. Richardson, who was his own printer, revised Pamela eight times over twenty years, the sequel three times, and the majority of the variants have hitherto suffered from critical neglect. Because {{it is well known that}} Richardson responded to friendly and antagonistic 2 ̆ 2 collaborators 2 ̆ 2 by making emendations, I also examine the extant documents that played a role in Pamela 2 ̆ 7 s development, including Richardson 2 ̆ 7 s correspondence and contemporary criticisms of the novel. Pamela Reworded, then, is an explanation, exhibition, and interpretation of what Richardson revised, why he revised, and, more importantly, how the revisions affect one 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the novel and its characters. While studies of Pamela 2 ̆ 7 s composition history have been thoroughly discussed in Richardson biographies, and the influence of Richardson 2 ̆ 7 s contemporaries on the novel 2 ̆ 7 s revisions has been examined, a comprehensive study of the variants and their impact on the narrative has remained in a scholarly limbo between textual and literary criticism. My collation is supported by documentary evidence about the text, including relevant contemporary conversations, in an attempt to illustrate the evolution of the novel through its different editions, and an exhibition of the variants is further supported by literary analysis. This exploration of why Richardson emended Pamela and what he changed informs how the revisions impact the novel and its characters. The results indicate that he typically revised in similar ways in subsequent editions, but at different times he had different intentions, and the changes he made serve different purposes. As a result, I contend that new and even contradictory perspectives of the novel 2 ̆ 7 s hero and heroine emerge. Consequently, this dissertation dissertations up additional opportunities in the study of Pamela and, perhaps, the eighteenth-century novel as well...|$|E
