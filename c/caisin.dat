50|$|Although {{a junior}} line, the Uí <b>Caisin</b> {{continued}} to have a prominent role {{and the leader of}} their kindred in Thomond were the MacNamara, who as Lords of Clancullen, were the second most powerful family after the O'Brien. Other families descended from the branch of Carthann (son of <b>Caisin)</b> include Harley, Flood, Torrens, Stoney, Hickey, O'Hay, Clancy, Neylon and Flattery. Carthann had brothers named Eocha and Sineall from whom descends the O'Grady, Tubridy, Hartigan, Durkin, Killeen and Hogg. In addition to this, there are the Cineal Fearmaic who claim to descend from Aengus Cinathrach, a brother of <b>Caisin</b> and Bloid. This kindred included the O'Dea as leaders, as well as the O'Quin, O'Heffernan, Kielty and Perkin.|$|E
50|$|Mac Conmara (anglicised as MacNamara or McNamara) is an Irish surname of {{a family}} of County Clare in Ireland. The MacNamara family were a Dál gCais sept and after the O'Briens one of the most {{powerful}} families in the Kingdom of Thomond as Lords of Clancullen (a title later divided into East and West families). They are related to the O'Gradys, also descended from the Uí <b>Caisin</b> line of the Dál gCais.|$|E
50|$|The septs of the Dál gCais {{developed}} over time, with new ones breaking off to form separate surnames at different times, but all claiming {{to share the}} same paternal line (with a few biological exceptions along the way due to adoption or extra-marital issue). Their eponymous founder Cas had severals sons; two of them gave their names to the Uí Bloid and Uí <b>Caisin</b> kindreds, another founded the Cineal Fearmaic. As the proto-Dál gCais moved up into what is today East Clare, these became associated with rooted tribal areas, but were themselves internally divided into any other septs.|$|E
40|$|Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra) and <b>Caisin</b> (Brassica rapa subsp. parachinensis) are leafy {{vegetable}} crops grown in south-east Asian countries where rainfall varies dramatically from excess to deficit {{within and between}} seasons. We investigated the physiological and growth responses of these plants to waterlogging and water deficit in a controlled experiment in a glasshouse. Juvenile plants were subjected to waterlogging or water deficit for 19 days in case of Chinese kale and 14 days in case of <b>Caisin</b> and compared with well-watered controls. <b>Caisin</b> tolerated waterlogging better than Chinese kale because it produced hypocotyl roots and gas spaces developed at the stem base. In Chinese kale, waterlogging reduced plant fresh weight (90 %), leaf area (86 %), dry weight (80 %) and leaf number (38 %). In contrast, waterlogging had no impact on leaf number in <b>Caisin</b> and reduced plant fresh and dry weights and leaf area by 60 - 70 %. Water deficit reduced leaf area, fresh weight and dry weight of both species by more than half. Leaf number in Chinese kale was reduced by 38 % but no effect occurred in <b>Caisin.</b> Water deficit increased the concentration of nitrogen in the leaf dry matter by more than 60 % in both species and the leaf colour of water deficient plants was dark green compared with the leaf colour of well-watered plants. Soil water deficit delayed flowering of <b>Caisin</b> while waterlogging accelerated it. Thickening and whitening of the cuticle on the leaves of Chinese kale probably increased its ability to retain water under drought while <b>Caisin</b> adjusted osmotically and Chinese kale did not. Waterlogging and water deficit had strong effects on leaf gas exchange of both Brassica species. Water deficit closed the stomata in both species and this {{was associated with a}} leaf water content of 9 g g - 1 DW. In contrast, waterlogging reduced conductance from 1. 0 to 0. 1 mol H 2 O m - 2 s - 1 in direct proportion to changes in leaf water content, which fell from 11 to 5 g g - 1 DW. This separation of the effects of water deficit and waterlogging on conductance was reflected in transpiration, internal CO 2 concentration and net photosynthesis. In conclusion, Chinese kale and <b>Caisin</b> showed rather different adaptations in response to waterlogging and water deficit. <b>Caisin</b> was more tolerant of waterlogging than Chinese kale and also showed evidence of tolerance of drought. There is genetic variation to waterlogging within the Brassica genus among the {{leafy vegetable}}s {{that could be used for}} cultivar improvement...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCK chondrites are {{the only}} group of {{carbonaceous}} chondrites with petrologictypes ranging from 3 to 6. Although CKs are described as calcium-aluminum-rich inclusion(CAI) -poor objects, the abundance of CAIs in the 18 CK 3 – 6 we analyzed ranges from zeroto approximately 16. 4 %. During thermal metamorphism, some of the fine-grained CAIsrecrystallized as irregular assemblages of plagioclase + Ca-rich pyroxene ! olivine ! Ca-poor pyroxene ! magnetite. Coarse-grained CAIs display zoned spinel, fassaitedestabilization, and secondary grossular and spinel. Secondary anorthite, grossular,Ca-rich pyroxene, and spinel derive from the destabilization of melilite, which is lacking inall CAIs investigated. The Al-Mg isotopic systematics measured in fine- and coarsegrainedCAIs from Tanezrouft (Tnz) 057 was affected by Mg redistribution. The partialequilibration of Al-Mg isotopic signatures obtained {{in the core of}} a coarse-grained CAI(CG 1 -CAI) in Tnz 057 may indicate a lower peak temperature for Mg diffusion ofapproximately 540 – 580 °C, while grossular present in the core of this CAI indicates ahigher temperature of around 800 °C for the metamorphic event on the parent body ofTnz 057.

40|$|Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) is an {{important}} seedborne virus that infects vegetable crops, especially Brassicae group, in Indonesia. Reliable detection method having high accuracy is required to detect the virus from seeds {{in order to avoid}} disease incidence as early as possible. A study was conducted to evaluate three total RNA extraction methods from Brassica seeds for TuMV detection using reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction. The samples used are Brassica rappa seeds and seedling germinated for 3, 5, and 7 days. Total RNA extraction methods evaluated consisted of Wylie method, Randles method, and commercial kit as comparation. Total RNA extracted using Wylie and Randles methods has high concentration but low level of purity, on the other hand total RNA obtained using  commercial kit has low concentration but high level of purity. Detection of TuMV from seed was  successfully carried out using Wylie and Randles methods, TuMV from 3 - day old seedlings was detected using all three methodes, TuMV from 5 -day old seedlings was only detected using Randles method, whereas TuMV from 7 -day old seedlings was not detected using all three methodes.
