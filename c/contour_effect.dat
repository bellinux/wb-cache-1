It means a little variation of deposited mass {{on the surface of}} QCN and it will cause the change of thickness-shear-mode resonant frequency. An electro-mechanical coupled-field 3 D finite element method is applied to analyze the resonant frequency, modal shape, harmonic response, and the <b>contour</b> <b>effect</b> for AT-cut piezoelectric quartz crystal (PQC).

40|$|Neurones {{tuned for}} second-order stimuli—those which have edges defined by {{properties}} other than luminance and colour—have been frequently observed in prestriate cortex and in area V 2 there are neurones which explicitly and unambiguously signal {{the orientation of}} purely subjective contours, i. e. contours with no Fourier components at {{the orientation of the}} perceived edge [von der Heydt, R. 2 ̆ 6 Peterhans, E. (1989) Journal of Neuroscience, 9, 1731 – 1748]. No neurones in area V 1 showed similar tuning characteristics. In addition, it has been demonstrated that like real contours, purely subjective test contours are subject to tilt aftereffects following prolonged viewing of an adapting stimulus, whether that stimulus is real or subjective [Paradiso, M. A., Shimojo, S. 2 ̆ 6 Nakayama, K. (1989) Vision Research, 29, 1205 – 1213]. This result supports the assertion that the cortical processes responsible for real contour perception are also those giving rise to subjective contour perception. The data reported here further examined this hypothesis. Four experiments show that purely subjective contours exhibit both direct and indirect tilt aftereffects and tilt illusions like those observed with real contours. Further, they provide evidence that direct and indirect subjective <b>contour</b> <b>effects,</b> like direct and indirect real <b>contour</b> <b>effects,</b> arise via the operation of two mechanisms: a low level process, possibly lateral inhibition between orientation channels, and a second “higher-order” process. The data suggest that processing of orientation information beyond the striate cortex is similar to that which occurs in area V 1 and the data are consistent with models of contour processing which assume that all perceived contours, both real and subjective, arise from a common mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiological}} {{appearance of}} a double contour {{on the sides of}} the long bones of infants has been noted by several writers since Chiari first drew attention to it in 1938. Many theories of its causation and significance have been advanced, including the view that it may be due to organic disease such as rickets or syphilis. Glaser, however, in 1949 suggested that this appearance may be seen in radiographs of normal, healthy bone, and that its production depends on the angle of projection. The results of the investigation described below support his view that a double <b>contour</b> <b>effect</b> may be seen in normal bones, but suggest that its origin is in the histological structure of the bone itself rather than in the technique of radiography...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{setting of}} hierarchical Bayesian inference is gaining acceptance {{as a framework}} for understanding cortical computation. In this paper, we describe how Bayesian belief propagation in a spatio-temporal hierarchical model, called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), can lead to a mathematical model for cortical circuits. An HTM node is abstracted using a coincidence detector and a mixture of Markov chains. Bayesian belief propagation equations for such an HTM node define a set of functional constraints for a neuronal implementation. Anatomical data provide a contrasting set of organizational constraints. The combination of these two constraints suggests a theoretically derived interpretation for many anatomical and physiological features and predicts several others. We describe the pattern recognition capabilities of HTM networks and demonstrate the application of the derived circuits for modeling the subjective <b>contour</b> <b>effect.</b> We also discuss how the theory and the circuit can be extended to explain cortical features that are not explained by the current model and describe testable predictions that can be derived from the model...|$|E

For each inlet configuration, complex directivity patterns and complex pressure reflection coefficients are measured {{as a function of}} a single space-time structure of the wave (up to a frequency of 4000 Hz and an azimuthal wave number 6) and of flow velocity (up to Mach number 0. 4) in a cylindrical duct located downstream the inlet. Experimental results of radiation from an unflanged duct are compared with theory. Effect of inlet contour and flow are deduced by comparing respectively unflanged duct and bellmouth measurements and, no flow and flow measurements with the bellmouth. Results are presented which indicate that the <b>contour</b> <b>effect</b> is significant near the cut-on frequency of a mode and emphasize the necessity for taking into account the inlet geometry in a radiation prediction.

40|$|Contour Completion {{plays an}} {{important}} role in visual perception, where the goal is to group fragmented low-level edge elements into perceptually coherent and salient contours. This process is often considered as guided by some middle-level Gestalt principles. Most existing methods for contour completion have focused on utilizing rather local Gestalt laws such as good-continuity and proximity. In contrast, much fewer methods have addressed the global <b>contour</b> closure <b>effect,</b> despite that many psychological evidences have shown the usefulness of closure in perceptual grouping. This paper proposes a novel higher-order CRF model to address the <b>contour</b> closure <b>effect,</b> through local connectedness approximation. This leads to a simplified problem structure, where the higher-order inference can be formulated as an integer linear program (ILP) and solved by an efficient cutting-plane variant. Tested on the BSDS benchmark, our method achieves a comparable precision-recall performance, a superior contour grouping ability (measured by Rand index), and more visually pleasing results, compared with existing methods. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis of low Reynolds number nozzle flows {{was performed to}} investigate the loss mechanisms involved and to determine the nozzle wall contour that minimizes these losses. DSMC was used to simulate flows through three different nozzle configurations at two different stagnation chamber temperatures so that the heat transfer losses could {{be separated from the}} wall <b>contour</b> <b>effects</b> on performance. A trumpet-shaped nozzle had 5 percent higher efficiency than a conical nozzle and a 3 percent higher efficiency than a bell-shaped nozzle with the unheated flow. With heated flow both the trumpet and bell-shaped nozzles had a 6. 5 percent higher efficiency than the conical nozzle. The conical nozzle had the highest discharge coefficient of the three configurations, 0. 92, and the trumpet-shaped nozzle had the lowest, 0. 82. The discharge coefficient of each nozzle was unaffected by the change in stagnation temperature; however the increase in stagnation temperature increased the heat transfer and viscous losses in the boundary layer. These results suggest that the trumpet-shaped wall contour performed most efficiently except near the throat region, where it incurred large viscous losses. However, the bell-shaped nozzle may increase its overall performance with an increase in stagnation temperature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The time {{consuming}} {{part of the}} encoding step is the search for an appropriate domain for each range. Several methods have been devised to accelerate the search and reduce the encoding complexity. In this paper we implement both quadtree and diamond partitioning. Quadtree partitioning uses horizontally and vertically oriented domains that are {{twice as large as}} the ranges. This works extremely well for images that has horizontal and vertical block structure. Many images also possess block structures oriented in other directions. Thus it makes sense to add domains that are of diamond or other kinds of shapes so that a large range block may find a "close " domain counterpart to avoid being further partitioned [...] The diamond is well suited for our needs because it is already in a square shape on only rotational transformations of 45 degrees are needed to related them to our square ranges. Adding diamond domains reduces the number of range partitions,increases the BPP of the compressed images and increases the fidelity of encoded images. Finally we implemented the post-processing of the decoded images to filter out the <b>contour</b> <b>effects</b> due to quantization of the shift (s) and offset (o) parameters...|$|R

It is important to use conserving approximations such that the evolution of the electron density, momentum, and total energy agrees with the macroscopic conservation laws. One of the main topics in this paper is the non-interacting Green function, which is the relevant quantity for time-dependent density functional theory. We discuss this Green function in detail, and show how the Keldysh contour in a simple way allows us to derive the time-dependent Kohn-Sham potential from an action functional. The formalism in a similar way leads to response functions that obey the causality principle. To illustrate these points, we discuss the time-dependent optimized effective potential equations.
