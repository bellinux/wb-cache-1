One <b>can</b> also <b>transfer</b> the notion of normal terms to a notion of normal proofs, expressing that the hypotheses of the axioms never need to be all detached (since otherwise a simplification can happen).|$|R
5|$|The host {{controller}} directs {{traffic flow}} to devices, so no USB device <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> any {{data on the}} bus without an explicit request from the host controller. In USB2.0, the host controller polls the bus for traffic, usually in a round-robin fashion.

5|$|Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, {{introduced}} in 2006, offer high-fidelity audio features that require HDMI for best results. HDMI 1.3 can transport Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, and DTS-HD Master Audio bitstreams in compressed form. This capability allows for an AV receiver {{with the necessary}} decoder to decode the compressed audio stream. The Blu-ray specification does not include video encoded with either deep color or xvYCC; thus, HDMI 1.0 <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> Blu-ray discs at full video quality.|$|E
5|$|Electrons <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> between {{different}} orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E

5|$|Fruit bodies can be {{inhabited}} by species of limoniid flies, such as Discobola marginata or Limonia yakushimensis, {{as well as}} several species of fungi-dwelling mites. The flies are hosts for the mites in a symbiotic association known as phoresis, whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host. Mites are small and unable to migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, are large and <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.|$|E
5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her. Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.|$|E

5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E
5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Special springs can {{be found}} {{near the top of}} certain acts. By jumping onto these springs, the player can reach a special stage, where they are sent falling down a tube on a {{snowboard}} while trying to collect enough rings to meet the target amount. By completing the stage, the player receives a Chaos Emerald. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds unlocks the game's true ending. The game also features a minigame called the Tiny Chao Garden, in which players can raise Chao. Players <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> their Chao between the Tiny Chao Garden and the Chao Garden from the GameCube versions of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2. The game also features a competitive multiplayer mode, where up to four owners of the game can race {{to the end of a}} level or search for Chao.|$|E

5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume control}} of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses {{crossbows}} to deliver ranged attacks. The game {{can be played}} as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick or set of keys, and firing weapons {{is controlled by the}} other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players <b>can</b> <b>transfer</b> health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one {{at the expense of the}} other.|$|E
