50|$|It has a slim <b>bulb</b> (<b>coloured</b> cream) {{with a long}} thin neck. Below {{the bulb}} are {{tuberous}} roots that are white, thin and 6in long. The fragile roots mean that the bulb does not take transplanting very well.|$|R
50|$|Another solo in 2004 took Veeraraghvan's {{scrutiny}} of the strangeness of perception further. This untitled exhibition questioned the limits of sight playing optical tricks on the viewers. The show was made to resemble a fair or playground. White cotton curtains created a labyrinth, while wires studded with <b>coloured</b> light <b>bulbs</b> dangled from the ceilings. The last installation was called How Many Shadows Have You?, and comprised tremulous, multi-hued shadows of viewers on gallery walls. A series of seven photographic prints made from unexposed negatives also reflected passersby in their colourful depths.|$|R
50|$|The Club {{provided}} language {{classes and}} less-formal discussion {{groups in a}} number of languages, including French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, and Esperanto. The discussion groups could cover any number of topics, except politics and sex. The Linguists' Club was open 6 days a week, from 11 am to 11 pm. There was a snack bar, no alcohol was served. There was a TV room, a ping-pong room, a small cinema for showing foreign-language films, and Friday evening dances to records. Just after World War II, some Club dances were held on the roof-garden of the Chester Close location, illuminated by <b>coloured</b> light <b>bulbs.</b> For a time, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, the Club organised trips abroad for members, and there were also visits to a social venue near Leatherhead, Surrey, known as Surrey Crest.|$|R
40|$|This paper takes Forced Entertainment’s performance, Tomorrow’s Parties, and casts a dramaturgical eye on how {{the text}} enacts and erases a series of utopias and dystopias. Standing still on wooden pallets for over an hour, two performers, one woman and one man, {{describe}} and then discard a string of fictive futures. Illuminated by <b>coloured</b> light <b>bulbs</b> that fade out over {{the duration of the}} performance, the pallets represent both a life raft and a soapbox for these two lost politicians of hypothesis, building on and deconstructing each other’s arguments about life in the future. The paper imagines the text as a shifting landscape of potential that ebbs and flows and questions notions of politics, gender, ethics and environment. With reference to the company’s devising processes drawing on Tim Etchell’s practice of iterative writing and Austin’s notion of the ‘performative’, the paper explores how the text corrects itself, questions its logic and reflects on its origins. Tomorrow’s Parties is a post-dramatic text that sits somewhere between science fiction and fantasy and touches upon terror and catastrophe. It predicts and undermines the endgame of the world but also the endgame we play when we are making the world of a performance...|$|R
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Sleep Alone" [...] begins with Khan singing in her bedroom. In one shot, {{she seems to}} be drawing and in another shot, she is lying on her bed, facing {{what seems to be a}} paper robot. Another shot shows Khan {{standing}} outside a building which is seen to be under construction. As Khan sings, various shots of herself staring into a shop window and a television can be seen. In the next shot before the chorus, Khan is walking down a dark street whilst holding a paper bag. She is dressed in a red coat. She sees a group of people gathered on the floor, examining what seems to be little <b>coloured</b> light <b>bulbs.</b> Khan then walks past an initially dark shop, and the lights turn on as she walks by. She takes a closer look into the shop window and sees various objects, such a spinning disco ball, a turntable and she is attracted by a heart-shaped red plastic object. She hears something and quickly turns behind, and the group of people she saw previously throws the light bulbs at her. She then reaches into her paper bag and takes out the same heart-shaped red plastic object she saw in the shop. She returns to her room. The shot changes to Khan wearing a white dress and drawing on the paper what seems to be the construction of the heart-shaped red plastic object.|$|R
