50|$|A process using a two-sided {{mould set}} that forms both {{surfaces}} of the panel. On the lower side is a rigid mould and on the upper side is a flexible membrane made from silicone or an extruded polymer film such as nylon. Reinforcement materials can be placed manually or robotically. They include <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>forms</b> fashioned into textile constructions. Most often, they are pre-impregnated with the resin {{in the form of}} prepreg fabrics or unidirectional tapes. In some instances, a resin film is placed upon the lower mould and dry reinforcement is placed above. The upper mould is installed and vacuum is applied to the mould cavity. The assembly is placed into an autoclave. This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{due to the}} {{increasing}} importance of environmental issues, biodegradable polymers, especially polylactic acid (PLA), have attracted attention. However, their applications are limited because the impact resistance and heat resistance of PLA are {{lower than those of}} the petroleum-derived resin. The impact resistance of PLA {{has been the subject of}} research and development in injection-moulding; it can be achieved by combining PLA with short natural fibres. However, the impact resistance of PLA does not rise sufficiently as a result, thus reinforcement of PLA with <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres</b> is expected. A FRTP high speed compression moulding method using the electromagnetic induction heating system, in which it is possible to control the temperature of the mould surface, is proposed and high speed forming of FRTP using <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> becomes possible. However, the impact resistance of PLA reinforced with jute <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres</b> has not been studied yet. In this study, jute <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced PLA was moulded by the FRTP high speed compression moulding method, using an electromagnetic induction heating system. The effect of nucleating agents and the annealing process on their impact properties were investigated. Since this system allows control of the temperature of the mould surface, it is able to perform an annealing process during the moulding process. In this study, jute <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres</b> and PLA with a nucleating agent were used to develop high impact resistance FRTP. The impact performance of JFRTP is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Fibre-reinforced polymer laminas are <b>formed</b> by {{embedding}} <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres</b> in a resin matrix, which binds the <b>fibres</b> together <b>forming</b> {{a composite}} ply. The plies are then stacked {{together in a}} certain sequence 1 to form composite-laminated plates (figure 1). The use of fibre-reinforced polymer laminas as a construction material has increased in recent years. The primary reason for this increase is their non-corrosive nature and long term durability, high tensile strength-toweight ratio, electromagnetic neutrality and resistance to chemical attack. Because of their high strength to weight ratios slender structural components may be formed by using composite laminates due to which, however, buckling may become a main concern, and fibre orientation and boundary conditions of the laminated plates are important parameters determining the buckling behaviour...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> {{reinforced}} thermoplastic matrix composites {{have been}} successfully employed in the aircraft, military and aerospace industries due to the excellent properties (Brandt et al. 1993 & Nunes et al 2005 a). In these and many other commercial engineering applications, they can replace other materials, such as thermosetting matrix composites. However, {{the high cost of}} the impregnation of <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> thermoplastic composites, arising from the melting of the polymer or the use of solvents, still restricts their use in commercial applications. Hence, cost reduction largely depends on developing more efficient methods for impregnating fibres with high-viscosity thermoplastics and for processing final composite parts. This chapter summarizes the development of new technologies to fabricate long and <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced composite structures from thermoplastic matrix semi-products (towpregs and PCT – pre-consolidated tapes) for commercial and highly demanding markets. The production of <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced thermoplastic matrix towpregs and PCT’s was done using a recently developed coating line (Nunes et al. 2008, 2010 & Silva, R. F. et al. 2008). Using this prototype equipment, it was possible to produce glass fibre polypropylene (PP) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) towpregs for commercial markets and towpregs from carbon fibres and Primospire®, an amorphous highly aromatic material developed by Solvay Advanced Polymers, for application in advanced markets (Nunes et al. 2005, 2009 & Silva, J. F. et al. 2010). To process these thermoplastic pre-pregs into composite structures, conventional thermosetting equipments were adapted to fabricate thermoplastic matrix composites. Filament winding, pultrusion and hot compression moulding were the studied technologies. The mechanical properties determined on the final composites were compared with the theoretical predictions and have shown to be acceptable for the targeted markets. As applications, filament wound pressure vessels prototypes for gas and incompressible fluids were produced from towpregs and submitted to internal pressure burst tests [Silva, J. F. et al. 2008 & Velosa et al. 2009). These prototypes have accomplished all requirements of the applicable European standards...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil {{the need for}} {{efficient}} large volume capable production technologies for high performance composite structures, a new processing technology has been developed. The process {{is based on the}} injection moulding technology but differs from this known processing technology by enabling the production of <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced high performance composites with fibre volume contents of over 40 % by volume. The processing technology enables the processing of very low viscosity polymer intermediate products such as caprolactam which is mixed with suitable activator and catalyst additives prior to the injection into the mould cavity. After the infiltration of the <b>continuous</b> dry <b>fibre</b> preform in the mould cavity the polymer intermediate system undergoes an anionic in-situ polymerisation to form the engineering thermoplast polyamide 6. The developed processing technology utilises the automated features of the injection moulding machine to enable a more efficient process than the current available state of the art processing technologies which are used to produce <b>continuous</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced thermoplastic composites such as the resin transfer moulding techniques. Thereby the overall goal for the process development is to reduce the process cycle time and the labour required to produce such high performance thermoplastic composites...|$|R
40|$|The translaminar {{fracture}} toughness determines {{in many cases}} the damage tolerance of composite components, and this property is strongly influenced by the microstructure. A finite element model was developed that can aid in the optimisation of the microstructure for maximising the translaminar {{fracture toughness}} of composites hybridised at the tow level. The model proved that the toughness is increased when the crack has to grow through an interface between carbon and glass in a hybrid composite. This implies that the microstructure can be optimized to maximize the translaminar fracture toughness. Hybridisation at the tow level is now possible by using micro-tow placement machines. Therefore, samples were 3 D-printed with <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres.</b> Therefore, samples were 3 D printed with <b>continuous</b> <b>fibres.</b> Compact tension tests indicated that the toughness can indeed be increased by fibre-hybridization.

40|$|International audienceCertain {{material}} have a {{non linear}} stress-strain behaviour under monotonic loading. This non linearity {{can be caused}} by continuous damage. To highlight this phenomena simultaneous strain and damage measurements should be taken.
