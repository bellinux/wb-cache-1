500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down her cheeks while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on what happens in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first look}} of the film was {{supposed}} to be released along with Dharma Productions' We Are Family on 3 September. Later the trailer was withdrawn from We Are Family. The official reason given for the postponement of the trailer was the time factor as the producers felt {{that there was a lot}} of time before the release of Guzaarish, and hence it was decided Guzaarish's first promotional trailer would feature in theaters a month later with Siddharth Anand's Anjaana Anjaani. However the real story was that there were some concerns over a sequence showing Aishwarya Rai puffing away frantically at a <b>cigarette</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trailer. While smoking is not entirely prohibited in Indian films, it is certainly seen to be injurious to health, especially since the one smoking on screen is a global icon playing a nurse. Sources close to the film revealed, [...] "Aishwarya is not really smoking in Guzaarish. It's a very cute, funny and a very beautiful sequence where she is trying to smoke when she doesn't know how to." [...] Irrespective of the context it had been decided that the release date of the first trailer would be postponed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The use {{of tobacco}} {{products}} would not continue without {{the initiation of}} their use by youth and adults. Since {{the vast majority of}} cigarette smokers begin smoking by age 25, understanding the role of menthol <b>cigarettes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation of smoking <b>in</b> youth (under <b>the</b> age of 18) and young adults (aged 18 – 25) is especially relevant. Data demonstrate that menthol cigarettes are disproportionately used by youth and young adults. This review seeks to examine what role, if any, menthol plays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation of <b>cigarette</b> smoking. Overall, there is a paucity of data on this topic. The data that do exist suggests that youth who have smoked for less than 1 year are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than youth who have smoked for more than 1 year. A lack of data prevents further conclusions on the role of menthol <b>cigarettes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation of smoking. </p...|$|R

The {{results of the study}} shows that the price elasticity of demand for <b>cigarettes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run is higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run for the Swedish consumers, which is in line with previous studies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. The fact that the price elasticity of demand for <b>cigarettes</b> is higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run, indicates that the substitution effect has {{a significant impact on the}} price elasticity of demand for <b>cigarettes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run. The study was conducted in two parts where the authors investigated the effect of cigarette tax on <b>cigarette</b> prices and <b>in</b> addition <b>the</b> <b>cigarette</b> prices impact on <b>the</b> demand for <b>cigarettes</b> <b>in</b> Sweden. <b>The</b> combined result of the study demonstrates that increasing the cigarette tax by 10 per cent means that the demand for cigarettes is reduced by 5 per cent, while government revenues from the cigarette tax will increase by 4. 5 per cent. <b>The</b> result <b>in</b> this paper shows why the state's incentive to raise the cigarette tax is twofold, since a tax increase will generate health benefits through reduced consumption and generate increased revenues to the state. These incentives are also shown to have a greater impact <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long term.  Studien undersöker efterfrågans priselasticitet på cigaretter på kort- och lång sikt i Sverige.
