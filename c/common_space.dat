25|$|About {{governance}} : Two approaches shall {{enable us}} to tackle the problems of higher education institutions’ governance in Africa. The first one is current. It consists of rationalizing, valorizing and modernizing both the university foundations and their various systems of functioning. It supposes to put on better the whole university structure : better management, transparency in the decision-making and the participation of all actors in the decision-making. The second approach of governance fundamentally questions {{the efficiency of the}} systems of functioning of universities, too much centered on the hierarchical authority of the State, and on that of the university and academic administration, whether it is to define the financing, programs, the qualifications and even the courses of training. The governance of higher education will succeed only if it allows creating a <b>common</b> <b>space</b> of meeting between the actors : political, socioeconomic, students, teaching and civil society.|$|E
40|$|This study explores how <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> in {{assisted}} living schemes for older persons {{are used by}} the residents. Observation studies, group interviews with staff and individual interviews with residents, relatives, architects and key stakeholders {{in the context of}} Swedish elder-care were conducted. <b>Common</b> <b>spaces</b> are the major location for in-house social interaction on the units. The results show a higher presence on the dementia units, compared to the somatic units. No significant correlation was found between the residents’ mobility limitations and their degree of presence in the <b>common</b> <b>spaces.</b> The results also suggest a contradiction between the staff’s intentions to provide a social context and the capabilities of the residents. Although <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> are not used much between meals, the residents stress their importance for social interaction, suggesting that <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> have important qualitative aspects, rather than quantitative. The results also how that few of the residents used the <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> together with their relatives. The increasing use of assistive technology creates a shortage of space, suggesting a conflict between the efforts to create a home-like environment and the use of assistive technology...|$|R

25|$|In the 1980s the {{residential}} {{part of the}} house was modified to accommodate youth with social difficulties that may face social problems for multiple reasons. Since then {{the main part of the}} building has served as a home generally for youth, with the exception for a short lived home for African migrant families. The home opened its doors for the youth in 1981, on the initiative of the founder Adrijan Cachia (OFM). During its mission as a home over 600 youth (between 10 and 13 years) residents have received temporal stay at the villa and admittance was irrelevant to religious belief of the clients. It was administered by two Roman Catholic priests and a number of secular workers. Cachia was the first director of the home and was later succeeded by Father P. Eddie Pace (OFM), and last was Father John Abela. The youth were provided with a bedroom (alone or shared) and access to most of the house as <b>common</b> <b>space.</b> The house provided for the needs of the residents, such as a better alternative in the lack of family environment and a social worker as a social reference support. This aimed to prepare the youth for independent living. More government funds, for works and service, were given in 1994. On 9 January (1998) Giacomo Bini, the Minister General of the OFM, was received by Pace at the building for breakfast.|$|E

500|$|Few {{records of}} the church's history exist, {{possibly}} because no single denomination or organization took ownership. Several Christian denominations held meetings at Old Pine Church, including the Schwarzenau Brethren (or German Baptist Brethren), which began holding services at {{the church in the}} late 19th century. As many of the Mill Creek valley's settlers were of German descent, the Old Pine Church structure may also have been built as a meeting place for Brethren adherents, known as [...] "Dunkers" [...] or [...] "Dunkards". It is believed that Old Pine Church was also used by German Methodists. The Brethren are a Christian denomination of Anabaptist origin that practiced baptism by triune immersion and exercised nonresistance. Triune immersion consists of dipping a new believer into water three times, once for each of the entities of the Holy Trinity. Brethren adherents believed only in the New Testament, and professed no other creeds. The interior of Old Pine Church, which consists of a single <b>common</b> <b>space</b> for all worshippers, also illustrates the building's connection with the Brethren and the denomination's beliefs regarding slavery. According to the minutes from the 1782 meeting of the Brethren in Franklin County, Virginia, [...] "It has been unanimously considered that it cannot be permitted in any way by the church that a member should purchase Negroes or keep them as Slaves." [...] While many residents in Hampshire County prior to the American Civil War were slaveholders, it is thought that Brethren adherents in the county did not own slaves or depend upon slave labor.|$|E

40|$|Relation to the {{complexity}} and usability of <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> in assisted living facilities (ALFs). Background: ALFs for older people in Sweden contain both the residential and workplace perspectives. The <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> retain physical and organizational features {{that are related to}} traditional institutional care environments. The use of <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> in ALFs focuses heavily on communal activities, entailing a complex relation to the concept of home in a social context and of the home as a place. Approach: A mixed QUAL/QUAN approach was applied containing method and data trian-gulation. Participant observations, semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and statistical analyses were used. The project encompasses 14 ALFs in Sweden and includes residents, staff, relatives, planners and architects. Results: When the relative context of the building in use diverges from the normative context of planning and conceptualization, it affects the usability. Residential and workplace per-spectives entail different objectives for use, which also affects the usability. The results also show different objectives for use between dementia and somatic units. Although Swedish regulations include the <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> as part of the housing unit, the different functions are used and perceived differently and to a varying degree. The spaces represent functions with varying proximity to the concept of home; placing the dining rooms closer and the kitchens further away. Higher degree of use on the dementia units places the <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> closer to the concept of home here, compared to the somatic units. Discussion: The normative aspects of architecture represent a fixation in time and space as they are manifested in the design processes and, as a result, in the physical structures. Usability, contrarily, represents relational aspects as it is created in continuous negotiation between the users, residents and staff, and the physical environment; or in the interaction between human and non-human actors. The prerequisites for use are continuously changing in relation to the planning context. <b>Common</b> <b>spaces</b> must be understood from an extended concept of home that takes into consideration the context of the building in use...|$|R

2500|$|Crescent Street, on {{the southeastern}} end of campus, {{is the only}} through street on Trinity's campus. The only other {{exception}} until its recent closure was Vernon Street, {{at the north end}} of the campus. Since the street was transferred to the school from the city, Trinity widened and repaved it, as well as installing light posts about every ten feet and adding granite crosswalks, curbs, benches, and fenceposts. [...] Vernon Street is the location of most of the campus' cultural houses and Greek organizations, as well as Vernon Social Center. [...] There are also various residences on that street, including the President's house, the Dean of Students' house, other faculty housing, and the Smith House for visitors. There was an additional street added in 2013, after Trinity bought out the public housing occupying Crescent Street. The college built townhouses on this street, giving an off-campus feel to an on-campus housing option. The 8 to 9- person suites are offered to upperclass students and come at an additional cost to normal dormitory-style living. In 2016, the college announced another addition to Crescent street.

The goal is to answer the question “What role do circulation and <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> play in {{the success or failure of}} a public housing project?” and to determine the best design practices to give architects a guideline for future designs of public housing. Fifteen housing projects throughout New York City, Great Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands were chosen to represent three housing typologies commonly utilized to design public housing. These typologies include courtyard, tower, and slab types. Each typology is analyzed based on its type and configuration of circulation spaces and the characteristics of <b>common</b> <b>spaces</b> (whether they are indoor, outdoor, and how they relate to circulation spaces). To determine the success or failure of the establishment of community within specific housing projects, testimonials are taken from online sources such as group facebook pages and newspaper articles to gain a better understanding of residents’ opinions of living in specific projects...|$|R
