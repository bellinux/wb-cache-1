40|$|In recent years, {{the pork}} {{industry}} has faced numerous challenges. As consumer resistance to fatter meats has increased, {{the industry has}} had two options, 1) argue against popular opinion that fat consumption posed a health risk or 2) strive to reduce the fatness of their products. Since the first option is highly unlikely, the NPPC and commodity leaders have moved rapidly, decisively, and aggressively to promote and reposition pork as a vital, healthful part of the U. S. diet. Pork consumption from 1965 to 1985 was reasonably stable (1965, 45 lb; 1985, 44. 2 lb). Demand has been stable to declining in recent years. However, Glenn Grimes, University of Missouri economist, says pork consumption increased about 3 % last year, despite higher prices and stiff competition. Certainly, pork producers {{can be proud of}} what has been accomplished, but to be certain that pork remains competitive, progress must be made in reducing fatness of the pork carcass. Additional concerns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> industry are uniformity of <b>the</b> product, <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer,</b> and price competitiveness. New buying systems encourage production of lean, uniform lots of market hogs, often at heavier weights than in previous years. For many producers, this may require a change in breeding and production systems...|$|R
40|$|Clayton M. Christensen first {{coined the}} term “disruptive {{technologies}} ” to describe why great companies fail. In The Innovator’s Dilemma, he argues that well-managed companies fail because the structure, procedures, and strategies that enabled them to become industry leaders are actually counterproductive {{to the development of}} and response to disruptive innovations. These disruptions tend to have several common attributes including improved simplicity, reliability, and <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer.</b> Christensen contends that listening to customer feedback and expert opinions causes companies to focus on sustaining technologies, improvements to existing technologies within the established value proposition. Using the example of Intuit and their Quicken software, Christensen demonstrates that observing how customers use a product rather than customer feedback is a more effective method of developing disruptive innovations. While Christensen’s work focuses on for-profit commercial firms, Montgomery C. Meigs observed a similar methodology in his analysis of subsurface warfare in World War II. In Slide Rules and Submarines Meigs details the scientific efforts in overcoming the threat posed by German U-boats {{during the first half of}} the Second World War. Meigs showed the effectiveness in embedding scientists and engineers forward to observe first-hand, the environment and challenges resulting from this threat. It was these embedded scientists and engineers that designed the modifications to existing technologies and created the innovations that ultimatel...|$|R

40|$|Consumer demand <b>for</b> {{freshness}} and <b>convenience</b> {{food has}} led to the evolution and increased production of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. Moreover this may represent a way to increase the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and therefore a benefit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> crops sector economy. Since <b>the</b> increase in <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> has a detrimental effect on product quality, attention must be focused on extending shelf life while maintaining quality. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is a packaging technology which by making qualitative or quantitative changes to the atmosphere composition around the product, can improve product preservation. However, MAP must be carefully designed, as a poorly designed system may be ineffective or even shorten product shelf life. Thus, while in the past a trial and error approach to package food was predominant, nowadays the need has emerged for an engineering approach to properly design a package to improve product shelf life. Therefore, to ensure an appropriate gas composition during the product’s shelf life, a model should take into account all the variables that play a critical role, such as product respiration and its mass; packaging material and its geometry; and environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity and gas composition. In this chapter a procedure to design a package for fresh-cut produce is described. An engineering approach is used to develop a mathematical model with the experimental data obtained for product respiration and package permeability and solve the mass balance equations using computer software. A case study on fresh-cut apples is reported in order to validate the model...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{transitions}} {{have been}} taking place continuously since the Industrial Revolution. These transitions primarily involve national energy mixes. In general, countries keep moving up the energy ladder, meaning that they integrate larger and larger proportions of specialized fuels into their energy mixes for dedicated types of energy demand (heat, cooling, electricity, mobility). These fuels often emit less carbon per unit of energy consumed and, due to technological developments, create more economic efficiency and <b>convenience</b> <b>for</b> <b>consumers.</b> <b>The</b> availability of domestic sources {{plays an important role}} in the composition of a national energy mix, and the ability to transport and trade energy is crucial in matching demand and supply. This report shows some of the history of how the nature of these transitions has changed over time. The emphasis on transitions lays out a different way of thinking about the approaches to the phenomenon known as the ‘carbon bubble’ or the potential of future stranded assets and value loss in the fossil energy industries as a result of climate change policies. A core message is that the role of coal without CCS, as the largest source of future CO 2 emissions, would need to be addressed first. Such a policy focus would allow space for fuels with a higher energy output per unit of carbon emission to stay in <b>the</b> mix <b>for</b> a longer period of time [...] ...|$|R
