5|$|Haynes asked Fitch {{to observe}} the ailerons through the {{passenger}} cabin windows to see if <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> were having any effect. Fitch reported back that the ailerons were not moving at all. Nonetheless, the crew continued to manipulate their control columns {{for the remainder of}} the flight, hoping for at least some effect. Haynes then asked Fitch to take over control of the throttles so that Haynes could concentrate on his control column. With one throttle in each hand, Fitch was able to mitigate the phugoid cycle and make rough steering adjustments.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} control near and above the speed of sound, it is often necessary to use either power operated all-flying tailplanes (stabilators), or delta wings fitted with power operated elevons.

40|$|Various {{examples}} of systems and methods are provided for Lyapunov control for uncertain systems. In one example, a system includes a process plant and a robust Lyapunov controller configured to <b>control</b> an <b>input</b> {{of the process}} plant. The robust Lyapunov controller includes an inner closed loop Lyapunov controller and an outer closed loop error stabilizer. In another example, a method includes monitoring a system output of a process plant; generating an estimated system <b>control</b> <b>input</b> based upon a defined output reference; generating a system <b>control</b> <b>input</b> using the estimated system <b>control</b> <b>input</b> and a compensation term; and adjusting the process plant based upon the system <b>control</b> <b>input</b> to force the system output to track the defined output reference. An inner closed loop Lyapunov controller can generate the estimated system <b>control</b> <b>input</b> and an outer closed loop error stabilizer can generate the system <b>control</b> <b>input...</b>|$|R

When the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> is active, the output value is the input value, and the buffer is not different from the single input digital buffer.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the data}} input is nothing and the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> is open, the output value will be [...] "Z", which means no current and high impedance. Both {{the data and}} the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> are inactive; the buffer shuts down.|$|R
25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require light <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher air density and lack of a power assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. <b>Control</b> <b>inputs</b> must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E
25|$|The Kalman filter uses a system's {{dynamics}} model (e.g., physical laws of motion), known <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> to that system, {{and multiple}} sequential measurements (such as from sensors) {{to form an}} estimate of the system's varying quantities (its state) that is better than the estimate obtained by using only one measurement alone. As such, it is a common sensor fusion and data fusion algorithm.|$|E
25|$|The {{final report}} {{stated that the}} {{accident}} resulted from the pilots’ lack of a common action plan during the approach, the final approach being continued below the Minimum Decision Altitude without ground visual reference being acquired, the inappropriate application of flight <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> during the go-around and after the activation of the Terrain Awareness and Warning System, and the flight crew’s lack of monitoring and controlling of the flight path.|$|E
40|$|Amethod for {{generating}} a near-minimum-time <b>control</b> <b>input</b> for exible structures is presentedwith {{the objective of}} minimizing the maneuver time and the residual energy of the exible modes. The method is based on smoothing the bang–bang, time-optimal <b>control</b> <b>input</b> designed for the rigid-body mode. Smoothing is accomplished through the addition, to the basic time-optimal control problem for the rigid-body mode, of a constraint that limits the rst time derivative for the resulting <b>control</b> <b>input.</b> If the rst time-derivative constraint is replaced with the second time-derivative constraint, then smoother <b>control</b> <b>input</b> is generated. The necessary conditions of optimality for the resulting time-optimal control problem, with control and state constraints, are derived, which leads to forming a boundary-value problem. The resulting boundary-value problem is solved using the shooting method.

25|$|The K-MAX {{relies on}} two primary {{advantages}} of synchropters over conventional helicopters: The increased efficiency compared to conventional rotor-lift technology; and the synchropter's natural tendency to hover. This increases stability, especially for precision work in placing suspended loads. At the same time, the synchropter is {{more responsive to}} pilot <b>control</b> <b>inputs,</b> {{making it possible to}} easily swing a load, or to scatter seed, chemicals, or water over a larger area.|$|E

The flashlight beam, moving across the hangar door {{in response to his}} <b>control</b> <b>inputs,</b> easily revealed a lag problem, which could soon be corrected.|$|E
25|$|The step {{response}} {{of a system}} in a given initial state consists of the time evolution of its outputs when its <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> are Heaviside step functions. In electronic engineering and control theory, {{step response}} is the time behaviour of the outputs of a general system when its inputs change from zero to one {{in a very short}} time. The concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a dynamical system using an evolution parameter.|$|E

25|$|On September 6, 1985, Midwest Express Flight 105, Midwest's {{first and}} only fatal accident, crashed upon takeoff from Milwaukee. One of the airline's Douglas DC-9s crashed while taking off, bound for Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport. According to NTSB reports, the crash was caused by {{improper}} pilot reaction when the plane's right engine failed due to stress corrosion cracking. The improper flight <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> caused an uncommanded roll and accelerated stall. The 31 people on board died.|$|E
25|$|Due to a fan {{designed}} to smooth airflow before {{it enters the}} compressor, the F404 has high resistance to compressor stalls, even at high angles of attack. It requires less than two shop visits per 1,000 flight hours and averages 6,500 hours between in-flight events. It also demonstrates high responsiveness to <b>control</b> <b>inputs,</b> spooling from idle to full afterburner in 4 seconds. The engine contains an in-flight engine condition monitoring system (IECMS) that monitors for critical malfunctions and keeps track of parts lifetimes.|$|E
25|$|In some applications, it {{is useful}} to compute the {{probability}} that a Kalman filter with a given set of parameters (prior distribution, transition and observation models, and <b>control</b> <b>inputs)</b> would generate a particular observed signal. This probability is known as the marginal likelihood because it integrates over ("marginalizes out") the values of the hidden state variables, so it can be computed using only the observed signal. The marginal likelihood can be useful to evaluate different parameter choices, or to compare the Kalman filter against other models using Bayesian model comparison.|$|E

Rather than the usual arrangement where a <b>control</b> <b>input</b> from the driver's lever sets an engine speed that is maintained by a governor, in the Hi-Dyne engine the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> selected an output power level, which was maintained by the governor.|$|R
25|$|A basic {{means of}} {{controlling}} an aircraft with disabled flight controls, discovered through crew experience, is by {{making use of}} the position of the engines. If the engines are mounted under the centre of gravity, {{as is the case in}} most passenger jets, then increasing the thrust will raise the nose, while decreasing the thrust will lower it. This control method may call for <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> that go against the pilot's instinct: when the aircraft is in a dive, adding thrust will raise the nose and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|According to Mason, the {{controls}} of the Vampire {{were considered to be}} relatively light and sensitive, employing an effective elevator arrangement that enabled generous acceleration from relatively little <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> along with highly balanced ailerons that could achieve high rates of roll. In comparison to the elevator and ailerons, the rudder required more vigorous actuation in order to achieve meaningful effect. Pilots converting from piston-engined types would find themselves having to adapt to the slower acceleration of turbojet engines and the corresponding need to moderate rapid throttle movements to avoid instigating a compressor stall.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} {{of all of}} the factual evidence is consistent with the conclusions that: 1) no airplane-related mechanical malfunctions or failures caused or contributed to the accident, and 2) the accident can be explained by intentional pilot action. Specifically, a) the accident airplane’s flight profile is consistent with sustained manual nose-down flight control inputs; b) the evidence suggests that the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was intentionally disconnected; c) recovery of the airplane was possible but not attempted; and d) {{it is more likely that}} the nose-down flight <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> were made by the captain than by the first officer.|$|E
40|$|Event-triggered and self-triggered control {{methods are}} an {{important}} control strategy in networked control systems. Event-triggered control is a method that the measured signal {{is sent to the}} controller (i. e., the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> is recomputed) only when a certain condition is satisfied. Self-triggered control is a method that the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> and the (non-uniform) sampling interval are computed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose new methods of event-triggered control and self-triggered control from the viewpoint of online optimization (i. e., model predictive control). In self-triggered <b>control,</b> the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> and the sampling interval are obtained by solving a pair of a quadratic programming (QP) problem and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. In event-triggered control, whether the <b>control</b> <b>input</b> is updated or not is determined by solving two QP problems.

25|$|A latch or a {{flip-flop}} is {{a circuit}} that has two stable states {{and can be}} used to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.|$|E
25|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} (or slash and burn) is {{a system}} in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years. Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and some manual pest control. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity {{in which there is no}} fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest <b>control</b> <b>inputs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Author {{and pilot}} William Langewiesche {{asserted}} that insufficient credit {{was given to}} the A320's fly-by-wire design, by which the pilot uses a side-stick to make <b>control</b> <b>inputs</b> to the flight control computers. The computers then impose adjustments and limits of their own to keep the plane stable, which the pilot cannot override even in an emergency. This design allowed the pilots of Flight 1549 to concentrate on engine restart and deciding the course, without the burden of manually adjusting the glidepath to reduce the plane's rate of descent. Sullenberger said that these computer-imposed limits also prevented him from achieving the optimum landing flare for the ditching, which would have softened the impact.|$|E
