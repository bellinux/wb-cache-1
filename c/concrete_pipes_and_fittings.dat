40|$|One of the {{companies}} undergoing this trouble is PT Langgeng Makmur Industri, Tbk. The problem is the decrease in PVC <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> product sale. From this final project analysis a solution to prevent the company from continuous losses shall be found. After the analysis is made, the most probable cause of the decrease beside the macro economic crisis happening in Indonesia is the wrong strategy stated by the company. Therefore a plan must be made for a strategy in marketing mix for the company. Marketing mix strategy is obtained by processing sales data, customer survey, marketing area, competitive advantage company, industrial analysis for PVC <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting,</b> <b>and</b> the present condition of the market.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the possibility to}} use a neuro-fuzzy type mathematical model, with the final goal of establishing the welding parameters for new types <b>and</b> dimensions of <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b> Anticipating the developing dynamic of polyethylene-made elements, especially <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings,</b> starting from the current situation when already {{a wide range of}} <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> with different wall thicknesses and nominal working pressures is produced and commercialized, and taking into account also new development, it was considered necessary to find out the welding parameters for any new <b>pipe</b> type <b>and</b> dimension. The usage of existing welding equipment for new pipe dimensions is impossible without a preliminary set of welding parameters: pressure, temperature, time. Based on experimentally validated data for discreet values of the characteristic welding parameters, there was generated, using mathematical laws and functions, a new model that can estimate the necessary values of the welding parameters for any value within their variation range. As a result, the mathematical model created using neuro-fuzzy techniques allows the obtaining of the correct value for certain parameters (e. g. required welding pressure) for any values of the input variables <b>pipe</b> diameter <b>and</b> <b>pipe</b> thickness...|$|R
