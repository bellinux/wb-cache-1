50|$|With {{implicit}} certificates {{there is}} no explicit validation of the <b>certificate</b> <b>authority's</b> (<b>CA’s)</b> signature on a certificate. Instead, a user computes a public key from the implicit certificate and simply uses it in the intended ECC operation, e.g. key agreement protocols such as ECDH and ECMQV, or signing such as ECDSA. The operation will fail if the certificate is invalid. Thus ECQV is regarded as an implicit validation scheme. Computing the public key is very fast, much faster than a public key operation.|$|R

Multiple instances of EJBCA are run simultaneously, sharing a database containing the current <b>certificate</b> <b>authorities</b> (<b>CAs).</b> This permits each instance of the software to access any CA. The software also supports the use of a Hardware Security Module (HSM), which provides additional security. Larger-scale installations would use multiple instances of EJBCA running on a cluster, a fully distributed database on a separate cluster and a third cluster with HSMs keeping the different CA keys.|$|R
50|$|TLS/SSL {{encryption}} {{is currently}} based on certificates issued by <b>certificate</b> <b>authorities</b> (<b>CAs).</b> Within {{the last few}} years, a number of CA providers suffered serious security breaches, allowing the issuance of certificates for well-known domains to those who don't own those domains. Trusting {{a large number of}} CAs might be a problem because any breached CA could issue a certificate for any domain name. DANE enables the administrator of a domain name to certify the keys used in that domain's TLS clients or servers by storing them in the Domain Name System (DNS). DANE needs the DNS records to be signed with DNSSEC for its security model to work.|$|R

AKI integrates an architecture for key revocation of all entities (e. g., CAs, domains) with an architecture for accountability of all infrastructure parties through checks-and-balances. AKI efficiently handles common certification operations, and gracefully handles catastrophic events such as domain key loss or compromise. We propose AKI to make progress towards a public-key validation infrastructure with key revocation that reduces trust in any single entity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The recent {{adoption}} in Italy of a legislation stating the full equivalence of digital and handwritten signatures gives any institution {{with the appropriate}} requirements the opportunity to act as <b>Certificate</b> <b>Authorities</b> (<b>CA)</b> for digital signatures. This rises the question whether the CA role could be of potential interest for the Italian banks. The present analysis {{is focused on the}} Italian banking sector; however, some aspects taken into consideration here may be in common with other countries. Porter’s five forces model is used to show how the Italian banks could leverage the advantageous cost asymmetries given by their existing distribution channels to pursue simultaneously cost leadership and differentiation, acting as <b>Certificate</b> <b>Authorities.</b> Furthermore, they could build up new complementary services and value for the customers around this role. The lack of specific competences and assets together with a number of tactical and strategical drivers suggests that these new services could be object of outsourcing. I...|$|R

It contains minor revisions to reflect updated TeraGrid management structure. Revisions in this document (February 7, 2006) include format changes, new subsections (status, abstract, security considerations, acknowledgements), and modification of references to “TeraGrid Executive Committee ” to reflect the current management structure. Specifically, references to the “TeraGrid Executive Committee ” were changed to “TeraGrid Security Officer ” in all cases but one (§ 5), where the reference was changed to “TeraGrid Director. ” Revisons made (March 1, 2006) include a URL to the current repository for TeraGrid CAs.
