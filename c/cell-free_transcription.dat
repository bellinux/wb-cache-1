50|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that TFIIH is a rate-limiting factor for HIV transcription in unactivated T-cells by {{using a combination of}} in vivo ChIP experiments and <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> studies. The ability of NF-κB to rapidly recruit TFIIH during HIV activation in T-cells is an unexpected discovery; however, there are several precedents in the literature of cellular genes that are activated through the recruitment of TFIIH. In an early and influential paper, demonstrated that type I activators such as Sp1 and CTF, which were able to support initiation but were unable to support efficient elongation, were also unable to bind TFIIH. By contrast, type II activators such as VP16, p53 and E2F1, which supported both initiation and elongation, were able to bind to TFIIH. In one of the most thoroughly characterized transcription systems, have studied the temporal order of recruitment of transcription factors during the activation of the major histocompatibility class II (MHC II) DRA gene by IFN-gamma. Following induction of the CIITA transcription factor by IFN-gamma, there was recruitment of both CDK7 and CDK9 causing RNAP CTD phosphorylation and elongation. Finally, Nissen and Yamamoto (2000) in their studies of the activation of the IL-8 and ICAM-1 promoters observed enhanced CDK7 recruitment and RNAP II CTD phosphorylation in response to NF-κB activation by TNF.|$|E

Analogous to the procaryotic RNA polymerase, the eucaryotic enzyme terminated just beyond the guanine-plus-cytosine-rich region of dyad symmetry in the terminator sequence. These {{results suggest that the}} eucaryotic RNA polymerase II may respond to transcription termination sequences similar to those used by the procaryotic enzyme. However, similar templates containing lambda tint or lambda tR 1 terminators did not elicit pausing or termination, suggesting that other features, such as sequence specificity, may also be involved...|$|R

Exposure of vaccinia virus to an increasing dose of irradiation resulted in differential reduction in the syntheses of virus-specified polypeptides in the coupled system, with sensitivity being proportional {{to the size of the}} gene pro duct.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the role of {{phosphorylation}} of the human oestrogen receptor (hOR; otherwise known as hER) at serine- 167, which has been identified previously as the major oestrogen-induced phosphorylation site. We have tested transactivation by the hOR in yeast and <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> assays, and shown that mutation of serine- 167 results in a 70 % decrease in hOR-dependent transcription. Furthermore we explored the functional significance of phosphorylation at this site by hormone binding and DNA binding. DNA binding affinity was 10 -fold lower when serine- 167 was changed to alanine in the hOR. <b>Cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> experiments showed that casein kinase II is the enzyme responsible for oestradiol-dependent phosphorylation of the hOR at serine- 167. This suggests that a conformational change of the hOR must occur upon hormone binding that exposes serine- 167 to casein kinase II, resulting in transactivation of oestrogen-responsive genes...|$|E
40|$|The yeast {{auxiliary}} {{transcription factor}} GAL 11, {{a candidate for}} the coactivator, was partially purified from yeast cells, and its function was characterized in a <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> system. The partially purified GAL 11 protein stimulated basal transcription from the CYC 1 core promoter by a factor of 4 - 5 at the step of preinitiation complex formation. GAL 11 protein also enhanced transcription activated by general regulatory factor 1, GAL 4 -AH, or GAL 4 -VP 16 to the same extent as the basal transcription. Therefore, the apparent potentiation of the activators by GAL 11 was attributable to the stimulation of basal transcription. The wild-type GAL 11 protein (but not a mutant-type protein) produced in bacteria stimulated transcription as effectively as GAL 11 from yeast. These results suggest that GAL 11 functions as a positive cofactor of basal and activator-induced transcription in a <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> system...|$|E

Deletion of the region (- 71 to - 83) containing the GTCAAA direct repeat resulted in a marked decrease of specific transcription of the ovalbumin gene; transcription could be competed with DNA fragments containing this sequence. Furthermore, DNase I footprinting identified a protein-binding site including this direct repeat with crude extracts {{and one of the}} partially purified protein fractions required for transcription.

40|$|The {{coat protein}} (CP) of {{bacteriophage}} f 1 is integrated into an Escherichia coli plasma membrane fraction consisting of inverted vesicles {{when it is}} synthesized in a <b>cell-free,</b> coupled <b>transcription</b> [...] translation system supplemented with the inverted vesicles. By using proteolytic enzymes as probes, we found by subsequent peptide mapping and determination of the sequence of the proteolytic products that CP was inserted into the inverted vesicles in an orientation indistinguishable from that in inverted vesicles prepared from infected E. coli: only a COOH-terminal portion of approximately 10 residues was accessible to proteolysis, whereas the remainder of CP (CP') was entirely protected. Protection of CP' was dependent on {{the integrity of the}} vesicle membrane, because it was abolished when proteolysis was done in the presence of nonionic detergents. Insertion was observed when the inverted vesicles were present during translation in the cell-free system, not when they were added after translation. Thus, the asymmetric insertion of this type of integral membrane protein is strictly coupled to translation. These findings are discussed with respect to prokaryotic membrane biogenesis and are related to bacteriophage f 1 assembly and infection...|$|R
40|$|Retroviral reverse {{transcription}} starts near the 5 * end of unspliced viral RNA at a sequence called the primer binding site (PBS), where the tRNA primer anneals to the RNA template for initiation of DNA synthesis. We {{have investigated the}} roles of NCp 7 in annealing of primer tRNA 3 Lys to the PBS and in reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, using a <b>cell-free</b> reverse <b>transcription</b> reaction mixture consisting of various 5 * viral RNA templates, natural primer tRNA 3 Lys or synthetic primer, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) nu-cleocapsid protein (NCp 7), and HIV- 1 RT. In the presence of tRNA 3 Lys, NCp 7 was found to stimulate synthesis of minus-strand strong-stop DNA [(2) ssDNA], consistent with previous reports. However, specific DNA synthesis was observed only at a NCp 7 /RNA ratio similar to that predicted {{to be present in}} virions. Moreover, at these concentrations, NCp 7 inhibited the synthesis of nonspecific reverse-transcribed DNA products, which are initiated because of self-priming by RNA templates. In contrast to results obtained with tRNA 3 Lys as primer, NCp 7 inhibited the synthesis of (2) ssDNA products primed by an 18 -nucleotide (nt) ribonucleotide (rPR) ...|$|R

40|$|Transcription of {{the human}} growth hormone (hGH) gene depends on cis-acting {{elements}} contained within 300 base pairs of its 5 '-flanking sequence. An earlier in vitro study of the transcriptional activity of this 5 '-flanking region suggested that transcription can start upstream from position + 1. We have investigated this phenomenon by <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> and transient transfection of chimeric constructs in cultured pituitary cells and in HeLa cells and by analysis of RNA from human pituitary glands and HeLa cells. Transcription initiation sites were identified at positions - 54 and - 197 by <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> assays and by RNAse mapping of human pituitary RNA. In transfection assays, the hGH gene 5 '-flanking sequence upstream from position - 197 displayed transcriptional activity, which critically depended on the upstream stimulatory factor-binding site located between positions - 253 and - 266. Transcripts initiated upstream from position + 1 were detected in human pituitary RNA by polymerase chain reaction amplification and Northern blotting. These transcripts were longer than the mRNA encoding hGH. They might control initiation at position + 1 or code for a novel peptide...|$|E
40|$|Employing a <b>cell-free</b> {{chromatin}} <b>transcription</b> {{system that}} recapitulates progesterone receptor (PR) -mediated transcription in vivo, we have investigated further the coactivator functions of steroid receptor coactivator- 1 (SRC- 1) {{in terms of}} its functional domains as well as cooperation with other coactivators in PR transactivation. By analyzing wild-type and mutant SRC- 1 with liganded PR in the chromatin transcription system in vitro, the basic helix–loop–helix/Per-Arnt-Sim domain, the p 300 -binding domain, and the carboxyl-terminal region (containing the PR-binding site) of SRC- 1 were shown to be important for PR transactivation. Although in context of a synthetic promoter its histone acetyltransferase activity was nonessential for PR-mediated transcription, SRC- 1 was observed to act synergistically with p 300 to enhance PR transactivation from chromatin. Moreover, SRC- 1 and p 300 were found to function cooperatively to increase the efficiency of productive transcription initiation and reinitiation. Further analysis of synergism between SRC- 1 and p 300 revealed an obligatory “sequential” recruitment of SRC- 1 and p 300 to liganded PR. Efficient recruitment of p 300 required the presence of SRC- 1. In addition, functional analysis of SRC- 2 and SRC- 3 coactivators indicated that the SRC family modulated PR transactivation from chromatin by a similar mechanism...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{class of}} vaccinia virus genes, called intermediate, is {{expressed}} immediately post-replication and {{prior to the}} onset of late gene transcription. Intermediate transcription is dependent on trans-acting factors which are present in an active state in virus-infected cells prior to the onset of DNA replication. Plasmid-borne intermediate genes transfected into vaccinia-virus infected cells are expressed prior to DNA replication, whereas the copies within the viral genome are repressed. DNA replication is essential for activation of viral intermediate transcription and de novo protein synthesis is not required post-replication. In contrast, activation of late transcription depends on DNA replication and continued de novo protein synthesis. Therefore, a subset of intermediate proteins {{is likely to be}} trans-activators of late gene <b>transcription.</b> <b>Cell-free</b> extracts differentially transcribe early, intermediate and late genes in a way similar to the temporal expression observed in vivo.

40|$|TFIID is a multiprotein complex {{comprised}} of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) {{and an array}} of TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs). Whereas TBP is sufficient for basal transcription in conjunction with other general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, TAFIIs are additionally required for activator-dependent transcription in mammalian <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> systems. However, recent in vivo studies carried out in yeast suggest that TAFIIs are not globally required for activator function. The discrepancy between in vivo yeast studies and in vitro mammalian cell-free systems remains to be resolved. In this study, we describe a mammalian <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> system reconstituted with only recombinant proteins and epitope-tagged multiprotein complexes. Transcriptional activation can be recapitulated in this highly purified in vitro transcription system in the absence of TAFIIs. This TBP-mediated activation is not induced by human mediator, another transcriptional coactivator complex potentially implicated in activator response. In contrast, general transcription factors TFIIH and TFIIA {{play a significant role in}} TBP-mediated activation, which can be detected in vitro with Gal 4 fusion proteins containing various transcriptional activation domains. Our data, therefore, suggest that TFIIH and TFIIA can mediate activator function in the absence of TAFIIs...|$|E
40|$|The {{characterization}} of atypical mutations in loci associated with diseases {{is a powerful}} tool to discover novel regulatory elements. We previously identified a dinucleotide deletion in the human ankyrin- 1 gene (ANK- 1) promoter that underlies ankyrin-deficient hereditary spherocytosis. The presence of the deletion {{was associated with a}} decrease in promoter function both in vitro and in vivo establishing it as a causative hereditary spherocytosis mutation. The dinucleotide deletion is located in the 5 ′ untranslated region of the ANK- 1 gene and disrupts the binding of TATA binding protein and TFIID, components of the preinitiation complex. We hypothesized that the nucleotides surrounding the mutation define an uncharacterized regulatory sequence. To test this hypothesis, we generated a library of more than 16, 000 ANK- 1 promoters with degenerate sequence around the mutation and cloned the functional promoter sequences after <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription.</b> We identified the wild type and three additional sequences, from which we derived a consensus. The sequences were shown to be functional in <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription,</b> transient-transfection, and transgenic mouse assays.

The role of these factors in B-cell differentiation and stage-specific expression of these genes is, however, not fully understood. We have used a model of human lymphoid neoplasia to address this question. Different fragments of unrearranged human variable region of immunoglobulin kappa gene (V kappa) were used for <b>cell-free</b> in vitro <b>transcription</b> and DNA mobility shift assays. Previously described enhancement of in vitro transcription that was only seen with nuclear extracts derived from B-cell neoplasms corresponding to the late stages of B-cell differentiation was shown to be dependent on the actions of these factor(s) on the DNA region within the V kappa gene promoter. This region is located within the 920 bp fragment located 210 bp upstream from the coding region and this fragment represents a possible novel DNA region, which plays a role in the stage- and tissue-specific expression of immunoglobulin genes...|$|R
40|$|Plasmid-encoded {{fusidic acid}} {{resistance}} in Escherichia coli is mediated {{by a common}} variant of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 28), an enzyme which is an effector of chloramphenicol resistance. Resistance to chloramphenicol {{is a consequence of}} acetylation of the antibiotic catalysed by the enzyme and the failure of the 3 -acetoxy product to bind to bacterial ribosomes. <b>Cell-free</b> coupled <b>transcription</b> and translation studies are in agreement with genetic studies which indicated that the entire structural gene for the type I chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is necessary for the fusidic acid resistance phenotype. The mechanism of resistance does nor involve covalent modification of the antibiotic. The other naturally-occurring enterobacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase variants (types II and III) do not cause fusidic acid resistance. Steady-state kinetic studies with the type I enzyme have shown that the binding of fusidic acid is competitive with respect to chloramphenicol. The inhibition of in vitro polypeptide chain elongation which is observed in the presence of fusidic acid is relieved by addition of purified chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and equilibrium dialysis experiments with tritiated fusidate have defined the stoichiometry and apparent affinity of fusidate for the type I enzyme. Further binding studies with fusidate analogues, including bile salts, have shown some of the structural constraints on the steroidal skeleton of the ligand which are necessary for binding to the enzyme. Determinations of antibiotic resistance levels and estimates of intracellular chloramphenicol acetyltransferase concentrations support the data from in vitro experiments to give a coherent mechanism for fusidic acid resistance based on reversible binding of the antibiotic to the enzyme...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe M 184 V {{mutation}} in HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) {{is associated with}} high-level resistance against the nucleoside inhibitor lamivudine as well as diminished viral replication capacity. We have previously demonstrated that HIV variants containing the M 184 V mutation were relatively unable to successfully undergo compensatory mutagenesis following deletion of an A-rich loop located upstream of the primer binding site (PBS). To understand the mechanisms involved, we synthesized viral RNA templates containing different compensatory mutations that were emergent during the long-term culture of the A-rich loop-deleted viruses. These templates were then used in <b>cell-free</b> reverse <b>transcription</b> initiation assays and in tRNA primer placement assays performed with either recombinant wild-type RT or recombinant RT containing the M 184 V substitution. The {{results showed that the}} RNA template that contained the A-rich loop deletion was impaired in ability to initiate reverse transcription and that the presence of the M 184 V substitution in RT amplified this effect. Clearance from pausing at position + 3 during synthesis of viral DNA was identified as a sensitive step in this reaction that could not be efficiently bypassed with the M 184 V mutant enzyme. Increased efficiency of initiation was seen with the deleted RNA templates that also contained mutations identified in the revertant viruses, provided that these mutations facilitated formation of a competent binary tRNA/RNA complex. These findings provide biochemical evidence that initiation of tRNALys 3 -primed DNA synthesis is an important rate-limiting step in reverse transcription that correlates with viral replication fitness...|$|R

For human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), RT and IN physically interact and certain mutations and deletions of IN result in viruses defective in early steps of reverse transcription. However, the mechanism by which IN affects reverse transcription is not understood. We used a <b>cell-free</b> reverse <b>transcription</b> assay with different primers and compositions of deoxynucleoside triphosphates to differentially monitor the effect of IN on the initiation and elongation modes of reverse transcription. During the initiation mode, addition of IN stimulated RT-catalyzed reverse transcription by fourfold. The stimulation was specific to IN and could not be detected when the full-length IN was replaced with truncated IN derivatives. The IN-stimulated initiation was also restricted to the template-primer complex formed using tRNA 3 Lys or short RNA oligonucleotides as the primer and not those formed using DNA oligonucleotides as the primer. Addition of IN also produced a threefold stimulation during the elongation mode, which was not primer dependent. The stimulation of both initiation and elongation by IN was retained in the presence of an RT trap. Furthermore, IN had no effect on steps at or before template-primer annealing, including packaging of viral genomic RNA and tRNA 3 Lys. Taken together, our results showed that IN acts at early steps of reverse transcription by increasing the processivity of RT and suppressing the formation of the pause products...|$|R

Receptor-mediated transactivation {{appears to be}} potentiated in response to ligand {{by a number of}} coactivators that may provide key interactions with components of the transcription preinitiation complex and/or alter chromatin structure. Here, we use the vitamin D 3 receptor ligand-binding domain (VDR LBD) as an affinity matrix to identify components of a transcriptionally active nuclear extract that interact with VDR in response to ligand. We describe the purification of a complex of at least 10 VDR interacting proteins (DRIPs) ranging from 65 to 250 kD that associate with the receptor in a strictly 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -dependent manner. These proteins also appear to interact with other, but not all, nuclear receptors, such as the thyroid hormone receptor. The DRIPs are distinct from known nuclear receptor coactivators, although like these coactivators, their interaction also requires the AF- 2 transactivation motif of VDR. In addition, the DRIP complex contains histone acetyltransferase activity, indicating that at least {{one or more of the}} DRIPs may function at the level of nucleosomal modification. However, we show that the DRIPs selectively enhance the transcriptional activity of VDR on a naked DNA template utilizing a <b>cell-free,</b> ligand-dependent <b>transcription</b> assay. Moreover, this activity can be specifically depleted from the extract by liganded, but not unliganded, VDR-LBD. Overexpression of DRIP 100 in vivo resulted in a strong squelching of VDR transactivation, suggesting the sequestration of other limiting factors, including components of the DRIP complex.

40|$|Human {{adenovirus}} E 1 A proteins can repress {{the expression}} of several viral and cellular genes. By using a <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> system, we demonstrated that the gene product of the E 1 A 12 S mRNA, the 243 -residue protein E 1 A 243 R, inhibits basal transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) long terminal repeat (LTR). The HIV- 1 transactivator protein Tat greatly stimulates transcription from the viral promoter in vitro. However, E 1 A 243 R can repress Tat-activated transcription in vitro. Strong repression of both basal and Tat-activated transcriptions requires only E 1 A N-terminal amino acid residues 1 to 80. Deletion analysis showed that E 1 A N-terminal amino acids 4 to 25 are essential for repression, whereas amino acid residues 30 to 49 and 70 to 80 are dispensable. Transcriptional repression by E 1 A in the <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> system is promoter specific, since under identical conditions, transcription of the adenovirus major late promoter and the Rous sarcoma virus LTR promoter was unaffected. The repression of transcription by small E 1 A peptides in vitro provides an assay for investigation of molecular mechanisms governing E 1 A-mediated repression of both basal and Tat-activated transcriptions of the HIV- 1 LTR promoter. The adenovirus (Ad) E 1 A gene encodes two major proteins; one is 243 residues long (E 1 A 243 R), {{and the other is}} 289 residues long (E 1 A 289 R). These proteins exert pleiotropic ef...|$|E

The receptors for 9 -cis retinoic acid and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3], RXR and VDR, respectively, as members of this superfamily, form a heterodimeric complex and bind cooperatively to vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs) to activate or repress the transcription of a multitude of genes which regulate a variety of physiological functions. To directly investigate RXR- and VDR-mediated transactivation, we developed a <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> system for 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 signaling by utilizing crude nuclear extracts and a G-free cassette-based assay. Transcriptional enhancement in vitro was dependent on purified, exogenous RXR and VDR and was responsive to physiological concentrations of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. We found that RXR and VDR transactivated selectively from VDRE-linked templates exclusively as a heterodimeric complex, since neither receptor alone enhanced transcription in vitro. By the addition of low concentrations of the anionic detergent Sarkosyl to limit <b>cell-free</b> <b>transcription</b> to a single round {{and the use of}} agarose gel mobility shift experiments to assay factor complex assembly, we observed that 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 enhanced RXR:VDR-mediated stabilization or assembly of preinitiation complexes to effect transcriptional enhancement from VDRE-linked promoter-containing DNA...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 Tat {{has been proposed}} {{to play a role}} in the regulation of reverse transcription. We previously demonstrated that wild-type Tat can augment viral infectivity by suppressing the reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction at late stages of the viral life cycle in order to prevent the premature synthesis of potentially deleterious viral DNA products. Here we have performed a detailed analysis of the <b>cell-free</b> reverse <b>transcription</b> reaction to elucidate the mechanism(s) whereby Tat can affect this process. Our results show that Tat can suppress nonspecific DNA elongation while moderately affecting the specific initiation stage of reverse transcription. In addition, Tat has an RNA-annealing activity and can promote the placement of tRNA onto viral RNA. This points to a functional homology between Tat and the viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein that is known to be directly involved in this process. Experiments using a series of mutant Tat proteins revealed that the cysteine-rich and core domains of Tat are responsible for suppression of DNA elongation, while each of the cysteine-rich, core, and basic domains, as well as a glutamine-rich region in the C-terminal domain, are important for the placement of tRNA onto the viral RNA genome. These results suggest that Tat can play at least two different roles in the RT reaction, i. e., suppression of DNA polymerization and placement of tRNA onto viral RNA. We believe that the first of these activities of Tat may contribute to the overall efficiency of reverse transcription of the viral genome during a new round of infection as well as to enhanced production of infectious viral particles. We hypothesize that the second activity, illustrating functional homology between Tat and NC, suggests a potential role for NC in the displacement of Tat during viral maturation...|$|R
40|$|The archaeal {{transcriptional}} initiation machinery {{closely resembles}} core {{elements of the}} eukaryal polymerase II system. However, apart from the established basal archaeal transcription system, {{little is known about}} the modulation of gene expression in archaea. At present, no obvious eukaryal-like transcriptional regulators have been identified in archaea. Instead, we have previously isolated an archaeal gene, the Pyrococcus furiosus lrpA, that potentially encodes a bacterial-like transcriptional regulator. In the present study, we have for the first time addressed the actual involvement of an archaeal Lrp homologue in transcription modulation. For that purpose, we have produced LrpA in Escherichia coli. In a <b>cell-free</b> P. furiosus <b>transcription</b> system we used wild-type and mutated lrpA promoter fragments to demonstrate that the purified LrpA negatively regulates its own transcription. In addition, gel retardation analyses revealed a single protein-DNA complex, in which LrpA appeared to be present in (at least) a tetrameric conformation. The location of the LrpA binding site was further identified by DNaseI and hydroxyl radical footprinting, indicating that LrpA binds to a 46 -base pair sequence that overlaps the transcriptional start site of its own promoter. The molecular basis of the transcription inhibition by LrpA is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} a <b>cell-free</b> {{polymerase}} I <b>transcription</b> system derived from HeLa cells to study the regulation of human rRNA synthesis. Analysis of deletion mutants spanning the start site of transcription at nucleotide + 1 indicates that the control region affecting initiation of human rRNA synthesis is contained within sequences from nucleotides - 158 to + 18. This promoter region can be subdivided into (i) a central segment of approximately 40 base pair that is required for transcription and (ii) flanking sequences that influence the efficiency of transcription in vitro. We have examined the in vitro transcriptional activity of the human extract under various conditions that are thought to modulate rRNA synthesis in vivo. Cell-free extracts prepared from HeLa cells infected with adenovirus 2 synthesize human rRNA at levels greatly decreased relative to uninfected cell extracts. By contrast, in vitro transcription of human rRNA is stimulated 2 - to 3 -fold {{by the addition of}} purified simian virus 40 large tumor antigen to the transcription reaction. Moreover, a mutant tumor antigen known to be defective for rRNA activation in vivo is incapable of stimulating rRNA synthesis in vitro. The ability to detect these different regulatory phenomena in vitro provides us with an experimental basis for investigating the molecular mechanisms that control rRNA synthesis...|$|R
