5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their connection with the afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E

30|$|Despite companies’ active {{participation}} in CSR activities, it remains unclear how they may effectively communicate CSR activities with consumers from different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> CSR communication strategies that are adapted to consumers’ <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> could be essential (Ding 2006), especially when the message content and audience’s message perception are tied to cultural values (e.g., Kim & Johnson 2013). As individuals’ <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are important consumer factors influencing campaign effects and effectiveness (de Mooij 2010), previous studies suggests the relative advantages of culturally adapted messages over standardized or culturally non-adapted messages (Han & Shavitt 1994; Zhang & Gelb 1996).|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that people from East Asian <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> make broader, more complex causal attributions than people from Western <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> In the current research, the authors hypothesized that East Asians would also be aware of a broader, more complex distribution of consequences of events. Four studies assessed cultural differences in perceptions of the consequences of 1) a shot in a game of pool, 2) an area being converted into a national park, 3) a CEO firing employees, and 4) a car accident. Across all four studies, compared to participants from Western <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> participants from East Asian <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> were more aware of the indirect, distal consequences of events. This pattern occurred on a variety of measures, including spontaneously generated consequences, estimations of an event’s impact on subsequent events, perceived responsibility, and predicted affective reactions. Implications for our understanding of cross-cultural psychology and social perception are discussed...|$|R

The current research utilized a survey (N= 452) of young adults to examine the occurrence of culturally- and gender-influenced differences in online behavior, offline networks, and satisfaction. Results show that participants who identify with more individualistic <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> have larger networks of friends on social network sites (SNSs), have {{a greater proportion of}} these friends not actually met face-to-face, and share more photos online opposed to participants who identify with less individualistic <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Social support network size {{was a significant predictor of}} satisfaction with life, while SNS network size was not.

40|$|Virtual teams improve {{organizational}} performance and competitiveness because they reduce business travel and allow team members {{to work from}} anywhere, anytime, using the Internet to complete projects. Although researchers have identified benefits of using virtual teams, knowledge about how <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> influence virtual team performance is limited. Illuminating this relationship may help leadership improve team performance. The purpose of this phenomenological {{study was to explore}} the lived experiences of team members with different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> to understand their effect on team performance. The research questions were based on the conceptual framework of organizational cultural theories developed by Schein and Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner. Interview questions were electronically distributed to a purposeful sample of 20 participants who worked on virtual teams and could describe their lived experiences. Data were collected, coded using open and axial techniques, and analyzed for themes and patterns. Key themes emerged such as <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> language barriers, communication, conflict, and use of information technology. Findings included techniques for improving communications, understanding different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> and the satisfaction of team members. Implications for positive social change include an improved understanding among virtual team leaders regarding how different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds</b> influence team performance. Results of this study may benefit organizations by helping them better manage the performance of multicultural virtual teams, thereby leading to improved product development and reduced costs associated with activities such as business travel and remote work...|$|R
