50|$|Etonitazene is {{a potent}} {{analgesic}} drug shown to be approximately 1000-1500x the potency of morphine in animal models but only 60x in man. It {{is one of several}} benzimidazole opioids, and is structurally related to <b>clonitazene</b> (where the p-ethoxybenzyl group is replaced by a p-chlorobenzyl group; however, <b>clonitazene</b> itself has only 3x the potency of morphine).|$|E
50|$|<b>Clonitazene</b> is an opioid {{analgesic}} of approximately {{three times the}} potency of morphine. It is related to etonitazene, an opioid of significantly higher potency. <b>Clonitazene</b> is not currently marketed. It is a controlled substance; in the United States it is a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9612 and an annual manufacturing quota of zero.|$|E
50|$|It {{can be used}} as a {{selective}} reducing agent (cf <b>Clonitazene),</b> where there are 2 nitro groups only one of them is selectively reduced.|$|E
50|$|Of these analogues, only {{etonitazene}} and <b>clonitazene</b> are explicitly {{listed as}} illegal drugs under UN convention {{and so are}} illegal throughout the world. The rest would only be illegal {{in countries such as}} the USA, Australia and New Zealand that have laws equivalent to the Federal Analog Act. In the United States it is a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9624 and a zero annual manufacturing quota as of 2013.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the exposure to the medical and industrial toxic chemicals. The research was carried out on hair, nail and blood samples in a panel of 40 healthy volunteers aged 7 to 77 with an average of 45 Â± 19 years (18 women (45 %) and 22 men (55 %)). All of these individuals had not received medication for at least 1 year, including antibiotics and psychotropic. This study was realized from July 2013 to March 2014 in Beijing, China. The method for an accurate and reliable screening of medical and an industrial toxic chemical was based on detection and assay by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection type of diode arrays. Also more than 10, 000 toxic molecules commonly found in western industrial coun-tries were screened by coupling gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The main results indicate that the molecules analyzed are mainly antibiotic (Gentamycine and Tobramycine), an-tidepressant (Amitriptylin and its metabolites), narcotic (MDMA and <b>Clonitazene),</b> ingredient in cosmetics (Benzenediol and Benzoic acid), insecticide (Carbamate derivative), ketamine, chlor-hexidine and phthalate derivatives. There are no detailed documented baseline data of the analy...|$|E
