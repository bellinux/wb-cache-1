50|$|Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, known {{commonly}} as <b>water</b> <b>pennywort,</b> floating pennywort, or floating marshpennywort, is an {{aquatic plant}} in the family Apiaceae. It is native to North and South America and parts of Africa. In the United Kingdom it is an invasive alien species which is currently spreading in waterways.

Addition of <b>common</b> <b>water</b> hyacinth improved the growth and quality of cucumber. At the same time, it increased the soil water content by 9. 2 to 11. 9 %, depending on the growth stages, from the level of the control, which was equivalent to the increase by addition of SAP.

Species identification H. ranunculoides is {{an entirely}} glabrous, stoloniferous, perennial aquatic plant species. Stems float in the water or creep onto the shore and the plants root freely from nodes at about 3 - 10 cm intervals. The alternate leaves are emergent or floating and sit above the horizontal stem on fleshly petioles of up to 40 cm long. The leaves are non-peltate, suborbicular to reniform with a cordate base, (25) 40 – 100 (180) mm in diameter, and usually broader than long. They are shallowly or deeply incised into 3 - 7 rounded, crenate or lobulate subequal lobes. The flowers are hermaphrodite, white and grouped by 5 to 10 in a small umbel. The inflorescence is borne on a leafless stalk, 1 - 6 cm in length and remaining shorter than the petioles. The flowers lack sepals, and have 5 unconnected petals and 5 stamens. The ovary is inferior, two-lobed and has 2 styles. The schizocarp fruits are brownish...|$|R
40|$|The plant Hydrocotyle umbellata L., Araliaceae (<b>water</b> <b>pennywort),</b> {{is widely}} used in Brazilian folk {{medicine}} to reduce anxiety. This work investigates the anxiolytic-like effects of the ethanol extract from H. umbellata subterraneous parts {{as well as the}} extract's other putative central nervous system effects that could justify its common use. Oral dosing of the extract (0. 3 and 1 g/kg) clearly showed an anxiolytic-like profile in the elevated plus maze test where it increased the percentage of entries into and the time spent in the open arms of the maze. In the marble-burying test, the extract induced anxiolytic-like effects only at a dose of 1 g/kg, which also causes mild sedative properties in other models. The sedated state was characterized by a slight reduction in spontaneous exploratory activity during the open field test and a potentiating of pentobarbital-induced hypnosis. No signs of motor impairment were detected in the rota rod or chimney tests. The extract did not show antidepressant properties in mice as assessed by the forced swimming test. These results support the use of H. umbellata in Brazilian folk medicine as an anxiolytic and contribute to the scientific knowledge of this possible phytotherapeutic resource...|$|R

40|$|Water-retention {{capacities}} of moss, <b>common</b> <b>water</b> hyacinth and Late　Juncellus {{were compared with}} that of SAP (super absorbent polymers), a presently used chemical water-retaining material. Moss was highest in the amount of water retained per unit weight among the three vegetable materials and showed a somewhat higher water-retention capacity than did SAP. However, it is difficult to collect moss enough for use as a water-retaining material, and collection of a large amount of moss easily lead to destruction of environment. Moss had a high potential but actually was not appropriate for using as a water-retaining material in crop production. Instead, <b>common</b> <b>water</b> hyacinth was targeted. It is an invading aquatic macrophyte with a potential for rapid growth and spreading, and has caused serious damage to local environment.
