40|$|The {{transient}} {{behaviors of}} natural circulation loop (NCL) {{are important for}} the system reliability under postulated accidents. The heat loss and structure thermal inertia may influence the transient behaviors of NCL greatly, so a transient analysis model with consideration of heat loss was developed based on the MATLAB/Simulink to predict the thermal-hydraulic <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> metal NCL. The transient processes including the start-up, the loss of pump, and the shutdown of thermal-hydraulic ADS lead bismuth loop (TALL) experimental facility were simulated by using the model. A good agreement is obtained to validate the transient model. The appended structure would provide significant thermal inertia and flatten the temperature distribution in the transients. The oscillations of temperature and flow rate are also weakened. The temperature difference between hot leg and cold leg would increase with the decrease of heat loss, so the flow rate increases as well. However, a significant increase of hot section temperature may cause a failure of facility integrity due to the decrease of heat loss. Hence, the full power of the core tank may also be limited...|$|E

But the systems of such particles that have been produced in the laboratory in ion traps, or ion beams, are finite with surfaces defined by the boundary conditions that have to be satisfied. This results in ion clouds with sharply defined curved surfaces, and interior structures that show up as a set of concentric layers that are parallel to the outer surface.

40|$|We use a variational {{principle}} to derive {{a mathematical model}} for a nematic electrolyte in which the liquid crystalline component is {{described in terms of}} a second-rank order tensor. The model extends the previously developed director-based theory and accounts for presence of disclinations and possible biaxiality. We verify the model by considering a simple but illustrative example of liquid crystal-enabled electro-osmotic flow (LCEO) around a stationary dielectric spherical particle placed {{at the center of a}} large cylindrical container filled with a nematic electrolyte. Assuming homeotropic anchoring of the nematic on the surface of the particle and uniform distribution of the director on the surface of the container, we consider two configurations with a disclination equatorial ring and with a hyperbolic hedgehog, respectively. The computed electro-osmotic flows show a strong dependence on the director configurations and on the anisotropies of dielectric permittivity and electric conductivity of the nematic <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal-enabled electrokinetics. Further, the simulations demonstrate space charge separation around the dielectric sphere, even in the case of isotropic permittivity and conductivity.

40|$|The main <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> {{crystals}} is {{that their}} properties, both electrical and optical, can be modified through a convenient applied signal, for instance a certain voltage.

However, the initial alignment is a fabrication-dependent parameter and may be either planar or homeotropic. In addition, the strong dependence of the properties of liquid crystals with the temperature is well known and widely used for several temperature sensors. This dependence is produced by the influence of the temperature on the ordering of the molecules. In this work, we have studied the temperature dependence of the electric properties of a liquid crystal cell, in particular the dielectric permittivity, with the temperature as a function of the initial alignment set during the fabrication process. Starting from experimental measurements, an equivalent circuit model including the temperature dependence has been proposed. We have observed that a good linearity in a wide temperature range is provided at a suitable exciting frequency. Finally, a proper conditioner circuit is proposed as a powerful tool for linear and high sensibility temperature measurement...|$|E

Alignment Technologies and Applications of Liquid Crystal Devices demonstrates both the fundamental and practical aspects of alignment phenomena in liquid crystals. The physical basis of alignment phenomena is first introduced in order to aid the understanding of the various physical phenomena observed in the interface between liquid crystalline materials and alignment layer surfaces. Methods for the characterization of surfaces, which induce the alignment phenomena, and of the alignment layer itself are introduced. These methods are useful for the research of liquid crystalline materials and devices in academic research as well as in industry. In the practical sections, the alignment methods used in the LCD production lines are introduced with various other trials for the alignment technologies.

40|$|For {{approximately}} the last 50 years eruptions at Oldoinyo Len-gai have produced passive natrocarbonatite lavas interspersed with mixed silicate—natrocarbonatite events approximately every 15 - 25 years. In 1993 an unusual blocky lava erupted and. pre-served detailed mixed silicate—natrocarbonatite textures clearly indicating an immiscible origin. The 1993 blocky flow consists of natrocarbonatite with small silicate crystal aggregates which constitute ~ 2 — 5 % of the rock.

40|$|We {{have applied}} {{molecular}} dynamics {{and methods of}} importance sampling to study structure and dynamics of liquid water in contact with metal surfaces. The specific surfaces considered resemble the 100 and 111 faces of platinum. Several results emerge that should apply generally, not just to platinum. These results are generic consequences of water molecules binding strongly to surfaces that are incommensurate with favorable hydrogen-bonding patterns. We show that adlayers of water under these conditions have frustrated structures that interact unfavorably with adjacent liquid water. We elucidate dynamical processes of water in these cases that extend over {{a broad range of}} timescales, from less than picoseconds to more than nanoseconds. Associated spatial correlations extend over nanometers. We show that adlayer reorganization occurs intermittently, and each reorganization event correlates motions of several molecules. We show that soft liquid interfaces form adjacent to the adlayer, as is generally <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> water adjacent to a hydrophobic surface.

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of humidity on {{changes to the}} pressure drop of flat and pleated HEPA filters clogged by polydisperse hygroscopic and non-hygroscopic aerosols has been studied. For flat filters, the results confirm the observations reported by Gupta et al. (1993) that with a hygroscopic aerosol at humidity below the deliquescent point, or with a non-hygroscopic aerosol, the particulate specific cake resistance decreases as relative humidity increases. For pleated filters as for flat filters, the results reveal that during {{the formation of the}} particulate cake, the increase in relative humidity leads to a decrease in the specific cake resistance. When the reduction in filtration area, specific to pleated filters, becomes large, the presence of humidity accelerates the filling of pleats causing a greater pressure drop for a same aerosol mass loading. With a hygroscopic aerosol at a humidity above its deliquescent point, the change in pressure drop through flat or pleated filters is not linear but <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> aerosol filtration. The {{influence of}} humidity on the efficiency of pleated filters, measured by a soda fluorescein aerosol, has also been studied.

40|$|Abstract: Aqueous {{solutions}} of ethoxylated alcohols {{which form}} lyotropic liquid crystals at high concentrations (40 – 80 %) were selected as model lubricating substances. Microscopic studies under polarized light and viscosity measurements {{were carried out}} in order to confirm the presence of liquid crystalline structures {{in the case of}} alcohol solutions with ethoxylation degrees of 3, 5, 7 and 10. Microscopic images and viscosity coefficient values characteristic of various mesophases were obtained. As expected, the viscosity of LLCs decreases considerably with an increase in shearing rate which is <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> crystals being non-Newtonian liquids. Antiseizure properties were determined by means of a four-ball machine (T- 02 Tester) and characterized by scuffing load (Pt), seizure load (Poz) and limiting pressure of seizure (poz). Alcohol ethoxylates forming mesophases in aqueous solutions have the strongest effect on the Pt values which are several times higher than those measured in the presence of water. Ethoxylates with higher degrees of ethoxylation exhibit higher values of scuffing load. Those changes have been interpreted as a result of higher cloud points at which those compounds lose their amphiphilic properties. In general, the presence of mesophases in the bulk phase and particularly in the surface phase may lead to the formation of a lubricant film which separates the frictionally cooperating elements of a friction pair. The antiseizure efficiency of alcohol solutions is highest up to the load value which does not exceed the scuffing load value...|$|E

Additionally, the experimental energetic measurements, i. e. the enthalpy and adsorption and related entropy of adsorbed benzene, are taken into considerations. The analysis of experimental data leads {{to the conclusion that the}} entropy of C 6 H 6 adsorbed in strictly microporous materials approaches the value characteristic of quasi-solid (a partially ordered structure). On the other hand, for adsorbents possessing wider pores (i. e. the contribution of mesopores to the total porosity is significant) the differential entropy approaches to the value <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid.</b> We test a key assumption of the theoretical models describing the mechanism of adsorption, that the adsorbed phase is considered as liquid. This verification leads to the conclusion that the various orientation of the adsorbate in the pore space should be taken into consideration in the theoretical assumptions of a model and in its thermodynamic verification. The significant improvement in the description of benzene experimental data for microporous adsorbents is observed if the "correction term" in the enthalpy of adsorption is considered. This term is correlated with the average pore diameter of studied solids.
