50|$|Shane’s {{second major}} focus is <b>cyberdemocracy.</b> He is {{particularly}} interested in the potential of online government initiatives to engage the public more fully in actual policy making. He is a prominent member of the “cyberrealist school,” which rejects technological determinism of both the utopian and dystopian kind. He argues that the democratic potential of digital information technologies depends significantly on human agency, although he perceives the structures of power in society as limiting the impact of any specific initiative. See, e.g., Peter M. Shane, Democracy Online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet (Routledge, 2004).|$|E
40|$|New {{information}} technologies {{have been widely}} predicted to {{change the nature of}} governance. The Internet has made the ideal of <b>cyberdemocracy</b> more attainable as the world grows smaller and more connected. Although the ideal no longer seems so distant a destination, nagging questions remain: Where is this place? Are we there yet? How much longer? This paper evaluates the website {{of one of the most}} powerful legislatures in the world, the European Parliament, to determine where we are, how far we have come, and what remains to be done to achieve the ideal of <b>cyberdemocracy.</b> Five criteria are used in its assessment: content, usability, transparency, audience, and interactivity. Previous studies have operationalized these criteria in terms of features...|$|E

Results of a 3 -year study of state legislature Web sites, an analysis of the community networks, and a review of purely political sites such as MoveOn. org, RNC. org, and DNC. org are reported. Little deliberation was found on the legislature sites, but opportunities for such were greater on the other types of sites.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an interdisciplinary research carried out by several universities and various departments specializing in different subjects and fields of study. Objetives. The aims are to identify the opinion leaders around the figure of Hugo Chávez on Twitter {{during the time of the}} sample, analyze user behavior in the microblogging space, and demonstrate whether full <b>cyberdemocracy</b> or mass self-communication are currently taking place. Results. The research has monitored all tweets which included the identifiers Chávez, Chavez, @chávez, @chavez on Twitter and has analyzed the daily flow of tweets from January 5 to April 13 2013 (UTC/ GMT – 4). Thus, with 19, 943, 709 tweets and 8, 450, 049 users, we have created the largest corpus of messages about a Latin-American political issue in Spanish ever presented by scientific research. Conclusions. This article demonstrates now full <b>cyberdemocracy</b> or mass self-communication are not currently taking place. Publicad...|$|E
40|$|Ideas {{drawn from}} {{theories}} of <b>cyberdemocracy,</b> {{or use of}} the Internet’s interactive abilities to foster political discourse, {{can be used to}} define new ways in which online newspapers can become facilitators of that discourse. A content analysis of 47 online newspapers demonstrates that few papers are embracing these approaches. But some limited evidence was found that the idea of using online tools to “cover” public affairs differently is one that’s starting to take root in journalism...|$|E
40|$|Developments in {{information}} technology and the internet are taking place at an almost bewildering pace. Such improvements, however, are believed to present opportunities for improving the responsiveness and accountability of political institutions and enhancing citizen participation. In <b>Cyberdemocracy</b> the theoretical arguments for and against "electronic democracy" and the potential of information and communication technology are closely examined. The book is underpinned {{by a series of}} case studies in the US and Europe that demonstrate the application of "electronic democracy" in a number of city and civic projects...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) has resulted in numerous optimistic concepts like digital democracy, <b>cyberdemocracy,</b> the digital agora, the virtual community, and the global village, giving the impression that cyberspace automatically implies the broadening of democracy within society. The discourse has thus far mainly narrowly focused on concepts such as e-government and e-voting implying that the use of ICTs by public administration strengthens democracy. In contrast to this narrow view the approach of the ICT&S Center at the University of Salzburg stresses that political participation is a broad concept that aims at including those affected by decisions within these processes. It is based on a broad concept of power that sees the latter not as something that is imposed on people from above by institutions that cannot be controlled. But as something that is distributed in a certain way and that is produced in social practices. The task of eParticipation is to empower people with ICTs to be able to act in bottom-up-decision processes, to make informed decisions, and to develop social and politica...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} to analyse the way foreign media organisations {{have used the}} Internet to inform, educate and mobilise citizens for participation in their national election. These foreign experiences provide a framework with which to analyse the implications for the SABC as a public broadcaster of the next elections in South Africa. The research was informed by theories of media and democracy. One {{of the most powerful}} features of the new technology is its technical ability to facilitate an interactive flow of information. This research examines the concept of <b>cyberdemocracy</b> and the implications for the SABC, especially as it is planning on launching an online election strategy. The democratic roles of journalism and the implications for the SABC are also discussed. As a public service broadcaster, the SABC is bound to educate, inform, and mobilise voters for participation, build community and national identity and scrutinise the poll in the interests of transparency, accountability and fair play. International journalists are advocating a new type of journalism, called public or civic journalism, which combines these roles. This research draws primarily on qualitative research methods, using a case study methodology. It draws upon direct observation and interview methodology in the fieldwork. However, it also uses some quantitative methods in the analysis of the websites and the SABC research. Finally, the research analyses the situation at the SABC and provides recommendations for the election website within this context...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{various aspects}} of the online Bulletin Board System (BBS) world as they relate to the {{possibilities}} of the public sphere in China. It addresses two major questions: what has BBS brought to China where traditional media primarily serve as the mouthpiece of the government? And, why are Chinese netizens, especially younger generation, particularly enthusiastic about this online platform? Through a full- dimensional view into BBS'S information communication mechanism and BBS users' identities, social behaviors and values, we investigate {{the pros and cons of}} BBS in terms of its potential to contribute to <b>cyberdemocracy</b> in China. The Introduction addresses research motivations, critical questions, and research goals. It also provides an overview of China's Internet landscape and a brief review of Chinese BBS studies. Chapter One walks through the history and development of BBS in China, and analyzes the demographics and online behavioral patterns of BBS users. Chapter Two looks into the distinct information communication mechanism of BBS as well as BBS regulation and censorship in China. Chapter Three looks at a cohort of BBS users, exploring who are using BBS in China, why they are enthusiastic about this online community, and what are their distinct identities, social behaviors and values. The Conclusion makes explicit the relevance of these developments to the ongoing growth of the Chinese Public Sphere. by Liwen Jin. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In the {{information}} era inequality is increasingly dictated by {{a myriad of}} issues related to both access and use of computer and internet technologies. Mere access to the web is an indisputably insufficient claim to equity; attention must also be paid to issues such as autonomy, skill, purposes, and perceptions related to technological access and participation in cyberspace. The final???and still yet emerging???barrier to equality is termed here as Digital Consciousness, a state of being which most digitally disadvantaged populations have little opportunity to develop. This is understandably so as the recipe for such an understanding includes socialization, digital literacy, and a realization of self and structure in the modern web. All of these factors are dependent upon both access and use. To develop a Digital Consciousness a person must have avenues and contexts available that provide these ingredients. The library is one potential space for this, but it is unclear to what extent contemporary libraries effectively facilitate this process. The inequalities that African American communities have endured historically have been harsh, and digital inequality is no exception. To truly remedy the digital inequality for the African American people and other disadvantaged populations we must call for extensive change; a social movement situated {{within the context of}} {{the information}} revolution. This movement must embody <b>cyberdemocracy,</b> collective intelligence, and information freedom, each of which is dependent upon Digital Consciousness. This report assesses the computing and internet resources present in numerous Illinois public libraries that serve African American populations. Library outlets are evaluated for their capacity to enable patrons to develop Digital Consciousness. The study finds that while libraries do a moderately good job providing basic resources for connectivity, creation, and the reception and production of knowledge, they do not live up to the potential that they could be. The paper concludes with discussion about how to best address challenges and start crafting sustainable and effective solutions. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Can new {{technology}} enhance purpose-driven, democratic dialogue in groups, governments, and societies? Online Deliberation: Design, Research, and Practice {{is the first}} book that attempts to sample {{the full range of}} work on online deliberation, forging new connections between academic research, technology designers, and practitioners. Since some of the most exciting innovations have occurred outside of traditional institutions, and those involved have often worked in relative isolation from each other, work in this growing field has often failed to reflect the full set of perspectives on online deliberation. This volume is aimed at those working at the crossroads of information/communication technology and social science, and documents early findings in, and perspectives on, this new field by many of its pioneers.
