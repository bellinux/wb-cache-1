5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> form on the upwind side, replacing older <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{cell lines}} of origin {{are not fully}} understood. The {{mechanism}} may involve abnormal activation of stem cells.

5|$|The {{internal}} cavity forms: a {{mouth that}} {{can usually be}} closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center {{that acts as a}} stomach; and a system of internal canals. These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal: the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles, if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth â€“ two of these four branches terminate in anal pores. The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium, the gastrodermis. The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well-developed muscles. In other parts of the canal system, the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies. The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> store nutrients in vacuoles (internal compartments), germ <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> produce eggs or sperm, and photocytes that produce bioluminescence. The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> circulate water through the canals, punctuated by ciliary rosettes, pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer layer}} of the {{epidermis}} (outer skin) consists of: sensory cells; <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> secrete mucus, which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into other types of cell.

5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive <b>cells</b> <b>that</b> both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
5|$|Viruses infect all {{cellular}} life and, although viruses occur universally, each cellular {{species has}} its own specific range that often infect only that species.
