2500|$|Although {{sometimes}} described, e.g., by Switzer (1960), as relatively {{resistant to}} attack by insects and disease, white spruce {{is far from}} immune to depredation.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for generation of banded electrostatic emissions by low density, superthermal electrons is developed for application to Jupiter's magnetosphere. The model employs a power law {{form for the}} energy dependence and a loss <b>cone</b> <b>pitch</b> angle distribution of the superthermals to drive convective instability of Bernstein modes. A direct correspondence between spectral features of the 3 / 2 band and resonant superthermal electrons is found. The concept of a critical flux of resonant electrons able to provide 10 e-foldings of electric field amplification yields an explicit relation {{in terms of the}} background thermal electron pressure. This result is used to construct a theoretical/empirical model of thermal electron density and temperature from 6 - 20 Jupiter radii in the Jovian magnetosphere which suggests that the electron temperature is less than the ion temperature which is approximately equal to 10 times the electron temperature in this region. Finally, wave ray paths are computed for propagation in the magnetic equator and in the magnetic meridional plane of a dipole magnetic field. These ray paths suggest that intense wave activity is tightly confined to a small latitudinal extent, less than + or - approximately 4 deg, about the magnetic equator...|$|R

The pitch angle scattering induced by a signal from a ground-based VLF transmitter in the ionosphere above the transmitter has been estimated and compared to the pitch angle scattering induced by naturally occurring ELF hiss through cyclotron resonance. It is found that the expected scattering due to plasmapheric hiss is an order of magnitude larger than that due to Landau resonance in the topside ionosphere. Pitch angle scattering due to cyclotron resonance in the topside ionosphere, however, may be larger by a factor of 2. It is suggested that the 'fast Trimpi' effect may be caused by a cyclotron resonance interaction in the topside ionosphere...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Ponderosa pine is an {{important}} species both commercially and ecologically in western North America. This study considers the incidence of insect and disease pests {{on a series of}} replicated ponderosa pine research plantations in northern California. The studies, on an environmental gradient, contain a series of silvicultural treatments including vegetation control, fertilization application and insecticide application/ thinning. The mean annual temperature and total precipitation were used as climatic variables and the site index was considered as an environmental site variable. Needle retention was negatively correlated to the site productivity, with no treatment affects. Estimates of mean needle retention were in-line with those found in the literature. Total foliar herbivory was the lowest at the highest productivity site, again there were no treatment effects. The gouty pitch midge had the highest level of infestation on the branches of the trees at the site with the lowest productivity. The environmental variables support this with drier, warmer and higher sites being more susceptible. Sequoia <b>pitch</b> <b>moth</b> attacks were highest at the more drier and warmer sites while treatments with vegetation control appear to experience higher levels of attack. Total foliar pathogen infection was the lowest at the highest site index. There was no statistically significant difference between the other five sites and no treatment effect was established. Western gall rust was the highest that the most productive sites and treatments that were fertilized had higher levels of infection. The year of gall infection was associated with the occurrence of El Niño events in the study time period...|$|R
40|$|In general, a {{hypoid gear}} and a {{spiral bevel gear}} for cars {{are made up of}} a formate gear and a {{generated}} pinion. The tooth shape is tapered tooth. Much practice is required to obtain excellent tooth bearing of the tapered tooth. If we convert a tapered tooth to an equi-depth tooth, it is thought that we could easily obtain practical tooth bearing. To date, however, there is no paper that theoretically analyzes tooth bearing of the equi-depth tooth and actually demonstrates it. Therefore the tapered tooth is still used in cars. Thus, we have studied the gear cutting method of the equi-depth tooth hypoid gear. The tooth surface of the hypoid pinion is generated by the 3 rd gear member. In such a case, it is useful to apply the cutting <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> instead of the <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> and to change the generating shaft angle to the tooth bearing development of a hypoid gear. In this report, we present the relationships between the cutting pitch angle or the generating shaft angle and the tooth bearing pattern compared with a tapered tooth...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 The Douglas-fir <b>pitch</b> <b>moth</b> (DFPM), Synanthedon novaroensis, is {{attracted}} to exudations of oleoresin and oviposits at wounds on the bole of host trees. Larvae then feed in subcortical regions of vigourously growing hosts. With the increase use of pruning in young stands of Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menzesii (Mirb.) Franco, the potential exists for the DFPM, {{attracted to}} pruning wounds, to create defects {{that would reduce}} the value of wood products and erode potential returns on this investment. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to investigate the relationship between host selection behavior of the DFPM related to intermediate silvicultural activities such as pruning. Specific objectives of this study were to determine if DFPM demonstrates an ovipositional preference between: individual pruned Douglas-fir trees; clones of Douglas-fir; branch pruning wounds and wounds on the bole of Douglas-fir; pruning wounds made through the branch collar and wounds made outside the branch collar; and wounds made during different seasons of the year. A series of field experiments were conducted in young Douglas-fir stands in Western Washington from 1991 - 1997. The principal conclusions from these experiments were: DFPM host preference varies significantly between individual Douglas-fir trees; DFPM host preference varies significantly between clones of Douglas-fir; DFPM oviposits at wounds on the bole of a host more often than at wounds made outside the branch collar; DFPM oviposits significantly more often at pruning wounds made through the branch collar than at pruning wounds made outside the branch collar; and DFPM oviposits significantly more often at pruning wounds made in the spring than at pruning wounds made in summer, autumn, or winter...|$|R
40|$|A {{program of}} {{experimental}} and analytical {{research has been}} performed to demonstrate the effects of rotor and fuselage design parameters on rotor in-plane stability, including aeromechanical stability. The experimental data were obtained from hover and wind-tunnel tests of a scaled advanced bearingless main rotor model. Both isolated-rotor and free-hub conditions were tested. Test parameters included blade built-in cone and sweep angles; rotor inplane structural stiffness and damping; pitch link stiffness and location; and fuselage natural frequency, damping, and inertia. The results show that rotor blade structural damping {{is one of the}} most influential design parameters in obtaining acceptable aeromechanical stability margins. Other parameters, such as blade <b>cone</b> angle, <b>pitch</b> link location (rotor delta 3) and anisotropic hub damper configurations, may be used to improve stability margins, but their individual effects are subtle...|$|R

Pressure measure-ments show that by appropriate design of the actuators and appropriete choice of the a. c. voltage and frequency, side forces and yawing moments of opposite signs can be obtained at high angles of attack by activating one of the plasma actuators.

50|$|The {{diameter}} of a conical bore varies linearly with {{distance from the}} end of the instrument. A complete conical bore would begin at zero diameter - the cone's vertex. However, actual instrument bores approximate a frustum of a cone. The wavelength produced by the first normal mode is approximately twice the length of the cone measured from the vertex. The wavelength produced by the second normal mode is approximately equal to the length of the <b>cone,</b> so its <b>pitch</b> is an octave higher. Therefore, a conical bore instrument, like one with an open cylindrical bore, overblows at the octave and generally has a harmonic spectrum strong in both even and odd harmonics.|$|R

40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} {{comprehensive}} pressure measurements of a circular cone-cylinder model in a low-turbulence 3. 0 × 1. 6 m low-speed wind tunnel. The semi-apex {{angle of the}} cone is 10 ◦. The results consist of detailed pressure distributions over nine sta-tions on the cone at 35 ◦ angle of attack and free-stream Reynolds number of (0. 1 − 0. 9) × 106 based on the cone base diameter. The tests encompassed a complete coverage of roll angles in 9 ◦ intervals. Local and overall forces and moments are calculated from the measured pressures. The variation of local side-force coefficient normalized by the local diameter of the cone, with roll angle is nearly a square-wave curve. At Re = (0. 7, 0. 9) × 106, the maxi-mum side force is reduced, which is caused by late separation of the boundary layer, and irregular values of side force occur at a few roll angles, which is correlated to disagreement of separation asymmetry with pressure asymmetry.

Paul O'Neill hit a two-run home run to make it 2-1 Yankees in the top of the fourth. Jay Buhner's RBI single tied the game in the bottom half. In the sixth, Don Mattingly hit a two-run double that put the Yankees in front 4-2. In the bottom of the eighth, with five outs to go and <b>Cone</b> still <b>pitching,</b> Ken Griffey, Jr. homered to make it a one-run game. The Mariners loaded the bases later in the inning and with Doug Strange at bat, Cone walked in a run to tie the game at four. Both teams blew chances in the ninth with two men on to score the potential series winning run. Starters Jack McDowell and Randy Johnson came in the game in rare relief appearances in extra innings. The game moved to extra innings and in the top of the eleventh, Randy Velarde singled home pinch runner Pat Kelly to put the Yankees up by one and three outs away from advancing to the next round. But Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line that stayed fair in the bottom half to lead things off. Griffey singled to put runners on first and third. Then, Edgar Martínez lined a double to left field, scoring both Cora and Griffey to send the Mariners to the 1995 American League Championship Series. Martinez's game-winning hit has become the Seattle Mariners' most famous moment. During Seattle's playoff run, there were rumors the team might relocate.

40|$|Industrially-manufactured, {{spiral bevel}} gears with {{complementary}} tooth-end surfaces as a rule have reduced tooth thickness and subsequently reduced strength at the tooth ends. The weakened tooth ends of octoid gearing are generally produced by machining, inevitably resulting in a certain lengthwise dimensional discrepancy and slight profile difference. This in turn very often leads to systematic breakage of teeth. Serious, systematic damage occurs irrespective of the transmission tightness of the outer or inner tooth ends. Gear manufacturers currently use several solutions to avoid such breakages, including artificial inclination near to the teeth or deliberately reducing the back or outer cone angle and increasing the front or root cone angle. This paper outlines an improved design of gear blanks, with optimised tooth ends. Our research concluded {{that it is possible}} to optimise rectangular-generated, spiral bevel pinion/gear pairs with constant tooth height and a common <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> apex. We can successfully achieve this through recalculation of the gear blanks, without any changes in the flank geometry or tooth-cutting process. Thus the gear pair with optimised tooth ends can be cut without interference to the customary tooth-cutting process. To prove the concept, an example of the recalculation is provided. These improvements result in increased tooth strength, simplification of the gear blank geometry and more suitable geometry for modern machining, as well as a smaller outer diameter of the gear...|$|R
