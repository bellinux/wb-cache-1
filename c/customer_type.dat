40|$|We study {{an optimal}} {{admission}} of arriving customers to a Markovian finitecapacity queue, e. g. M/M/c/N queue, with several <b>customer</b> <b>types.</b> The system managers {{are paid for}} serving customers and penalized for rejecting them. The rewards and penalties depend on <b>customer</b> <b>types.</b> The goal is to maximize the average rewards per unit time subject to the constraint on the average penalties per unit time. We provide {{a solution to this}} problem based on Lagrangian optimization. For a feasible problem, we show the existence of a randomized trunk reservation optimal policy with the acceptance thresholds for different <b>customer</b> <b>types</b> ordered according to a linear combination of the service rewards and rejection costs. In addition, we prove that any 1 -randomized stationary optimal policy has this structure. In particular, we establish the structure of an optimal policy that maximizes the average rewards per unit time subject to the constraint on the blocking probability for one of the <b>customer</b> <b>types</b> or for a group of <b>customer</b> <b>types</b> pooled together...|$|R

40|$|The {{telecommunications}} {{industry is a}} fragmented market, characterized by a tremen-dous amount of customer heterogeneity. This paper shows how such customer heterogeneity dramatically affects nonlinear pricing strategies: (i) First, if there are unbalanced calling patterns between different <b>customer</b> <b>types,</b> networks make larger proÞts on the least at-tractive customers. In addition, {{the nature of the}} calling pattern substantially affects how networks discriminate implicitly between different <b>customer</b> <b>types.</b> (ii) Secondly, different <b>customer</b> <b>types</b> often perceive the substitutability of competing networks differently.

5000|$|Businesses {{employing}} {{data mining}} {{may see a}} return on investment, but also they recognize {{that the number of}} predictive models can quickly become very large. For example, rather than using one model to predict how many customers will churn, a business may choose to build a separate model for each region and <b>customer</b> <b>type.</b> In situations where a large number of models need to be maintained, some businesses turn to more automated data mining methodologies.|$|E
50|$|Load {{profiles}} can {{be determined}} by direct metering but on smaller devices such as distribution network transformers this is not routinely done. Instead a load profile can be inferred from customer billing or other data. An example of a practical calculation used by utilities is using a transformer's maximum demand reading and {{taking into account the}} known number of each <b>customer</b> <b>type</b> supplied by these transformers. This process is called load research.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{nonlinear}} {{nature of}} this problem, numerical methods are employed to obtain a solution that is within an acceptable tolerance. The load model needs to automatically calculate loads to match telemeter or forecasted feeder currents.

50|$|Previously, {{analytics}} {{was considered}} a type of after-the-fact method of forecasting consumer behavior by examining the number of units sold {{in the last quarter}} or the last year. This type of data warehousing required a lot more storage space than it did speed. Now business analytics is becoming a tool that can influence the outcome of customer interactions. When a specific <b>customer</b> <b>type</b> is considering a purchase, an analytics-enabled enterprise can modify the sales pitch to appeal to that consumer. This means the storage space for all that data must react extremely fast to provide the necessary data in real-time.|$|E

5000|$|Summarization: When {{dealing with}} {{large volumes of}} {{information}} like network usage, {{it may not be}} practical to go through CDR by CDR and compare the same between 2 systems. In such cases summarization will help in quickly examining and finding out the preliminary problems areas. For example, one could first summarize information on the basis of few dimensions like events ( [...] voice, sms, data), <b>customer</b> <b>type</b> (postpaid, prepaid, in roamer, out roamer), operator (self, local, national, international) etc. and compare the measures like count and duration of these dimensions between 2 systems. Such rapid assessments help in identifying the problem areas or dimensions quickly and a further detailed investigation can be carried out for those dimensions identified. Summarization greatly reduces the manual effort in identifying problem areas within a large data stream.|$|E
50|$|Reference data {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from master data, which represent key business entities such as customers and materials in all their necessary detail (e.g., for customers: number, name, address, and date of account creation). In contrast, reference data usually consist only of a list of permissible values and attached textual descriptions. A further difference between reference data and master data is that a change to the reference data values may require an associated change in business process to support the change; a change in master data will always be managed as part of existing business processes. For example, adding a new customer or sales product {{is part of the}} standard business process. However, adding a new product classification (e.g. restricted sales item) or a new <b>customer</b> <b>type</b> (e.g. gold level customer) will result in a modification to the business processes to manage those items.|$|E
50|$|Porter’s books give {{techniques}} for getting {{a handle on}} the possible average profitability of an industry over time. The analysis of these forces is the base for estimating a firm’s relative position and competitive advantage. In any industry, the sustained average profitability of competitors varies widely. The problem is to determine how a business can outperform the industry average and attain a sustainable competitive advantage. It is possible that the answer lies in information technology together with good management. Porter claims that the principal types of competitive advantage are low cost producer, differentiation, and focus. A firm has a competitive advantage if it is able to deliver its product or service at a lower cost than its competitors. If the quality of its product is satisfactory, this will translate into higher margins and higher returns. Another advantage is gained if the firm is able to differentiate itself in some way. Differentiation leads to offering something that is both unique and is desired, and translates into a premium price. Again, this will lead to higher margins and superior performance. It seems that two types of competitive advantage, lower cost and differentiation, are mutually exclusive. To get lower cost, you sacrifice uniqueness. To get a premium price, there must be extra cost involved in the process. To be a superior performer, however, you must go for competitive advantage in either cost or differentiation. Another point of Porter’s is that competitive advantage is gained through a strategy based on scope. It is necessary to look at the breadth of a firm’s activities, and narrow the competitive scope to gain focus in either an industry segment, a geographic area, a <b>customer</b> <b>type,</b> and so on. Competitive advantage is most readily gained by defining the competitive scope in which the firm is operating, and concentrating on it. Based on these ideas of type and scope, Porter gives a useful tool for analysis which he calls the value chain. This value chain gives a framework on which a useful analysis can be hung. The basic notion is that to understand competitive advantage in any firm, one cannot look at the firm as a whole. It is necessary to identify the specific activities which the firm performs to do business. Each firm is a collection of the things that it does that all add up to the product being delivered to the customer. These activities are numerous and are unique to every industry, but it is only in these activities where cost advantage or differentiation can be gained. The basic lis that the firm’s activities can be divided into nine generic types. Five are the primary activities, which are the activities that create the product, market it and deliver it; four are the support activities that cross between the primary activities.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} an infinite sequence of <b>customers</b> of <b>types</b> C = { 1, 2, [...] ., I} and an infinite sequence of servers of types S = { 1, [...] ., J}, where server of type j can serve {{a subset of}} <b>customer</b> <b>types</b> C(j) and where <b>customer</b> of <b>type</b> i can be served by a subset of server types S(i). We assume the <b>types</b> of <b>customers</b> and servers in the infinite sequences are random, independent identically distributed, and customers and servers are matched according to their order in the sequence, on a first come first served (FCFS) basis. We investigate this process of infinite bipartite matching. In particular {{we are interested in}} the limiting rate ri,j of <b>customers</b> of <b>type</b> i assigned to servers of type j.

Reference [19] presents an improved approach to estimate the <b>customer</b> <b>type</b> and the customer outage cost function by using historical demand side management (DSM) data, and formulates the ILM contract model with a discrete <b>customer</b> <b>type</b> parameter.
