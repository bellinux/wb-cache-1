40|$|Purpose: Discovering {{the cause}} of early hip {{prosthesis}} mobilization is a challenge for the orthopedic surgeon. Infection is one possible cause of early prosthesis failure, {{but there are other}} causes that orthopedic surgeons should also consider. Case report: We present the case of a 61 -year-old male patient with early hip failure due to <b>cobalt</b> <b>allergy</b> and describe the different diagnosis steps that led to this diagnosis. Discussion: Collaboration between departments was fundamental in order to reach the diagnosis. Revision surgery using components without the allergenic metal and using different surface bearing materials (ceramic-ceramic) gave satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Metal allergy {{in total}} knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) {{is still a}} controversial topic. Oxinium, ceramic or titanium niobium nitride (TiNbN) coated implants are available for some knee systems. The hypothesis {{of this study was}} that the use of TiNbN-coated components would not lead to inferior results compared to conventional implants and that none of the allergic patients receiving TiNbN-coated implants would require revision for metal allergy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective, 2 to 1 matched pairs study with 40 titanium niobium nitride-coated TKA compared with 80 conventional cobalt chrome implants. No demographic differences between these groups were observed. The mean follow-up for this study was 2 years. RESULTS: No differences in clinical, radiological, or patient-reported outcome measurements were observed between the two groups. No patients have been revised at this short- to medium-term outcome evaluation. DISCUSSION: Metal allergy leading to contact or systemic dermatitis is especially linked to chrome and <b>cobalt</b> <b>allergy.</b> Nickel allergy because of knee implants rarely gives cutaneous symptoms, but could potentially lead to peri-prosthetic osteolysis and loosening. The use of titanium niobium nitride implants in case of a positive history of metal allergy could avoid this devastating complication. CONCLUSION: The use of titanium niobium nitride-coated implants for primary knee osteoarthritis shows similar clinical and radiological outcomes as conventional TKA without revision for loosening at short- to medium-term follow-up.

40|$|Objectives: To {{quantify}} {{the risk of}} contact allergy (CA) to important ubiquitous allergens asso-ciated with certain occupations, in particular the construction industry, and to identify possible time trends, controlling for potential confounding variables. Methods: Bivariate as well as Poisson regression analysis of standardized anamnestic and patch test data comprising 82 561 patients assessed in the 33 German and Austrian contact dermatitis units of the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) between 1992 and 2000. Results: CA to five of the 18 (groups of) allergens considered here were observed significantly more often in construction workers: dichromate, epoxy resin (BADGE), cobalt, thiurams and N-isopropyl-p-phenylenediamine (IPPD). Multifactorial analysis confirmed {{an increased risk of}} CA to these allergens in construction workers, compared with other occupations. A very strong association between <b>cobalt</b> and chromate <b>allergy</b> was found in construction workers (OR 39. 1, 95 % CI 21. 1 â€“ 79. 6). Conclusions: Dichromate is still an prominent allergen in construction workers; as yet, there is only weak evidence of a decrease in Germany. Therefore, the addition of ferrous sulphate t...|$|R
