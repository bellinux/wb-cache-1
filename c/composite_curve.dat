40|$|Composites {{have proven}} their great {{potential}} for many aerospace applications, where high performance justifies high cost. One of the potential applications of composites is helicopter landing gears. Helicopter landing gears consist of straight and curved tubes. A new analysis and design tool is required to consider the manufacturing technology. In this study, high-order analytical methods are proposed to analyze and design thick laminated orthotropic straight and curved tubes subjected to different boundary and loading conditions. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, the elasticity displacement field of thick laminated composite straight tubes is developed. In this investigation, thick composite cantilever tubes under transverse loading are studied using the newly displacement-based method. This method provides a quick, convenient and accurate procedure for the determination of 3 D stresses in thick composite straight tubes subjected to both bending and shear loadings. In addition, this method is used to study stress and strain distributions in thick composite straight tubes with different simple and complex lay-up sequences. Note that thick laminated composite straight tubes subjected to cantilever loading conditions are investigated for the first time. Moreover, the developed method is used to analyze thick laminated composite straight tubes subjected to different mechanical loadings such as axial force, torque and bending moment. In the second part of this thesis, the general displacement field of thick laminated <b>composite</b> <b>curved</b> tubes is developed. By proposing a new high-order displacement-based method, single-layer <b>composite</b> <b>curved</b> tubes are examined. First, a displacement approach of Toroidal Elasticity is chosen to obtain the displacement field of single-layer <b>composite</b> <b>curved</b> tubes. Then, a layer-wise method is employed to develop the most general displacement field of elasticity for thick arbitrary laminated <b>composite</b> <b>curved</b> tubes. The developed method is used to analyze single-layer and laminated <b>composite</b> <b>curved</b> tubes subjected to pure bending moment. Note that displacement-based Toroidal Elasticity is applied to study thick laminated <b>composite</b> <b>curved</b> tubes for the first time. In addition, the failure analysis on thick <b>composite</b> <b>curved</b> tubes subjected to pure bending moment is conducted. Effects of lay-up sequences of <b>composite</b> <b>curved</b> tubes on stress distributions and failure sequences are investigated, as well. The accuracy of the proposed methods is verified by comparing the numerical results obtained using the proposed methods against finite element method, experimental data and solutions available in the literature. The methods that proposed in this thesis do not require meshing. They simplify greatly inputs that the user has to do, once the program for solution is available. This presents a clear advantage over FEM. Therefore, the most important advantage of the proposed methods is that inputs for modeling and analyzing of <b>composite</b> straight and <b>curved</b> tubes with complex lay-up sequences are simple, easy to use and fast to run. In addition, using FEM for the parametric study is cumbersome. By applying the proposed methods, the parametric study for thick laminated <b>composite</b> straight and <b>curved</b> tubes is simple with low computational cost...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{integration}} of heat pumps in industrial processes {{has not yet}} been fully understood. In this paper an optimization methodology and a method which uses the <b>composite</b> <b>curves</b> as a guideline to the correct choice of heat pump type are outlined. The selection is done by matching the shape of the <b>composite</b> <b>curves</b> against the specific characteristics of several heat pump types. Furthermore, a methodology for the optimization of the most important parameters in a heat pump system is presented. In the optimization methodology the annual cost is minimized by varying heat source and heat sink temperatures, the heat pump size and the stream or streams to be utilized as heat source and heat sink. To reveal the potential for electrically driven compression heat pumps two different examples were studied with the methodology. The first example had close <b>composite</b> <b>curves</b> and was thought to be a poor heat pump candidate. The second one had open <b>composite</b> <b>curves</b> and was thought to be a promising example. The results showed that for both examples, heat pump installations were advantageous under good economic conditions for the heat pump, i. e. low electricity price, high fuel price and low investment costs. Also reasonable payback periods were achieved. With more unfavourable conditions the payback period increased, and in extreme cases a heat pump was no longer a better alternative than pure heat exchange. This decline in potential for heat pumping was much less in the example with open <b>composite</b> <b>curves</b> than in the example with closed ones.

Wastewater management deals with optimal design of effluent treatment units to respect environmental norms. However, optimal design of effluent treatment units should be solved in conjunction with {{the problem of}} optimal allocation of water among different processes that use water. A new methodology for targeting minimum effluent treatment flow rate satisfying minimum freshwater requirement is proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology can be applied to fixed-flow-rate as well as fixed-contaminant-load problems having a single contaminant. A source <b>composite</b> <b>curve</b> is proposed for directly targeting generation of wastewater. Freshwater can be indirectly targeted using overall mass balance. To target distributed generation of wastewater, wastewater <b>composite</b> <b>curve</b> is proposed.

It was previously shown that several features of such noise-delay functions are well predicted by the <b>composite</b> <b>curve,</b> generated by the linear summation of responses to tones with varying ITD. This indicates a surprising degree of linearity at the midbrain level of the auditory pathway. A similar comparison between responses to tones and to noise has not been made at a more peripheral, monaural level and it is therefore unclear to what extent this linearity reflects peripheral physiology. Here, we compare cat auditory nerve responses to broadband noise and to isolevel tones. We constructed shuffled autocorrelograms for responses to tones and summed across frequencies to obtain a monaural <b>composite</b> <b>curve.</b> We then compare this <b>composite</b> <b>curve</b> to the shuffled autocorrelogram of responses to broadband noise and find that the match between tonal and noise responses is poorer {{at the level of the}} auditory nerve than at the level of the IC.
