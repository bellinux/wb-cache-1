5|$|The 2012 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} on June 22–23, 2012, at the <b>Consol</b> Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the first round, the Canucks drafted Brendan Gaunce, a two-way centre with size. Leading up to the draft, Gaunce was ranked 13th among North American skaters by the NHL's {{scouting}} department, and was the top-ranked Canadian forward. Projected to be a mid-first round pick, he dipped slightly to 26 where he was selected by the Canucks. General Manager Mike Gillis stated that going into the draft, they had targeted Gaunce, {{and if he had}} not been available, Vancouver would have traded down to add extra picks.|$|E

In addition to extending a home sellout streak to 72games on October 23, the Penguins ranked 113% {{above the national}} average for male television viewers aged 18 to 34. The franchise ranked as the 18th most valuable in the league at US$195million, marking a 26%increase from the past season. According to Forbes, the franchise's revenue would likely put the Penguins into the top ten after their new arena, <b>Consol</b> Energy Center, opened in 2010. The Penguins finished October with a 3–1–1 record in Pittsburgh and concluded the month with three consecutive road losses.|$|E

5|$|The Pittsburgh Penguins are an American {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They {{play in the}} Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise was established as one of six new franchises of the 1967 NHL expansion.

The franchise is co-owned by Ronald Burkle and Mario Lemieux—the only player/owner in the NHL's modern era.

5|$|His signing by the Steelers {{caused a}} social media {{backlash}} by many Steeler fans, with some {{saying that they}} would never support the team again. Fans who supported or were indifferent about the signing called such fans fair weather fans, and also cited that the Steelers have several players with questionable pasts, most notably Roethlisberger and James Harrison. The Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania made a subtle jab at the team on Twitter by saying that they were now more proud to support the Pittsburgh Penguins and subsequently moved an upcoming fundraiser event from Heinz Field to <b>Consol</b> Energy Center. Steelers president Art Rooney II defended the Vick signing on KDKA-TV, saying that they felt that Vick had proven himself since being released from prison. The Steelers had considered signing Vick in 2009—both Vick and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin are from the same part of Virginia and know each other well personally—but decided against it due to potential backlash since Vick at the time hadn't proven himself following his release from prison.|$|E

5000|$|Frederic Morton {{relates the}} story thus:To the Rothschilds, England's chief {{financial}} agents, Waterloo brought a many million pound scoop. ... a Rothschild agent ... jumped into a boat at Ostend ... Nathan Rothschild ... let his eye {{fly over the}} lead paragraphs. A moment later {{he was on his}} way to London (beating Wellington's envoy by many hours) to tell the government that Napoleon had been crushed: but his news was not believed, because the government had just heard of the English defeat at Quatre Bras. Then he proceeded to the Stock Exchange. Another man in his position would have sunk his work into <b>consols</b> annuities, already weak because of Quatre Bras. But this was Nathan Rothschild. He leaned against [...] "his" [...] pillar. He did not invest. He sold. He dumped <b>consols.</b> ... <b>Consols</b> dropped still more. [...] "Rothschild knows," [...] the whisper rippled through the 'Change. [...] "Waterloo is lost." [...] Nathan kept on selling, ... <b>consols</b> plummeted - until, a split second before it was too late, Nathan suddenly bought a giant parcel for a song. Moments afterwards the great news broke, to send <b>consols</b> soaring. We cannot guess the number of hopes and savings wiped out by this engineered panic.|$|R

25|$|A {{statue in}} his honour, created by {{sculptor}} Bruce Wolfe, was erected in Pittsburgh on March 7, 2012, outside of <b>Consol</b> Energy Center.

25|$|The {{main issue}} {{in dealing with}} the fossil fuel {{phase-out}} has been job loss. Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, <b>Consol</b> Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural gas producer. Not only does this shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the shuttering of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million jobs will be lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to keep running. As a result, coal plants are no longer a reliable, go-to energy source for the United States.|$|E
