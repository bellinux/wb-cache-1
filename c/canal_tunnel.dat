5|$|The 32nd Battalion was to {{commence}} its attack at Bellicourt at 09:00 on 29 September, and move south through the village. Due to mist and smoke from a preceding artillery barrage, visibility was poor. When the advance {{was held up}} by two German machine guns, Wark ordered a tank to neutralise them. On reaching {{the southern end of}} St Quentin <b>Canal</b> <b>tunnel,</b> Wark came across two hundred troops of the American 117th Infantry Regiment who appeared to be leaderless, and attached them to his own command. A short time later, with visibility still poor, he appropriated armoured reinforcements and began an advance on the village of Nauroy. As the fog began to lift, Wark organised his troops for an attack on the village from a southerly direction. By 11:30, the battalion had taken the village, along with forty Germans as prisoners of war.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{demolition}} of the Butterley Company's old foundry buildings exposed the original blast furnace, dating to 1790. In {{front of the}} furnace {{is at least one}} vertical shaft, now capped off, which leads down to a short tunnel which connects with the <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> close to the wharf area. Additionally, a number of deep drains below these buildings probably link to the <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The site is now occupied by Butterley Engineering, one of the successors to the Butterley Company, and noted for its involvement {{in the construction of the}} Falkirk Wheel.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} smaller canal tunnels are joined to the Telford tunnel. These tunnels {{connected}} to coal mines at Golden Hill and allowed both the drainage of the mines and {{the export of}} coal directly from the mines to the <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> without the necessity of first hauling it to the surface. Small boats of ten tons' capacity were used in this endeavour.|$|E
25|$|Gloucester Line Tunnels â€“ {{are four}} {{separate}} tunnels heading south-west towards Five Ways. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holiday Street Tunnel, 93 yards (85 metres) long; <b>Canal</b> <b>Tunnel,</b> 224 yards (204 metres) long, passing under the Birmingham Canal Navigations; Granville Street Tunnel, 81 yards (74 metres) long; and Bath Row Tunnel, 209 yards (191 metres) long. These tunnels opened in 1885 {{as part of}} the Birmingham West Suburban Railway and hold two tracks.|$|E

25|$|The Thames and Medway Canal {{was opened}} for barge traffic in 1824. It ran from Gravesend on the Thames to Frindsbury near Strood on the Medway. Although seven miles long {{it had only}} two locks, each 94ft by 22ft in size, one at each end. Its most notable feature was the tunnel near Strood which was 3,946 yds long, the second longest <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> ever built in the UK. The great cost of the tunnel meant that the canal was not a {{commercial}} success.|$|E
25|$|The North Midland Railway, {{running from}} Leeds to Derby, opened in 1840 and this {{represented}} {{a major threat}} to the domination of the coal trade by all the South Yorkshire navigations. Parts of the railway ran alongside the canal. At Adwick upon Dearne the railway constructed a long cutting, and in order to maintain their alignment, the <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> was demolished and the canal was re-routed to share the new cutting. The canal Company took the opportunity to build interchange facilities with the new railway.|$|E
25|$|The first short section, which {{connected}} to the Stourbridge Canal, opened in 1779, and this was connected through the Dudley Tunnel to the Birmingham Canal system in 1792. Almost immediately, work started on an extension, called Line No. 2, which ran through another long tunnel at Lapal, to reach the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. This was completed in 1798, but significant trade {{had to wait until}} the Worcester and Birmingham was completed in 1802. In 1846, the company amalgamated with the Birmingham Canal Navigations, and various improvements followed, including the Netherton Tunnel, of a similar length to the Dudley Tunnel, but much bigger, with towpaths on both sides and gas lighting. It was the last <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> built in England.|$|E
50|$|Another {{option for}} dealing with hills is to tunnel through them. An example of this {{approach}} is the Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey <b>Canal.</b> <b>Tunnels</b> are only practical for smaller canals.|$|R

50|$|A trolley boat (a {{descriptive}} neologism {{not used}} contemporaneously) is an electrically driven boat on canals {{and particularly in}} <b>canal</b> <b>tunnels.</b> It takes its energy like a tram or trolleybus from one or two overhead wires respectively.|$|R
25|$|Another {{major feature}} is the Harecastle Tunnel, near Kidsgrove {{in the city of}} Stoke-on-Trent, north Staffordshire. There are {{actually}} two tunnels; the first was built by Brindley and was 2880 yards (2633 m) long, and boats were 'legged' through by men lying on their backs and pushing against the roof with their feet. This was a physically demanding and slow process and created major delays, so leading civil engineer Thomas Telford was commissioned to provide a second, wider, parallel tunnel with a towpath. This 2926 yard (2676 m) long tunnel was opened in 1827. In the 1900s, the Brindley tunnel was closed due to severe subsidence, but the Telford Tunnel - although also prone to the same problems - remains in use, and is the fourth-longest navigable <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The boom in {{industry}} {{that had occurred}} in Saddleworth during the Industrial Revolution called for greater transport links. Construction of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was begun in 1794, {{at the height of}} Canal Mania, connecting Huddersfield to Stalybridge via Saddleworth and completed seventeen years later in 1811; when the Standedge <b>Canal</b> <b>Tunnel</b> at Diggle was finally opened. The decline of canals and the rise of steam powered locomotives left the canal falling behind the competition, and so it was decided that a railway tunnel would be built parallel to the canal, which was completed in 1848. The rise in traffic demanded a second tunnel be built, completed in 1871. Both of these were single line tunnels and eventually superseded by the 1894 tunnel, a double line tunnel, which {{is the only one of}} the three still regularly carrying passengers.|$|E
25|$|The Thames and Severn Canal is a canal in Gloucestershire in {{the south}} of England, which was {{completed}} in 1789. It was conceived as part of a canal route from Bristol to London. At its eastern end, it connects to the River Thames at Inglesham Lock near Lechlade, while at its western end, it connects to the Stroudwater Navigation at Wallbridge near Stroud, and thence to the River Severn. It has one short arm (branch), from Siddington to the town of Cirencester. It includes Sapperton Tunnel, which when built was the longest <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> in Britain, and remains the fourth longest. There were always problems with water supply, as no reservoirs were built, while the summit section near the tunnel ran through porous limestone, and there were constant difficulties with leakage. Competition from the railways took much of the canal's traffic {{by the end of the}} 19th century, and most of the canal was abandoned in 1927, the remainder in 1941.|$|E

50|$|In some <b>canal</b> <b>tunnels</b> the towpath {{continues}} through the tunnel. In other cases, especially on English narrow canals, {{there is no}} towpath. The horse would be led over the hill and the boat would be propelled by legging.|$|R
25|$|This link {{was made}} {{possible}} by the construction of two <b>tunnels</b> named the <b>canal</b> <b>tunnels.</b> These are about 100metres north of the Thameslink platforms, and they will join the ECML where the North London Line and HS1 go over the top.|$|R
500|$|The wheel {{was fully}} {{constructed}} and assembled at the Butterley Engineering plant in Ripley, Derbyshire. The structure was then dismantled {{in the summer}} of 2001, and transported on 35 lorry loads to Falkirk, before being reassembled into five sections on the ground and lifted into place. Construction of the canal required [...] of excavation, a [...] <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> of [...] diameter, aqueducts of [...] and , three sets of locks and a number of bridges, as well as [...] of access roads. The [...] Rough Castle Tunnel was driven in three stages, with the two upper quarters being drilled with a standard [...] excavator before the lower half was dug using a modified road planer in [...] layers. This technique was 15 per cent cheaper and reduced the build time of the tunnel by two weeks.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>canal</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{were built}} without a towpath as this {{would require a}} much larger bore, and hence cost more to build. Prior to the {{introduction}} of motorised boats, legging {{was one of the few}} options for getting a boat through such a tunnel.|$|R
2500|$|The Higham and Strood tunnel is [...] long, and was {{the second}} longest <b>canal</b> <b>tunnel</b> built in the UK (the longest is the Standedge <b>Canal</b> <b>Tunnel).</b> It was also the largest: 10.7m (35ft) high from arch to canal bed, 6.6m (21.5ft) wide at the water line, a further 1.5m (5ft) wide at towpath level, and had water 2.4m (8ft) deep.
