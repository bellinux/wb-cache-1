Two com-mon array designs are tested; they are detrimental to the P-S wavefield and provide little additional bene-fit for P-P data. The seismic data are a 3 C 2 -D line recorded at closely spaced (2 m) point receivers over the Blackfoot oil field, Alberta. The 3 <b>C</b> <b>receiver</b> ar-rays are constructed by summing five (one group in-terval) and ten (two group intervals) point receivers. The shorter array emphasizes signal preservation while the longer array places priority on noise rejection. The effectiveness of the arrays versus the single geo-phones is compared in both the t–x and f –k domains of common source gathers. The quality of poststack data is also compared by analyzing the f –x spec-tra for signal bandwidth on both the vertical receiver component (P-P) and radial receiver component (P-S) structure stacks produced using these two array design philosophies. The prestack analysis shows that the two arrays effec-tively suppress coherent noise on both the vertical and radial geophone data and perform reasonably as spa-tial antialias filters. The poststack analysis reveals that, for both the P-P and P-S data, neither of the two arrays significantly improves {{the quality of the}} final seismic im-age over that obtained from point receiver data. For the P-P data there are subtle differences between the final stacked sections, while for the P-S data there is a signifi-cant deterioration in image quality from the application of the arrays. This P-S image deterioration is attributed to significant variation of shear-wave statics across the ar-ray.

The two PRN sequences employed in L 2 C, named civil moderate (CM) and civil long (CL), have periods of 20 ms and 1. 5 s, respectively.

Three techniques, namely conventional differential combination (CDC), generalized differential combination (GDC), and modified generalized differential combination (MGDC), are investigated in terms of detection probabilities and mean acquisition time leading to the selection of MGDC as the most suitable technique for the L 2 C partial acquisition.

40|$|The {{central focus}} of the GPS {{modernization}} program is the addition of new navigation signals. L 2 C is the first modernized GPS civilian signal to become available over the full constellation by the year 2016. It has an advanced signal structure {{designed to meet the}} demands of new and more challenging application environments. Due to its imminent availability and modern code design L 2 C is likely to be a widely used GPS signal. A GPS L 2 <b>C</b> <b>receiver</b> must perform an exhaustive search to acquire the signal, due to the unusually long ranging codes used in L 2 C, consuming substantial resources at the very first stage of digital processing. Dealing with this problem is particularly important for L 2 C success in the mass market of low-cost mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs, constrained by battery power. This dissertation identifies three different approaches for saving processing resources during the L 2 C acquisition phase. The first approach focuses on the design of the local replica code to accommodate multiple searches in parallel. Several composite codes are proposed to expedite the L 2 C search and their acquisition performance is evaluated. In the second approach, down-sampling of baseband signals is investigated, to perform correlation at slower rates, saving searches in the code delay dimension whilst reducing the computations per search. A chip-wise correlation strategy is proposed where one correlation per each chip period is sufficient to accomplish a search without compromising detection performance. In the third approach, partial-period correlations are performed to save searches in the Doppler dimension and their outcomes are combined through a semi-coherent differential processing technique. The detection performance of this approach is shown to be competitive with the full-period correlation. The L 2 C signal is also the first fully accessible signal to join the legacy L 1 C/A signal to serve dual frequency civil users. In this context, two different investigations are carried out in this thesis. First, it is identified that while longer L 2 C codes might appear a straightforward decision to combat the cross-correlation interference in a dual frequency GPS L 1 /L 2 <b>C</b> <b>receiver,</b> in fact L 1 C/A is more robust in the Assisted-GPS, warm start and reacquisition scenarios. Secondly, a scheme for improving sensitivity and measurement accuracy of the L 1 carrier tracking loop by providing aiding from the L 2 C PLL is evaluated. A margin of at least 3 dB against the effects of radio frequency interference is shown to be achieved by the aided-L 1 tracking loop, while such benefits might previously have been obtained though inertial aiding...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Classification is an {{important}} technique of data mining. In this paper feature selection technique and an ensemble model is proposed to improve classification accuracy. Feature selection technique is used for selecting subset of relevant features from the data set to build robust learning models. Classification accuracy is improved by removing most irrelevant and redundant features from the dataset. Ensemble model is proposed for improving classification accuracy by combining the prediction of multiple classifiers. Three decision tree data mining classifiers CART, CHAID and QUEST are considered in this paper for classification. The ionosphere dataset investigated {{in this study is}} taken from UCI machine learning repository which is classified under two category “Bad” and “Good”. The proposed ensemble model combines the classifiers CART, CHAID and QUEST by using confidential-weighted voting scheme. A comparative study is carried on the performances of the classifiers before and after carrying out feature selection. The performance of each classifier and ensemble model is evaluated by using statistical measures like accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Gain chart and R.
