40|$|Efficiency {{in obtaining}} {{biological}} evidence is paramount in the forensic investigation of sexual assaults. The {{objective of this}} study was to quantitatively compare the cellular yield between <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> and nylon flocked swabs in post-coital samples. Swabs were used to sample dilutions of neat semen; flocked swabs yielded more spermatozoa than <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs.</b> 7 couples donated post-coital swabs: oral, dried secretions; inside/outside of a used condom. Swabs were collected at 1 -hour and 24 -hour post-coital intervals. Flocked swabs from oral samples and samples from inside a used condom yielded more spermatozoa than <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs.</b> <b>Cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> from dried secretions samples and samples from outside a used condom yielded more nucleated epithelial cells than flocked swabs. Possible explanations are the capillary action and liquid dynamics that occur when swabs absorb a sample; the fibrous matrix of <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> protects epithelial cells, and the spiral arrangement of flocked swabs release spermatozoa efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although various {{acceptable}} and easy-to-use devices {{have been used}} for saliva collection, <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> are among the most common ones. Previous studies reported that <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> yield a lower level of melatonin detection. However, this statistical method is not adequate for detecting an agreement between cotton saliva collection and passive saliva collection, and a test for bias is needed. Furthermore, the effects of <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> have not been examined at lower melatonin level, a level at which melatonin is used for assessment of circadian rhythms, namely dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). In the present study, we estimated the effect of <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> on the results of salivary melatonin assay using the Bland-Altman plot at lower level. Methods Nine healthy males were recruited and each provided four saliva samples on a single day to yield a total of 36 samples. Saliva samples were directly collected in plastic tubes using plastic straws, and subsequently pipetted onto <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> (<b>cotton</b> saliva collection) and into clear sterile tubes (passive saliva collection). The melatonin levels were analyzed in duplicate using commercially available ELISA kits. Results The mean melatonin concentration in cotton saliva collection samples was significantly lower than that in passive saliva collection samples at higher melatonin level (> 6 pg/mL). The Bland-Altman plot indicated that <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> causes relative and proportional biases in the assay results. For lower melatonin level (Conclusion Our findings indicate an interference effect of <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> on the assay result of salivary melatonin at lower melatonin level. Cotton-based collection devices might, thus, not be suitable for assessment of DLMO. </p...|$|R
25|$|Genetic {{tests are}} {{performed}} on {{a sample of}} blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. For example, a medical procedure called a buccal smear uses a small brush or <b>cotton</b> <b>swab</b> {{to collect a sample}} of cells from the inside surface of the cheek. Alternatively, a small amount of saline mouthwash may be swished in the mouth to collect the cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory where technicians look for specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, or proteins, depending on the suspected disorders, often using DNA sequencing. The laboratory reports the test results in writing to a person's doctor or genetic counselor.|$|E

Sadler dressed the wound with a <b>cotton</b> <b>swab</b> and an adhesive bandage, then completed the patrol; however, he subsequently developed a serious infection in his leg, and was evacuated to Clark Air Force Base Hospital in The Philippines. Doctors were forced to surgically enlarge the wound to drain it and to administer large doses of penicillin. Sadler returned to Fort Bragg where he made a complete recovery.|$|E
25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers {{can take}} a long time to heal, {{sometimes}} months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry <b>cotton</b> <b>swab</b> under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which is superficial cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and acetylcysteine.|$|E

50|$|It is {{generally}} advised {{not to use}} <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> (Q-Tips or <b>cotton</b> buds), as doing so will likely push the wax farther down the ear canal, and if used carelessly, perforate the eardrum. Abrasion of the ear canal, particularly after water has entered from swimming or bathing, can lead to ear infection. Also, the cotton head may fall off and become lodged in the ear canal. Therefore, <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> should be used only to clean the external ear.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that {{olfactory}} cues are important for mammalian communication. However, many specific compounds that convey information between conspecifics are still unknown. To understand mechanisms and functions of olfactory cues, olfactory signals such as volatile compounds emitted from individuals need to be assessed. Sampling of animals with and without scent glands was typically conducted using <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> rubbed over the skin or fur and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, this method has various drawbacks, including {{a high level of}} contaminations. Thus, we adapted two methods of volatile sampling from other research fields and compared them to sampling with <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs.</b> To do so we assessed the body odor of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) using <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs,</b> thermal desorption (TD) tubes and, alternatively, a mobile GC-MS device containing a thermal desorption trap. Overall, TD tubes comprised most compounds (N = 113), with half of those compounds being volatile (N = 52). The mobile GC-MS captured the fewest compounds (N = 35), of which all were volatile. <b>Cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> contained an intermediate number of compounds (N = 55), but very few volatiles (N = 10). Almost all compounds found with the mobile GC-MS were also captured with TD tubes (94 %). Hence, we recommend TD tubes for state of the art sampling of body odor of mammals or other vertebrates, particularly for field studies, as they can be easily transported, stored and analysed with high performance instruments in the lab. Nevertheless, <b>cotton</b> <b>swabs</b> capture compounds which still may contribute to the body odor, e. g. after bacterial fermentation, while profiles from mobile GC-MS include only the most abundant volatiles of the body odor...|$|R
