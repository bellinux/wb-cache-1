40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to survey {{perceptions}} of quality of (primary) health care services provided in rural communities in the Limpopo province. Ten focus groups discussions were held with community members chosen by convenience from public places from four villages in the central region of the Limpopo Province. The sample included 42 women and 34 men (76 participants). Results indicated perceived quality discussed within the following categories: (1) <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> (reception, communication, discrimination, care and compassion, respect for privacy), (2) technical care (examination, explanation of treatment, responsiveness, treatment outcomes), (3) health care facility, (4) health care organisation, (5) drugs (availability, explanation, effectiveness, payment), and (6) waiting time. The findings suggest some satisfaction with free basic and preventive health care and social services provided but there is a need to look closely into the interpersonal dimension of the services provided, provision of medication with adequate explanation to patients on the medication given, and on structural aspects, there is need for the government to give support to the clinics to provide adequate services. Improving drug availability, interpersonal skills (including attitudes towards patients) and technical care have been identified as the three main priorities for enhancing perceived quality of primary health care and health policy action...|$|E

40|$|In {{our present}} times {{the quality of}} service is beyond any doubt the most {{significant}} category in the banking sector. Focus on consumers, i. e. clients {{over the last few}} years is experiencing an expansion in the services oriented activities especially in banks. The needs of users of financial services have also experienced a dynamic change and it is necessary for the banks to develop their long-term business relationship with their clients, in order to satisfy their needs and render their own business profitable. In addition, a robust competition prevails on the banking market, and very often quality of service appears to be the competitive advantage of a bank. One of the ways to measure quality of service is also its mystery shopping. Mystery shopping is measuring the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> employed in an organisation. Bank employees are being judged during their service offering interaction. Staff employed is also the first link in the chain of communication between the client and the bank. The paper is based on the presentation of the manner in which the mystery shopping is conducted in banks, and also on the presentation of results of the mystery shopping in the major banks operating in Novi Sad. The objective of this research work is to present the significance that the mystery shopping has in banks, and the problem thus resolved is the quality of services offered in banks. Methodology applied was interviewing of the staff employed, and the research and analysis of the internal materials received from banks. We are pointing out, based on the result obtained from the research, at the ways in which mystery shopping is affecting satisfaction of clients, and the ways in which through mystery shopping the high quality of service can be achieved, the one that is beyond expectations in the banking sector. Emphasis is also made at the importance that the human factor has, i. e. staff employed as an important category in measuring quality of service offered in the banking sector. Research disclosed also the steps that should be applied in order to render mystery shopping more effective. Further research that could be conducted from the above mentioned are the financial indicators of the quality of service before the application of the mystery shopping tool and after its implementation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LLM) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The current legal {{framework}} pertaining to animals does not sufficiently address {{the welfare of}} animals. The Animal Protection Act 71 of 1962 does not specifically regulate the welfare of animals contained in research laboratories. Animals utilized for experimental research purposes endure tremendous “unnecessary suffering” due to legislative inaptitude. Experimental animals suffer inherent abuses associated with experimental research because of the methods, procedures and processes relevant to the experiments. The most controversial method of experimental research is vivisection. The method of vivisection is not only invasive but also causes “unnecessary suffering” to animals. The non-inherent abuses animals suffer during confinement in a laboratory solely relates to uncontrolled and unregulated <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff.</b> Continuing {{the application of the}} current legislative framework may also be detrimental to {{the health and well-being of}} humans. Animals are specifically utilized as objects of science in research laboratories. The data obtained from research experiments conducted on animals are for the benefit of humankind rather than the animals. Scientific research concluded that not only are invasive methods of research conducted on live animals generally regarded as useless but extrapolating data from animals to humans can also be misleading, unnecessary and dangerous. False results and questionable methodologies are some of the other problems that seem to require urgent attention. Ethically, neither human nor animal should be utilized at the expense of the other and therefore it would be reasonable to recommend that legislative reform takes place. The human perception of animals in terms of the relationship we have with them is the reason why legislative inaptitude in terms of animal welfare exists. The current approach followed is the philosophy of Utilitarianism. Utilitarians believe that neither humans nor animals have rights but interests. Utilitarianism focuses on the permissibility of an act (the use of animals) by weighing the benefits of such an act to the costs suffered because of such act. If the benefits outweigh the costs suffered, the act is permissible. The application of Utilitarianism seems to be the crux of our legislative inaptitude. The human perception and view of animals must therefore be re-directed to develop a sufficient {{legal framework}} in terms of animal welfare. A solution offered is to apply an alternative interpretation to the concept of “dignity” (capabilities approach) and progressive realisation. In terms of this solution a species capabilities in terms of its value, capabilities and worth are considered. Inherent to its value, capabilities and worth, is its “dignity”. Once the alternative interpretation of “dignity” is acknowledged, the progressive realisation of its interests can be achieved. Master...|$|E

40|$|Health - {{without a}} doubt - {{is one of the}} most {{precious}} gifts and it {{is one of the most}} important values for each of us. The human body fascinates humanity throughout its existence. Since the beginning of the first medicinal extracts to modern robotic surgery, people strive for the same - to prevent diseases, full recovery of health or to bring closer this state. The whole developed society is interested in our good health. It is necessary to ensure the functional part of the infrastructure, so called critical infrastructure. Unplanned power blackout can have disastrous consequences not only for the patients. Plenty of electrical energy is required for the functioning of hospital. The electrical network in the hospital is very fragile. It is necessary to have alternative sources of electricity in hospital. For each hospital is a priority ability to reliably protect the power grid to avoid damaging consequences of its lack. This thesis entitled "Power blackout in Jihlava hospital" focuses on the question of emergency unscheduled power blackout Hospital Jihlava, also explains the basic concepts related to this topic and describes the functioning of the hospital equipment. The theoretical part consists of several chapters which provide basic information about electricity, the electricity grid, power plants, transmission and distribution systems, principles and functioning of the hospital. There is clear description of the Maslow's pyramid of human needs, in this part is also explanation of the term "blackout" and the incidence of several serious blackouts of electricity in the Czech Republic and worldwide, experience with them and their impact on human society. The practical part is the basic characteristic of Hospital Jihlava, location of alternative sources - diesel power generators, a description of the various sources of electric power, their function and principle of functioning of Hospital Jihlava. The whole research theoretically examined the readiness Hospital Jihlava to power blackout. The basic method of investigation was to collect data that was obtained through a guided interview with the responsible employees, their answers were transcribed into text and then were analyzed risks identified by the method KARS, in order to investigate the size of the impact of the crisis situation on patients. It is assumed that it is sufficiently adequate protection against failure of the power system, that could at power interruptions, endanger patients, staff, expensive diagnostic and surgical instruments actually overall functioning of this important institution. Based on the investigation was identified the need to inform the public, staff, patients and top management. Technicians may well ensure the functioning of important machinery and equipment. Equally important is understanding of this issue by medical staff to be well versed in an emergency situation quickly. The behavior and <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> could help manage the situation without major problems and reduce imminent risk of impact on patiens and expensive instrumentation to a minimum. Also for this purpose could serve the results of this work. The aim of the thesis was to investigate the effects of a power blackout at the Hospital Jihlava on patients and suggest possible measures. The results of the survey show that a sudden power outage Hospital Jihlava presents a serious threat to its functionality, for this reason, in the final part of my thesis are presented the final recommendations, which can not only reduce the risk of impact on patients...|$|E
