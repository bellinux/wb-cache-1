Barrett suggested Nimoy for the part of Spock. He had worked with both Roddenberry and Barrett on The Lieutenant, and once Roddenberry remembered the thin features of the actor, he did not consider anyone else for the part. The remaining cast came together; filming began on November 27, 1964, and was completed on December 11. After post-production, the episode was shown to NBC executives and it was rumored that Star Trek would be broadcast at 8:00pm on Friday nights. The episode failed to impress test audiences, and after the executives became hesitant, Katz offered to make a second pilot. On March 26, 1965, NBC ordered a new episode.|$|E

2500|$|When offered, Nimoy {{accepted}} the role. However, {{he was still}} apprehensive as {{he wanted to have}} a serious acting career {{and did not want to}} be made to look foolish by playing an alien with pointy ears and other as-then undetermined makeup. When the character was included in the original 1964 pitch, Roddenberry wrote that the character was [...] "probably half Martian, he has a slightly reddish complexion and semi-pointed ears". Early versions had the character ingest energy through a plate in his stomach. Writer Samuel A. Peeples told Roddenberry these attributes made Spock too alien, and suggested [...] "he should at least be half-human and have the problems of both sides", believing the human traits made the character more interesting and able to comment on the human condition more believably. Spock's home planet was changed because Roddenberry thought if the show was a success, humans might actually walk on Mars during the series' run. The eventual logical nature of Spock was originally written into the <b>character</b> <b>Number</b> One as portrayed by Majel Barrett. It was not until the second pilot that this was included as one of Spock's traits.|$|E

50|$|Like EGA, VGA {{supports}} having up to 512 different simultaneous {{characters on}} screen, albeit in only 8 foreground colors, by rededicating one color bit {{as the highest}} bit of the <b>character</b> <b>number.</b> The glyphs on 80×25 mode are normally made of 9×16 pixels. Users may define their own character set by loading a custom font onto the card. As character data is only eight bits wide on VGA, just as on all of its predecessors, there is usually a blank pixel column between any two horizontally adjacent glyphs. However, some characters are normally made nine bits wide by repeating their last column instead of inserting a blank column, especially those defining horizontally connected IBM box-drawing characters. This functionality is hard-wired to the character numbers C0hex to DFhex, where all horizontally connecting characters are found in code page 437 and its most common derivatives. The same column-repeating trick was already used on the older MDA hardware with its 9×14 pixel glyphs, but on VGA it can be turned off when loading a font in which those character numbers do not represent box drawing characters.|$|E
