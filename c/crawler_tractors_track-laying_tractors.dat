The work is aimed at creating the method of estimation of the stress state and fatigue durability of the agricultural <b>track-laying</b> <b>tractor</b> provided with the individual elastic suspension on the stage of the design counting the conditions of the operational load. The multiversion approach to the design of the agricultural <b>track-laying</b> <b>tractor</b> frame for strength in conformity with the loading conditions has been developed. The influence of the different design diagrams of the frame on the stressed state design accuracy has been established. The estimation methods of the frames durability has been developed on the stage of the design on the base of the finite-element method designs and a priori information about statistic loading laws. Grounded have been the recommendations on application of the design method for a strength of frames of the agricultural <b>track-laying</b> <b>tractors</b> with the individual elastic suspension, on selection of the finite-element models of frames at the FEM design, on the design for a fatigue {{as well as on the}} improvement of the T- 250 tractor frame structure.

40|$|Human {{exposure}} to mechanical vibration {{may represent a}} significant risk factor for exposed workers in the agricultural sector. Also, noise in agriculture {{is one of the}} risk factors {{to be taken into account}} in the evaluation of workers’ health and safety. One of the major sources of discomfort for the workers operating a tractors is the noise to which they are exposed during work. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of {{exposure to}} whole-body vibration for the operator driving <b>track-laying</b> <b>tractors</b> in vineyard orchard and the noise level. The experimental tests were performed with six different <b>track-laying</b> <b>tractors</b> coupled with the same rototilling machine. The results showed that the vibration values of <b>track-laying</b> <b>tractors</b> coupled to rototilling machine, referred to the 8 -hour working day, were always higher than 0. 5 m s- 2, the daily exposure action value established by Directive 2002 / 44 /EC of the European Parliament. The daily noise exposure levels always exceeded the exposure limit value of 87 dB(A) established by Directive 2003 / 10 /EC of the European Parliament. The ANOVA repeated measures model showed that the factor ‘site’, namely, the soil characteristics, did not influence the vibration level on the X and Y-axes of the tractors measured, regardless of their age. In the Z-axis, the vibration level was enhanced as the soil structure increased. As tractor age increased, the influence of soil characteristics was less important. In term of the age of the tractor and the number of hours worked, it was possible to identify three risk classes, which were up to 3, 000 hours worked and offered a low risk; from 3, 000 – 6, 000 hours worked with a medium risk, and over 6, 000 hours with a high risk level...|$|R

This paper concerns the analysis of the noise risk arising from the use of a <b>track-laying</b> <b>tractor</b> during field operations carried out in the vineyard. The objective of this study was to evaluate the noise level that comes close to the ear of the operator driving the tractor measuring the values of equivalent sound level (Leq(A)) and peak sound pressure (LCpk).

40|$|Purpose of {{the paper}} – {{is to create a}} {{measuring}} complex, develop a methodology and carry out experimental investigations of curvilinear movement of the Belarus 1802 <b>crawler</b> <b>tractor.</b> The measuring complex and methodology for determination of kinematics and forced parameters of <b>crawler</b> <b>tractor</b> turning ability have been developed. Experimental investigations of curvilinear tractor movement have been carried out and they have shown that an increase in its movement speed leads to a decrease in its actual angular speed. It is explained by an increase in a radius of tractor’s turning. While increasing a speed difference of crawler a torque of a running track is increasing and a torque of a lagging track is decreasing and it even takes a negative value. Having a towed load of 20 kH a lagging track thrust force is also decreasing but it does not pass in the are of negative values, in other words, both tracks move in a traction mode. A minimal radius of tractor turning is 1. 42 m. Relative minimal kinematics radius of turning is 0. 89 m.
