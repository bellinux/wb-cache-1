First investigations in Germany and Austria show <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> (<b>r²)</b> <b>of</b> up to 0. 79 on district level. Our modeled net primary productivity is computed with the dynamic biomass model BETHY/DLR. Primarily the photosynthetic rate of vegetation types is computed with time steps of one hour and cur-rently with a spatial resolution of about 1 km x 1 km. Included models compute the water balance and radiative energy transfer between atmosphere, vegetation and soil. The model is driven by meteorological data provided by the Euro-pean Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), remote sensing data derived through SPOT-VEGETATION and soil type information by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The model output (gross primary productivity (GPP)) is calculated daily. Net primary productivity (NPP) is determined by subtracting the cumulative plant maintenance respiration from GPP. In order to validate the modeled NPP, data of crop yield estima-tions derived from national statistics are used to calculate above ground biomass by using conversion factors about corn to straw relations. Furthermore conversion factors about shoot to root relations are used to determine total bio-mass. Finally the carbon content of dry matter is estimated. With this method <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> (<b>r²)</b> <b>of</b> up to 0. 67 combined with a slope of 0. 83 are found for Germany. For Austrian NUTS- 3 units slightly higher <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> are found (0. 74) combined with a slope of 1. 08.

However, the fragility of skulls often leads to incomplete data matrices. Damaged specimens or incomplete sets of measurements are usually discarded prior to statistical analysis. We assessed the performance of two strategies that avoid elimination of observations: (1) pairwise deletion of missing cells, and (2) estimation of missing data using available measurements. The effect of these distinct approaches on the computation of inter-individual distances and population differentiation analyses were evaluated using craniometric measurements obtained from insular populations of deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845). In our simulations, Euclidean distances were greatly altered by pairwise deletion, whereas Gower's distance coefficient corrected for missing data provided accurate results.

Three levels of meatiness were assigned to three different storage conditions according to a protocol established in an EU project. Destructive measurements of the firmness, hardness, juiciness and soluble solids content of the fruit were performed. The fluorescence curves were fitted by a tenth-order polynomial and the regression coefficients were used as input parameters in quadratic discriminant analysis to assign the fruit into the different meatiness levels. The achieved classification performance was around 85 %. Based on the measured curves, different fluorescence parameters could be defined. The slope of the fluorescence curve at the origin and the normalised fluorescence at 1 ms proved to be reliable parameters to classify apples according to their meatiness level (classification performance of about 80 %). The big advantage of these parameters is their extremely short measuring time.

OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the O 2 pulse curve pattern response to a maximal cycling ramp protocol exhibits a stable linear pattern in subjects reevaluated under the same clinical conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 100 adults (80 males), mean age at baseline of 59 + 12 years, who performed two cardiopulmonary exercise testings (median interval was 15 months), for clinical and/or exercise prescription reasons.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing results and the O 2 pulse curve pattern, expressed by its slope and intercept, were compared among quintiles of relative O 2 pulse at both cardiopulmonary exercise testings.

In addition, the PLS model was successful in predicting the solubility of new congeneric test sets when solubility values of corresponding scaffolds were accessible...|$|E
40|$|Aim:  To develop {{prediction}} equations {{for total}} and regional (trunk, abdominal, arms and legs) body fat using surface anthropometric measures in children aged 6 – 17 years. Methods:  This was a cross-sectional correlation study of 70 Caucasian children aged 6 – 17 years recruited {{from a larger}} randomly sampled population-based study. The independent variables included age, mass, height, body mass index, waist and hip girth, and skinfold thicknesses at eight sites. Subscapular/triceps skinfold ratio was also calculated and entered as an independent variable. The dependent variables were total body percentage fat, and fat mass for total body, trunk, abdominal region of interest, arms and legs measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Partial least squares regression {{was used to determine}} the best predictive equation for fat percentage or fat mass in each body region in each sex. Results:  Sex-specific prediction equations were developed with high <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> (<b>r²),</b> ranging from 0. 869 to 0. 936 in boys and from 0. 900 to 0. 979 in girls, absolute bias was low, and limits of agreement were narrow. Conclusion:  Equations were developed, which were able to predict total and regional body fat of Caucasian children aged 6 – 17 years using surface anthropometric measurements with high predictive accuracy.

40|$|Allometric {{equations}} {{to estimate}} total aboveground alive biomass (B) or crown projection area (C) of ten caatinga species based on plant height (H) and/or stem diameter {{at ground level}} (DGL) or at breast height (DBH) were developed. Thirty plants of each species, covering the common range of stem diameters (3 to 50 cm), were measured (C, H, DGL, DBH), cut at the base, separated into parts, weighted and subsampled to determine dry biomass. Wood density (p) of the stem and the largest branches was determined. B, C, H and p ranged from 1 to 500 kg, 0. 2 to 112 m², 1. 3 to 11. 8 m, and 0. 45 to 1. 03 g cm- 3. Biomass of all 10 species, separately or together (excluding one cactus species), could be estimated with high <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> (<b>R²)</b> using the power equation (B = aDGLb) and DGL, DBH, H or combinations of diameter, height and density. Improvement by multiplying H and/or p to DGL or DBH was small. The mixed-species equation based only on DBH (valid up to 30 cm) had a = 0. 173 and b = 2. 295, similar to averages of these parameters {{found in the literature}} but slightly lower than most of those for humid tropical vegetation. Crown area was significantly related to diameter, height and biomass...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of Iron (Fe), As, and Cu in {{soil samples}} from the fields near the Baoshan Mine in-Hunan Province, China, were {{analyzed}} and soil spectral reflectance was measured with an ASD FieldSpec FR spectroradiometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc., USA) under laboratory condition. Partial least square regression (PLSR) models were constructed for predicting soil metal concentrations. The data pre-processing methods, first and second derivatives (FD and SD), baseline correction (BC), standard normal variate (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and continuum removal (CR), {{were used for the}} spectral reflectance data pretreatments. Then, the prediction results were evaluated by relative root mean square error (RRMSE) and <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> (<b>R(2)).</b> According to the criteria of minimal RRMSE and maximal R(2), the PLSR models with the FD pretreatment (RRMSE = 0. 24, R(2) = 0. 61), SNV pretreatment (RRMSE = 0. 08, R(2) = 0. 78), and BC-pretreatment (RRMSE = 0. 20, R(2) = 0. 41) were considered as the final models for predicting As, Fe, and Cu, respectively. Wavebands at around 460, 1400, 1900, and 2 200 nm were selected as important spectral variables to construct final models. In conclusion, concentrations of heavy metals in contaminated soils could be indirectly assessed by soil spectra according to the correlation between the spectrally featureless components and re; therefore, spectral reflectance would be an alternative tool for monitoring soil heavy metals contamination...|$|R
