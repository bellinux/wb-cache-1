40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{empirical}} comparison of various types of <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> models in predicting the timing and duration of activities. In particular, three types of models are compared: a non-competing risk model, an unconditional <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> model, and a conditional <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> model. The models are applied to an activity diary, collected in the Netherlands. The results of the comparison indicate that the conditional <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> model performs best, indicating that the choice and timing of activities depends on the nature and duration of the activity conducted previously. The specific structure of these dependent transition probabilities are discussed in detail.

40|$|Patients with {{diabetes}} {{are at high}} risk of death prior to reaching end-stage renal disease, but most models predicting the risk of kidney disease do not take this <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> into account. We aimed to compare the performance of Cox regression and <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> models for prediction of early- and late-stage renal complications in type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes participating in the observational ZODIAC study were included. Prediction models for (micro) albuminuria and 50 % increase in serum creatinine (SCr) were developed using Cox regression and <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> analyses. Model performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration. During a total follow-up period of 10 years, 183 out of 640 patients (28. 6 %) with normoalbuminuria developed (micro) albuminuria, and 22 patients (3. 4 %) died without developing (micro) albuminuria (i. e. experienced the competing event). Seventy-nine out of 1, 143 patients (6. 9 %) reached the renal end point of 50 % increase in SCr, while 219 (19. 2 %) died without developing the renal end point. Performance of the Cox and <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> models predicting (micro) albuminuria was similar and differences in predicted risks were small. However, the Cox model increasingly overestimated the risk of increase in SCr in presence of a substantial number of competing events, while the performance of the <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> model was quite good. In this study, we demonstrated that, in case of substantial numbers of competing events, it is important to account for the <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> of death in renal risk prediction in patients with type 2 diabetes...|$|R

50|$|Prostate {{specific}} antigen (PSA) based {{screening for}} prostate cancer led to earlier detection of prostate cancer (stage migration), and thus altered {{the course of the}} disease in the absence of treatment (natural history). The incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer increased with widespread PSA testing, as did the length of time that men live with their disease, as compared to the pre PSA era. The stage migration that occurred, with application of curative intervention at an earlier stage, undoubtedly led to a reduction inprostate cancer mortality. However, the extent to which this reduction was due to PSA based screening is debatable. Further, because prostate cancer progresses slowly and is found most often in older men with <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> of mortality, {{the extent to which these}} changes in natural history have resulted in benefit and harm are also debatable.|$|E
40|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{has dramatically}} increased in industrialized nations {{over the last}} 200 hundred years. The aging of populations carries over to clinical research and leads to an increasing representation of elderly and multimorbid individuals in study populations. Clinical research in these populations {{is complicated by the}} fact that individuals are likely to experience several potential disease endpoints that prevent some disease-specific endpoint of interest from occurrence. Large developments in <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> methodology have been achieved over the last decades, but we assume that recognition of <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> in the clinical community is still marginal. It is the aim of this article to address translational aspects of <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> to the clinical community. We describe clinical populations where <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> issues may arise.

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that patients enrolled in clinical trials frequently have a large degree of variation in their baseline risk for the outcome of interest. Thus, {{some have suggested that}} clinical trial results should routinely be stratified by outcome risk using risk models, since the summary results may otherwise be misleading. However, variation in <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> is another dimension of risk heterogeneity that may also underlie treatment effect heterogeneity. Understanding the effects of <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> heterogeneity may be especially important for pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials, which seek to include traditionally excluded patients, such as the elderly or complex patients with multiple comorbidities. Indeed, the observed effect of an intervention is dependent on the ratio of outcome <b>risk</b> to <b>competing</b> <b>risk,</b> and these risks – {{which may or may not}} be correlated – may vary considerably in patients enrolled in a trial. Further, the effects of <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> on treatment effect heterogeneity can be amplified by even a small degree of treatment related harm. Stratification of trial results along both the competing and the outcome risk dimensions may be necessary if pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials are to provide the clinically useful information their advocates intend. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Decision curve {{analysis}} {{is a novel}} method for evaluating diagnostic tests, prediction models and molecular markers. It combines the mathematical simplicity of accuracy measures, such as sensitivity and specificity, with the clinical applicability of decision analytic approaches. Most critically, decision curve analysis can be applied directly to a data set, and {{does not require the}} sort of external data on costs, benefits and preferences typically required by traditional decision analytic techniques. Methods In this paper we present several extensions to decision curve analysis including correction for overfit, confidence intervals, application to censored data (including <b>competing</b> <b>risk)</b> and calculation of decision curves directly from predicted probabilities. All of these extensions are based on straightforward methods that have previously been described in the literature for application to analogous statistical techniques. Results Simulation studies showed that repeated 10 -fold crossvalidation provided the best method for correcting a decision curve for overfit. The method for applying decision curves to censored data had little bias and coverage was excellent; for <b>competing</b> <b>risk,</b> decision curves were appropriately affected by the incidence of the <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> and the association between the <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> and the predictor of interest. Calculation of decision curves directly from predicted probabilities led to a smoothing of the decision curve.

30|$|The <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> model {{involves}} multiple {{failure modes}} when only the smallest failure {{time and the}} associated failure mode are observed. This model is widely studied in the medical, actuarial, biostatistics and so on, under the assumption of independent <b>competing</b> <b>risks.</b> It is common that a failure is associated {{with one of the}} several competing failure modes. Previous studies have mostly considered the competing failure modes to be independent even when the interpretation of the failure modes implies dependency. Such as, in the study of colon cancer, the failure causes were cancer recurrence or death, obviously, such failure causes were dependent [see Lin et al. (1999)]. The <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> model assuming independence among competing failure modes has been widely studied [see, e.g., Crowder (2001)]. Kundu et al.

Multiple entrance states occur frequently in many situations, but have received little attention in the literature.

40|$|Survival {{analysis}} encompasses {{investigation of}} time to event data. In most clinical studies, estimating the cumulative incidence function (or the probability of experiencing an event by a given time) is of primary interest. When the data consist of patients who experience an event and censored individuals, a nonparametric estimate of the cumulative incidence can be obtained using the Kaplan–Meier method. Under this approach, the censoring mechanism {{is assumed to be}} noninformative. In other words, the survival time of an individual (or the time at which a subject experiences an event) is assumed to be independent of a mechanism that would cause the patient to be censored. Often times, a patient may experience an event other than the one of interest which alters the probability of experiencing the event of interest. Such events are known as <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> events. In this setting, it would often be of interest to calculate the cumulative incidence of a specific event of interest. Any subject who does not experience the event of interest can be treated as censored. However, a patient experiencing a <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> event is censored in an informative manner. Hence, the Kaplan–Meier estimation procedure may not be directly applicable. The cumulative incidence function for an event of interest must be calculated by appropriately accounting for the presence of <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> events.

We determined the relationships between PA, smoking and 12 -year CV, non-CV and all-cause mortality in elderly Oslo men screened for CV disease in 1972 – 1973 and 2000. Methods: Among 14   846 men born during 1923 – 1932 and participating in 1972 – 1973, there were 5738 participants in 2000. During the 12  years follow-up 2154 died. Cox regression modelling of mortality endpoints, with and without <b>competing</b> <b>risk,</b> was applied analysing PA variables hours per week of light or vigorous PA intensity and degree of PA at leisure. Comparisons of predictive ability between PA and smoking were done by receiver operating characteristics. Results: Thirty minutes of PA per 6  days a week was associated with about 40 % mortality risk reduction. There was a 5  years increased lifetime when comparing sedentary and moderate to vigorous physically active men. Associations to CV or non-CV mortality were slightly weakened, allowing <b>competing</b> <b>risk.</b> Conditional on the prevalence of smoking and PA, the degree of PA at leisure was almost as predictive as smoking with regard to the effects on mortality.
