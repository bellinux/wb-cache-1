25|$|Hitler was {{disappointed}} with Halder's plan and initially reacted by deciding that the German army should attack early, ready or not, {{in the hope}} that Allied unreadiness might bring about an easy victory. Hitler proposed beginning the invasion on 25 October 1939 but accepted that the date was probably unrealistic. On 29 October, Halder presented another plan, Aufmarschanweisung N°2, Fall Gelb, featuring a secondary attack on the Netherlands. On 5 November, Hitler informed Walther von Brauchitsch that he intended the invasion to begin on 12 November. Brauchitsch replied that the military had yet to recover from the Polish campaign and offered to resign; this was refused but two days later Hitler postponed the attack, giving poor weather as the reason for the delay. More postponements followed, as commanders persuaded Hitler to delay the attack for a few days or weeks, to remedy some <b>critical</b> <b>defect</b> in the preparations or to wait for better weather. Hitler also tried to alter the plan, which he found unsatisfactory; his weak understanding of how poorly prepared Germany was for war and how it would cope with losses of armoured vehicles were not fully considered. Though Poland had been quickly defeated, many armoured vehicles had been lost and were hard to replace. This eventually resulted in a dispersion of the German effort; although the main attack would remain in central Belgium, secondary attacks would be undertaken on the flanks. Hitler made such a suggestion on 11 November, pressing for an early attack on unprepared targets.|$|E

However, they were issued to the new third siege company and used for annual practice where numerous defects became clear. Minor modifications were made but the <b>critical</b> <b>defect,</b> no elevation below 42 degrees, giving a high trajectory, made accurate fire impossible with the methods of the time.

50|$|The process {{above is}} {{extremely}} important in case the organization is looking to start implementing RBT and to continually improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process.Measuring the test coverage is done by dividing the amount of defects found by the testing provider {{with the amount of}} defects found by the users of the system. Since critical defects carry a different importance to the organization versus less severe defects, each defect is multiplied by its severity. For example, assuming a scale of 1-5 is used, a <b>critical</b> <b>defect</b> (severity = 5) will be counted {{in the same way as}} 5 minor defects (severity = 1).|$|E

Zurek was awarded the Albert Einstein Professorship Prize by the Foundation of the University of Ulm in Germany in 2010. Zurek with his colleague Tom W. B. Kibble pioneered a paradigmatic framework for understanding defect generation in non-equilibrium processes, particularly, for understanding topological defects generated when a second-order phase transition point is crossed at a finite rate. The paradigm covers phenomena of enormous varieties and scales, ranging from structure formation in the early Universe to vortex generation in superfluids. The key mechanism of <b>critical</b> <b>defect</b> generation {{is known as the}} Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and the resulting scaling laws as the Kibble-Zurek scaling laws.|$|E
50|$|Electroporation is a {{multi-step}} {{process with}} several distinct phases. First, a short electrical pulse must be applied. Typical parameters would be 300-400 mV for < 1 ms across the membrane (note- the voltages used in cell experiments are typically much larger {{because they are}} being applied across large distances to the bulk solution so the resulting field across the actual membrane {{is only a small}} fraction of the applied bias). Upon application of this potential the membrane charges like a capacitor through the migration of ions from the surrounding solution. Once the critical field is achieved there is a rapid localized rearrangement in lipid morphology. The resulting structure is believed to be a “pre-pore” since it is not electrically conductive but leads rapidly to the creation of a conductive pore. Evidence for the existence of such pre-pores comes mostly from the “flickering” of pores, which suggests a transition between conductive and insulating states. It has been suggested that these pre-pores are small (~3 Å) hydrophobic defects. If this theory is correct, then the transition to a conductive state could be explained by a rearrangement at the pore edge, in which the lipid heads fold over to create a hydrophilic interface. Finally, these conductive pores can either heal, resealing the bilayer or expand, eventually rupturing it. The resultant fate depends on whether the <b>critical</b> <b>defect</b> size was exceeded which in turn depends on the applied field, local mechanical stress and bilayer edge energy.|$|E

It will be shown how these <b>critical</b> <b>defects</b> can be avoided by optimizing the epitaxial growth of the active device volume. Furthermore, it will be proven that the absence of <b>critical</b> <b>defects</b> in the device prevents bipolar degradation.

30|$|Importantly, periosteal repair is least {{successful}} {{when the}} fracture ends form a “cap” by migrating inwards.

40|$|Although most {{fractures}} heal, <b>critical</b> <b>defects</b> in bone fail due to aberrant {{differentiation of}} mesenchymal stem cells towards fibrosis rather than osteogenesis. While conventional bioengineering solutions {{to this problem}} have focused on enhancing angiogenesis, which is required for bone formation, {{recent studies have shown}} that fibrotic non-unions are associated with arteriogenesis {{in the center of the}} defect and accumulation of mast cells around large blood vessels. Recently, recombinant parathyroid hormone (rPTH; teriparatide; Forteo) therapy have shown to have anti-fibrotic effects on non-unions and <b>critical</b> bone <b>defects</b> due to inhibition of arteriogenesis and mast cell numbers within the healing bone. As this new direction holds great promise towards a solution for significant clinical hurdles in craniofacial reconstruction and limb salvage procedures, this work reviews the current state of the field, and provides insights as to how teriparatide therapy could be used as an adjuvant for healing <b>critical</b> <b>defects</b> in bone. Finally, as teriparatide therapy is contraindicated in the setting of cancer, which constitutes a large subset of these patients, we describe early findings of adjuvant therapies that may present future promise by directly inhibiting arteriogenesis and mast cell accumulation at the defect site...|$|R

30|$|This {{research}} {{is not without}} limitations. (1) Biomechanical testing was done only at week  5. Since there is no universal definition of nonunions, {{it has been suggested}} that they should not be defined arbitrarily in terms of duration, but rather as the ending of the intramembranous healing response [13]. Since the <b>critical</b> <b>defects</b> had “capped” fracture ends, displayed characteristics of true atrophic nonunion, and did not possess any measurable strength even at 5  weeks, we suggest that it is highly unlikely that the <b>critical</b> <b>defects</b> would heal at any later time point, thereby becoming established nonunions. (2) It can be argued that the transgenic manipulation of the mice used in this study could have affected the healing properties. While in most cases a reporter does not have an impact on development and healing, this is still an open question. Since these changes are not readily predictable and highly variable, it will take proper controls in the future to understand their impact, if any, on healing.|$|R

40|$|An {{approximate}} {{method is}} proposed {{to calculate the}} EUV scattering from a defect within a multilayer coating. In this single surface approximation (SSA) the defective multilayer structure {{is replaced by a}} single reflecting surface with the shape of the top surface of the multilayer. The range of validity of this approximation has been investigated for Gaussian line defects using 2 D finite-difference-time-domain simulations. The SSA is found to be valid for sufficiently low aspect ratio defects such as those expected for the <b>critical</b> <b>defects</b> nucleated by particles on the mask substrate. The <b>critical</b> EUVL <b>defect</b> size is calculated by combining the SSA with a multilayer growth model and aerial image simulations. Another approximate method for calculating the aerial image of an unresolved defect is also discussed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{finite-element method}} {{has been used}} to study the thermal stress {{distribution}} in large-sized sapphire crystals grown with the sapphire growth technique with micro-pulling and shoulder-expanding at cooled center (SAPMAC) method. A <b>critical</b> <b>defect</b> model has been established to explain the growth and propagation of cracks during the sapphire growing process. It is demonstrated that the stress field depends on the growth rate, the ambient temperature and the crystallizing direction. High stresses always exist near the growth interfaces, at the shoulder-expanding locations, the tailing locations and the sites where the diameters undergo sharp changes. The maximum stresses always occur at the interface of seeds and crystals. Cracks often form in the <b>critical</b> <b>defect</b> region and spread in the m-planes and a-planes under applied tensile stresses during crystal growth. The experimental results have verified that with the improved system of crystal growth and well-controlled techniques, the large-sized sapphire crystals of high quality can be grown due to absence of cracks...|$|E

METHODS: Eighteen rats Wistar {{were divided}} into three groups of six animals each according {{to the time of}} evaluation (15, 30 and 60 days). One calvarium defect of 5 mm was made in the parietal bone of each animal under general anesthesia. After the time of evaluation, the animals were killed, when the bone was histological studied and classified according to the type of tissue found: fibrosis or bone. RESULTS: The results showed that in the group of 15 days, in five animals there was only fibrosis. In the group of 30 days, the process of regeneration was growing and in four animals was found bone, in three with partial filling and in the other one with complete filling of the defect. In the group of 60 days, out of the three animals with bone, two had a complete filling of the defect. CONCLUSIONS: There was no bone regeneration in <b>critical</b> <b>defects</b> in 15 days.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare and evaluate, through histomorphometric and {{radiological}} analysis, the effects of UV photofunctionalization on an implant placed over a <b>critical</b> <b>defect</b> area with and without a bone graft. Four female beagle dogs were first divided into control and bone graft groups. Each group was then subdivided into UV-treated and UV-untreated groups. The mandibular premolars in each dog were extracted. 12 weeks after extraction, implants were placed according to the condition of each group. Four and 12 weeks after implantation on left and right mandible, the dogs were sacrificed. The specimens were prepared for histomorphometric and micro-computed tomographic analysis. In both 4 -week and 12 -week groups, UV-treated implant surfaces showed better osseointegration than SA implant surfaces. Also, with implant surfaces placed over the <b>critical</b> <b>defect</b> with bone graft, UV photofunctionalization increased bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and new bone formation at the initial stage (4 weeks). Based on the results of this study, it can be suggested that UV photofunctionalization on the surface of implants placed over large critical defects with bone graft aids initial osseointegration and osteogenesis...|$|E
