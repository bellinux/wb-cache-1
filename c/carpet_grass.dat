500|$|When not breeding, the Fiji parrotfinch is gregarious, and {{is usually}} found in small flocks of up to six birds. It feeds on seeds, usually at the [...] "milk" [...] (watery ripe) stage. A {{favourite}} is the Guinea grass, Megathyrsus maximus. The finch will also take seed from rice ears, and its spread into gardens has been aided by another preferred food plant, <b>carpet</b> <b>grass,</b> Axonopus compressus, which is a common lawn grass in Fiji. This finch readily takes insects, often extracted from under loose bark or tree crevices. It also feeds on nectar and small berries.

5000|$|Agriculture takes {{much of the}} area’s workforce, {{employing}} 35.5%. Most of this is {{the growing}} of corn and beans for auto consumption. Indigenous homes mostly work with subsistence agriculture and some cattle raising, supplemented by seasonal labor and trade. Crops also include sugar cane, mangos, tomatoes, chili peppers, citrus fruits and <b>carpet</b> <b>grass.</b> The main cash crop for export is tobacco, which employs between 6,000 and 9,000 people per year. By far, the most of the livestock raised in the region is meat and dairy cattle, even though this production is less than four percent of the total for Veracruz.

40|$|Abstract: Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) {{has been}} widely {{confirmed}} to have very strong tolerance to flooding and even complete submergence and, therefore, is a considerably excellent species for stabilization and revegetation of “wet ” barren slopes and for wastewater treatment. However, it is poorly documented why vetiver is so tolerant to submergence. To understand the mechanisms of vetiver’s tolerance to submergence, an experiment was conducted to examine ecophysiological, biochemical, and anatomical characteristics of vetiver leaves under submergence compared to other three grasses, St. Augustine (Stenotaphrum secundatum), <b>carpet</b> <b>grass</b> (Axonopus compressus), and bahia grass (Paspalum notatum). After stressed by submergence, the contents of photosynthetic pigments of St. Augustine and <b>carpet</b> <b>grass</b> decreased while those of vetiver and bahia grass increased from 18 - to 54 -day submergence, especially for vetiver, its chl(a+b) and car/chl increased by 63. 9 % and 72. 8 %, respectively. Within 36 d submergence, Fv/Fm and _PS _ of St. Augustine and <b>carpet</b> <b>grass</b> declined distinctly, but those of vetiver and bahia grass only declined slightly. This suggests that the latter two grasses were influenced very little with special reference to their photosynthetic apparatus; therefore their photosynthesi...|$|E

40|$|Soil erosion has causes {{serious problem}} in {{damaging}} the soil productivity at oil palm plantation especially at hilly area. This research was conducted to find another alternative to control soil erosion instead using Legume Cover Crop (LCe) such as Mucuna braceata. The purpose of this research project {{is to determine the}} best soil cover practices in controlling soil erosion at hilly area on oil palm plantation. Three treatments were used for this project; <b>Carpet</b> <b>grass</b> (Axonopus compressus), plant residue and bare soil (control). Three criteria were tested to determine the most effective soil cover; firstly by measuring the amount of eroded sediment, secondly by determining the volume of runoff water and lastly by measuring the nutrients loss from soil eroded. The test was run with a 15 degree slope gradient stand-up apparatus by using watering can with four liter of water. Data of amount eroded sediment and volume runoff water were collected once the test was finished. The eroded sediment will then be brought to a laboratory for soil analysis and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) to determine the nutrient loss from the soil erosion. The research project results shows that, <b>Carpet</b> <b>grass</b> gave the lowest amount of eroded sediment with average mean 6. 47 g, lowest volume of runoff water with average mean 1246. 4 mL and less nutrients loss (phosphorus with average mean 611. 22 mg/Kg and potassium with 48. 27 mg/Kg) in soil compared to plant residue and bare soil. This result has proved that applying <b>carpet</b> <b>grass</b> as soil cover can help in reducing the soil erosion and nutrient loss. Therefore, it is recommended to use <b>carpet</b> <b>grass</b> for controlling soil erosion at hilly area...|$|E

A study of land treatment system was conducted to treat and utilize nitrogen in treated wastewater from the {{concentrated latex}} factory. The experimental pilot-scale land treatment system was constructed at the Faculty of Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai Campus. It consisted of water convolvulus (Ipomea aquatica, I.

40|$|Biological (or biotechnical) {{stabilization}} of banks {{based on the}} stabilization effect of grass has a fundamental disadvantage for reinforcement constructions {{and that is the}} delay in their functionality. It starts to be functional only several weeks after the sowing and its full function can be usually guaranteed for as late as the following vegetation period. Moreover, <b>grass</b> <b>carpets</b> on slopes forming banks of watercourses are damaged by erosion caused by the flow of water in the watercourse but also water flowing down the slopes. Other damage is inflicted by “trampling”, i. e. the damage caused by the movement of people (anglers, rowers, hikers, etc.). This can be prevented to a degree by pre-grown <b>grass</b> <b>carpets.</b> These will bring about the stabilization effect sooner but the resistance of a pre-grown <b>grass</b> <b>carpet</b> is finally the same as when a suitable grass mixture is sown. Therefore, in need of functional reinforcement significantly more resistant than a <b>grass</b> <b>carpet,</b> mostly stone or gravel riprap on the slope above the stabilization toe is designed. The aim of the presented paper is to inform the professional public on the results of a design and a following application of a pre-grown stabilization reinforced <b>grass</b> <b>carpet</b> which, as stated by the producers, manifests a considerably higher efficiency against damage caused by water and trampling.

The ratio between shear strength of the grass cover and its subsoil layer would get a value of two to distinguish the first two manners and would be zero for the last one.

This paper investigates how grass covered slopes perform when {{being attacked by}} overtopping flow during storm surges. Based on observations during a number of simulator tests, damage is classified into three types 'head-cut', 'roll-up' and 'collapse' depending on the combination of grass, material components and corresponding layer thickness. To quantitatively predict the potential types, strength ratio and thickness ratio are proposed. Besides, erosion usually starts at weak spots so their spatial distributions are evaluated along dike stretches with various lengths. Finally, the overtopping resistance of a grass turf is presumably represented by critical velocities depending on soil cohesion and apparent cohesion induced by roots. The computed results are comparable to erosion on Bermuda and <b>Carpet</b> <b>grass</b> slopes tested with the simulator. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
