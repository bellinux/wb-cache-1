50|$|IBM 3270-type <b>console</b> <b>keyboards</b> of the IBM System/370 {{mainframe}} computer, {{created in}} 1970, had an operator interrupt key {{that was used}} to cause the operating system such as VM/370 or MVS to allow the console to give input to the operating system.|$|R
50|$|When the {{internal}} {{fabric of the}} church was redecorated in 1928, the organ was restored and improved. Most of the 1899 pipe-work was re-incorporated to provide a summary of 29 speaking stops, 2 tremulants and 19 couplers, with a new electro-pneumatic action and the original four-manual <b>console</b> (<b>keyboards)</b> as before.|$|R
5000|$|In any organ, each pipe has a valve {{located at}} its foot which {{responds}} to the organist's commands from the <b>console's</b> <b>keyboard,</b> pedalboard and stop controls. These valves are contained in windchests upon which the organ's pipework is set. Any type of apparatus that connects an organ's console with its windchest {{is referred to as}} its [...] "action". An organ that utilizes tubular-pneumatic action is commonly called a [...] "tubular-pneumatic organ".|$|R

Developed in 1998 by Fredrik Hubinette, based on source code from x2x and VNC.|$|E
50|$|Local remote KVM device design {{allows users}} to control {{computer}} equipment up to 1000 ft away from the user <b>consoles</b> (<b>keyboard,</b> monitor and mouse). They always need direct cable connection from the computer to the KVM switch to the console and include support for standard category 5 cabling between computers and users interconnected by the switch device. In contrast, USB powered KVM devices are able to control computer equipment {{using a combination of}} USB, keyboard, mouse and monitor cables of up to 5 m.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were a few}} holdovers {{from the}} days of the System/32 (the [...] "Bionic Desk" [...] of 1975): the <b>KEYBOARD,</b> <b>CONSOLE,</b> and DISPLAY files which {{provided}} unformatted access to the monitor and <b>keyboard.</b> (<b>CONSOLE</b> came from the System/3 days). Clever System/36 programmers could use a KEYBOARD file to accept commands from the procedure (the [...] "system input file") meaning that a program could be customized at run time without a recompilation.|$|R
50|$|Dat'r {{incorporates}} {{many different}} types of electronic instruments (game <b>console</b> joysticks, laptops, <b>keyboards)</b> and percussive instruments (shakers, cymbals, tambourines) into their energetic live performances. The duo performed at the 2007 annual PDX Pop Now! Festival in Portland.|$|R
50|$|The DRAC {{provides}} {{remote access}} to the system <b>console</b> (<b>keyboard</b> and screen) allowing the system BIOS to be accessed over the Internet when the server is rebooted. This is done by configuring the system BIOS to send its output to a serial port (as a stream of text using VT100-compatible control codes.) The chosen serial port is then redirected to the DRAC's serial port. Users can then log into the DRAC via SSH and run a command to connect the SSH session to the serial port, thus allowing the console to be accessed over the Internet.|$|E
50|$|The {{best known}} {{hardware}} (due to its low price and broad distribution) was the TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo) and the similar Dragon series. Even on the CoCo, a quite minimalist hardware platform, {{it was possible}} under OS-9/6809 Level One {{to have more than}} one interactive user running concurrently (for example, one on the <b>console</b> <b>keyboard,</b> another in the background, and perhaps a third interactively via a serial connection) as well as several other non-interactive processes. A second processor implementation for the BBC Micro was produced by Cumana. It included on-board RAM, SASI hard disk interface and a MC68008 processor.|$|E
50|$|The Atari XE Video Game System (Atari XEGS) is a {{home video}} game console {{released}} by Atari Corporation in 1987. Based on Atari's 8-bit 65XE computer, the XEGS {{is compatible with the}} existing Atari 8-bit computer software library. Additionally, it is able to operate as either a stand-alone console or full computer with the addition of its specially designed keyboard. In computer mode, it may utilize the majority of peripherals released for Atari's 8-bit computer line. Atari packaged the XEGS as a basic set consisting of only the console and joystick, and as a deluxe set consisting of the <b>console,</b> <b>keyboard,</b> joystick and light gun.|$|E
50|$|Proteus was {{initially}} {{created as a}} multiplatform (DOS, Windows, Unix) system utility, to manipulate text and binary files and to create CGI scripts. The language was later focused on Windows, byadding hundreds of specialized functions for: network and serial communication, database interrogation, system service creation, <b>console</b> applications, <b>keyboard</b> emulation, ISAPI scripting (for IIS).Most of these additional functions are only available in the Windows flavour of the interpreter, even though a Linuxversion is still available.|$|R
50|$|In {{the rear}} {{wall of the}} apse is a pipe organ built in 1938 by Mascioni. The organ has a fully {{electric}} drive. Its <b>console</b> has three <b>keyboards</b> with 61 notes each and a concave-radial pedalboard with 32 notes.|$|R
50|$|Introduced {{with the}} System/370 in 1971, the IBM 129 {{was capable of}} punching, verifying, and use as an auxiliary, on line, 80 column card reader/punch for some computers. A switch on the <b>keyboard</b> <b>console</b> {{provided}} the ability to toggle between the punch and verify modes.|$|R
5000|$|By convention, buffers are {{preceded by}} a word count. The [...] assembles a count word and the {{following}} [...] reserves the required number of words for the buffer. The card buffer requires 80 words, one for each card column. Driver CARD0 reads each card column literally, using 12 of the 16 bits in the buffer word to describe {{whether there is a}} punch in the corresponding row for that column. The pattern of punches typically describes a text character using the Hollerith code. The <b>console</b> <b>keyboard</b> also gives input to the program in the Hollerith code, the only case of two devices using the same character encoding.|$|E
50|$|Early 3270s offered {{three types}} of keyboards. The {{typewriter}} keyboard came in both a 66 key version, with no programmed function (PF) keys, and a 78 key version with twelve. Both versions had two program attention (PA) keys. The data entry keyboard had five PF keys and two PA keys. The operator <b>console</b> <b>keyboard</b> had twelve PF keys and two PA keys. Later 3270s had twenty-four PF keys and three PA keys. When one of these keys is pressed, it will cause its control unit to generate an I/O interrupt to the host computer and present a special code identifying which key was pressed. Application program functions such as termination, page-up, page-down, or help can be invoked by a single key press, thereby reducing the load on very busy processors.|$|E
50|$|Their modern use {{may have}} been popularized by IBM keyboards: first the IBM 3270 terminals, then the IBM PC. IBM use of {{function}} keys dates to the IBM 3270 line of terminals, specifically the IBM 3277 (1972) with 78-key typewriter keyboard or operator <b>console</b> <b>keyboard</b> version, which both featured 12 programmed function (PF) keys in a 3×4 matrix {{at the right of}} the keyboard. Later models replaced this with a numeric keypad, and moved the function keys to 24 keys {{at the top of the}} keyboard. The original IBM PC keyboard (PC/XT, 1981) had 10 function keys (F1-F10) in a 2×5 matrix at the left of the keyboard; this was replaced by 12 keys in 3 blocks of 4 at the top of the keyboard in the Model M ("Enhanced", 1984).|$|E
50|$|DSLinux runs a {{modified}} version of the μClinux kernel, and is based on uCLinux 2.6.14 (Linux-2.6.14-hsc0). It only runs in textmode and nano-x which is displayed using a custom framebuffer <b>console</b> driver. A <b>keyboard</b> is displayed on the touchscreen of the Nintendo DS to allow user input.|$|R
50|$|The 12 bit {{instrument}} was {{more advanced than}} the 8 bit prototype, and was enclosed in a stylishly modern plastic case with a futuristic touch-sensitive <b>console</b> above the <b>keyboard.</b> It was small and light {{enough to be a}} practical performance instrument. It is still in Coupland's possession.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{versions}} of Microsoft BASIC-80 that were customized by home computer manufacturers {{to use the}} particular hardware features of the computer, MBASIC relied only on the CP/M operating system calls for all input and output. Only the CP/M <b>console</b> (screen and <b>keyboard),</b> line printer, and disk devices were available.|$|R
5000|$|During this time, another design idea called EvStack {{also added}} to the flamewar. EvStack was a pretty much {{complete}} redesign of the input and output subsystem that allowed for events (thus the [...] "Ev") to flow through a [...] "Stack" [...] of modules that can be configured to manipulate them. EvStack {{is a very powerful}} concept, allowing e.g. to have two keyboards attached to the same machine, one operating a text console on one graphics adapter and one operating a graphics console on the other (as was demonstrated on the Linux-Kongreß ´97) and even allows for having different keyboard layouts on different virtual consoles or attaching keyboards via network. However this came at the price of a huge patch to the input subsystem which did not seem acceptable. The modern Linux input event system allows programs (e.g. Xorg) to receive keyboard events other than through the <b>console</b> <b>keyboard,</b> allowing multiseat operation.|$|E
50|$|A memory card, {{flash card}} or memory {{cartridge}} is an electronic flash memory data storage device used for storing digital information. These {{are commonly used}} in portable electronic devices, such as digital cameras, mobile phones, laptop computers, tablets, PDAs, portable media players, video game <b>consoles,</b> synthesizers, electronic <b>keyboards,</b> and digital pianos.|$|R
50|$|Not {{strictly}} an operating system, the MGR windowing system run under 1616/OS, but usurped the <b>console</b> video and <b>keyboard,</b> and added virtual tty devices for each window. The MGR port required a video hack {{to add a}} higher resolution but monochrome video mode; this was done by replacing a PAL in the video circuit.|$|R
50|$|The SRM console {{is capable}} of display on either a {{graphical}} adapter (such as a PCI VGA card) or, if no graphical <b>console</b> and/or local <b>keyboard</b> is detected, on a serial connection to a VT100-compatible terminal. In this way the SRM console {{is similar to the}} Open Firmware used in SPARC and Apple PowerMac computers, for example.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{components}} of a photosynthetic system are the leaf chamber, infrared gas analyzer (IRGA), batteries and a <b>console</b> with <b>keyboard,</b> display and memory. Modern 'open system' photosynthesis systems also incorporate miniature disposable compressed gas cylinder and gas supply pipes. This is because external air has natural fluctuations in [...] and water vapor content, which can introduce measurement noise. Modern 'open system' photosynthesis systems remove the [...] and water vapour by passage over soda lime and Drierite, then add [...] at a controlled rate to give a stable [...] concentration. Some systems are also equipped with temperature control and a removable light unit, so {{the effect of these}} environmental variables can also be measured.|$|R
50|$|The V.Smile PC Pal variant <b>console</b> and Smart <b>Keyboard</b> {{accessory}} faces direct {{competition with}} Leapfrog's ClickStart educational computer offering, and indirect competition with various toy educational laptops and low cost desktop PCs with children software and child-friendly accessories installed. While the V.Smile smartbook console may face {{competition from the}} Sega Pico due to the similarity of the concepts, the Sega Pico has not been available outside Japan for a long time.|$|R
50|$|A five-section organ (grande organ, positive, recitative, {{solo and}} echo) {{actioned}} by a <b>console</b> of five <b>keyboards</b> and pedals is {{installed in the}} choir. It has 152 registers and approximately 12,000 lead, tin and wood tubes, with the largest 11 m in height and the smallest 9 mm. Initially, the organ was divided into its five parts and dispersed within the basilica, but it was re-formed in 1962 and installed in its present location.|$|R
5000|$|Cybernaughts {{are human}} beings who utilize {{interface}} technologies. The simplest representation of the concept are the maimed people who have installed mechanical [...] "limbs" [...] or sensor [...] "eyes" [...] to replace the ones they have lost or sickly people who implant mechanical devices to replace failed or failing internal organs. The more complex concept extends to the interface technologies that allow a user to interact with a system indirectly (via <b>keyboards,</b> <b>consoles,</b> or Etheric gauntlets) or directly (via an Etherjack implant).|$|R
40|$|Navigating virtual environments usually {{requires}} a wired interface, game <b>console,</b> or <b>keyboard.</b> The advent of perceptual interface techniques allows a new option: the passive and untethered sensing of users' pose and gesture {{to allow them}} maneuver through and manipulate virtual worlds. We describe new algorithms for interacting with 3 -D environments using real-time articulated body tracking with standard cameras and personal computers. Our method is based on rigid stereo-motion estimation algorithms and uses a linear technique for enforcing articulation constraints. With our tracking system users can navigate virtual environments using 3 -D gesture and body poses. We analyze the space of possible perceptual interface abstractions for full-body navigation, and present a prototype system based on these results. We finally describe an initial evaluation of our prototype system with users guiding avatars {{through a series of}} 3 -D virtual game worlds...|$|R
5000|$|One wing of {{the stage}} group was {{constructed}} to house the organ. This concrete chamber is divided into four separate sections or sub-chambers. Two of these house the organ proper. The openings, for tone egress, are filled with bronze screens, back of which are the expression shutters for the various departments, and, in addition, there have been provided rolling steel shutters to fully protect the organ from the weather. In a third room is located the large electric blower ... to which is directly connected the low voltage compound electric generator which produces the current for the organ action ... The <b>console,</b> or <b>keyboard,</b> is of movable type, permanently mounted, together with the player's bench, on a special platform on rollers... When the organ is not in use, the entire console unit is housed in the fourth chamber.|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from early}} hobbyist/kit/home {{computers}} and some video game <b>consoles,</b> membrane-based QWERTY <b>keyboards</b> {{are used in}} some industrial computer systems, and are also found as portable, even [...] "rollable-collapsible" [...] designs for PDAs and other pocket computing devices. Smaller, specialised membrane keyboards, typically numeric-and-a-few-control-keys only, {{have been used in}} access control systems (for buildings and restricted areas), simple handheld calculators, domestic remote control keypads, microwave ovens, and other similar devices where the amount of typing is relatively small or infrequent, such as cell phones.|$|R
5000|$|Trinity, {{having been}} built on the New Haven Green, has always been limited in its {{possibilities}} for expansion by a legal restriction to within [...] "two ox carts" [...] from the outside wall of the church - about 3.8 meters or 12.4 feet. In 1961 and 1962, during the tenure of the Rev. C. Lawson Willard, 1940-70, in an event called [...] "The Big Dig", the church was substantially enlarged by digging out under the church floor to create not a crypt or basement, but an English-inspired undercroft with choir rooms, classrooms, toilet rooms, a kitchen and meeting hall. Two-story towers were also added {{at this time to}} provide exits {{on either side of the}} chancel including, as well, four small rooms for church use. Two more bells were added to the tower in 1957 with a bell <b>console</b> small <b>keyboard</b> installed adjacent to the organ console.|$|R
