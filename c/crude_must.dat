40|$|Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GF-AAS) {{technique}} {{had been}} widely {{used for the}} determination of trace metals because of its high sensitivity. However, when this technique is applied for metals in organic samples such as crude oil, inconsistent reading were obtained due to smoke produced during the heating program which in turn interfere light absorption by the analyte. As such, organic components of the <b>crude</b> <b>must</b> first be removed to obtain a more accurate analysis of the metal analyte. This study evaluates the use of different acid combinations such as H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 /H 2 O 2, HCl/HNO 3, HNO 3 /H 2 O 2, H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 /HCl for the decomposition of crude oil for the determination of nickel, chromium and vanadium. First, the temperature for GF-AAS analysis was optimized. The optimum drying, pyrolysis and atomization temperature for Ni were 110, 1000, and 2600 oC, while for vanadium were 110, 1100 and 2650 oC, and for Cr were 110, 1650 and 2500 oC respectively. The results show that vanadium concentrations in crude oil were 10. 60 ± 4. 28 µg/g, 32. 95 ± 10. 00 µg/g and 26. 31 ± 10. 90 µg/g after being digested using H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 /H 2 O 2, H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 /HCl and H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 respectively [...] The concentration of nickel using the acid combination of H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 /HCl, H 2 SO 4 /HNO 3 and HNO 3 /H 2 O 2 are 35. 27 ± 2. 40 µg/g, 12. 35 ± 7. 19 µg/g and 37. 61 ± 0. 85 µg/g respectively.

However, I have been persuaded by friends who are better acquainted with the literary world than myself to write an account of my travels in a country so little known to the ordinary traveller as Northern Queensland.

40|$|Evidence {{to support}} or deny {{expectations}} of future scarcity or abundance of <b>crude</b> oil <b>must</b> show whether <b>crude</b> oil supply functions are shifting and, if so, in what direction. The authors estimate oil supply functions for 41 countries for which suitable data are available. Because {{of the poor}} quality of data, especially for reserves, the model specification is simple. Their model relates reserve additions to the imputed"in situ"price of discovered but undeveloped reserves and {{to the passage of}} time. The passage of time is a surrogate for measuring the net impact on supply conditions of the chance of finding oil, resource depletion, cost efficiency, and technology. Time's impact could be expansionary or contractionary. They test two main versions of the model, one a straightforward linear function, the other nonlinear, assuming decreasing returns. Both models yield similar results. In most cases the models fit the data reasonably closely, after adjustment for outliers. The complete model results show 26 countries with statistically significant shifts in supply functions -in almost equal parts expansionary and contractionary. The shift is often contractionary in countries with a long production history (including Burma, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States). Some are OPEC countries, to which a model specification involving market price response does not properly apply. Tests on a small sample of countries for differences between earlier and later periods reveal limited evidence of an expansionary shift from 1980 onward. There is partial evidence that lower oil prices stimulate productivity. The authors suggest that a gloomy outlook for non-OPEC supply is unwarranted. Several countries are still in an expansionary phase. Others show no evidence of entering a period of decline. And countries in a contractionary phase will continue to add to reserves. Further research requires improving the database rather than employing more elaborate models.

The substrates analyzed were used restaurant oil (yellow grease) and animal fat (white grease) derived crude glycerol from biodiesel production, and sweet sorghum juice. Crude glycerol is the primary by-product from biodiesel production - 0. 66 lb is generated for each gallon of biodiesel produced. The crude glycerol can be purified and used in food, chemical, drug, and other industries. Purification however, is an expensive and complicated process therefore other economical uses of <b>crude</b> glycerol <b>must</b> be identified such as the one described in this study - fermentation of crude glycerol via S. limacinum SR 21 to produce lipids which then serve as biodiesel feedstocks. Sweet sorghum juice is harvested from the sweet sorghum plant, a C 4 plant possessing high photosynthetic efficiency and high sugar yield including glucose, sucrose, and fructose. The juice is typically used for white sugar production, but may be a good substitution for common substrates used in lipid production via S. limacinum SR 21. S. limacinum SR 21 is a fast growing microalga capable of accumulating large quantities of lipids, which have applications in human health products, biodiesel, and animal feed. In separate batch studies, S. limacinum SR 21 was grown on each substrate and monitored. On crude glycerol derived from yellow grease, 25 and 35 g/l were the optimal doses for untreated and treated crude glycerol, respectively. Biomass dry weights of 8. 3 and 11. 3 g/l were attained for these doses, respectively. The highest crude lipid content of all doses, 73. 3 %, was with 35 g/l treated crude glycerol. Crude glycerol derived from animal fats also provided similar results to these. S. limacinum SR 21 grown on sweet sorghum juice furnished similar biomass density and lipid content. The optimum does of 50 % juice produced a biomass dry weight of 9. 4 g/l and 73. 4 % lipid content. While biomass dry weight was lower than that grown on glucose (10. 9 g/l), lipid content was higher than typical values (50 %). Of the three sugars, only glucose was utilized for growth. The remaining medium may still be used for white sugar production since fructose and sucrose were not consumed. Both crude glycerol and sweet sorghum juice caused substrate inhibition at high doses, and presence of methanol in crude glycerol presented an additional prohibitory effect on cell growth. Major fatty acids were nearly identical among the lipids produced from different substrates. This research shows that at certain concentrations of both crude glycerol and sweet sorghum juice can be utilized by S. limacinum SR 21 to yield substantial quantities of lipids. Based upon the results revealed from the batch stage studies, large scale lipid production from industrial or agricultural by-products could be a reality in the near future. This production process will: 1) eliminate excessive crude glycerol from the market, 2) produce high-value lipids in an environmentally friendly, economical, and sustainable way, and 3) provide lipid feedstocks for various industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{his recent}} essays and {{especially}} {{his recent book}} Moral Thinking Professor Hare developed universal prescriptivism and advocated a kind of utilitarianism which he calls a Kantian. Introducing his new theory, I tried to make clear what he means by Kantian kind of utilitarianism. Intuitionist deontologists have been making attacks against crude forms of act-utilitarianism, saying that utilitarians must, from their total-utility principle, judge that those actions which are justified by ordinary people's sound intuitions must be wrong. The method which Professor Hare uses is, on the one hand, to put oneself in others positions with all their desires and interests. His version of utilitarianism can, he says, be defended from the deontologist attack in this way: if utilitarians in 'giving equal weight to the equal interests of parties' {{take account of the}} desires and interests which would be deppressed by the proposed act, then he must probably disagree with <b>crude</b> act-utilitarianism, <b>must</b> share with intuitionists the sound intuitions which people usually have. This defence is to be derived from the critical moral thinking made on one level in his two-tier theory, the other level being intuitive level. His argument against deontologists becomes easier, on the other hand, if we use the intuitive-level moral thinking, because on intuitive level we are incalcated in moral disposition to act according to our general intuitive principles, which, though called prima facie principles, are by no means the rules of thumb. This is a Harean version of rule-utilitarianism. In critical moral thinking he uses universalistic act-utilitarianism which can be distinguished from crude forms of act-utilitarianism by the former's having the character of universalizability-thesis; act-utilitarianism emerges, in this way, into specific rule-utilitarianism. Accordingly {{it is clear that the}} rules are universal, whether general or specific. In these twofold senses, I think, the Harean type of utilitarianism has a Kantian element. R. Brandt, in his A Theory of the Good and the Right has criticized Hare's recent theory, saying that: (1) we must know all the fact before we act; this brings in complications arising both from the variety of desires of all the parties and from limiting the number of people whom the consequences of the proposed action would affect, (2) the two-tier theory leads to the conclusion that on occasion the morally good act is one that is not morally right. This criticism can also be answered, I think, by using the two-level theory; i. e. (1) Any theory giving weight to benevolence or interests of parties must, in any way, know all the fact concerning the situation and desires of parties but we cannot always know all the relevant facts, and it is for this reason that the general prima facie principles are required. Therefore we must meet such cases by using intuitive moral thinking. (2) The morally good act is usually the kind of act chosen by good men with good intuitive dispositions, but this act is not always a morally right one on critical level. But, if we consider as a whole those cases which were decided on intuitive level in the situations of extreme difficulties and ignorance, if moreover we imagine that in all these cases critical moral thinking was practiced before we began acting, and if we compare the both, then we shall find that former cases would be more exempted from danger of evil consequences than the latter ones; so the former are better and therefore right as a whole. In this sense the good act done by good men is a right act after all...|$|R
40|$|Waxy {{crude oils}} are a {{commonly}} encountered type of <b>crude</b> oil which <b>must</b> {{be dealt with}} by oil production companies. They are characterized by a gel-like behavior at temperatures below their wax appearance temperature (Twa) and often exhibit a yield stress. The restart of pipelines containing gelled waxy crude is a commonly encountered problem in production scenarios where low ambient temperatures are encountered, especially due to the increasingly important role that deep-water oil exploration has in meeting production needs. In this thesis, a model wax-oil system is formulated which closely mimics the thermorheological complexity of an actual waxy crude oil. The composition of the model system is characterized using chemical characterization techniques, and the basic rheological properties of these components are probed using temperature sweeps and stress sweeps. Large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) is also used to gain additional insight into the rheology of the model system. The results from the LAOS measurements show that the wax-oil system exhibits a strain stiffening and shear thinning response under oscillatory shear. The system is then studied using a combined approach of rheology and flow measurement techniques. We describe the design, fabrication and calibration of a quantitative flow imaging apparatus that enables measurements of the local kinematics within the model fluid using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). This Rheo-PIV approach forms the basis {{for the study of the}} model fluid using Flow Assurance Rheometry. The data from this combined approach shows that the model fluid exhibits a complex behavior due to heterogeneities within the domain of the fluid. Specifically, the wax-oil system is shown to consist of two distinct phases: rigid clumps or fragments that are formed by aggregates of wax crystallites, and fluid-like regions which contain fewer wax precipitates. It is shown that under imposition of a steady shear stress, these rigid fragments break down over time into smaller pieces, and this contributes to the fluidization of the model wax-oil. The effect of surface roughness on the dynamics of this shear-induced fragmentation process is also investigated. It is shown that when the gelled system is in contact with a roughened surface, the fragmentation process happens faster. by Christopher Dimitriou. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{greenhouse}} gas {{concentration in the}} atmosphere influences global climate change even though the level of impact is still unclear. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly seen as {{an important component of}} broadly based {{greenhouse gas}}es reduction measures, {{such as the use of}} renewable energy sources or nuclear energy. Although the other greenhouse gases are more potent, the sheer volume of CO 2 makes it dominant in term of its effect in the atmosphere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) uses 19 % of emission reduction requirements as the target for CCS. Although a fossil fuel power plant is a large source of CO 2 emissions, with CO 2 capture these emissions can be reduced substantially. However, it must be recognized that CO 2 capture significantly decreases power plant efficiency; therefore, extra resources (for example, coal in the case of a coal-fired power plant) are needed to compensate for the lost capacity. Extensive application of CO 2 capture will require the construction of replacement power plants to compensate for the loss of electricity to the grid. CO− 2 transport and storage also contribute to an increase in emissions and waste generation, as well as an increase in energy and other resource consumption [...] To understand the implications, CCS activities should be studied from a full life cycle perspective. The objectives of this study is to conduct life cycle assessment of combining two energy systems, coal-fired power plant and CO 2 EOR, as a new tool to evaluate environmental LCA of CCS with CO 2 EOR option. In addition, this is an attractive tool for decision making of any CCS project. Various equations are applied into the GaBi software (a LCA software) to model this tool. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the primary approach used in this study to create the tool for CCS environmental evaluation. The Boundary Dam Power Station (BDPS) and the Weyburn-Midale CO 2 Project in Saskatchewan, Canada, are studied and modified as the case scenarios to find the potential and encourage the appllications of CCS on both energy systems. Energy, using GJ as one of its unit, is considerably the product of this combining two energy resources as one system. The application of this tool effectively demonstrates the result of CCS system as life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) on carbon footprint and resource depletion. Other environmental impacts can, therefore, be analyzed by this tool as well. Three processes; coal mining, power plant including CO 2 capture unit operation and <b>crude</b> oil usage, <b>must</b> be presented when the global warming potential (GWP) of CCS is performed. In addition, the result demonstrates the GWP reduction is directly related to fossil fuel resource use efficiency. This means the lower GWP of CCS, the lower efficiency of fossil fuel resource use as well...|$|R
6000|$|I {{say this}} woman seemed {{glad to be}} greeted in Italian, but not, so far as I could see, surprised; and {{altogether}} {{the most amazing thing}} about my doorstep acquaintance of her nation is, that they are never surprised to be spoken to in their own tongue, or, if they are, never show it. A chestnut-roaster, who has sold me twice the chestnuts the same money would have bought of him in English, has not otherwise recognized the fact that Tuscan is not the dialect of Charlesbridge, and the mortifying nonchalance with which my advances have always been received has long since persuaded me that to the grinder at the gate it is not remarkable that a man should open the door of his wooden house on Benicia Street, and welcome him in his native language. After the first shock of this indifference is past, it is not to be questioned but it flatters with an illusion, which a stare of amazement would forbid, reducing the encounter to a vulgar reality at once, and I could almost believe it in those wily and amiable folk to intend the sweeter effect of their unconcern, which tacitly implies that there is no other tongue in the world but Italian, and which makes all the earth and air Italian for the time. Nothing else could have been the purpose of that image-dealer whom I saw on a summer's day lying at the foot of one of our meeting-houses, and doing his best to make it a cathedral, and really giving a sentiment of medieval art to the noble sculptures of the facade which the carpenters had just nailed up, freshly painted and newly repaired. This poet was stretched upon his back, eating, in that convenient posture, his dinner out of an earthen pot, plucking the viand from it, whatever it was, with his thumb and fore-finger, and dropping it piecemeal into his mouth. When the passer asked him [...] "Where are you from?" [...] he held a morsel in air long enough to answer [...] "Da Lucca, signore," [...] and then let it fall into his throat, and sank deeper into a reverie in which that <b>crude</b> accent even <b>must</b> have sounded like a gossip's or a kinsman's voice, but never otherwise moved muscle, nor looked to see who passed or lingered. There could have been little else in his circumstances to remind him of home, and if he was really in the sort of day-dream attributed to him, he was wise not to look about him. I have not myself been in Lucca, but I conceive that its piazza is not like our square, with a pump and horse-trough in the midst; but that it has probably a fountain and statuary, though not possibly so magnificent an elm towering above the bronze or marble groups as spreads its boughs of benison over our pump and the horse-car switchman, loitering near it to set the switch for the arriving cars, or lift the brimming buckets to the smoking nostrils of the horses, while out from the stable comes clanging and banging with a fresh team that famous African who has turned white, or, if he is off duty, one of his brethren who has not yet begun to turn. Figure, besides, an expressman watering his horse at the trough, a provision-cart backed up against the curb {{in front of one of}} the stores, various people looking from the car-office windows, and a conductor appearing at the door long enough to call out, [...] "Ready for Boston!"--and you have a scene of such gayety as Lucca could never have witnessed in her piazza at high noon on a summer's day. Even our Campo Santo, if the Lucchese had cared to look round the corner of the meeting-house at its moss-grown head stones, could have had little to remind him of home, though it has antiquity and a proper quaintness. But not for him, not for them of his clime and faith, is the pathos of those simple memorial slates with their winged skulls, changing upon many later stones, as if by the softening of creeds and customs, to cherub's heads,--not for him is the pang I feel because of those who died, in our country's youth exiles or exiles' children, heirs of the wilderness and toil and hardship. Could they rise from their restful beds, and look on this wandering Italian with his plaster statuettes of Apollo, and Canovan dancers and deities, they would hold his wares little better than Romish saints and idolatries, and would scarcely have the sentimental interest in him felt by the modern citizen of Charlesbridge; but I think that even they must have respected that Lombard scissors-grinder who used to come to us, and put an edge to all the cutlery in the house.|$|R
