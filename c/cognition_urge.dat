40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships between risk (i. e., gambling <b>cognitions,</b> gambling <b>urges,</b> psychological distress) and protective factors (i. e., life satisfaction, resilience, gambling refusal self-efficacy) and problem gambling among 310 Singaporeans aged between 18 and 73  years. Data on demographics, risk and protective factors, and gambling behavior were collected through electronic and paper surveys. Hierarchical multiple regression was employed to assess {{the contributions of the}} risk and protective factors in predicting problem gambling. Three risk factors (i. e., gambling <b>cognitions,</b> gambling <b>urges,</b> psychological distress) and two protective factors (i. e., resilience, gambling refusal self-efficacy) were found to significantly and uniquely predict problem gambling. Furthermore, the risk factors significantly interacted with the protective factors to moderate gambling severity. Gambling refusal self-efficacy shows significant protective effects against problem gambling, while the effects of resilience on gambling vary across settings. Both factors need {{to be taken into account}} in the understanding of problem gambling...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of {{prevention and intervention}} research in problem gambling (PG) has focused on identifying negative risk factors. However, not all at-risk individuals go on to develop anticipated disorders and many thrive in spite of them. In healthcare settings, PG and other disorders are typically conceptualized from the biomedical perspective that frame disorders as something negative residing within the individual and reduction in negativity is seen as success. Indeed, this problem-focused conceptualization may be adequate in many cases as reducing PG behaviour is undoubtedly an important outcome, but the focus on negativity alone is too narrow to capture the complexity of human behaviour. Hence, this study attempts {{to bridge the gap}} in literature by providing an evaluation of the predictive ability of the positive dispositions on problem gambling severity, gambling-related <b>cognitions,</b> and gambling <b>urges.</b> The positive psychological dispositions examined were curiosity, gratitude, hope, personal growth initiative, and mindfulness. Participants consisted of 801 Taiwanese Chinese students and community individuals (Mean age = 25. 36 years). Higher levels of gratitude and hope have been found to predict lower PG, gambling-related <b>cognitions,</b> or gambling <b>urges.</b> Meanwhile, higher mindfulness predicted lower PG, but only among Chinese males. However, lower personal growth initiative predicted lower PG, gambling-related <b>cognitions,</b> and gambling <b>urges.</b> These analyses have small to medium effect sizes with significant predictions. Findings of this study have essential implications in understanding and treating Chinese problem gamblers. These positive disposition...|$|R
40|$|Most {{cognitive}} {{studies of}} religion adopt a modular theory of cognition. The 'space'that is studied {{is often the}} 'space between the ears'. Culture and religion are viewed as by-products of more entrenched features of our brains. Although this 'Standard Model' explains many intuitive expressions of religious belief, it has trouble explaining (a) the variability of religious systems crossculturally (b) the uses of material culture (i. e. symbolic structures etc) in transmitting religious concepts. The following thesis presents a 'wideware mind' hypothesis for religious <b>cognition.</b> I <b>urge</b> that while our internal cognitive architecture is causally relevant to religious cognition, the material artefacts of culture must be viewed as cognitive properties in their own right. Hence any causal account of religious cognition must acknowledge the external features of minds and how our neurological resources interact with the artefacts of our world...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} mostly {{examined}} cognitive and psychosocial variables {{that are critical}} to the cognitive behavioral conceptualization of Problem Gambling (PG) in community samples. This study aimed to assess whether cognitive and psychosocial variables (gambling refusal self-efficacy, gambling <b>cognitions,</b> gambling <b>urges,</b> comorbid negative psychological states, comorbid substance use/misuse, life satisfaction and quality of life) can predict gambling behaviour in a clinical sample. One hundred and thirty-nine volunteers for a PG self-help cognitive behaviour treatment program participated. Results showed that only perceived gambling refusal self-efficacy, cognitions of inability to stop gambling, hazardous drinking behaviors, and poor quality of life related to one’s environment, significantly predicted SOGS and/or CPGI scores. Significant interactions between gender {{and a number of}} variables including gambling cognitions (especially gambling expectancies), gambling refusal self-efficacy as well as quality of life related to physical or environmental health predicted gambling behaviour in this clinical sample...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} body of work is to bridge {{a gap in the}} {{literature}} by providing an evaluation of an integrated model of gambling among the Chinese with the incorporation of both positive and negative antecedents of problem gambling. This thesis made advancements in the assessment of Chinese problem gambling (PG), theoretical model and thus, it is hoped in interventions of PG. Stemming from Chapter 1, which is a comprehensive review of Chinese PG, we acknowledged that {{there is a lack of}} empirical research in this area and went on to address some of the questions raised in subsequent chapters. Thus, this thesis aimed to provide psychometric evaluations of two scales that have not been translated and validated in this ethnic group, test the predictive ability of a range of gambling correlated, and finally to test the validity of the cognitive-behavioural component of Sharpe’s (2002) biopsychosocial model of PG in a Chinese sample. The participants consisted of 801 Taiwanese Chinese individuals (Mean age = 25. 36 years). Different subsets of this sample were used for statistical analyses in each empirical chapter. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 aimed to test the validity and reliability of the Chinese translated versions of The Resilience Scale (TRS-C) and The Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI-C), respectively. The TRS-C was found to be unstable across different ethnicities (i. e., in Spanish, Russian, and English language versions). Hence, the TRS-C was omitted from empirical analyses in subsequent chapters. Furthermore, further analyses revealed that resilience as measured by TRS-C was not a significant predictor of PG behaviour. The 9 -item PGSI-C scale was found to have good psychometric properties and was utilised in subsequent empirical chapters. Chapter 5 aimed to examine the patterns of PG and the predictive ability of variables such as gambling-related <b>cognitions,</b> gambling <b>urge,</b> depression, anxiety, stress, and help-seeking attitudes in predicting Chinese PG. The overall rates of PG (measured with PGSI-C) and pathological gambling (measured with South Oaks Gambling Screen-Chinese version; SOGS-C) are higher in this Taiwanese Chinese sample as compared to participation rates in past prevalence research in other samples. Significant differences were found between PGSI-C groups (i. e., non-PG, low-risk, moderate-risk, and PG) in socio-demographic variables such as age, gender, marital status, and employment status. Erroneous gambling-related cognitions and overall level of depression, anxiety, and stress significantly predicted PG severity. Unique to PG research, Chapter 6 aimed to investigate the predictive ability of the positive psychological dispositions on problem gambling severity, gambling-related <b>cognitions,</b> and gambling <b>urges</b> among Chinese individuals. The positive psychological dispositions examined were curiosity, gratitude, hope, personal growth initiative, and mindfulness. Higher levels of gratitude and hope were found to predict lower PG, gambling-related <b>cognitions,</b> and gambling <b>urges.</b> Meanwhile, higher mindfulness predicted lower PG, but only among Chinese males. However, lower personal growth initiative (PGI) predicted lower PG, gambling-related <b>cognitions,</b> and gambling <b>urges.</b> The nature of the results obtained is further discussed in this chapter. The first in PG literature, Chapter 7 aimed to evaluate the validity of the cognitive-behavioural component of Sharpe’s (2002) biopsychosocial model with a combination of positive and negative factors in predicting PG. Path analyses were conducted to examine model fit. In the proposed framework, gambling-urge mediated the relationship of negative psychological states, hope, gratitude, and personal-growth initiative with gambling-related cognitions. Meanwhile, gambling-related cognitions mediated the relationship between gambling-urge and PG among the Chinese. The results evidenced the importance of gratitude in predicting PG among the Chinese via gambling-urge and gambling-related cognitions. In addition, hope in life (encompassing autonomy in devising plans for life goals and agency in thought processes) was found to have the same predictive pathway as gratitude on PG. Contrary to initial predictions, stronger personal-growth initiative (PGI) predicted higher PG severity, gambling-related <b>cognitions,</b> and gambling <b>urges.</b> The implications of these results in relation to PG literature was further elaborated in this chapter. The implications, strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations are discussed in each chapter and in the final chapter. These studies were unique investigations in both the general and Chinese PG literature. The final chapter (Chapter 8) provided a general discussion of the results obtained in this thesis and present a global overview, strengths, limitations, and direction for future research...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:The aim of {{the current}} study was {{to assess the impact of}} an {{intervention}} aimed at communicating the negative reinforcement explanation for smoking, a set of ideas derived from popular self-help books, upon participants 2 ̆ 7 <b>cognitions</b> and <b>urges</b> to smoke. Methods: Smokers (n = 205) undergoing standard stop-smoking treatment were randomised to receive either the experimental intervention, a brief intervention aimed at communicating the explanation or a control intervention, a video on the health risks of smoking. Outcomes were participants 2 ̆ 7 acceptance of the negative reinforcement explanation for smoking, positive outcome expectations for smoking, self-efficacy and urges to smoke reported at one week post-cessation. Results: Post-cessation urges to smoke were similar in the two groups (Adjusted expt. group mean = 2. 50, Control group mean = 2. 75, F(1, 60) = 0. 98, p =. 33). Other cognitive measures were also unchanged. Conclusions: The brief cognitive intervention offered as an adjunct to standard care failed to reduce urges to smoke or alter smokers 2 ̆ 7 cognitions. Changing smokers 2 ̆ 7 cognitions may be as challenging as changing their behaviours. Suggestions are provided for further research...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} consensus that problem gambling (PG) is a serious social issue among the Chinese, but little is known of the factors associated with PG among the Chinese using validated and improved PG measure-ments. This study examined the patterns of PG and the PG predictive ability of variables such as gam-bling-related <b>cognitions,</b> gambling <b>urge,</b> depression, anxiety, stress, and help-seeking attitudes among Chinese individuals living in Taiwan. The participants consisted of 801 Taiwanese Chinese student and community indi-viduals (Mean age = 25. 36 years). The prevalence of PG (Problem Gambling Severity Index; PGSI) and patho-logical gambling (South Oaks Gambling Screen; SOGS) are higher in this Taiwanese Chinese sample as com-pared with past prevalence research. Significant {{differences were found between}} PGSI groups (i. e., non-PG, low-risk, moderate-risk, and PG) in socio-demographic variables. Erroneous gambling-related cognitions and overall negative psychological states significantly predicted PG. In addition, interaction effects of gender, mediation effects, and the predictive ability of help-seeking attitudes were discussed. The findings of this study have important implications in the understanding of PG among the Chinese. Gambling-related cognitions and negative psychological states are important factors that should be addressed in intervention programs...|$|R

A prospective cohort study with 158 treatment and support seeking problem gamblers in South Australia. Key measures were selected using a consensus process with international experts in problem gambling and related addictions. The outcome measures were Victorian Gambling Screen (VGS) and behaviours related to gambling. Potential predictors were gambling related <b>cognitions</b> and <b>urge,</b> emotional disturbance, social support, sensation seeking traits, {{and levels of}} work and social functioning. Mean age of participants was 44 years (SD = 12. 92 years) and 85 (54 %) were male. Median time for participants enrolment {{in the study was}} 8. 38 months (IQR = 2. 57 months). Patterns of completed measures for points in time included 116 (73. 4 %) with at least a 3 month follow-up. Using generalised mixed-effects regression models we found gambling related urge was significantly associated with relapse in problem gambling as measured by VGS (OR 1. 29; 95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 49) and gambling behaviours (OR 1. 16; 95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 27). Gambling related cognitions were also significantly associated with VGS (OR 1. 06; 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 12). There is consistent association between urge to gamble and relapse in problem gambling but estimates for other potential predictors may have been attenuated because of methodological limitations.

40|$|Currently, {{cognitive}} behavioral therapies {{appear to}} be one of the most studied treatments for gambling problems and studies show it is effective in treating gambling problems. However, cognitive behavior models have not been widely tested using statistical means. Thus, the aim of this study was to test the validity of the pathways postulated in the cognitive behavioral theory of gambling behavior using structural equation modeling (AMOS 20). Several questionnaires assessing a range of gambling specific variables (e. g., gambling <b>urges,</b> <b>cognitions</b> and behaviors) and gambling correlates (e. g., psychological states, and coping styles) were distributed to 969 participants from the community. Results showed that negative psychological states (i. e., depression, anxiety and stress) only directly predicted gambling behavior, whereas gambling urges predicted gambling behavior directly as well as indirectly via gambling cognitions. Negative psychological states were significantly related to gambling cognitions as well as avoidance coping. In addition, significant gender differences were also found. The results provided confirmation for the validity of the pathways postulated in the cognitive behavioral theory of gambling behavior. It also highlight the importance of gender differences in conceptualizing gambling behavior...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of an Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy program (I-CBT) for the treatment of problem gambling, when compared to a waitlist control and an active comparison condition consisting of monitoring, feedback, and support (I-MFS). Participants (N = 174) were randomly allocated to the three conditions. Variables of interest were gambling outcome and related mental health measures. Participants in the active conditions (I-CBT and I-MFS) completed six online modules. Both I-CBT and I-MFS conditions resulted in significant treatment gains on gambling severity. However, I-CBT was also associated with reductions in a range of other gambling-related and mental health outcomes. Compared with I-MFS, I-CBT produced greater effects across seven outcomes measures, relating to gambling <b>urges,</b> <b>cognitions,</b> stress, and life satisfaction. I-CBT participants also rated the program as significantly more satisfactory. Treatment gains observed for both active conditions were found to be stable through to 12 month follow up. The results indicate that the benefits of I-CBT were more than simply the non-specific effects of engaging in online treatment or receiving motivation, feedback, and support. Online treatments for gambling may be a valuable tool in increasing help-seeking and treatment engagement in this population, and be integrated as part of stepped care approaches to treatment...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Gender {{differences}} {{have been observed}} in the pathogenesis of gambling disorder and gambling related <b>urge</b> and <b>cognitions</b> are predictive of relapse to problem gambling. A better understanding of these mechanisms concurrently may help {{in the development of}} more directed therapies. Methods We evaluated gender effects on behavioural and cognitive paths to gambling disorder from self-report data. Participants (N = 454) were treatment-seeking problem gamblers on first presentation to a gambling therapy service between January 2012 and December 2014. We firstly investigated if aspects of gambling related <b>urge,</b> <b>cognitions</b> (interpretive bias and gambling expectancies) and gambling severity were more central to men than women. Subsequently, a full structural equation model tested if gender moderated behavioural and cognitive paths to gambling severity. Results Men (n = 280, mean age = 37. 4 years, SD = 11. 4) were significantly younger than women (n = 174, mean age = 48. 7 years, SD = 12. 9) (p < 0. 001). There was no gender difference in conceptualising latent constructs of problem gambling severity, gambling related urge, interpretive bias and gambling expectancies. The paths for urge to gambling severity and interpretive bias to gambling severity were stronger for men than women and statistically significant (p < 0. 001 and p = 0. 004, respectively) whilst insignificant for women (p = 0. 164 and p = 0. 149, respectively). Structural paths for gambling expectancies to gambling severity were insignificant for both men and women. Conclusion This study detected an important signal in terms of theoretical mechanisms to explaining gambling disorder and gender differences. It has implications for treatment development including relapse prevention...|$|R
