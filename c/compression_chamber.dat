25|$|In an {{isothermal}} compression process, the {{gas in the}} system is kept at a constant temperature throughout. This necessarily requires exchange of heat with the gas, otherwise the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange {{can be achieved by}} heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator and tank. To avoid wasted energy, the intercoolers must be optimised for high heat transfer and low pressure drop. Smaller compressors can approximate {{isothermal compression}} even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the compressor body itself.|$|E

[...] For example, USN treatment table 7 (which may be used if decompression sickness has reoccurred during initial treatment in the <b>compression</b> <b>chamber)</b> states [...] "Decompress with stops every 2 feet for times shown in profile below." [...] The profile shows an ascent rate of 2fsw every 40min from 60fsw (feet of sea water) to 40fsw, followed by 2ft every hour from 40fsw to 20fsw and 2ft every two hours from 20fsw to 4fsw.|$|E

2500|$|The Voitenko {{compressor}} initially separates a {{test gas}} from a shaped charge with a malleable steel plate. When the shaped charge detonates, {{most of its}} energy {{is focused on the}} steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames Research Center translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A [...] shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was a phenomenal [...] The apparatus exposed to the detonation was, of course, completely destroyed, but not before useful data were extracted. In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates hydrogen gas, which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40km/s. A slight modification to the Voitenko compressor concept is a super-compressed detonation, a device that uses a compressible liquid or solid fuel in the steel <b>compression</b> <b>chamber</b> instead of a traditional gas mixture. A further extension of this technology is the explosive diamond anvil cell, utilizing multiple opposed shaped-charge jets projected at a single steel-encapsulated fuel, such as hydrogen. The fuels used in these devices, along with the secondary combustion reactions and long blast impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in fuel-air and thermobaric explosives.|$|E

An equation of state for real gas was also considered to complete the system of equations and relate pressure, temperature and density along the compression cycle.

40|$|The scroll {{compressor}} {{consists of two}} plane spiral/helix running inside each other, traditionally both scrolls are the same circle involute with constant wall thickness. When the moving scroll follows a circular orbit the chambers moves inwards and the air or fluid trapped in the chambers is compressed.

One could try to increase the compression rate by having more chambers, but that would increase the leakage too. The task was to investigate how a change in the basic geometry of the scrolls and the orbit influence the compressor performance and efficiency, and then try to optimize the design. We have not done any optimization, but we believe we have found a sound foundation for the optimization process. We can represent the geometry of the problem in a way which leads to closed expressions for all the geometric quantities which are interesting for the scroll design.

For that purpose, an exhaustive computational MHD analysis is a necessary step. This master thesis investigated the possibility of using PLUTO to estimate the ideal-MHD of a multi-coil parabolic reaction chamber. PLUTO is a freely-distributed and modular code for computational astrophysics that, although not originally programmed for engineering applications, has demonstrated great adaptation capabilities: implementing the boundary conditions to effectively emulate a magnetic flux <b>compression</b> reaction <b>chamber</b> has eventually been possible. Besides, the attained results are in accordance with theoretical projections and previous numerical analyses. However, the outcomes pointed out that ideal-MHD could be an over-simplified model: relativistic conditions, that are not properly reproduced by the ideal-MHD equations, have been identified in several locations of the computational domain. In addition, some aspects of the real system physics have yet to be thoroughly investigated as well as mathematically described. Therefore, further investigations are required. According to this research, no other computational analyses of a multi-coil parabolic reaction chamber (i. e. the latest and most promising magnetic flux <b>compression</b> reaction <b>chamber</b> concept) have been found in the literature.
