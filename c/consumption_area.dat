Based on the theory and method of ESV, take Fengnan district as an example, and the paper analyzes the change of ESV from 1998 to 2009, evaluates the temporal and spatial differences among the 15 towns, and compares the relationship between ESV change and economic development. The results are the ESV of Fengnan is in a declining trend during the period. According to the ESV variation of the towns, Fengnan district is divided into four zones: value-added area, low <b>consumption</b> <b>area,</b> middle <b>consumption</b> <b>area,</b> high <b>consumption</b> <b>area.</b> The economic development has a great negative impact to the ESV in Fengnan.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the question of}} ecologically differentiated value added taxes (VAT) {{as a tool to}} overcome tax-related cognitive barriers by connecting to an existing tax system. This is elaborated along several aspects: (a) The role indirect of consumption taxes for the economy, (b) the legal issues of the VAT system, (c) the EU harmonization efforts in this context, (d) the distributional implications of value added taxes. Following this, the chapter develops a proposal for a VAT reform (e). To this end, it looks at potential and existing differentiations between sectors, products and services, and product and service groups and turns to those <b>consumption</b> <b>areas</b> that are widely identified as particularly resource and carbon intensive and sets out how a harmonization of the overall system and an ecological differentiation in single <b>consumption</b> <b>areas</b> could be brought together.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{opportunities}} for consumers to design their lives more sustainably. While a rapidly growing body of literature has investigated how consumers can reduce carbon footprints in key <b>consumption</b> <b>areas,</b> such as food, housing and mobility, an overall framework that allows structuring those options across all <b>consumption</b> <b>areas</b> is still missing. Hence, this paper presents a novel and systematic framework to identify improvement options that promote climate change mitigation and structure them based on their primary mode of impact on GHG emissions. The framework targets consumer practices and focuses on ambitious, but technically and socioeconomically feasible strategies for consumers to lower their carbon footprint. Four major categories for reducing consumption-based emissions form the basic framework, which are then subdivided into behavioural strategies and sub-strategies. The practical application of the framework is illustrated by using food consumption as an example. Systematically identifying improvement options can advance a holistic understanding {{of the range of}} behavioural strategies targeting consumer choices that operate at different stages in the supply chain. It thus provides a starting point for addressing critical questions related to the role of consumers in supporting climate change mitigation...|$|R

40|$|This paper probes {{effects of}} the evolvement of labor {{resources}} on technical efficiency in crop production in rural China. Based on twelve years of data on crop production of 30 provinces in China, a stochastic frontier production function model is used to measure crop production efficiency in three crop-functional areas—the production area, the <b>consumption</b> <b>area,</b> and the balanced area. Then effects of both quantity and quality change in labor force on technical efficiency in different regions of China are analyzed. Results show that rural China generally has {{an increasing number of}} employees shifted to non-agricultural sectors and a decreasing trend of the stock of human capital. However, both these two changes in rural labor force have significantly positive effects on improving crop production efficiency. In addition, China’s technical inefficiency is at an average of 22. 2 %. Dynamically, the technical efficiencies show a tendency to rise steadily throughout China and in three areas, while the <b>consumption</b> <b>area</b> possesses the highest technical efficiency. Those results may lend some experience for other countries that are currently experiencing rural labor force and economic transition...|$|E
