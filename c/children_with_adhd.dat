5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E
25|$|Improving the {{surrounding}} {{home and school}} environment can improve the behavior of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD.</b> Parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> often show similar deficits themselves, and thus {{may not be able}} to sufficiently help the child with his or her difficulties. Improving the parents' understanding of the child's behavior and teaching them strategies to improve functioning and communication and discourage unwanted behavior has measurable effect on the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD.</b> The different educational interventions for the parents are jointly called Parent Management Training. Techniques include operant conditioning: a consistent application of rewards for meeting goals and good behavior (positive reinforcement) and punishments such as time-outs or revocation of privileges for failing to meet goals or poor behavior. Classroom management is similar to parent management training; educators learn about ADHD and techniques to improve behavior applied to a classroom setting. Strategies utilized include increased structuring of classroom activities, daily feedback, and token economy.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a high}} {{comorbidity}} {{of learning}} disorders (LDs) in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD,</b> {{and for that reason}} the VADRS has been studied to determine if the performance item questions on the VARS can reliably predict if the child with ADHD has a comorbid LD (e.g. math, reading, spelling LDs). Results of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis show that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> can be reliably ruled out from have a comorbid LD based on the performance items on the VARS. This is clinically useful because it allows those without LDs to be ruled out and therefore reduce the amount of unnecessary referrals to healthcare professionals.|$|E

The research question was whether differences would be found in the well being and {{quality of life}} of parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ad(h)</b> d compared to other parents. The results indicate that there are differences in the amount of stress in both family and professional life experienced by parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ad(h)</b> d due to the child‘s problems. The mothers of hyperactive children were more likely to work part time because of the child‘s problems but not the fathers. The parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ad(h)</b> d experienced more stress in their family life compared to the other parents. In addition, the parents of hyperactive children did worry more about the future of their child than the other parents. They also had more negative interactions with their mates than the other parents, due to the child‘s problems and their well being was not as good as the well being of the other parents.

Subjects and Methods: A total of 2, 500 primary school students, aged 6 - 12 years, were randomly selected from the government primary schools, and 1, 869 students (947 boys and 922 girls) gave consent to participate in this study. An Arabic questionnaire was used to collect the sociodemographic variables and a standardized Arabic version of the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale for ADH symptoms. Results: Of the 947 boys, 158 (16. 7 %; 95 % confidence interval, CI, 14. 4 - 19. 2) and of the 922 girls, 50 (5. 4 %; 95 % CI 4. 1 - 7. 1) scored above the cut-off (≥ 15) for ADH symptoms, thus giving an overall prevalence of 11. 1 % (95 % CI 9. 7 - 12. 6). The children who had higher scores for ADH symptoms were in the age group of 6 - 9 years. Children who had higher scores for ADH symptoms had a poorer school performance than those with lower scores (p = 0. 002). Two hundred (96. 2 %) <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> were disobedient, 126 (60. 6 %) noisy and hyperactive, 76 (36. 5 %) very cranky, 78 (37. 5 %) troublesome and 79 (37. 9 %) nervous. The logistic regression identified socio-economic condition, number of children, school performance and poor relationship between parents as the main contributors to ADH. Although the univariate analysis showed a significant relationship (p = 0. 010) between ADH symptoms and consanguineous parents, logistic regression did not support this association (p = 0. 075). This suggests that consanguinity has no impact on ADH children. Conclusion: The study revealed that ADH is a common problem among schoolchildren. The <b>children</b> <b>with</b> higher scores for ADH symptoms had a poorer school performance than those with lower scores. A significant difference exists between the behaviour of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> and without <b>ADH...</b>|$|R

40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} hypocalcemia (ADH) is {{an inherited}} form of hypoparathyroidism caused by activating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR). Treatment with PTH(1 - 34) may {{be superior to}} conventional therapy but is contraindicated in children, and long-term effects on the skeleton are unknown. The patient is a 20 -yr-old female <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> treated <b>with</b> PTH continuously since 6 yr and 2 mo of age. A bone biopsy was obtained for histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI). Her data were compared with one age-, sex-, and length of hypoparathyroidism–matched control not on PTH and two sex-matched ADH controls before and after 1 yr of PTH. The patient's growth was normal. Hypercalciuria and hypermagnesuria persisted despite normal or subnormal serum calcium and magnesium levels. Nephrocalcinosis, without evidence of impaired renal function, developed by 19 yr of age. Cancellous bone volume was dramatically elevated in the patient and in ADH controls after 1 yr of PTH. BMD distribution (BMDD) by qBEI of the patient and ADH controls was strikingly shifted toward lower mineralization compared with the non-ADH control. Moreover, the ADH controls exhibited a further reduction in mineralization after 1 yr of PTH. These findings imply a role for CaR in bone matrix mineralization. There were no fractures or osteosarcoma. In conclusion, long-term PTH replacement in a <b>child</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> was not unsafe, increased bone mass without negatively impacting mineralization, and improved serum mineral control but did not prevent nephrocalcinosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Deficits in {{executive}} functioning are {{of great}} significance in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One of these executive functions, working memory, {{plays an important}} role in academic performance and is often seen as the core deficit of this disorder. There are indications that working memory problems and academic performance can be improved by school-oriented interventions but this has not yet been studied systematically. In this study we will determine the short- and long-term effects of a working memory - and an executive function training applied in a school situation for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>AD(H)</b> D, taking individual characteristics, the level of impairment and costs (stepped-care approach) into account. Methods/design The study consists of two parts: the first part is a randomised controlled trial <b>with</b> school-aged <b>children</b> (8 – 12 yrs) <b>with</b> <b>AD(H)</b> D. Two groups (each n = 50) will be randomly assigned to a well studied computerized working memory training ‘Cogmed’, or to the ‘Paying attention in class’ intervention which is an experimental school-based executive function training.

25|$|Children with {{attention}} deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships, due to a limited ability to build social skills through observational learning, difficulties attending to social cues, and because of the social impacts of impulsive behavior and a greater tendency to engage in behavior that may be seen as disruptive by their peers.

25|$|Five {{different}} amphetamine-based pharmaceuticals {{are currently}} used in ADHD treatment: racemic amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and two mixed enantiomer products (Adderall and Dyanavel XR). Lisdexamfetamine is an inactive prodrug of dextroamphetamine (i.e., lisdexamfetamine itself doesn't {{do anything in}} the body, but it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine). Adderall is a proprietary mixture of (75%) dextroamphetamine and (25%) levoamphetamine salts, which results in very mild differences between their effects. Dyanavel XR contains a similar mixture. Adderall begins to work before dextroamphetamine because of levoamphetamine. Levoamphetamine also provides Adderall with a longer clinical effect than dextroamphetamine. Some <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> and comorbid disorders respond well to levoamphetamine.|$|E
40|$|Background: Attention deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) {{is one of}} the commonest {{psychiatric disorders}} in children and adolescents. The main symptoms of ADHD are hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. Both etiology and neurobiological basis of ADHD are unknown. In this context, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), especially omega- 3 (n- 3) PUFAs, have become a focus of interest. The symptoms of ADHD have been suggested to be associated with a deficiency of n- 3 PUFAs. In addition, the impact of a supply of dietary n- 3 PUFAs in the treatment of ADHD has frequently been discussed. Objective: The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the influence of n- 3 PUFA supplementation on attention and impulsivity in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) which has been proposed to be a valid genetic animal model of ADHD. Methods: Seven-week-old male SHRs were randomly divided into two groups of 15 rats and fed one of two experimental diets (n- 3 PUFA-enriched or n- 3 PUFA-deficient) prior to and during behavioral testing. Attention and impulsivity were assessed using a three-choiceserial-reaction-time-task (3 CSRTT) which is based on the five-choice-serial-reaction-timetask. The experiment was performed with three-month-old rats. Results: Our findings demonstrate a marked difference between groups regarding impulsivity but not attention. The n- 3 PUFA-enriched diet significantly reduced impulsivity in SHRs compared with rats fed with the n- 3 PUFA-deficient diet. Conclusion: The present data show a decrease in impulsivity following a dietary n- 3 PUFA supplementation, but no changes in attention. A possible explanation for these results is that the attention displayed by SHR may not be linked to n- 3 PUFA supply. It is important to note that inattention and impulsiveness are two of the main symptoms of ADHD. Our results regarding dietary n- 3 PUFA supply may support the positive findings in human studies demonstrating that n- 3 PUFA administration can improve the cognitive or behavioral symptoms in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADH...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background-Autosomal {{dominant}} hypercholesterolemia (ADH) {{is characterized}} by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease. Mutations in the genes encoding for low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK 9) underlie ADH. Nevertheless, a proportion of individuals who exhibit the ADH phenotype do not carry mutations {{in any of these}} 3 genes. Estimates of the percentage of such cases among the ADH phenotype vary widely. We therefore investigated a large pediatric population <b>with</b> an unequivocal <b>ADH</b> phenotype to assess the molecular basis of hereditary hypercholesterolemia and to define the percentage of individuals with unexplained dyslipidemia. Methods and Results-We enrolled individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels above the 95 th percentile for age and gender and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of hypercholesterolemia from a large referred pediatric cohort of 1430 children. We excluded <b>children</b> <b>with</b> thyroid dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome, autoimmune disease, liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and obesity (body mass index > 75 th percentile for age and gender), as well as children referred via a cascade screening program and those from families with a known molecular diagnosis. Of the 269 children who remained after the exclusion criteria were applied, 255 (95 %) carried a functional mutation (LDLR, 95 %; APOB, 5 %). Conclusion-In the vast majority of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> an <b>ADH</b> phenotype, a causative mutation can be identified, strongly suggesting that most of the large-effect genes underlying ADH are known to date.

The results showed that the teachers who have been working as teachers for a longer period, think that the problems of adhd occur primarily due to environmental causes, but then also say that they think the individual causes matters. It is also these teachers that talks very well about medication as a treatment to cure adhd symptoms. The teachers who have worked the shortest time, most of them have some special education from the teacher education. They think that the adhd occur primarily from individual cause as heredity, and secondarily that surrounding environment also matters. Still the pedagogic strategies do not differ between these two groups of teachers with different thoughts about the causes of adhd symptoms. All the teachers want more knowledge about adhd, while simultaneously at the same time they think that the school situation works very well.

25|$|Baroness Susan Greenfield, {{a leading}} neuroscientist, wanted a wide-ranging inquiry in the House of Lords into the {{dramatic}} increase in the diagnosis of ADHD in the UK and its possible causes. This followed a BBC Panorama programme in 2007 which highlighted US research (The Multimodal Treatment Study of <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> by the University of Buffalo showing treatment results of 600) suggesting drugs are no better than therapy for ADHD in the long-term. In the UK medication use is increasing dramatically. Other notable individuals have made controversial statements about ADHD. Terence Kealey, a clinical biochemist and vice-chancellor of University of Buckingham, has stated his belief that ADHD medication is used to control unruly boys and girls behavior.|$|E
25|$|Certain genes {{have been}} {{identified}} with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman et al. (2008), the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) with 7'-repeating polymorphism (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD. The catechol-o-methyl transferase gene (COMT) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set shifting) {{and the experience of}} reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD.</b> Both the DRD4/7R and COMT/Val158Met polymorphisms are also correlated with executive dysfunction in schizophrenia and schizotypal behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Current {{models of}} ADHD {{suggest that it}} is {{associated}} with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. Approximately70% of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members, generally perform better in school, are less distractible and impulsive, and have longer attention spans. People with ADHD have an increased risk of substance use disorders, and stimulant medications reduce this risk. Some studies suggest that since ADHD diagnosis is increasing significantly around the world, using the drug may cause more harm than good in some populations with ADHD. This applies to people who potentially may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. The drug is used to treat symptoms that could be better treated through a different, such as behavioural, intervention. People in this category can then experience negative side-effects of the drug which worsen their condition, and make it harder for them to receive adequate care as providers around them may believe the drugs are sufficient and the problem lies with the user.|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the three}} class I alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (ADH) genes (ADH 2 and ADH 3) encode known functional variants that act on alcohol with different efficiencies. Variants at both these genes have been implicated in alcoholism in some populations because allele frequencies differ between alcoholics and controls. Specifically, controls have higher frequencies of the variants <b>with</b> higher Vmax (<b>ADH</b> 2 * 2 and ADH 3 * 1). In samples both of alcoholics and of controls from three Taiwanese populations (Chinese, Ami, and Atayal) we found significant pairwise disequilibrium for all comparisons of the two functional polymorphisms and a third, presumably neutral, intronic polymorphism in ADH 2. The class I ADH genes all lie within 80 kb on chromosome 4; thus, variants are not inherited independently, and haplotypes must be analyzed when evaluating the risk of alcoholism. In the Taiwanese Chinese we found that, only among those chromosomes containing the ADH 3 * 1 variant (high Vmax), the proportions of chromosomes <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> 2 * 1 (low Vmax) and those <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> 2 * 2 (high Vmax) are significantly different between alcoholics and controls (P< 10 - 5).

25|$|Several {{studies have}} also {{explored}} the connection between Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and obesity in children. A study in 2005 concluded that within a subgroup of children who were hospitalized for obesity, 57.7% had co-morbid ADHD. This relationship between obesity and ADHD may seem counter-intuitive, as ADHD is typically associated with higher level of energy expenditure, which is {{thought of as a}} protective factor against obesity. However, these studies determined that children exhibited more signs of predominantly inattentive-type ADHD rather than combined-type ADHD. It is possible, however, that the symptoms of hyperactivity typically present in individuals with combined-type ADHD are simply masked in obese <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> due to their decreased mobility. The same correlation between obesity and ADHD is also present in adult populations. Existing underlying explanations for the relationship between ADHD and obesity in children include {{but are not limited to}} abnormalities in the hypo-dopaminergic pathway, ADHD creating abnormal eating behaviors which leads to obesity, or impulsivity associated with binge eating leading to ADHD in obese patients. A systematic review of the literature on the relationship between obesity and ADHD concluded that all reviewed studies reported ADHD patients were heavier than expected. However, the same systematic review also claimed that all the evidence supporting this connection was still limited and further research is still necessary to learn more about this connection. Given the prevalence rates of both obesity and ADHD in children, understanding the possible relationship between the two is important for public health, particularly when exploring treatment and management options.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs are}} {{prescribed}} off-label in the U.S., {{which means they}} have not been approved for treating ASD. Large placebo-controlled studies of olanzapine and aripiprazole were underway in early 2008. Aripiprazole may be effective for treating autism in the short term, but is also associated with side effects, such as weight gain and sedation. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and dopamine blockers can reduce some maladaptive behaviors associated with ASD. Although SSRIs reduce levels of repetitive behavior in autistic adults, a 2009 multisite randomized controlled study found no benefit and some adverse effects in children from the SSRI citalopram, raising doubts whether SSRIs are effective for treating repetitive behavior in autistic children. A further study of related medical reviews determined that the prescription of SSRI antidepressants for treating autistic spectrum disorders in children lacked any evidence, and could not be recommended. One study found that the psychostimulant methylphenidate was efficacious against hyperactivity associated with ASD, though with less response than in neurotypical <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD.</b> Of the many medications studied for treatment of aggressive and self-injurious behavior in children and adolescents with autism, only risperidone and methylphenidate demonstrate results that have been replicated. A 1998 study of the hormone secretin reported improved symptoms and generated tremendous interest, but several controlled studies since have found no benefit. Oxytocin {{may play a role in}} autism and may be an effective treatment for repetitive and affiliative behaviors; two related studies in adults found that oxytocin decreased repetitive behaviors and improved interpretation of emotions, but these preliminary results do not necessarily apply to children.

Relative to ADH 32 - 2 carriers, ADH 31 - 1 [OR, 0. 7; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 4 - 1. 1] and ADH 31 - 2 (OR, 0. 8; 95 % CI, 0. 5 - 1. 2) had a nonsignificant reduced risk of HNSCC. ADH 1 - 2 smokers of> 30 pack-years were at decreased risk of oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas compared <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> 32 - 2 (OR, 0. 3, 0. 1 - 0. 9), whereas ADH 31 - 1 smokers were not. After adjustment, those <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> 31 - 2 had significantly worse overall survival compared <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> 31 - 1 (HR, 0. 3, 0. 2 - 0. 6) or ADH 32 - 2 (HR, 0. 4, 0. 2 - 0. 9) and increased recurrence (ADH 31 - 1, 0. 2, 0. 1 - 0. 6; ADH 32 - 2, 0. 6, 0. 2 - 1. 3). Our data did not show that ADH 3 genotypes had a significantly independent effect on the risk of HNSCC, nor did they modify the risks increased by alcohol or tobacco consumption and high-risk human papil-lomavirus infection. However, participants <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> 31 - 2 genotype were associated with poorer survival compared with those who had the other two ADH 3 genotypes and {{a higher rate of}} recurrence than participants <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> 31 - 1 geno-type.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{investigate}} {{the correlation of}} E 2 F- 1, Rb and ER expression with peripheral papilloma (Peri-PM) and ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS), and further explore some molecular mechanisms of the canceration of Peri-PM. METHODS Imunohistochemistry {{was used to examine}} the expression of E 2 F- 1, Rb and ER in 60 Peri-PM, 60 Peri-PM with atypical ductal hyperplasia (Peri-PM <b>with</b> <b>ADH)</b> and 60 DCIS. Normal breast tissues were selected as a control group. RESULTS Based on immunohistochemical staining, the positive rate of E 2 F- 1 expression in Peri-PM, Peri-PM <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> and DCIS was 21. 7 %, 46. 7 % and 78. 3 % respectively. The positive rate of Rb expression was 83. 3 %, 53. 9 % and 21. 7 % and the ER expression was 86. 7 %, 61. 7 % and 55. 0 %. Significant differences were found among the 3 groups (Peri-PM, Peri-PM <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> and DCIS) (P< 0. 05). Significant differences existed between any 2 groups (P< 0. 05) except for the rate of ER positive expression comparin...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{disagree with}} the lumping of ADHD and DCD, with the argument that they are unrelated. Gillberg stated in 2003 that, although he feels {{that there is a}} [...] "very real issue of {{how to deal with the}} conflict between splitting (ADHD plus developmental coordination disorder (DCD)) and lumping (DAMP)," [...] he nevertheless feels that [...] "the DAMP construct has been helpful in identifying a group of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> and multiple needs that will not be self evident if the diagnosis is just ADHD or just DCD." [...] Before the Scandinavian studies, recognition that individuals with attention problems may also have difficulties with movement, perception, and memory had received little attention in studies.

2500|$|Parents of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD</b> {{note that}} they usually display their {{symptoms}} {{at an early}} age. There have been few longitudinal studies on {{the long-term effects of}} stimulant use in children. The use of stimulant medication has not been approved by the FDA for {{children under the age of}} six. A growing trend is the diagnosis of younger <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>ADHD.</b> Prescriptions for children under the age of 5 rose nearly 50 percent from 2000 to 2003. Research on this issue has indicated that stimulant medication can help younger children with [...] "severe ADHD symptoms" [...] but typically at a lower dose then older children. It was also found that children at this age are more sensitive to side effects and should be closely monitored. Evidence suggests that careful assessment and highly individualized behavioural interventions significantly improve both social and academic skills, while medication only treats the symptoms of the disorder. [...] "One of the primary reasons cited for the growing use of psychotropic interventions was that many physicians realize that psychological interventions are costly and difficult to sustain." ...|$|E

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus type 8 capsular {{polysaccharide}} (CP) was conjugated either to diphtheria toxoid or to Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant exoprotein A by using adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) or N-succinimidyl- 3 -(2 -pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) as the joining reagent. The polysaccharide/protein ratios {{of these two}} pairs of conjugates were similar. The two synthetic schemes bound the linker to the carboxyls of the type 8 CP by carbodiimide-mediated condensation. ADH was bound to the carboxyls of the protein, whereas SPDP reacted with the amino groups of the protein. Intermolecular linking of the carrier protein, caused by the carbodiimide during the conjugation reaction with the type 8 CP derivative, probably accounts for the larger size of the conjugates formed <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> compared <b>with</b> those formed with SPDP. Both conjugates synthesized <b>with</b> <b>ADH</b> elicited higher levels of CP antibodies, especially after the first immunization, than did those prepared with SPDP.
