30|$|Practically, it is {{seen that}} the longer <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> attracts more customers. So, to {{increase}} the length of <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> increases the customers’ demand. From the literature survey on <b>credit</b> <b>periods,</b> it is studied that almost all research works have considered one manufacturer/supplier to offer the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to only one retailer. And there are also very few papers (Dye and Ouyang 2011) in which the retailer offers the <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> to end customer (consumer). In their paper, only one end customer has been considered. But, it is impractical to consider only one customer by which all items are consumed together. It is happened {{that there are many}} end customers by which items are procured from the retailer at different times during the business period and it is also observed that sometimes the retailer announces a <b>credit</b> <b>period</b> during some period to fascinate more end customers.

40|$|Residential {{applications}} {{of renewable energy}} can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while {{improving the quality of}} life for households. Thermosiphon solar water heaters are passive systems using solar energy to supply hot water for residential or industrial use. Replacing fuels or electricity for heating, solar water heating systems can substantially reduce a household’s energy demand. Despite the economic and environmental benefits, several barriers hinder the broader adoption of solar water heating in Bolivia. These include an investment barrier due to the high upfront costs, lack of awareness and little confidence in the technology. This study investigated whether carbon finance can contribute to overcoming these barriers: Access of the voluntary carbon market by registering a micro-scale project activity verified by the Gold Standard (GS) was investigated. Potential financial benefits were studied from both a project developer and an end-user perspective. For project baseline scenario determination and related emission reductions calculations, the CDM small-scale methodology AMS-I. J (solar water heating) and its stipulated energy saving method were applied, resulting in emission reductions of 0. 425 tCO 2 per square meter collector area. The state and recent development of the carbon market was studied in order to be able to make reasonable assumptions on the VER (Verified Emission Reduction) price. The maximum collector area generating emission reductions lower than micro-scale limits was estimated to be reached in the sixth year of the <b>crediting</b> <b>period.</b> Assuming this collector area and a constant VER price of 15 USD, 3. 9 % of capital investment expenditures (CAPEX) could be recovered within the first <b>crediting</b> <b>period</b> of 7 years and 16. 4 % of CAPEX within the maximum crediting time of 21 years. Sensitivity analysis showed that these numbers are significantly more affected by VER price changes than by increase of CAPEX. From an end-user perspective, Simple Payback Periods (SPP) of between 10. 1 and 16. 4 years without VER revenue was calculated, depending on the system size. Earnings from VER revenue will decrease the SPP to between 9. 7 to 12. 8 years. Given the determined relevant benchmark Internal Rate of Return of 13. 82 %; a negative Net Present Value (NPV) was calculated for all systems without and with VER revenue.

Usually small scale (SSC) CDM EE lighting projects expect a <b>crediting</b> <b>period</b> of 10 years given that the lighting population will decay as time goes by. The SSC CDM sampling guideline requires that the monitored key parameters for the carbon emission reduction quantification must satisfy the sampling accuracy of 90 % confidence and 10 % precision, known as the 90 / 10 criterion. For the existing registered CDM lighting projects, sample sizes are either decided by professional judgment or by rule-of-thumb without considering any optimisation. Lighting samples are randomly selected and their energy consumptions are monitored continuously by power meters. In this study, the sampling size determination problem is formulated as a metering cost minimisation model by incorporating a linear lighting decay model as given by the CDM guideline AMS-II. J. The 90 / 10 criterion is formulated as constraints to the metering cost minimisation problem.

This study was conducted in a Pulai (Alstonia) plantation developed by PT. Xylo Indah Pratama, in South Sumatra, Indonesia, in partnership with more than 1, 749 smallholders of private lands. The actual costs incurred in plantation development were used to estimate the potential cost of forest carbon projects in the same area. The existing plantation is not eligible as a sink project under the current rules of the CDM. However, results show potential for new groups of smallholders to be eligible. Under the same rules mentioned, a project with a size of 104 ha to 250 ha would cost $ 3, 121 /ha to $ 1, 254 /ha respectively, and can produce 130 tC (476 tCERs) after a 10 -year <b>crediting</b> <b>period.</b> In order to attract farmers/smallholders of land in Musi Rawis to plant trees to help in climate change mitigation in small-scale, carbon must be sold at $ 62 /t.

The REDD mechanism {{is in charge of}} distilling the right incentives for fostering forest conservation with appropriate compensation of foregone revenues, which in turn is related to avoided deforestation (how many hectares of forests are saved). Although any prediction of deforestation rates (i. e. business-as-usual scenarios) is challenging, and any negotiated target is subject to political influence, these two ways have been prioritirized so far. In other words, proposals have focused on a baseline (or cap) -and-trade approach, which relevance is questionable because resulting financial compensations are subject to unfairness if estimations of avoided deforestation are not reliable. Rather than considering overall deforestation (predicted and observed), we argue that a REDD mechanism would gain from linking compensations to real efforts that developing countries implement for slowing deforestation rates. This would provide more efficient incentives to design and enforce suitable policies and measures. The methodology we present to measure these efforts (labeled Compensated Successful Efforts) is based on the rationale that overall deforestation is due partly to structural factors, and partly to domestic policies and measures. This typology differs from others presented in the literature such as proximate / underlying causes, or economic / institutional factors.

The REDD mechanism, still in discussion, would {{be in charge of}} distilling the right incentives and promoting the right policies for fostering forest conservation. The estimation of reduced emissions induced by the mechanism has been raised as an issue, either for issuing the proper amount of carbon credits or for providing appropriate compensations of foregone revenues and other costs to host countries. This estimation would be based on the gap between observed deforestation and a counterfactual value. Although any prediction of deforestation rates (i. e. business-asusual scenarios) is challenging, and any negotiated target is subject to obvious political influence, these two ways have been prioritirized so far to determine the counterfactual value. In other words proposals focused on a results-based approach, the relevance of which is questionable because estimations of avoided deforestation are hardly reliable. With this approach, issuance of carbon credits and distribution of financial compensations could threaten respectively environmental integrity of the scheme and equity outcomes. Rather than considering overall deforestation (predicted and observed), we argue that a REDD mechanism would gain from linking distribution of carbon finance to real efforts (opposed to “results”) that developing countries implement for slowing deforestation rates.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzed}} the financial attractiveness of Clean Development Mechanism Afforestation and Reforestation (CDM A/R) in irrigated agricultural settings. The Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of CDM A/R were estimated {{by analyzing the}} case of Khorezm region in Uzbekistan, where a mixed-species tree plantation was established on marginal cropland. The dual purposes of carbon sequestration and production of fruits, leaves as fodder, and fuelwood were studied over a seven-year rotation period. We compared the opportunity costs of land in marginal agricultural areas between this short-rotation plantation forestry and the annual cultivation of the major crops in the region, i. e., cotton, winter wheat, rice, and maize. The analyses were performed considering different levels of irrigation water availability, from 0 to 30, 000 m 3 /ha, to reflect {{the reality of a}} high variability of water supply in the region. The NPV of CDM A/R ranged between 724 and 5794 USD/ha over seven years, depending on the tree species. Among the latter, Elaeagnus angustifolia L. had the highest profits due to the annually recurring cash flows generated from fruit production. Temporary Certified Emission Reductions (tCER) ranged within 399 – 702 USD/ha after the assumed 7 -year <b>crediting</b> <b>period</b> and would not suffice to cover initial investments and management costs of tree plantations. IRR peaked at 65 % with E. angustifolia under the conventional afforestation and measured − 10 % and 61 % when considering only the tCER and the CDM A/R, respectively. In contrast, other species had higher IRRs in case of the CDM A/R. The total profits from tree plantations exceeded those of both cotton and winter wheat, even with the assumption that there was an optimal irrigation supply for these crops. Rice production was overall the most profitable land use option but required water input of 26, 500 m 3 /ha/year, which is not consistently available for marginal croplands. We argue that the current global average price of 4. 76 USD/tCER is insufficient to initiate forestry-based CDM projects but, in the absence of other incentives, can still motivate forestation of degraded croplands for land rehabilitation and the provisioning of non-timber products. Given the low irrigation needs of trees, 3 – 30 % of the crop water demand, a conversion of degraded cropland to forested areas could save up to 15, 300 m 3 /ha/year at the current tCER price. Combining the monetary value of water and carbon would enlarge the scope for CDM A/R in irrigated drylands, thus enhancing the investments in marginal land rehabilitation and strengthening the resilience of rural populations to the repercussions of climate change...|$|E
