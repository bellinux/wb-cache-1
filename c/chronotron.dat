40|$|In many cases, neurons process {{information}} {{carried by the}} precise timings of spikes. Here we show how neurons can learn to generate specific temporally precise output spikes in response to input patterns of spikes having precise timings, thus processing and memorizing information that is entirely temporally coded, both as input and as output. We introduce two new supervised learning rules for spiking neurons with temporal coding of information (<b>chronotrons),</b> one that provides high memory capacity (E-learning), and one that has a higher biological plausibility (I-learning). With I-learning, the neuron learns to fire the target spike trains through synaptic changes that are proportional to the synaptic currents at the timings of real and target output spikes. We study these learning rules in computer simulations where we train integrate-and-fire neurons. Both learning rules allow neurons to fire at the desired timings, with sub-millisecond precision. We show how <b>chronotrons</b> can learn to classify their inputs, by firing identical, temporally precise spike trains for different inputs belonging to the same class. When the input is noisy, the classification also leads to noise reduction. We compute lower bounds for the memory capacity of <b>chronotrons</b> and {{explore the influence of}} various parameters on chronotrons' performance. The <b>chronotrons</b> can model neurons that encode information in {{the time of the first}} spike relative to the onset of salient stimuli or neurons in oscillatory networks that encode information in the phases of spikes relative to the background oscillation. Our results show that firing one spike per cycle optimizes memory capacity in neurons encoding information in the phase of firing relative to a background rhythm...|$|R

40|$|A neutron time‐of‐flight {{spectrometer}} {{developed for}} the 1 ‐ to 20 ‐Mev region is described. The instrument makes use of the phase bunching of deuterons in the Michigan 42 ‐inch cyclotron and an external beam pulsing system to provide isolated bursts of neutrons of 4 ‐mμsec time duration. Flight times are measured with an improved version of the <b>chronotron</b> capable of a precision of ± 3 × 10 − 10 sec. The energy spread for a 5 ‐meter flight path varies from 3. 5 % at 0. 5 Mev to 10 % at 20 Mev.

40|$|Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) {{were shown}} to be {{suitable}} tools for the processing of spatio-temporal information. However, due to their inherent complexity, the formulation of efficient supervised learning algorithms for SNN is difficult and remains an important problem in the research area. This article presents SPAN – a spiking neuron that is able to learn associations of arbitrary spike trains in a supervised fashion allowing the processing of spatio-temporal information encoded in the precise timing of spikes. The idea of the proposed algorithm is to transform spike trains during the learning phase into analog signals so that common mathematical operations can be performed on them. Using this conversion, {{it is possible to}} apply the well-known Widrow-Hoff rule directly to the transformed spike trains in order to adjust the synaptic weights and to achieve a desired input/output spike behavior of the neuron. In the here presented experimental analysis, the proposed learning algorithm is evaluated regarding its learning capabilities, its memory capacity, its robustness to noisy stimuli and its classification performance. Differences and similarities of SPAN regarding two related algorithms, ReSuMe and <b>Chronotron,</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Precise spike timing as a {{means to}} encode {{information}} in neural networks is biologically supported, and is advantageous over frequency-based codes by processing input features on a much shorter time-scale. For these reasons, much recent attention has been focused on the development of supervised learning rules for spiking neural networks that utilise a temporal coding scheme. However, despite significant progress in this area, there still lack rules that are theoretically justified, and yet can be considered biologically relevant. Here we examine the general conditions under which optimal synaptic plasticity takes place to support the supervised learning of a precise temporal code. As part of our analysis we introduce two analytically derived learning rules, one of which relies on an instantaneous error signal to optimise synaptic weights in a network (INST rule), and the other one relying on a filtered error signal to minimise the variance of synaptic weight modifications (FILT rule). We test the optimality of the solutions provided by each rule with respect to their temporal encoding precision, and then measure the maximum number of input patterns they can learn to memorise using the precise timings of individual spikes. Our results demonstrate the optimality of the FILT rule in most cases, underpinned by the rule's error-filtering mechanism which provides smooth convergence during learning. We also find the FILT rule to be most efficient at performing input pattern memorisations, and most noticeably when patterns are identified using spikes with sub-millisecond temporal precision. In comparison with existing work, we determine the performance of the FILT rule to be consistent with that of the highly efficient E-learning <b>Chronotron</b> rule, but with the distinct advantage that our FILT rule is also implementable as an online method for increased biological realism...|$|E
40|$|European eels (Anguilla Anguilla), an {{endangered}} species with high economic value, exhibit very unusual features in their multistage catadromous life cycle at different life stages. The reproduction of eel {{takes place in the}} Sargasso Sea. Leptocephalus larvae use ocean currents (mainly the Gulf Stream) to migrate to European coastal areas, and then metamorphose into glass eels probably as they reach the continental shelf. Glass eel then, enter estuaries to join the fresh waters network. Knowledge about glass eel biology and migration has mainly increased in the eighties, and it is now well established that the activity during the estuary migration depends mainly on tidal cycle, even if lunar and circadian rhythms and/or direct influence of light and tidal coefficient may interact. Different migratory tactics are suspected on the basis of recent laboratory experiments (Bolliet & Labonne, 2008; Bureau du Colombier et al., 2009), notably the existence of individuals swimming only with the current, others swimming with and against the current, and others presenting a weak degree of activity. The propensity to migrate and glass eels energy content would be linked and may result in different migratory behaviours possibly leading to estuarine settlement (Bureau du Colombier et al., 2007; 2009). Unfortunately, few are known about the glass eel swimming behaviours in estuaries, a crucial point to better understand their estuarine migration: such knowledge would help to characterize the migratory tactics and to better understand the link with energy status. The videotracking system [EthoVision Color-Pro 3. 1 (Noldus Information Technology) ] which allows to measure automatically the movements of individuals represents an interesting tool to progress in this questioning. Nowadays, video tracking to measure fish behaviours is relatively frequent, but is rather rare in the ecological studies. Moreover, tracking a transparent animal, under water current conditions is a real challenge, particularly at night. To detect the individuals, several eels are marked by a fluorescent VIE tag (Visible Implant Elastomer, Northwest Marine Technology Inc.). VIE do no affect growth, survival and behaviour of tagged glass eels. Initially developed to improve the identification of individual tags in mark-recapture studies of aquatic animals, VIE tags are used here for a new extreme application in ethometry: the study of behaviours of transparent animals in weaker luminosity and in the dark by automatic tracking technology. The individual identification is based on the fluorescent color (red, blue, yellow and green) emitted by the VIE tag injected in the muscle mass on the basis of dorsal fin. The detection of the four marks is excellent. It allows measuring the activity (notably path and speed) of each tagged individuals as a function of tidal and nycthemeral rhythms in the same <b>chronotron</b> (circular aquarium simulating the estuarine conditions) and spatial use at a wide time scale from second to week. Another advantage is the possibility of tracked animals to go out the analysed arena without error of identification when it appears again in the analysed zone. This multitracking method by fluorescent VIE tags could be applied to a large number of species (crustaceans, fish, holothurians, amphibians, …).
