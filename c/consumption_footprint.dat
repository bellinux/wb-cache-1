40|$|Brick-manufacturing is an {{intensive}} water-consuming industry {{that requires a}} sustainable and integrated water management strategy to reduce reliance on freshwater consumption. This study aims to develop a rigorous analytical tool based on water footprint principles and water pinch analysis techniques {{that can be used}} to manage and optimise water consumption. By performing thorough water audits, the water <b>consumption</b> <b>footprint</b> (the sum of blue and green water footprints) and the theoretical water pollution footprint (grey water footprint) were quantified. The total water <b>consumption</b> <b>footprint</b> of a brick is determined as 2. 02 L, of which blue water is identified as 1. 71 L (84. 8 %) and green water as 0. 31 L (15. 2 %). The theoretical grey water footprint of a brick was found to be 1. 3 L, a value that would have been higher if in-situ wastewater treatment had not been operated before effluent discharge. In order to reduce the water footprint of a brick, water pinch analysis techniques were applied for the brick-manufacturing processes. Two water recovery schemes were explored, i. e. direct re-use/recycle and water regeneration. For the former, water targeting was first carried out using the material recovery pinch diagram. Next, an algebraic technique was utilised for the targeting of water regeneration, where an interception unit is used to partially purify the water sources for further re-use/recycle. The network that fulfils the water flow rate targets was then designed using the nearest neighbour algorithm. The calculation indicates that direct re-use/recycle scheme reduces with the standard water <b>consumption</b> <b>footprint</b> reduced only by 15. 6 %. Water regeneration scheme, on the other hand improved the current value (which relies on an unsystematic water regeneration scheme) by 56. 4 %. The analysis clearly shows that the water <b>consumption</b> <b>footprint</b> of a brick is improved when the brick-manufacturing industry operates sustainable water management strategies. This study, a first of its kind, demonstrates that integration of water pinch analysis coupled with water footprint concepts, provides a robust and effective tool for the manufacturing industries that aim for sustainable water consumption...|$|E

40|$|The Renewable Fuels Standard 2 (RFS 2) is an {{important}} component of alternative transportation fuels policy in the United States (US). By mandating the production of alternative fuels, RFS 2 attempts to address a number of imperfections in the transportation fuels market: US economic vulnerability to volatile prices; security and environmental externalities; and a lack of investment in alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels. Although RFS 2 aims to reduce the climate impact of transportation fuels, the policy raises a number of additional environmental concerns, including the water and land resource requirements of alternative fuel production. These factors should be considered {{in order to determine the}} overall environmental viability of alternatives to petroleum-derived transportation fuels. Middle distillate (MD) fuels, including diesel and jet fuel, are of particular interest because they currently make up almost 30 % of liquid fuel consumption in the US, and alternative MD fuels could potentially satisfy 21 of the 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels mandated by RFS 2 in 2022. This thesis quantifies the lifecycle blue (surface and ground) water <b>consumption</b> <b>footprint</b> of MD from conventional crude oil; Fischer-Tropsch (FT) MD from natural gas and coal; fermentation and advanced fermentation (AF) MD from biomass; and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) MD and biodiesel from oilseed crops, in the US. FT and rainfed biomass-derived MD have lifecycle blue water consumption footprints between 1. 4 and 18. 1 lwater/lMD, comparable to conventional MD, between 4. 1 and 7. 5 lwater/lMD. Irrigated biomass-derived MD has a lifecycle blue water <b>consumption</b> <b>footprint</b> potentially several orders of magnitude larger, between 2. 5 and 5300 lwater/lMD.

40|$|The Water Footprint, as an {{indicator}} of water consumption has become increasingly popular for analyzing environmental issues {{associated with the use of}} water resources in the global supply chain of consumer goods. This is particularly relevant for countries like the UK, which increasingly rely on products produced elsewhere in the world and thus impose pressures on foreign water resources. Existing studies calculating water footprints are mostly based on process analysis, and results are mainly available at the national level. The current paper assesses the domestic and foreign water requirements for UK final consumption by applying an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model in combination with geo-demographic consumer segmentation data. This approach allows us to calculate water footprints (both direct and indirect) for different products as well as different geographies within the UK. We distinguished between production and <b>consumption</b> <b>footprints</b> where the former is the total water consumed from the UK domestic water resources by the production activities in the UK and the latter is the total water consumed from both domestic and global water resources to satisfy the UK domestic final consumption. The results show that the production water footprint is 439 m 3 /cap/year, 85 % of which is for the final consumption in the UK itself. The average <b>consumption</b> water <b>footprint</b> of the UK is more than three times bigger than the UK production water footprint in 2006. About half of the UK <b>consumption</b> water <b>footprints</b> were associated with imports from Non-OECD countries (many of which are water-scarce), while around 19 % were from EU-OECD countries, and only 3 % from Non-EU-OECD countries. We find that the water footprint differs considerably across sub-national geographies in the UK, and the differences are as big as 273 m 3 /cap/year for the internal water footprint and 802 m 3 /cap/year for the external water footprint. Our results suggest that this is mainly explained by differences in the average income level across the UK. We argue that the information provided by our model at different spatial scales can be very useful for informing integrated water supply and demand side management...|$|R

Therefore, based on four case studies with two industrial consumers, one energy consulting company and one electricity retailer, this paper investigates the factors that influence industrial consumers’ acceptance of smart grid solutions, and how the influential factors are relevant to the smart grid adoption phases. Eleven influential factors are identified that impact on four stages for industrial consumers’ adoption of smart grid solutions (inscription, translation, framing, and stabilization stages).

40|$|The {{consumption}} of internationally traded goods causes multiple socio-environmental impacts. Current methods linking production impacts to final consumption typically trace {{the origin of}} products back to the country level, lacking fine-scale spatial resolution. This hampers accurate calculation of trade and <b>consumption</b> <b>footprints,</b> masking and distorting the causal links between consumers' choices and their environmental impacts, especially in countries with large spatial variability in socio-environmental conditions and production impacts. Here we present the SEI-PCS model (Spatially Explicit Information on Production to Consumption Systems), which allows for fine-scale sub-national assessments of the origin of, and socio-environmental impacts embedded in, traded commodities. The method connects detailed production data at sub-national scales (e. g., municipalities or provinces), information on domestic flows of goods and in international trade. The model permits the downscaling of country-to-country trade analyses based on either physical allocation from bilateral trade matrices or MR 10 models. The importance of producing more spatially-explicit trade analyses is illustrated by identifying the municipalities of Brazil from which different countries source the Brazilian soy they consume. Applications for improving consumption accounting and policy assessment are discussed, including quantification of externalities of consumption, consumer labeling, trade leakages, sustainable resource supply and traceability...|$|R

Better exploitation although comes with higher complexity. System architects need {{to take into account the}} efficiency of systems units, i. e.

The results show that the production and consumption activities outside of the basin also contributed to the water stress in the YRB, particularly the water scarce lower reach. Chapter 5 applied input-output structural decomposition analysis (10 SDA) to identify the key driving forces for China's regional CO 2 emissions 2002 - 2007 and found that increases of final consumption such as urban household consumption, capital investment and export were the key driving forces for most of China's regions.

The Haihe River Basin {{is an extremely}} water stressed hydrological system, which encompasses the two megacities of Beijing and Tianjin, and is experiencing the detrimental impacts of the recent unprecedented economic growth on its scarce water resources. We applied an integrated multi-regional input-output (MRIO) hydro-economic model combined with the Water Scarcity Index to analyze the total and scarce water <b>consumption,</b> <b>footprint,</b> and embedded flows in interregional trade in the Haihe River Basin. The study shows that in 2007, the total water footprint (WF) of the Basin was approximately 37. 1 billion m 3 (277 m 3 per capita), of which the ‘scarce’ WF was approximately 26. 7 billion m 3 or 72 % of the total WF. In line with its high level of water scarcity, the Basin’s net import level of virtual water was 11. 3 billion m 3 (84 m 3 per capita), with the total import of 25. 9 billion m 3 and total export of 14. 6 billion m 3. In contrast, the Basin’s net import level of virtual scarce water is at a moderate scale of 1. 8 billion m 3, with the import of 15. 7 billion m 3 and export of 13. 9 billion m 3. While it is highly desirable to import more virtual water from water rich regions, a caution is needed in importing virtual scarce water because the latter will lead to greater water stress in other water scarce regions.

40|$|International audienceIn {{communication}} systems channel quality variation, mostly induced by interferences, mobility, and environmental factors, is an unhindered physical phenomenon, {{which is usually}} perceived as a threat in pursuing reliable communication. There is a direct relation between the channel condition {{and the amount of}} computational resources and energy that have to be spend in order to reconstruct the correct messages at the reception side. When the quality is good, the decoding requires less resources and energy to identify and correct channel condition induced message errors, while when the channel noise level is high more resources and energy are needed to correct the errors. To be able to properly handle high noise levels while keeping the QoS requirements satisfied, telecom platforms are built upon largely over-designed hardware, i. e., they rely on worse case designs, which results in a substantial energy waste during most of their operation. In this chapter we introduce a methodology to dynamically adapt the platform operation mode to the channel noise level. The main objective is to keep QoS requirements satisfied regardless of the actual channel conditions while minimizing the energy <b>consumption</b> <b>footprint.</b> In particular, we propose a technique to exploit channel noise variability towards energy effective LDPC decoding amenable to adaptable low-energy operation. Endowed with the instantaneous channel noise level knowledge, our technique dynamically adjusts the operating voltage on-the-fly, aiming to achieve the optimal tradeoff between decoder performance and energy consumption without ignoring the fulfillment of the QoS requirements expressed in terms of frame/bit error rate. To demonstrate the capabilities of our proposal we implemented it and other state of the art energy reduction methods in the framework of a fully parallel LDPC decoder mapped on a Virtex- 6 FPGA. Our experiments indicate that the proposed technique outperforms state of the art counterparts, in terms of energy reduction, with 71  % to 76  % and 15  % to 28  %, w. r. t. early termination without and with DVS, respectively, while maintaining the targeted decoding robustness. Moreover, the measurements suggest that in certain conditions Degradation Stochastic Resonance occurs, i. e., timing faults caused by unpredictable underpowered components in the circuit unexpectedly become supporters rather than enemies of the decoding process...|$|E
40|$|The Ecological Footprint {{methodology}} by Global Footprint Network measures {{human consumption}} {{of products and}} services from different ecosystems {{in terms of the}} amount of bioproductive land and sea area needed to supply these products and services. In other words, the Ecological Footprint calculates the land area needed to produce food, provide resources, produce energy, and absorb the CO 2 emissions generated by the supply chains within one year at country level. For the calculations of Luxembourg’s Ecological Footprint, international statistical databases are used to identify the quantities of produced, imported and exported goods and services. Then, Global Footprint Network applies different factors to the quantities to assess the area needed to supply these products and services. Finally, the <b>Consumption</b> <b>Footprint</b> of a nation is divided by the number of inhabitants and compared to other countries at a per capita level (global hectares per capita). This means that the Ecological Footprint can be used as an indicator for the sustainability of a national consumption by assessing human land uses. In the following paragraph, Luxembourg’s Ecological Footprint is discussed in the framework of the environmental indicators of Luxembourg’s competitiveness scoreboard (see Table 9) [MECE, 2010]. Luxembourg’s ranking is rather low for all of the scoreboard indicators: number of ISO 9001 certifications per billion of inhabitants (21 out of 27); number of ISO 14001 certifications per billion of inhabitants (15 out of 27); total greenhouse gas emissions (15 out of 27); renewable energy ration (23 out of 27); quantity of municipal waste per capita per year (24 out of 27); energetic intensity (8 out of 27); transport by car (17 out of 27); Ecological Footprint in gha per capita per year (27 out of 27). Based on the environmental competiveness scoreboard indicators, it can be concluded that in general, Luxembourg’s environmental performance is low compared to the other countries of the European Union.

How do regions compare relatively to their production and <b>consumption</b> <b>footprints?</b> These results are designed to be a first step towards scenario analysis for decision-aiding that would also include socioeconomic indicators. Examples of such scenarios are discussed in the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{differentiation}} {{and optical}} Hilbert transformation play {{important roles in}} communications, computing, information processing and signal analysis in optical domain which offering huge bandwidth. Meanwhile, silicon-based photonic integrated circuits are preferable in all-optical signal processing due to their intrinsic advantages of low power <b>consumption,</b> compact <b>footprint</b> and ultra-high speed. In this study, we analyze the interrelation between first-order optical differentiation and optical Hilbert transformation and then experimentally demonstrate a feasible integrated scheme which can simultaneously function as first-order optical differentiation and optical Hilbert transformation based on a single microdisk resonator. This finding may motivate the development of integrated optical signal processors. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{accounting}} for {{environmental impacts of}} products, processes, and systems during the design phase is increasing. Numerous studies have undertaken investigations for reducing environmental impacts across the product life cycle. Efforts have also been launched to quantify such impacts more accurately. Life cycle energy <b>consumption</b> and carbon <b>footprint</b> {{are among the most}} frequently adopted and investigated environmental performance metrics. As efforts continue to incorporate environmental sustainability into product design, struggles persist in concurrent consideration of environmental impacts resulting from the manufacturing processes and supply chain network design. Thus, the objective of this research is to present a framework for reducing product cradle-to-gate energy <b>consumption</b> and carbon <b>footprint</b> through simultaneous consideration of manufacturing processes and supply chain activities. The framework developed in this thesis relies on unit process modeling, and is demonstrated for production of a bicycle pedal. It is shown that simultaneous consideration of manufacturing and supply chain processes can impact decision-making and improve product environmental sustainability at the design stage...|$|R

We integrated extended mix multi-regional input-output model with water scarcity to analyze <b>consumption</b> water <b>footprint</b> and virtual water flows in inter-regional trade of energy production in China. The {{results show that}} electricity is the dominant sector of scarce water consumption per unit energy product in China. Remarkable regional difference is manifested for scarce water footprint per unit electricity production. Non-electrical energy production is recommended in north and northwest China due to both high water and scarce water consumptions. In the regions with lower scarce water consumptions, however, electrical industry is suggested to be developed, such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian and Hainan provinces...|$|R

A programmable reference level gives the flexibility of moving the amplifier’s output baseline up or down to match the range of certain test signals such as haversines which are unidirectional. A 12 -bit DAC (DAC 7311) with low-power <b>consumption</b> and small <b>footprint</b> was used to implement both DAC 1 and DAC 2.|$|R
