5|$|England <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{their second}} innings, and with Bradman {{predominantly}} reliant on his seamers, Johnson bowled only seven overs {{on the third}} afternoon as the hosts closed at 3/174 from 69 overs. Late in the day, Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80. Washbrook reached stumps unbeaten on 85, and Johnson's miss only cost five runs, as the fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day. Johnson ended with 0/16 from seven overs.|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} started several minutes late {{due to the}} damp {{conditions}} from the earlier rain. A red flag briefly <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the No. 5 Swiss Spirit Lola {{a few minutes after}} the session began due to the car being stopped {{at the side of the}} track. Although the track was drying, it was not until the last half hour that teams were able to improve on their first session times. The No. 2 Audi and No. 8 Peugeot swapped the pole position multiple times before the session ended with the No. 8 Peugeot claiming the top position on the final lap of the session with a time of 3:26.344. In GT1 the No. 008 Larbre Aston Martin took the class lead on the final lap with a 3:50.761. The LMP2 and GT2 classes saw very little improvement; the class leading teams remained the same.|$|E
5|$|The teams <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{the second}} half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan {{released}} Allen {{but he was}} not quick enough to make something of the chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.|$|E

5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
5|$|On lap 241, {{the pace}} car <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the eighth and final caution, after Joey Logano {{collided}} with the outside wall. McMurray led on the restart, but Stewart reclaimed the lead on lap 247. Seven laps later, Johnson was forced to pit due to a loose wheel. By lap 257, Stewart had a lead of over one second. Five laps later, Hamlin claimed sixth from Harvick. During the 263rd lap, Bowyer passed McMurray for second. Four laps later, Newman passed Kyle Busch for tenth position. After 269 laps, Stewart lead was over Bowyer was 1.6 seconds. Six laps later, Hamlin moved into fifth position after passing Earnhardt. During lap 290, Hamlin passed McMurray for third. With two laps remaining, Stewart and Burton both ran out of fuel, handing the lead back to Bowyer. Bowyer maintained the lead to win his first race of the 2010 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of McMurray in third, Earnhardt in fourth, and Harvick in fifth.|$|E
5|$|The School of International and Public Affairs extends {{invitations to}} {{heads of state}} and heads of {{government}} who come to New York City {{for the opening of}} the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased {{with the fact that the}} Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus. Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the historic occasion.|$|E

25|$|The players reluctantly <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{the second}} half as {{conditions}} got steadily worse. Most of the 1,500 spectators had decided that a warm seat by the fireside was infinitely more enjoyable than standing around a muddy field.|$|E
25|$|Next, Maven and Matt Hardy <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> their {{scheduled}} match but attacked {{one another}} outside the ring. Hardy threw Maven into the ring, where a furious Batista attacked Maven and executed a powerbomb. As Maven could not compete, the referee canceled his match against Hardy.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{knocked out}} of the Chase, Earnhardt {{continued}} to be consistent. At Martinsville, he led 79 laps and was leading with ten laps to go when a caution <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a wreck between Kyle Larson and Marcos Ambrose. On the resulting restart, Earnhardt was running 5th. During the restart, he slipped through the pack and overtook Tony Stewart for the lead in turn 4. He continued to hold the lead to win the race ahead of Jeff Gordon. It was Earnhardt's first career win at Martinsville.|$|E

When he was relieved {{in the beginning of the}} 9th inning, he received a very long and memorable standing ovation and <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a curtain call after being congratulated by the players. Despite his outing, he was awarded a no-decision, and the Jays lost 6–2 in extra innings.|$|E
25|$|On lap 26 Massa {{attempted}} to pass David Coulthard. The two collided; Coulthard {{retired from the}} race with serious damage to his car. Coulthard was irate at Massa after the race for not apologising for the incident. The safety car <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the second time. Massa retired on lap 29 with Ferrari's first engine failure of the race. Räikkönen, who had been about to pit, had to stay out. Despite this he did not pit when the pit was re-opened two laps later, preferring {{to move up the}} field as other drivers pitted.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, of the 11 {{states in which}} {{amendments}} defining marriage were on the ballot, all passed handily. Bush won in nine, including Ohio.

Notably, a vast majority of these states have not voted for a Democrat in many years. The two states that Bush did not win, Michigan and Oregon, still passed amendments limiting official recognition of marriage to one man one woman unions.|$|E

25|$|Returning to Pocono, Earnhardt started 9th. He ran {{inside the}} Top 10 {{for most of}} the race, and took the lead from Greg Biffle with 14 laps to go. Earnhardt had built up a lead in excess of three seconds when the caution <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> Kurt Busch's cut tire on lap 154, erasing his lead. He then sweated out a four lap shootout on the last restart to take his 3rd win of the year, marking the first time since 2006 that a driver swept both Pocono races (Denny Hamlin was the last driver). This win tied Earnhardt with Jimmie Johnson and Brad Keselowski for most wins of the season up to that point.|$|E
25|$|As {{the crash}} {{happened}} with 3 laps remaining, {{the race was}} extended according to NASCAR's Green–white–checker finish policy. Clint Bowyer led the field to the green flag on lap 331; however, {{he did not get}} the white flag under green, as the eleventh caution <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a six car crash in turn 3, which included Jamie McMurray, Bowyer, Kyle Busch, Martin, Truex Jr., and Hamlin. There was also a lead change on the same lap, with Kurt Busch passing Bowyer and Paul Menard. Kurt Busch continued to hold off Matt Kenseth to win his first race of the year. This race also marked as the longest race in Atlanta Motor Speedway history, as the race was extended to 341 laps total, surpassing the 330 laps of the previous year's Kobalt Tools 500.|$|E
25|$|On lap 44 Timo Glock ran wide {{onto the}} grass and {{the bottom of his}} car hit two {{substantial}} bumps, the second of which caused it to briefly fly {{up in the air and}} land with force sufficient to break the suspension, leaving the monocoque in contact with the ground and unable to be stopped, resulting in a sizable accident. Glock spun twice and came to rest against the wall further down the track. He was forced to retire and the safety car <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a third time. On the same lap, due to a false signal from the chief mechanic, Barrichello left a pit stop before the fuel hose had been removed from his car. Several mechanics suffered minor injuries. He would also serve a ten-second penalty for this pit stop as it was taken while the pit lane was closed. Ultimately he was disqualified for exiting the pitlane when the red light was on.|$|E

25|$|Lyon {{began their}} Champions League quest at home taking on Fiorentina. Lyon also {{unveiled}} their fluorescent green third kit in this match. As with the Nice match, which occurred {{just four days}} before, this match {{had its share of}} controversy. Following a disappointing first half, with Fiorentina leading 0–2 after two goals from Alberto Gilardino, Lyon <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the second half with scoring in mind. With Lyon attacking, following a cross into the box, a collision occurred just inside the field of play between Frédéric Piquionne and Fiorentina defender Luciano Zauri, which unexpectedly injured the latter. Following a clearance by the Fiorentina defence, it was expected, by Fiorentina, that the ball would be put out of play with fair play being in mind. However, with Lyon trailing 0–2 and several Lyon players not having any idea of Zauri being down, they proceeded to attack and eventually a goal was scored by Piquionne. Following this incident, Lyon still trailed 1–2, but in the 86th minute, after earning a free kick, Juninho and Benzema proceeded to display excellent and sly teamwork as Benzema equalised for his side drawing the match 2–2 and giving both clubs one point through one round.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Johnson {{began his}} {{season with a}} 14th-place finish in the 2013 Sprint Unlimited when he crashed on lap 14 along with Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon, and Denny Hamlin. Afterward, he placed fourth in the first Budweiser Duel, {{resulting}} in a ninth-place starting position in the 2013 Daytona 500. In the Daytona 500, Johnson started well, assuming the lead from Jeff Gordon on lap 33 and leading a handful of laps before falling {{back to the middle}} of the pack. Over the last few laps, Johnson was racing alongside Brad Keselowski for the lead until a caution <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> debris. Johnson took the advantage of leading on the last restart. With five laps to go, Johnson led a lane with Greg Biffle and Danica Patrick. He then held off a last lap charge from Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Mark Martin to win his second Daytona 500. This was Johnson's first Daytona 500 win with regular crew chief Chad Knaus, as he won the 2006 race with Darian Grubb as Knaus was serving a five-race suspension. It was also the first time since his 2006 win that he finished better than 27th in the Daytona 500, after a streak of six years where he had never finished better than 27th because of crashes and mechanical failures.|$|E
25|$|In the Australian Grand Prix, he and {{teammate}} Pedro de la Rosa {{were unable}} to qualify. In Malaysia, both the HRTs managed to qualify, with Karthikeyan starting 23rd due to a 5-place gear box penalty for Heikki Kovalainen, the start was wet and the HRTs gambled to start the race on full wet tyres, whilst the other cars started on intermediate tyres. As the rain increased that gamble paid off as other cars had to pit for full wets which promoted Karthikeyan to a points-paying tenth place before the safety car then red flag <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> heavy rain. At the restart, after a few laps more laps behind the safety car, the track was dry enough for intermediate tyres and a few drivers pitted as the safety car came back in, however Karthikeyan stayed out and was as high as 5th place at one point, before McLaren's Jenson Button crashed into him whilst they were racing for position. Karthikeyan suffered damage however, but he pitted for intermediate tyres which dropped him {{to the back of}} the field, bar teammate de la Rosa who had a served a drive-through penalty. On lap 47, Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel received a puncture after hitting Karthikeyan's front wing, whilst lapping him and Vettel was forced to pit and replaced the punctured tyre which put Vettel down from 4th place, finishing 11th; Karthikeyan finished the race in 21st, however he was given a 20-second post-race penalty for his part in the collision, which meant Karthikeyan dropped to 22nd and last, behind de la Rosa.|$|E
