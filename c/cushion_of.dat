25|$|The Hoover Constellation was a spherical canister-type {{vacuum cleaner}} notable for {{its lack of}} wheels. Floating on a <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> air, it was a {{domestic}} hovercraft. They were not especially good as vacuum cleaners as the air escaping from under the cushion blew uncollected dust in all directions, nor as hovercraft as their lack of a skirt meant that they only hovered effectively over a smooth surface. Despite this, original Constellations are sought-after collectibles today.|$|E
25|$|As well as Saunders-Roe and Vickers (which {{combined}} in 1966 {{to form the}} British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC)), other commercial craft were developed during the 1960s in the UK by Cushioncraft (part of the Britten-Norman Group) and Hovermarine based at Woolston (the latter being sidewall hovercraft, where {{the sides of the}} hull projected down into the water to trap the <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> air with normal hovercraft skirts at the bow and stern). One of these models, the HM-2, was used by Red Funnel between Southampton (near the Woolston Floating Bridge) and Cowes.|$|E

25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require light control inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher air density and lack of a power assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. Control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> air provided by the high-lift wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E
25|$|The {{first leg}} of United's quarter-final against Roma was played at the Stadio Olimpico on 1 April 2008. Ryan Giggs started the match on the bench, which meant that Rio Ferdinand was handed the {{captaincy}} and Park Ji-sung was given his first Champions League appearance of the season, while Michael Carrick {{was able to take}} his position in the midfield three despite having missed the team's training session the day before. The match started fairly evenly, but it was Roma who had the first meaningful attempt on goal, with Christian Panucci heading just over from a corner. On the half hour, United's defence suffered a major setback as Nemanja Vidić fell awkwardly after jumping for a header. His place in central defence was taken by John O'Shea. Nevertheless, with just five minutes of the half remaining, the ball broke to Paul Scholes on the right hand side of the Roma penalty area. With his options limited, he played a ball at head-height into the centre of the penalty area, where Cristiano Ronaldo, who had just run full speed from near the centre circle, was ready to power a header past Roma keeper Doni. Buoyed by the <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> the away goal, United started the second half confidently, prising a desperate Roma side apart with crisp passing along the floor. On the hour mark, in response to a header on goal by Mirko Vučinić that brought about a world class save from Edwin van der Sar, Alex Ferguson called for his team to adopt a more conservative formation, bringing on Owen Hargreaves to replace Anderson. United seemed more comfortable playing in a 4–4–2 formation, and the change paid immediate dividends, as Rooney pounced on Doni's mishandling of Park's header to poke the ball home for 2–0. The Reds continued to threaten, but were forced to defend well to prevent Roma from taking any goals with them to Old Trafford. The match finished 2–0, putting United in a comfortable position going into the second leg on 9 April.|$|E

Its appeal lies in part in her intriguing stare, accentuated by the slight misalignment of her eyes, while the eyebrows are faintly skewed.|$|E
500|$|His {{death and}} funeral {{were treated with}} the same respect afforded to English monarchs before him. On 20 September, his body was moved to Somerset House to lie in state, which was {{opened to the public}} on 18 October. The body had been embalmed, {{shrouded}} and sealed in a lead coffin, which in turn was placed in a wooden decorated coffin, placed next to a life-like effigy. The effigy was decorated with the royal symbols, including: [...] "a rich Suit of uncut Velvet...laced with a rich gold lace, and furr'd with Ermins; upon the Kirtle is the Royal large Robe of the like Purple Velvet laced, and fur'd with Ermins, with rich strings, and tassels of gold...upon his head, the Cap of Regality of Purple Velvet, furr'd with Ermins...upon the <b>Cushion</b> <b>of</b> the Chair stands the Imperial Crown set with stones." [...] The elaborate funeral procession, delayed twice by hesitant preparations, made its way through London on 23 November 1658. The body itself had already been buried at Westminster Abbey two weeks earlier due to its fast decay (by the time of the funeral procession, he had been dead over two months). A catafalque had been erected to receive his coffin which was similar to that of King James I, only [...] "much more stately and expensive".|$|E

[...] While the film continued, the injured were escorted to the facility's first-aid room and about 50 people in the immediate area were moved {{to the back of the}} theater. [...] After the film and the following stage show concluded an hour-and-a-half later, the police roped off 150 seats in the area of the explosion and began the search for evidence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{electric}} machine was soon further improved by Andrew (Andreas) Gordon, a Scotsman {{and professor at}} Erfurt, who substituted a glass cylinder {{in place of a}} glass globe; and by Giessing of Leipzig who added a [...] "rubber" [...] consisting of a <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> woollen material. The collector, consisting of a series of metal points, was added to the machine by Benjamin Wilson about 1746, and in 1762, John Canton of England (also the inventor of the first pith-ball electroscope) improved the efficiency of {{electric machine}}s by sprinkling an amalgam of tin over the surface of the rubber. In 1768, Jesse Ramsden constructed a widely used version of a plate electrical generator.|$|E

2500|$|Ships as {{far away}} as South Africa rocked as tsunamis hit them, and the bodies of victims were found {{floating}} in the ocean for months after the event. The tsunamis which accompanied the eruption are believed to have been caused by gigantic pyroclastic flows entering the sea; each of the four great explosions was accompanied by massive pyroclastic flows resulting from the gravitational collapse of the eruption columns. This caused several cubic kilometers of material to enter the sea, displacing an equally huge volume of seawater. The town of Merak was destroyed by a tsunami [...] high. Some of the pyroclastic flows reached the Sumatran coast as much as [...] away, having apparently moved across the water on a <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> superheated steam.

By 1929 he believed he had solved the weight problem, by using cast magnesium instead of steel, and had also managed to improve the design of the suit's joints by using a trapped <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> oil to keep the surfaces moving smoothly.

2500|$|Fisher and his {{partners}} began looking into the idea of paving the track with bricks or concrete. Paving in 1909 was still relatively new {{with only a few}} miles of public roads paved, leaving little knowledge of what would work best. Traction tests were conducted on bricks, proving they could hold up. Less than a month after the first car races, the repaving project began. Five Indiana manufacturers supplied 3.2million [...] bricks to the track. Each was hand laid over a [...] <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> sand, then leveled and the gaps filled with mortar. At the same time, a concrete wall [...] tall was constructed in front of the main grandstand and around all four corners to protect spectators. The final brick added to the track was made of gold and laid in a special ceremony by Governor Thomas R. Marshall. Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track the [...] "Brickyard". Today, , or one yard, of original bricks remain exposed at the start-finish line.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mixed}} reviews critics {{generally}} praised Lewis's voice but criticised the music. Lyndsey Winship from BBC Music complimented Lewis's vocal ability but perceived {{a lack of}} [...] "hooks, innovation and personality". On Lewis's vocals Robert Christgau commented [...] "The subtle flutter of her finest melismatics could give an open-minded person goose bumps. Her coarser melismatics, however, are the usual showoff BS and probably also a commercial prerequisite, like not having a harelip." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised Lewis's voice but criticised the mixture of styles within the album. The New York Timess Nate Chinen felt the album did {{not live up to}} the standards of lead single [...] "Bleeding Love", but was successful in showcasing Lewis's vocal capabilities. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was disappointed, saying [...] " [...] has clearly invested every scrap of energy into these songs [...] but being able to belt 'em out is only half the story, and if there's a personality here, it's well hidden." [...] Victoria Segal of The Times praised Lewis's voice, but criticised the music, saying [...] " [...] has a powerful voice but on Spirit it seems to have paralysed her collaborators creatively. Instead of taking the opportunity to craft it into new and exciting shapes, it has been stuck in a big spotlit display case, revolving slowly and rather boringly on a velvet <b>cushion</b> <b>of</b> overstuffed balladry." [...] She concluded by saying, [...] "If Lewis is looking for the greatest love of all – public adoration – she will have to do better than this." ...|$|E
