5|$|A {{third round}} of {{guidelines}} was issued in April 2012 when the company {{announced that it would}} begin phasing in a plan to stop purchasing poultry and pork products from suppliers that caged animals. With this announcement, Burger King became the first American Fast food company to promise to purchase 100% of its eggs from companies that did not utilize wire battery cages and pork from suppliers that did not use gestational cages for sows. This is an increase of the percentage of cage free products from 9% of egg purchases and 20% of pork purchases the <b>company</b> <b>made</b> in 2008. The plan should be completed by 2017.|$|E

5|$|After this NSS {{decided not}} to obtain many {{additional}} restaurants, as it did not see value in such a strategy. From 1930 through 1934 the company took over restaurants at Ål, Jaren, Lillestrøm and Tønsberg, along with dining service on the steamship Skibladner, which ran on Mjøsa. During {{the first half of}} the 1940s it again acquired new restaurants, including the one at Kristiansand Station. In 1940 and 1941 the <b>company</b> <b>made</b> a solid profit, but lack of food from 1942 onwards transformed the profit to a loss. During the late 1940s NSS also took over the restaurants at Drammen and Sarpsborg, as well as the one at Oslo Airport, Fornebu.|$|E
5|$|After working {{together}} on other projects, director Martin Ritt and Paul Newman co-founded Salem Productions and the <b>company</b> <b>made</b> a three-film deal with Paramount Studios. For its first film Salem hired husband-and-wife scriptwriters Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr., who worked with Ritt and Newman on The Long, Hot Summer. Ravetch found Larry McMurtry's novel, Horseman, Pass By, in an airport shop during a Dallas stopover and presented the project to Ritt and Newman after reading a description of Hud Bannon. The partners met Ravetch and Frank at their home, approved the project and the writers adapted the script.|$|E
5|$|Australian Prime Minister John Curtin officially {{announced}} {{the loss of}} the cruiser during the afternoon of 30 November. Sydneys destruction was a major blow to Australian morale and military capability: her ship's <b>company</b> <b>made</b> up 35% of the RAN's wartime casualties. The cruiser's loss did not have the same impact internationally; two British capital ships were destroyed during the same fortnight, and Japan entered World War II with attacks on Pearl Harbor and Singapore three weeks later.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{his work}} as a lawyer, Alexander Rutherford was {{involved}} in a number of business enterprises. He was President of the Edmonton Mortgage Corporation, and Vice President and solicitor of the Great Western Garment Company. This latter enterprise, which Rutherford co-founded, was a great success: established in 1911 with eight seamstresses, it had quadrupled in size within a year. During the Second World War, the Great Western Garment <b>Company</b> <b>made</b> military uniforms and was reputed to be the largest garment operation in the British Empire. It was acquired by Levi Strauss & Co. in 1961, but continued to manufacture garments in Edmonton until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The <b>company</b> <b>made</b> two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch {{of a new generation}} of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The <b>company</b> <b>made</b> losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E

5|$|George Trice {{retired in}} 1948 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Derek, who sold Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route {{numbering}} was introduced {{for the first time}} to the three routes then operated. The <b>company</b> <b>made</b> an operating loss in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a local service in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut in frequency. As the Chilworth garage was still owned by Trice, operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.|$|E
5|$|In 1599, a {{partnership}} {{of members of}} the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the <b>company</b> <b>made</b> him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.|$|E
5|$|On 5June 1944, the <b>company</b> <b>made</b> final {{preparations}} for the mission. Each man was issued their personal weapons and ammunition as well as up to nine hand grenades and four Bren gun magazines. Each platoon also had a 2-inch mortar and a radio. Just before the men boarded the gliders, codewords were issued. 'Ham' indicated the canal bridge was captured and 'Jam' the river bridge. Capture and destruction of the canal bridge would be signalled using the codeword 'Jack'; 'Lard' would be used if a similar fate befell the river bridge.|$|E

5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German <b>company</b> <b>made</b> an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E
5|$|The F-28s had {{the largest}} {{regularity}} problems, mostly due {{to the number of}} landings, which could count up to 16 per day. For instance, LN-SUO flew 36,000 hours with 76,000 landings. The last flight was made on 16 December 1986, and the aircraft sold for NOK45 million each. Although the F-28 was taken out of service, some of the routes on the West Coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the 737. The <b>company</b> <b>made</b> an agreement to wet lease Busy Bee F-27s one some of the routes, while the most trafficked ones would be taken over by 737s.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Sarah Jane Smith, played by Sladen, appeared in Doctor Who from 1973 to 1976, alongside Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor and later Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor. A pilot episode for another Doctor Who spin-off series, K-9 and <b>Company,</b> <b>made</b> in 1981, featured Sarah Jane and the robot dog K-9; however, a full series was never commissioned. Sarah Jane and K-9 returned to Doctor Who in various media {{many times over}} the years, most notably in the 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors (1983), and in episodes School Reunion (2006), The Stolen Earth / Journey's End (2008) and The End of Time (2010).|$|E
