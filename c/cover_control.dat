40|$|The rapid {{economic}} development of Western Siberia {{and changes in the}} taiga as a result of industrial activity make it important to study the process of paludification and degradation of forests. Paludification and the development of peatlands is responsible for the formation of permafrost and forest degradation. The process starts in low-lying areas. Heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ground changes with the growth of the moss and peat layer and seasonal freezing begins to exceed summer thawing. Gradually the moss hummocks invade the forest and destroy it. The result is a deterioration in the growth conditions of trees; the soil temperature drops, the soil pores are filled with water, reducing aeration; no new trees appear and finally the trees begin to rot. Theoretical calculations show that the southern march of the permafrost zone will continue for another 400 - 450 miles. To reduce paludification soil and vegetation <b>cover</b> <b>control</b> is beneficial. Removal of the moss increases soil temperatures by 10 - 15 degrees C in the summer. Liming will destroy moss by neutralizing the soil acids and intensifying bacterial action. Burning the moss also creates favourable conditions. Snow accumulation decreases frost penetration and blackening the snow also rapidifies spring melting by 2 - 3 weeks. SOMMAIRE FRANCAIS A SUIVREPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

30|$|Trochus {{addition}} in cages at one trochus per cage did {{not produce}} any effect on turf algal cover and spat survivorship, indicating below threshold grazer density for algal <b>cover</b> <b>control.</b> A similar effect was observed {{in the culture of}} giant clams with trochus, where a trochus density of five per cage (0.36  m 2 with 18 -mm mesh, equivalent to 14  m- 2) {{did not produce}} enhancement in clam survivorship and growth, while a higher density (ten per cage, equivalent to 28  m- 2) did produce such effect (Clarke et al. 2003). A threshold grazer density should, then, be determined when incorporating trochus in caged culture of other reef organisms. This threshold trochus density may be dependent to the nature/type of co-cultured organism and to the culture setup or site. Some organisms may be more sensitive to algal effects and therefore require a higher grazer density. Since there was no observed effect of trochus treatment on spat survivorship in the in situ nursery culture (where environmental parameters were found to be different to that in the hatchery), even at two per cage trochus density, the efficiency of trochus to enhance the survival of coral spat in caged culture is then variable in different culture conditions. For hatchery conditions, the recommended density of trochus to effectively control turf/filamentous algae and thereby enhance spat survivorship is at least eight sub-adult individuals per square meter of cage surface area.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to cause extensive vegetation changes in the Arctic: deciduous shrubs are already expanding, in response to climate warming. The results from transect studies suggest that increasing shrub cover will impact significantly on the surface energy balance. However, {{little is known about}} the direct effects of shrub cover on permafrost thaw during summer. We experimentally quantified the influence of Betula nana cover on permafrost thaw in a moist tundra site in northeast Siberia with continuous permafrost. We measured the thaw depth of the soil, also called the active layer thickness (ALT), ground heat flux and net radiation in 10 m diameter plots with natural B. nana <b>cover</b> (<b>control</b> plots) and in plots in which B. nana was removed (removal plots). Removal of B. nana increased ALT by 9 % on average late in the growing season, compared with control plots. Differences in ALT correlated well with differences in ground heat flux between the control plots and B. nana removal plots. In the undisturbed control plots, we found an inverse correlation between B. nana cover and late growing season ALT. These results suggest that the expected expansion of deciduous shrubs in the Arctic region, triggered by climate warming, may reduce summer permafrost thaw. Increased shrub growth may thus partially offset further permafrost degradation by future temperature increases. Permafrost models need to include a dynamic vegetation component to accurately predict future permafrost tha...|$|E
