Others of my time and place have now passed whither there is neither time nor place, and there are moments when I feel that I must try to <b>call</b> them <b>back</b> and <b>pay</b> them such honor as my sense of their worth may give; but the impulse has as yet failed to effect itself, and I do not know how long I shall spare myself the supreme pleasure-pain, the [...] "hochst angenehmer Schmerz," [...] of seeking to live here with those who live here no more.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that Jose Castro had illegally worked at Hoffman Plastics due to his illegal immigration status. Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, {{was one of the}} major cases used in finding its decision. Sure-Tan was a very similar case about the firing of illegal immigrants. The court did not use immigration law under the IRCA in its findings. It used only one law, the National Labor Relations Act, since the issue was whether or not to <b>pay</b> the <b>back</b> <b>pay,</b> not the illegal hiring decision of Hoffman. The NLRB was searching for <b>back</b> <b>pay</b> that could have been earned if Castro was not let go. Under the IRCA law, Castro was not a documented worker and was thus ineligible to work. Therefore, no <b>back</b> <b>pay</b> could be awarded.|$|R
50|$|In retaliation, Hoffman {{laid off}} Castro {{and the other}} pro-union employees. Three years later, the NLRB found Hoffman Plastics to be in {{violation}} of section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA and awarded Castro <b>back</b> <b>pay</b> and reinstatement at Hoffman Plastics. But at an administrative law judge hearing to decide how much <b>back</b> <b>pay</b> should be awarded to the parties involved, Castro {{admitted that he had}} entered the country illegally and used a friend's birth certificate to obtain documents needed to gain employment.|$|R

40|$|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 {{provides}} {{administrative and}} judicial remedies {{for victims of}} discrimination in employment. Employers, engaged in “an industry affecting commerce” and having fifteen or more employees who work at least twenty weeks out of the year, {{are subject to the}} statutes strictures. Unions are also subject to the statute if they have fifteen or more members, operate an office or hiring hall, and represent employees. One remedy available under Title VII is an award of <b>back</b> <b>pay</b> from the date of the alleged violation. <b>Back</b> <b>pay</b> may be defined as court-awarded compensation for the loss of earnings resulting from a discriminatory employment practice. Modeled after similar provisions in the National Labor Relations Act, the <b>back</b> <b>pay</b> provision of Title VII, like the entirety of the statute, has a two-fold purpose. First, it provides employers with incentive to comply with the statute. Second, by furnishing the victim of discrimination with compensation for wages lost {{as a result of the}} violation, it makes the plaintiff whole. Initially intended as an instrument of compensation, the <b>back</b> <b>pay</b> award has become a formidable weapon in the hands of employee plaintiffs. The metamorphosis has been hastened by recent case law developments. The purpose of this Note is to review these developments, and to determine whether this increase in the award’s potency is desirable...|$|R
