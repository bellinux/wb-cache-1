2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} of adolescent development {{that are more}} rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures. Culture {{has been defined as}} the [...] "symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a <b>community</b> <b>framework</b> for what is valued". [...] Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects all aspects of an individual's life. [...] Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a youth culture. [...] For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture. However, [...] "culture" [...] should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group. Furthermore, to avoid ethnocentrism, researchers must be careful not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs.|$|E

The risk based decision making methodology {{is applied to}} European Union expenditure programs used to implement its regional policy, such as the <b>community</b> support <b>framework,</b> <b>community</b> initiatives, special initiatives and other European policies. An example is presented {{for the development of}} an audit (inspection) program in the region of West Macedonia, Greece, during the implementation of the 3 rd <b>Community</b> Structural Support <b>Framework</b> Operational Program. The generic nature of the method permits its use in the management of similar European regional programs in Greece and other European countries. It is also applicable to many other industries interested in applying risk–based management decisions to physical or process based systems...|$|R
50|$|Bettina is a {{vanished}} community {{founded in}} 1847 by German immigrants {{as part of}} the Adelsverein colonization of the Fisher-Miller Land Grant in the U.S. state of Texas. It was located {{on the banks of the}} Llano River in Llano County, and no trace of the settlement remains today. The community was named after German artist and social activist Bettina von Arnim and was one of five attempted by the Darmstadt Forty. It was also known as the Darmstaedter Kolonie. The community was sponsored by the Adelsverein, and founded on idealistic philosophies of European freethinkers of the day. It is notable for the community's camaraderie and mutually respectful relations with local indigenous tribes. Lack of a formal <b>community</b> <b>framework</b> caused Bettina to fail within a year of its founding.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept has}} {{not become a}} {{mainstream}} term {{in the field of}} international security despite its long history. After the end of the Cold War, the concept of a security community was adapted by constructivist scholars. A major impetus was the book Security Communities (1998), edited by Emanuel Adler and Michael Barnett. They redefined the security community by shared identities, values, and meanings; many-sided direct interactions; and reciprocal long-term interest. Several regions of the world have been studied in the security <b>community</b> <b>framework</b> since then, most notably the European Union, the Canada-United States and Mexico-United States dyads, Mercosur, and Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Michael Haas compared the Asian and Pacific Council, Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians Union, ASEAN, Indochinese Foreign Ministers Conference, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the South Pacific Forum (later renamed the Pacific Islands Forum).|$|E

40|$|New {{research}} {{published by}} ACELG explores how local governments can foster {{a culture of}} learning in their communities to achieve positive long term outcomes. The report Learning as a Driver for Change explores how learning partnerships between councils, their communities and learning organisations can help improve social outcomes, build community capability and strengthen community governance. The research demonstrates that such partnerships make social inclusion a priority and support both formal and informal learning opportunities. The researchers, Dr Leone Wheeler and Dr Shanti Wong, drew from a comprehensive literature review and from case studies of Hume City and Gwydir Shire councils to develop a template for other councils interested in developing learning partnerships in their own <b>communities.</b> The template <b>framework,</b> Learning <b>Communities</b> <b>Framework,</b> is published along with the report.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional Community PlanningStephanie A. RolleyAs bicycle {{tourists}} seek interesting experiences along low traffic roads, {{rural communities}} {{are poised to}} embrace bicycle tourism as a community development strategy. Asset based community development provides a methodology for communities to utilize assets that already exist within their communities {{to meet the needs}} of these tourists. The <b>community</b> capitals <b>framework</b> then provides a platform for analyzing and discussing the existing assets, as well as helping hone in on ways communities can develop further. The Sunken Lands region of Northeast Arkansas is one such rural region seeking to embrace bicycle tourism. Two case studies of communities that have capitalized on their existing assets to accommodate bicyclists were completed to explore potential for using the <b>community</b> capitals <b>framework</b> to guide pursuit of bicycle tourism. A snowball approach to interviewing community members in Collinwood, Tennessee and Farmington, Missouri was used to discover the details of bicycle accommodations, the processes of pursuing bicycle tourism, the people and groups involved, the types of assets used, and any challenges faced in implementation. Additionally, existing literature was used to substantiate each case and provide a more robust community picture. Emerging from the case studies were commonalities that aligned with the <b>community</b> capitals <b>framework</b> and Emery and Flora’s (2006) theory that community change is driven by social capital. The result is a tool that aligns community assets with the needs of bicycle tourists with the <b>community</b> capitals <b>framework...</b>|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of: 8 th International IFIP-TC 6 Networking Conference (Networking 2009), Aachen, Germany, May 11 - 15, 2009 This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} misbehaviour on QoS provisioning in wireless mesh networks. Misbehaviour occurs when a network participant decides not to cooperate. Since cooperation is fundamental for distributed environments such as mesh networks, misbehaviour can be {{a serious threat to}} them. In this work, the authors focus on the IEEE 802. 11 EDCA medium access function which provides QoS in mesh networks. Simulation studies have been performed to determine what realistic forms of misbehaviour can occur and what their impact is. From these results the most beneficial forms of MAC layer misbehaviour in multihop mesh networks are derived.
