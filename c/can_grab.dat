5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> opponents {{and put them}} in a chokehold, at which point a variety of actions can be performed, such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the button, and movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|What makes Yoshi's Island DS {{different}} is {{the addition of}} five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear, and <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively; Baby Donkey Kong <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> and swing on vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story (but they do so on impact) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little bit. The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the game is set on a whaler {{in the middle of a}} storm, and the {{conditions}} on the deck affect the degree of control the player has over Hansen. As the ship sways continuously from side to side, aiming is made more difficult, although Hansen <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> onto a ledge to steady himself, if one is available. In some instances, the ship can sway to such a degree that Hansen will slide towards the edge and potentially fall overboard. There are also numerous environmental hazards on the deck which react to the motion of the ship, such as swinging electrical wires and crates hooked up to ropes. If any of these items hit Hansen, he will lose health. Waves crashing on to the ship's deck can also cause Hansen damage.|$|E

5|$|However, {{once on the}} bus, Lisa {{realizes she}} is on the wrong bus and is dropped off in the middle of nowhere. During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out the error of his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E
5|$|In Abzû, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of a diver in a vast ocean—after waking up {{floating}} on the ocean's surface, the diver begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life. The diver can accelerate, and interact with marine life using sonar chimes. The diver <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them. Each area sports hidden collectables for the diver to find.|$|E
5|$|The game retains some {{platforming}} traits; {{the player}} may disembark {{from a vehicle}} and explore the environment {{in a manner similar}} to that of the previous games. On foot the duo <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> ledges, swim underwater, balance on tightropes and perform basic jumps. Kazooie's spanner can also be used as a melee weapon outside of the vehicle, in addition to levitating lopsided vehicles. Banjo and Kazooie have limited attack power and agility on foot at first, but the duo can upgrade their speed, stamina and strength by visiting Boggy's gym in the game's hub world. Scattered around the game's six worlds are musical notes, which serve as currency for the player to purchase certain items such as blueprints, parts, and access to advanced vehicles. Musical notes vary in value as determined by its colour; gold, silver or bronze. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts also features an online multiplayer; players can compete in challenges such as races and combat over Xbox Live. In addition, players can share their own vehicle designs and blueprints online.|$|E
50|$|Characters <b>can</b> also <b>grab</b> opponents, climb walls, or {{pick and}} throw items. They may {{also need to}} destroy objects to clear {{alternative}} paths through an area.|$|R

5000|$|The episode {{starts off}} {{immediately}} from [...] "The Final Chapter" [...] as Molly stabs Claire {{again in the}} chest. Ryan, gaining what strength he <b>can,</b> <b>grabs</b> Molly from behind her hair and strangles {{her to the ground}} and breaks her neck, killing her. He manages to get an ambulance to his apartment and he and Claire are rushed to a hospital. After Ryan is out of surgery, he is greeted by Mike and when he questions what happened to Claire, Mike informs him that Claire died, leaving Ryan devastated.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Dawn of Mana {{takes place in a}} full three-dimensional world, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls the main character, Keldric, and is followed for almost all of the game by a fairy spirit, Faye. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, Dawn is an action-adventure game, rather than an action role-playing game; as such, gameplay is focused on movement and attacking enemies, rather than leveling-up character statistics. Keldric is able to run, roll, and jump through the game world. Keldric has access to a vine-like plant attached to his arm, which can be used at any time as either a sword, a whip, or a slingshot. The sword can be used to hit enemies and objects, the whip <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> and throw enemies and objects, and the slingshot can throw collectible pebbles as projectiles. Faye can cast magic spells, selectable by the player.|$|E
25|$|Port Pirie is {{serviced}} by two local newspapers, The Recorder (Tuesdays and Thursdays) {{and the free}} Flinders News (Wednesdays). The Recorder has recently changed to a morning paper, after being delivered at around 3pm. Now readers <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> {{a copy of the}} paper off their front lawn early in the morning. It covers a small coverage area outside of the city however the Flinders News covers the mid north, Clare Valley and part of the Yorke Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|I {{would say}} from my gut {{that we are}} {{probably}} as low as we're {{going to go in}} that valley, and heading for the next peak. That's fine with me because everybody needs a turn. We've been {{at the top of the}} mountain twice already, and, if nothing else, we need to get out of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. Now they <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E
5000|$|Typically when {{a player}} calls ball {{that means that}} you have current {{possession}} of the ball and they <b>can</b> stop <b>grabbing</b> for it. Then they continue the game from the spot where [...] "ball" [...] was called.|$|R
5000|$|The player <b>can</b> also <b>grab</b> [...] "P" [...] icons to {{increase}} {{the power of the}} current level gun. A maximum of five [...] "P"s can be collected per experience level; getting more after this gives extra points instead.|$|R
50|$|Enemies <b>can</b> be <b>grabbed</b> {{simply by}} walking {{into one of}} them. When an enemy is <b>grabbed,</b> the player <b>can</b> perform a <b>grab</b> attack by {{pressing}} the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can {{be picked up by}} standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.|$|R
25|$|Animals {{which are}} {{considered}} too slow moving to be 'free' {{are not included}} in this category, as trapping them doesn't change their legal status of being able to grab them in 'one hand swoop' (a term used by the Rambam to define this law). One is therefore allowed to confine a snail or tortoise, etc. as you <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> them just as easily whether they are in an enclosure or unhindered in the wild. For these purposes trapping them serves no change to their legal status regarding their ease of capture, and they are termed legally pre-trapped due to their nature. Trapping is therefore seen not as a 'removal of liberty', which caging even such a slow moving creature would be, but rather the confining of a creature {{to make it easier to}} capture in one's hand.|$|E
500|$|During combat, Wario <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> {{enemies and}} either spin them around, throw them, or piledrive {{them into the}} ground. Enemies drop coins when defeated, and tend to {{regenerate}} if the area is left and returned to later. The coins are used to purchase items, such as life-restoring garlic, and to return to life. If Wario {{does not have enough}} money to return to life, the game is over. A new feature in Wario World are the spherical [...] "glue globes", in which Wario is stuck to if he touches it, allowing the player to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Along the way, Wario can re-collect his lost treasures, which are hidden in treasure chests, and collect pieces of golden Wario statues, which increases Wario's life meter by one half. In order to advance in the game, the player must collect a certain amount of red diamonds in each level. If the player collects all the treasure in the various levels, minigames from the Game Boy Advance title [...] are unlocked, and they can be played by using the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.|$|E
500|$|Emma {{opens the}} gateway and the Doctor travels through where {{he finds himself}} on a small island of land {{floating}} in a void. He finds Hila and they are drawn to a vision of Caliburn House that Emma has generated for them as a beacon. At the same time, a creature follows them and chases them into the house. The Doctor locks the doors to slow the creature down, and Hila uses the harness {{to return to the}} normal world. [...] The strain of keeping the gateway open causes Emma to collapse and the gateway closes, trapping the Doctor in the pocket universe. The TARDIS's cloister bell begins to sound, and Clara races to the TARDIS to find it locked. She pleads with the device via its holographic voice interface to help her save the Doctor, and after initially refusing the TARDIS finally opens up and allows Clara in. As Emma reopens the gateway again with Palmer's encouragement, the TARDIS briefly flies into the pocket universe and moves close to the ground, allowing the Doctor to jump and hang on before the creature <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> him. The Doctor and the TARDIS safely reappear in the normal world as Emma collapses from the pain and exhaustion.|$|E
50|$|A client <b>can</b> {{establish}} a <b>grab</b> over the keyboard, the pointer, or both. A request for <b>grabbing</b> <b>can</b> include {{a request for}} freezing the keyboard or the pointer. The difference between grabbing and freezing is that grabbing changes the recipient of events, while freezing stops their delivery altogether. When a device is frozen, the events it generates are stored in a queue to be delivered as usual when the freeze is over.|$|R

5000|$|CiN Weekly {{gave it a}} {{score of}} 93 out of 100 and called it [...] "an almost {{endlessly}} entertaining game with tons of fun and gratuitous destruction." [...] Maxim gave it a score of eight out of ten, praising it for [...] "a compelling Story mode, written by former Hulk scribe Paul Jenkins, who gives the big guy a reason to use his considerable crushing skills." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald also gave it four stars out of five and stated that [...] "While the battles can get exhaustingly repetitive, most players will have monstrous fun." [...] The Times likewise gave the PS2 version four stars out of five and stated, [...] "Leisurely plucking helicopters {{out of the sky}} can be immensely satisfying, as <b>can</b> <b>grabbing</b> a handful of trees to toss around like darts, damning the consequences." ...|$|R
2500|$|Under Ultimate rules, {{a player}} may catch the frisbee {{with one or}} two hands. A catch <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> the rim, or {{simultaneously}} grab {{the top and bottom of}} the frisbee -- in a clap-catch / [...] "pancake catch". Care is needed with the hand placement when catching with one hand on the disc rim, making sure to catch on the proper side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. When a frisbee is thrown at high speeds, as is frequently the case in a competitive Ultimate game, one side of the frisbee can spin out of the player's hand, and the other side can spin into their hand, which can make a catch far more secure. [...] For this reason, along with the desire to secure the frisbee strongly and [...] "cleanly," [...] the general advice is to for a two hands when possible.|$|E
2500|$|A {{separate}} elevator {{next to the}} turntable transports {{the balls}} to the ball return system, which has a near-vertical ramp that the balls roll down to gain enough momentum to roll through either an above-lane or submerged trough back up the alley, entering the ball return rack next to the approach area where players <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> them. Bowl Mor pinsetters are stocked with 24 to 27 pins, and are deemed substantially more reliable than typical Ten-pin bowling pinsetters. Due to the playing rules of candlepin bowling allowing fallen [...] "dead wood" [...] pins {{to remain on the}} lane between each ball's roll, no provision has ever been made for [...] "spotting cells" [...] in a candlepin pinsetter's spotting table, simplifiying the machines' design. Most parts of the machine are driven by chains – especially the sweep board's drive system, on two L-shaped tracks {{on either side of the}} unit – or belts. A Bowl Mor unit weighs approximate , and draws 24 amperes at 110 volts from three-wire 110-220 volt service mains. The ICBA lists the cost of a refurbished Bowl Mor unit at approximately $5000.|$|E
2500|$|A {{new feature}} called Power Blow (a {{triggered}} powerful attack {{that can be}} executed when a character's health is below 50%) enables the players to knock the opponent character away in a selected direction. Characters can be thrown into the series' signature Danger Zones or over a cliff in the multi-level stages; this initiates another new feature, which is a cinematic quick time event called Cliffhanger. With Cliffhanger, if a character <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> onto the stage {{at the last moment}} before falling into a lower level, an action sequence is activated where the opponent character can make an effort to inflict even more damage if the attack succeeds. The game's Critical System features Critical Stuns (after having been hit with specific moves, opponent characters get stunned and are unable to block, but can still perform holds), Critical Combos (striking a character in a Critical Stun state can prolong the amount of time they remain stunned, but the damage that can be inflicted this way is limited) and Critical Bursts (specific strikes over the damage limit of successful Critical Combos that leave the target character completely defenseless for a short while).|$|E

2500|$|Retrospectively, Bruce Eder of AllMusic {{thought the}} album {{contains}} [...] "some {{of the most}} sublimely beautiful musical passages ever {{to come from the}} group, and develops a major chunk of that music in depth and degrees in ways that one can only marvel at, though there's a big leap from marvel to enjoy. If one <b>can</b> <b>grab</b> onto it, Tales is a long, sometimes glorious musical ride across landscapes strange and wonderful, thick with enticing musical textures". In its fortieth anniversary issue from 1992, NME selected Tales from Topographic Oceans as their [...] "40 Records That Captured The Moment" [...] for 1974. In 1996, Progression magazine writer John Covach wrote that it is Tales from Topographic Oceans, not Close to the Edge (1972), that represents the band's true hallmark {{of the first half of}} their 1970s output and their [...] "real point of arrival". He pointed out [...] "the playing is virtuosic throughout, the singing innovative and often complex, and the lyrics mystical and poetic. All this having been asserted ... even the most devoted listener to Tales is also forced to admit that the album is in many ways flawed. Tracks tend to wander a bit ... and the music therefore is perhaps not as focussed as it might be." [...] He notes that while Howe [...] "set a new standard for rock guitar", he thought Wakeman's parts were not used properly and that the keyboardist was instead [...] "relegated to the role of sideman". Author and critic Martin Popoff called the album one of the [...] "black hole of Yes experiences, the band dissipating, expanding, exploding and imploding all at once", though he thought it contained [...] "some fairly accessible music".|$|E
