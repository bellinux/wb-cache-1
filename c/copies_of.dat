5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to <b>copies</b> <b>of</b> the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
