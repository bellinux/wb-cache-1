5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} <b>connected</b> <b>graph</b> is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a <b>connected</b> <b>graph</b> necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may be made into a strongly <b>connected</b> <b>graph</b> by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E

5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} are {{split into two}} colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a <b>connected</b> <b>graph</b> has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E
5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly <b>connected</b> <b>graph)</b> are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).|$|E
25|$|A {{strongly}} <b>connected</b> <b>graph</b> is a {{directed graph}} {{in which every}} ordered pair of vertices in the graph is strongly connected. Otherwise, it is called a weakly <b>connected</b> <b>graph</b> if every ordered pair of vertices in the graph is weakly connected. Otherwise it is called a disconnected graph.|$|E

Any {- 1, 1 }-weighing of the edges of G for which all connected subgraphs on k edges are positively weighted implies that G is positively weighted. Otherwise, we {{say that it is}} weakly forcing for G if any such weighing implies that the weight of G is bounded from below by a constant. Otherwise we say that k collapses for G. We classify k for some of the most prominent classes of graphs, such as all <b>connected</b> <b>graphs,</b> all <b>connected</b> <b>graphs</b> with a given maximum degree and all <b>connected</b> <b>graphs</b> with a given average degree...|$|R

25|$|Every finite <b>connected</b> <b>graph</b> has a {{spanning}} tree. However, for infinite connected graphs, {{the existence}} of spanning trees {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. An infinite graph is connected if each pair of its vertices forms the pair of endpoints of a finite path.

As a consequence, the pseudovariety R of all finite R-trivial monoids is shown to be hyperdecidable relative to the class of labellings of finite strongly <b>connected</b> <b>graphs</b> by finite monoids.
