In contrast, there was a significant reduction in carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci 3 months after one dose and 1 month after a second dose of conjugate vaccine (from 25 % to 9 % and 7 %, respectively; P <. 001). No effect was seen after vaccination with the nonconjugate vaccine. One year after immuniza-tion, carriage of antibiotic-resistant vaccine-type pneumococci in children receiving conjugate vac-cine was lower than that in children receiving the nonconjugate vaccine (4 % vs. 14 %, P =. 042).

40|$|The serotypes and {{molecular}} clones of penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSP) responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and discharging ears in metropolitan New South Wales were characterized {{to form a}} baseline prior to introduction of the <b>heptavalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> pneumococcal <b>vaccine</b> in Australia. Pneumococci isolated between 1 July 2000 and 30 June 2003 in Sydney from children, 15 years were tested for antibiotic susceptibilities and serotyped. Penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci were typed by multilocus sequence typing and BOX PCR. During this period, 97 (13. 9 %) of 698 pneumococci from IPD that were serotyped were penicillin-nonsusceptible. Of 607 pneumococci from discharging ears, 157 (26. 1 %) were penicillin-nonsusceptible. Serotype 14 was the predominant serotype responsible for IPD and serotype 19 F predominated from discharging ears. The <b>heptavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> serotypes accounted for 613 (87. 8 %) of all invasive isolates and 420 (69. 8 %) of all isolates from discharging ears. Representatives of the major international clones were present among the PNSP. The majority of serotypes and clones that showed penicillin-nonsusceptibility are present within the vaccine. Serotype switching was also noted to have occurred prior to introduction of the vaccine.

Methods: Ninety-six children with an AOM onset before six months of age, implying a high risk for rAOM, were closely monitored until the age of two years. Fortysix were vaccinated with PCV 7 and 50 were not. All episodes of AOM, emergency visits and ventilation tube insertions were registered. Results: A total of 363 AOM episodes were diagnosed.

40|$|Background: {{asymptomatic}} carriage of the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is known}} to precede the development of invasive disease. Young children {{are one of the}} major reservoirs for pneumococci and worldwide over 700, 000 children under two years old die due to invasive pneumococcal disease each year. <b>Heptavalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> <b>vaccine</b> (PCV- 7) was introduced into the UK childhood immunisation schedule in September 2006. Our objective was to assess the emergence of colonising serotypes in young children in the three years following PCV- 7 implementation. Methods: time-series prevalence survey set in the paediatric outpatients department of a large UK teaching hospital. Participants were children aged four years and under attending the outpatients department during PCV- 7 introduction (October 2006 –February 2007) and in the same months of the two subsequent years. The main outcome measure was prevalence of pneumococcal carriage by serotype. Results: the rate of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage remained stable during the three year period. We observed a significant 69 % (95 % CI, ? 40 % to ? 118 %, p < 0. 0001) decrease in carriage of PCV- 7 serotypes during PCV- 7 implementation and a concomitant increase in the proportion of non PCV- 7 serotypes. The most prevalent emerging non-vaccine serotypes were 6 C, 11 A, 19 A and 22 F. By March 2009, PCV- 13 was predicted to cover only 33. 3 % (95 % CI, 24. 2 – 42. 5 %) of strains carried in the study population. Conclusions: although the overall pneumococcal carriage rate remained stable between 2006 and 2009, we observed a significant decrease in the serotype coverage of PCV- 7 and PCV- 13. PCV- 7 was highly successful in reducing carriage of vaccine serotypes. However, the increase in the proportion of non-vaccine serotypes found both in our study and causing invasive disease currently in the UK, underlines the importance of continued surveillance of carriage and diseas...|$|R
40|$|The role of Streptococcus pneumoniae in cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is poorly understood.

The aim of this work was to investigate serotypes, antibiotic susceptibilities, genotypes and biofilm production of CF pneumococcal isolates. Overall, 44 S. pneumoniae strains collected from 32 paediatric CF patients from January 2010 to May 2012 in a large Italian CF Centre were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by Etest, serotyped by the Quellung reaction and genotyped by a combination of different molecular typing methods, including pbp gene restriction profiling, pspA restriction profiling and sequencing, PFGE and multilocus sequence typing. Biofilm production by pneumococcal strains was also assessed. Penicillin non-susceptibility was 16  %. High resistance rates (> 56  %) were observed for erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. The most frequent serotype recovered was serotype 3 (31. 8  %). The coverage of PCV 7 and PCV 13 was 6. 8 and 47. 7  %, respectively.

40|$|Background: During {{the last}} two decades, {{significant}} changes {{have taken place in}} the epidemiology of meningitis, especially due to the global availability and expanding use of Hib vaccines. The introduction of conjugate Hib vaccine in the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) in Oman and recent availability of meningococcal vaccines against serogroups A and C plus the introduction of pneumococcal <b>heptavalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> <b>vaccine</b> are expected to influence the epidemiology of the disease in the country. We conducted this periodic review of acute bacterial meningitis in children younger than five years of age in Oman from January 2000 to December 2005 to reflect changes in the epidemiological pattern of these pathogens. Methodology: Retrospective analysis of all cases of acute bacterial meningitis in children younger than five years of age reported to the Department of Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control, Ministry of Health, Oman. Results: There were 344 cases of meningitis due to suspected bacterial etiologies reported in children younger than 5 years of age. Although Haemophilus influenzae 76 (22 %) was the most common pathogen identified during the study period, the incidence of meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae has been dramatically reduced since the introduction of conjugate Hib vaccination in Oman in October 2001. Streptococcus pneumoniae 53 (15 %) and Neisseria meningitidis 37 (11 %) were the next two leading agents of meningitis respectively. In one hundred seventy four (52 %) cases of presumptive bacterial meningitis, the etiologic organism remains unidentified. The peak occurrence of meningitis was in young children younger than one year old. The total male to female ratio was 1. 4 : 1 and the case fatality rate (7 deaths) was 2 %. Conclusions: With the introduction of Hib vaccine in Oman in October 2001, the absolute number of cases due to Haemophilus influenzae significantly declined over the years. The incidence of meningitis due to other pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis remains steady. There is significant need to improve laboratory methods of bacterial detection and identification, which will help to formulate better antibiotic policies and strengthen control measures through newly introduced vaccines in Oman...|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} public health problem of {{antibiotic}} resistance, the European Union (EU) founded the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System.

Each laboratory reported data on antimicrobial susceptibility testing using standard laboratory procedures that were evaluated by an external quality control program. The antibiotic consumption data {{were obtained from the}} National Health System. We compared the antibiotic susceptibility of Spanish isolates of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae (2001 to 2003) with antibiotic consumption. Invasive S. pneumoniae was isolated from 1, 968 patients, 20 % of whom were children at or below the age of 14 years. Of non-penicillin-susceptible strains (35. 6 %; 95 % confidence interval, 34 to 37. 2), 26. 4 % were considered intermediate and 9. 2 % were considered resistant. Between 2001 and 2003, penicillin resistance decreased from 39. 5 to 33 % overall and from 60. 4 to 41. 2 % in children at or below the age of 14 years (P = 0. 002). Resistance to erythromycin was at 26. 6 %, and coresistance with penicillin was at 19. 1 %. Of total isolates, the ciprofloxacin MIC was > 2 μg/ml for 2. 1 %, with numbers increasing from 0. 4 % (2001) to 3. 9 % (2003). Total antibiotic use decreased from 21. 66 to 19. 71 defined daily doses/ 1, 000 inhabitants/day between 1998 and 2002. While consumption of broad-spectrum penicillins, cephalosporins, and erythromycin declined, use of amoxicillin-clavulanate and quinolones increased by 17. 5 and 27 %, respectively.

MÉTODOS: durante 57 meses, foi conduzida uma vigilância de cepas invasivas de pneumococo de pacientes com idade OBJECTIVE: {{describe}} the antimicrobial resistance and serotype distribution of pneumococcal strains. METHODS: in a 57 -month period, a laboratory-based surveillance of invasive pneumococcal strains from patients aged < 20 years was conducted. Pneumococcus was identified {{by means of}} tests for solubility in bile and optochin. Pneumococcal resistance to penicillin was screened by 1 µg oxacillin disc and minimal inhibitory concentration was determined for the strains not susceptible to penicillin. Disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods were used for surveillance of resistance to other antimicrobials. Pneumococci were serotyped {{by means of the}} Neufeld-Quellung reactions. RESULTS: of 70 patients, 57. 1 % were males. The mean age was 1. 92 yrs (mean 3. 19 + 3. 66 yrs, range 1 month to 19. 5 yrs); 52. 9 % and 81. 4 % were < 2 yrs and < 5 yrs, respectively. The strains were isolated from blood (91. 4 %), CSF (2. 9 %), pleural (2. 9 %), peritoneal (1. 4 %) and abscess (1. 4 %) fluids from patients with pneumonia (77. 1 %), fever without localizing signs (10. 0 %), meningitis (4. 3 %), others (8. 6 %). Resistance was detected to penicillin (20. 0 %), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (65. 7 %), tetracycline (21. 4 %), ofloxacin (6. 3 %), erythromycin (5. 7 %), clindamycin (2. 9 %). All tested strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol and vancomycin. Among penicillin-resistant strains, high resistance was detected in one, the same that showed intermediate resistance to cefotaxime.

40|$|Background: The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) granted market {{authorisation}} to the <b>heptavalent</b> pneumococcal <b>vaccine</b> Prevenar (Wyeth) in {{the year}} 2001. The indication of Prevenar is the active immunisation of infants and young {{children under the age}} of two against invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumonia serotypes 4, 6 B, 9 V, 14, 18 C, 19 F and 23 F. At the time of this study the German vaccination scheme advises the immunisation with Prevenar only for children at high risk. Objectives: The objective of the study is first to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of the immunisation of all children with the <b>heptavalent</b> <b>conjugated</b> pneumococcal <b>vaccine</b> in Germany and second, whether a general recommendation for vaccination of all children would be cost-effective. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in 29 relevant databases for the period of January 1999 to June 2004. Thus 1, 884 articles were identified which were then assessed according to predefined selection criteria. Results: There is evidence for the medical effectiveness of Prevenar against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the covered serotypes from a major double-blinded RCT undertaken in California. The vaccine shows lower values of effectiveness against otitis media and pneumonia. The values for effectiveness of the vaccine in Germany are below the data for California because of the different incidence of Serotypes. The cost-effectiveness rates for an immunisation of all children with Prevenar vary across different countries. One reason - besides different Health Systems - can be seen in the uncertainty about the duration of protection, another in the assumption on regional serotype coverage of the vaccine. From the healthcare payers' perspective a general vaccination of all children in Germany is not cost-effective, from a societal perspective the benefits from vaccination could prevail the cost. The actual price of the vaccine (if financed by the Healthcare Payer, 2004) has dropped and is lower than the assumed price in the German cost-effectiveness study. This fact could raise the cost-effectiveness-ratio of a general immunisation. Discussion: The low evidence of information on the herd immunity effect of pneumococcal immunisation, the occurrence on serotype-replacement phenomenon and the effects on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains shall be considered when deciding whether the pneumococcal vaccination for all infants and young children should be added to the German vaccination scheme. There is also little information on the duration of vaccine effectiveness and regional effectiveness because of different serotype incidence. The economic models thus incorporate some uncertainties. Conclusion: At present, relatively few pneumococcal strains in Germany show antibiotic resistance. This situation shall further be observed while improving the data evidence for future decisions (epidemiologic data of incidence of pneumococcal diseases and serotyping of pneumococcal bacteria). From the economic perspective no distinct recommendation to add the conjugated vaccination for all children to the German vaccination scheme can be given. This situation may change if the price for the vaccine further decreases. Furthermore a future cost-effectiveness analysis for Germany should incorporate the effects of the replacement phenomenon, the herd immunisation effects and the effects of the vaccination on the antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal strains...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{increasingly}} frequent bacterial {{resistance to}} antibiotics, antibacterial innovation is rare. Ketolides constitute {{one of the}} very few new antibiotic classes active against Streptococcus pneumoniae developed during the last 25 years. Their mechanism of action resembles that of macrolides, but they are unaffected by common resistance mechanisms. However, cross-resistance to ketolides has been observed in some macrolide-resistant strains. We examined how new antibiotic exposure may affect overall pneumococcal resistance patterns in the population. The aims of this study were to assess the potential dissemination of newly emerged resistances and to control the selection of strains already multiresistant to existing antimicrobials. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed an age-structured population model for S. pneumoniae transmission in a human community exposed to <b>heptavalent</b> <b>vaccine,</b> and b-lactams, macrolides and ketolides. The dynamics of intraindividual selection of resistant strains under antibiotic exposure and interindividual transmission were simulated, with antibiotic-specific resistance mechanisms defining the path to co-resistances and cross-resistances, and parameter...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an {{important}} cause of otitis media in children. In this study we estimated the effect of routine childhood immunization with <b>heptavalent</b> pneumococcal <b>conjugate</b> <b>vaccine</b> on frequent otitis media (3 episodes in 6 months or 4 episodes in 1 year) and pressure-equalizing tube insertions. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The study population included all children who were enrolled at birth in TennCare or selected upstate New York commercial insurance plans as of July 1998 and continuously followed until 5 years old, loss of health plan enrollment, study outcome, or end of the study. We compared {{the risk of developing}} frequent otitis media or having pressure-equalizing tube insertion for 4 birth cohorts (19989 ̆ 61999, 19999 ̆ 62000, 20009 ̆ 62001, and 20019 ̆ 62002) by using Cox regression analysis. We used data from the National Immunization Survey to estimate the <b>heptavalent</b> pneumococcal <b>conjugate</b> <b>vaccine</b> uptake for children in these 4 birth cohorts in Tennessee and New York.

40|$|International audienceAntibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) are {{described}} around the world. The present national surveillance study report analyzes more than 6000 Sp strains, isolated from adults across France in 2001 and 2003, from blood cultures (3086 in 2001 and 3164 in 2003), cerebrospinal fluid (respectively, 238 and 240), or middle ear fluid (respectively, 110 and 100). The proportion of isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin fell significantly between 2001 and 2003 from 46. 5 % to 43. 9 %. The proportion of high-level resistant strains to penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC > 1 mg/L), amoxicillin, and cefotaxime (MIC > 2 mg/L) slightly decreased but remained low: 10. 6 %, 1. 2 %, and 0. 2 % in 2003. Resistance to other antibiotics (erythromycin, cotrimoxazole, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol) also decreased. Decrease in prevalence of penicillin-resistant Sp varied according to specimen source. The proportion of penicillin nonsusceptible pneumococci decreased in blood cultures and middle ear fluids between 2001 and 2003 but increased in cerebrospinal fluid (43. 4 % and 46. 5 %, respectively).

40|$|Pneumococcal {{disease in}} young {{children}} {{has not been as}} well characterized in East Africa as it has been in industrialized countries. Although pneumococci are likely to cause substantial mortality and morbidity, uni-versal diagnostic challenges plus the rudimentary nature of public health surveillance make the true epide-miological characteristics of these diseases difficult to ascertain with these methods alone. However, local data are critical to inform the debate on vaccine deployment and assess vaccine impact. The Network for Surveillance of Pneumococcal Disease in the East African Region has worked to expand the World Health Organization Paediatric Bacterial Meningitis Surveillance Network—initiated surveillance process aimed at Haemophilus influenza type b to perform surveillance on pneumococcal diseases. A total of 119 H. influenzae isolates from children aged 12 years but! 5 years of age have been confirmed. Eighty-three isolates (69. 75 %) were serotype b, 19 belonged to other capsular antigen groups, and 17 were nontypable. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, a total of 442 isolates were confirmed to be pneumococci; 302 isolates were from blood cultures, and 140 were from cultures of cerebrospinal fluid. Most of the isolates were obtained from patients in the 6 – 29 -month age group; in this age group, overall coverage by the <b>heptavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> was 56 % (increasing to 67 % with the addition of cross-protection due to serotype 6 A).

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{have shown}} that wide-scale vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines {{was associated with a}} reduction in invasive disease, supporting the expectation that vaccination could help reduce carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and control the spread of resistant strains. However, {{it is too early to}} assess whether these effects can be sustained in the long term. Here, we used mathematical modeling to investigate time changes in pneumococcal colonization and resistance induced by conjugate vaccination in an environment where antibiotic exposure is high and resistance is widespread. According to model predictions, vaccination induced a decrease in carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci to very low levels, typically in 10 to 15 years under epidemiologically realistic conditions. Almost simultaneously, non-vaccine-type pneumococci spread in the community. Consequently, while there was a short-term decrease in the overall carriage rate, it was followed after a few years by a renewed, although limited, increase. Vaccination with a <b>heptavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> did not affect the extent to which antibiotic resistance was selected: in all cases, the distribution of resistance levels peaked at high levels (MIC > 2 μg/ml) after 20 years. With a vaccine optimally designed to include all serotypes currently exhibiting decreased susceptibility to penicillin G, the selection of resistance was slowed down, although not prevented. These results suggest that because of serotype replacement, the effects of vaccination observed today may not be sustained in the long term. As a consequence, vaccination alone may not be successful in controlling selection for resistance in S. pneumoniae...|$|R
40|$|Background. Patients may {{experience}} multiple episodes of bacterial meningitis. Information from large studies of recurrent meningitis is limited. We evaluated {{the incidence of}} recurrent bacterial meningitis {{and the distribution of}} causative organisms in The Netherlands. Methods. Data for patients with bacterial meningitis were prospectively collected nationwide for the period 1988 - 2005. Recurrent meningitis was defined as an episode of meningitis that either occurred >= 28 days after a previous episode or occurred < 28 days after a previous episode but was caused by a different pathogen or different subtype of the same pathogen. Results. Of 18, 915 patients, 202 (predominantly male) patients had recurrent bacterial meningitis (P <. 01). Prevailing causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 % of cases), Neisseria meningitidis (22 %), and non-type b Haemophilus influenzae (9 %). Pneumococci serotypes included in the <b>heptavalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> caused only 36 % of cases of recurrent pneumococcal meningitis. The proportion of episodes caused by meningococcus serogroups W 135, Y, and Z was higher among patients with recurrent meningitis than among those with nonrecurrent meningitis (odds ratio, 12. 8), and the proportion caused by nontypeable and type f H. influenzae was also higher among patients with recurrent meningitis (odds ratio, 3. 8 and 5. 6, respectively). Conclusions. In The Netherlands, the prevalence of recurrent bacterial and fungal meningitis is low. The distribution of causative microorganisms differs between cases of recurrent meningitis and cases of nonrecurrent meningitis; this could be associated with vaccinatio...|$|R
