40|$|Diets rich in {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} have been correlated to lower disease risk. This {{is thought to be}} due to bioactive components such as: vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and polyphenols. Grapes are a food source of many bioactive components, including polyphenols. The effects standardized, freeze-dried, grape powder (GRAPE) were examined in adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Twenty men and women (aged 30 - 70 y) were instructed to consume 60 g/day of GRAPE (equivalent to 2. 5 <b>cups</b> <b>fresh</b> grapes daily) or nutritionally-matched placebo powder in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover intervention study for 13 weeks. This included 2 -week run-in, 4 -week intervention (GRAPE or placebo), 3 -week washout, and final 4 -week intervention (alternate powder) phases. Subjects did not significantly alter their diets when comparing GRAPE and placebo. Plasma lipids, glucose, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), saw no significant changes when comparing GRAPE to placebo. GRAPE slightly, but significantly, decreased BMI compared to placebo. In men, it was seen that plasma triglycerides (TG) and pulse were significantly reduced by GRAPE vs. placebo. In females, an increase in plasma cholesterol was observed with GRAPE ingestion. Markers of oxidative stress, measured as advanced oxidative protein products (AOPPs), or thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), were not different when comparing GRAPE with placebo. Plasma inflammation markers TNF-α, IL- 6, and MCP- 1 also saw no significant changes between treatments, although TNF-α tended to be lower with GRAPE. No significant differences were seen between groups for plasma insulin and HOMA-IR score. However, plasma TBARS, insulin, and HOMA-IR were significantly increased with GRAPE compared to placebo only in women. These results suggest that GRAPE may favorably influence BMI, but has sex-dependent effects on cardiometabolic risk factors associated with MetS...|$|R

The worker also transfers the value of constant capital—the value of the beans; some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer; {{and the value of}} the cup—to the value of the final cup of coffee. Again, on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labor previously possessed to the finished cup of coffee So the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labor—this constant capital—and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work.|$|R

40|$|Radar {{mapping of}} the surface of Venus shows areas of high {{reflectivity}} (low emissivity) in the Venusian highlands at altitudes between 2. 5 - 4. 75 kilometers. The origin of the radar anomalies found in the highlands remains unclear. Previous experimental research investigated possible materials under simulated Venusian atmospheric and surface conditions, with special emphasis on the combined effect of pressure and temperature, and chemical composition. The results of these studies identified candidate source materials for the radar anomalies. In order to fully be considered a true source candidate the material must have spectroscopic measurements comparable to those measured {{on the surface of}} Venus where the high temperature affects spectral characteristics of minerals. The spectroscopic measurements of the previously identified candidate minerals were made at the Planetary Spectroscopy Laboratory (PSL) of DLR in Berlin in an effort to identify the anomaly source. The spectroscopic measurements were made with a FTIR Bruker Vertex 80 V evacuated to. 1 mbar and using several pairings of detector+beamsplitter to cover the spectral range from 0. 2 to 20 µm. Each sample was poured in a stainless steel reflectance <b>cup</b> and measured <b>fresh.</b> Successively each <b>cup</b> was heated (via an induction system) in vacuum (0. 07 mbar) at 400 °C for 8 hours and measured again in the UV+VIS+MIR spectral range. Three consecutive cycles of heating and measuring reflectance were performed to account for spectral variations arising from the thermal processing of the samples. Heating the samples directly inside the reflectance cups allows to measure every time exactly the same surface, exposed to increasing levels of thermal processing. Results from this study are expected to further constrain the source of the Venus radar anomalies...|$|R
