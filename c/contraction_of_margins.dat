40|$|We present {{theory and}} {{evidence}} {{of the impact of}} input trade costs on job flows. We construct a heterogeneous-firm model of trade in intermediate inputs that derives effects of input trade costs on both the extensive (due to births and deaths of firms) and intensive (due to expansions and <b>contractions</b> <b>of</b> firms) <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> employment. After a decline in input trade costs, the model predicts job destruction by death and contraction for nonimporting firms, an ambiguous response for importing firms, a {{decline in the number of}} firms, and overall job destruction. Using a longitudinal database containing the universe of manufacturing establishments in California from 1992 to 2004, we find the relationship between job flows and input trade costs to be largely consistent with the theoretical predictions of our model...|$|R
40|$|The {{wound healing}} {{promoting}} effect of negative wound pressure therapies (NPWT) {{takes place at}} the wound interface. The use of bioactive substances at this site represents a major research area for the development of future NPWT therapies. To assess wound healing kinetics in pressure ulcers treated by NPWT with or without the use of a thin interface membrane consisting of poly-N-acetyl glucosamine nanofibers (sNAG) a prospective randomized clinical trial was performed. The safety of the combination of NPWT and sNAG was also assessed in patients treated with antiplatelet drugs. In the performed study, the combination of NPWT and sNAG in 10 patients compared to NPWT alone in 10 patients promoted wound healing due to an improved <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> the wound <b>margins</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 05) without a change in wound epithelization. In 6 patients treated with antiplatelet drugs no increased wound bleeding was observed in patients treated by NPWT and sNAG. In conclusion, the application of thin membranes of sNAG nanofibers at the wound interface using NPWT was safe and augmented the action of NPWT leading to improved wound healing due to a stimulation <b>of</b> wound <b>contraction...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} contemporary {{trends in}} commercial banking, confronting {{the stages of}} deregulation and reregulation in this field triggered by the global mortgage crisis. Under deregulatory conditions the competitive position of banks has toughened, and they reacted to it by intensifying: marketization, i. e. globalization, concentration, securitization and conglomeration, and by turning to the profit-oriented risk management of their activity. The <b>contraction</b> <b>of</b> their interest <b>margin</b> was thus neutralized by the reduction of operational costs and loss provisions, and {{by an increase in}} non-interest revenues, thereby maintaining banking profitability. The recent crisis has pinpointed the necessity of firmer regulation or reregulation of the banking sector, aimed at reducing its systemic risk, {{the most important aspect of}} which being the stricter international banking capital and liquidity standards, along with the requirement to adequately treat systemically important banks. Reregulation should strengthen capitalization and liquidity; mitigate the volume, concentration, internationalization and business dispersion, hence improving the supervision of the banking sector, implying its lower, yet more stable profitability. Such an impact of the adopted section of targeted regulatory measures has been indicated by higher liquidity, lower globalization, slower concentration and securitization, and stabilization-oriented risk management activities of today's banks. Their growth and profitability have shrunk...|$|R
