40|$|Mechanical {{resistance}} of tablets is usually described by <b>crushing</b> force, or by tensile strength. Method {{used in this}} thesis records <b>crushing</b> force and path of <b>crushing.</b> This force-path record {{can be used to}} calculate <b>crushing</b> energy. <b>Crushing</b> force, <b>crushing</b> path and <b>crushing</b> energy can be used to calculate other parameters that characterize tablet properties. This thesis uses <b>crushing</b> force, volume <b>crushing</b> force, tensile strength, <b>crushing</b> energy, volume <b>crushing</b> energy and <b>crushing</b> energy related to tablet weight to describe tablets compressed of powdered cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and lactose monohydrate.

40|$|The {{effects of}} crushing-surface {{roughness}} on the energy-absorption capability of graphite and glass-epoxy composite tubes were investigated. Fifty {{different combinations of}} fiber, matrix, and specimen ply orientation were evaluated. Two different <b>crushing</b> surface roughnesses were used in this investigation. <b>Crushing</b> surface significantly influences the energy-absorption capability only of tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending <b>crushing</b> mode; tubes that <b>crush</b> in other modes are not influenced because their lamina bundles do not slide against the <b>crushing</b> surface. Those tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending mode can achieve higher, lower, or no change in energy-absorption capability as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness increases. If the fiber failure strain of tubes that <b>crush</b> in the lamina bending <b>crushing</b> mode exceeds the matrix failure strain then the energy-absorption capability increases as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness increases. However, if the matrix failure strain exceeds the fiber failure strain then the energy-absorption capability increases as <b>crushing</b> surface roughness decreases. Energy-absorption capability is uninfluenced by <b>crushing</b> surface roughness for tubes that have equal fiber and matrix failure strains...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} match featured Shawn Michaels {{defending his}} WWF Intercontinental Championship against <b>Crush.</b> <b>Crush</b> controlled the early {{portion of the}} match by performing several dropkicks on Michaels, which he followed with a military press slam and a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Michaels left the ring to recover and returned to attack <b>Crush's</b> head. Michaels was unable to pin <b>Crush,</b> however, and <b>Crush</b> threw Michaels out of the ring. Two wrestlers dressed as Doink the Clown, with whom <b>Crush</b> had been feuding, came to the ring to distract <b>Crush.</b> Michaels performed a superkick, his signature move, and pinned <b>Crush</b> to retain the championship.|$|R
