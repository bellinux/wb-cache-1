A total of 260 suicidal ideators, 58 attempters and 55 <b>completers</b> were studied. The majority of ideators, attempters and <b>completers</b> were 26 - 35 years of age, males (except attempters who were predominantly females), married, literate up to high school, employed (ideators) or housewives (attempters and <b>completers).</b> The suicide ideators, attempters and <b>completers</b> who had a past history of attempt were 6. 9 %, 24. 1 % and 18. 2 % respectively.

40|$|Objective—This study {{examined}} the role of demographic characteristics, psychological factors, and family functioning on attendance in a randomized controlled trial of a family-based pediatric obesity program. Method—Participants included 155 {{children between the ages}} of 4 and 7 years (M age = 5. 77, 57. 4 % female, 73. 6 % African-American, M BMI = 25. 5) and their primary caregivers who were randomized to the treatment group. Three groups of participants were created based on their patterns of attendance during the program: 1) noncompleters, 2) partial <b>completers,</b> and 3) <b>completers.</b> Results—Results indicated no differences among the attendance groups in child gender, child BMI, or child psychological functioning. Significant group differences were found with respect to race/ethnicity, parent marital status, and family income, such that noncompleters were more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities, to living in single parent households, and to have lower incomes than partial <b>completers</b> and <b>completers.</b> After controlling for the effects these socio-demographic risk factors, noncompleters and partial <b>completers</b> reported more family dysfunction characterized by high levels of disengagement than <b>completers.</b> Conclusion—Adapting existing weight management programs to include a focus on family engagement in the early stages of treatment may help to improve participation in family-based obesity interventions targeting high risk, socio-economically disadvantaged youth...|$|R

40|$|Background: Ideal {{approaches}} to increasing long-term physical activity (PA) adherence in women remain unclear. This study used a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to 1) determine {{the effectiveness of}} an 8 -month book club intervention for increasing PA participation and self-worth, and reducing barriers at 1 -year followup; and 2) identify reasons why <b>completers</b> and noncompleters {{did or did not}} maintain PA. Methods: One year after the cessation of Women Bound to be Active (WBA), <b>completers</b> (participated in posttesting; n = 30) and noncompleters (did not participate in posttesting; n = 22) responded to questionnaires and interviews assessing their body mass index (BMI), current PA participation, barriers, and global self-worth. Results: Compared with noncompleters, <b>completers</b> reported decreases in BMI, higher motivation for PA, higher ratio of benefits to barriers, and more consistent PA. Both groups still reported barriers to PA, especially time; however, <b>completers</b> more often reported strategies for overcoming these barriers. <b>Completers</b> more directly discussed the impact of their improved self-worth on their PA participation. Conclusions: In the future, a greater focus on time management and self-regulation strategies should be emphasized in PA interventions, specifically those that focus on women.

40|$|Abstract Background The anatomy course offers {{important}} {{opportunities to}} develop professionalism {{at an early}} stage in medical education. It is an academically significant course that also engenders stress in some students. Methods Over a three-year period, 115 of 297 students completed creative projects. Thirty-four project <b>completers</b> and 47 non-completers consented to participate in the study. Projects were analyzed for professionalism themes using grounded theory. A subset of project <b>completers</b> and non-completers were interviewed to determine their views about the stress of anatomy and medical school, as well as the value of the creative projects. We also compared test performance of project <b>completers</b> and non-completers. Results Projects completed early in the course often expressed ambivalence about anatomy, whereas later projects showed more gratitude and sense of awe. Project <b>completers</b> tended to report greater stress than noncompleters, but stated that doing projects reduced stress and caused them to develop a richer appreciation for anatomy and medicine. Project <b>completers</b> performed significantly lower than non-completers on the first written exam (pre-project). Differences between groups on individual exams after both the first and second creative project were nonsignificant.

40|$|The {{detrimental}} effects of alcoholism on society have stimulated {{the growth of}} addiction treatment centers. These programs are characterized by low completion rates. This fact has promoted {{a great deal of}} research aimed toward predicting treatment completion. If those "at risk" for dropping out of programs can be identified, they can be singled out for special consideration which could result in their success with treatment. Alternatively, if it can be determined that clients with certain characteristics have a high probability of completing treatment at specific centers, then patient characteristics can be "matched" with the program shown to offer such people the best opportunity for treatment completion. The majority of studies in this area have used MMPI scales and/or combinations of demographic variables for prediction. In general, these studies have not been very successful or have failed to replicate. Some reasons for this are small sample sizes, a limited number of variables used in prediction, and lack of cross validation. The present research addresses these problems by using large numbers of subjects and predictor variables. Cross validation was performed on an independent sample. Phase One subjects were drawn from archival records; a sample of three hundred and seventy subjects was obtained; two hundred were treatment <b>completers</b> and one hundred seventy non <b>completers.</b> Variables included in the analysis were; age, sex, race, education. marital status, nnuummbbeerr of dependents, employment status, previous treatments, weeks sober prior to treatment, place of residence, prescription medication, referring agent, self reported reasons for referral, and the three validity and ten standard clinical scales of the MMPI, Through discriminant analysis, an overall successful classification rate of 65. 4 % was obtained. Treatment <b>completers</b> were classified correctly 74. 0 % and non <b>completers</b> 55. 3 %. The cross validation sample was obtained and variables collected {{in the same manner as}} in phase one. Data from one hundred treatment <b>completers</b> and eighty non <b>completers</b> was collected. The discriminant function from phase one derived an overall successful classification rate of 56. 1 %. Treatment <b>completers</b> were classified correctly 69. 0 % and non <b>completers</b> 40. 0 %. Results highlight a dramatic failure to predict treatment dropouts. However, treatment <b>completers</b> could be predicted. The relevance of this finding for treatment matching was discussed. It was concluded that, due to the heterogeneity of alcoholic samples, personality measures such as the MMPI should only be used to describe population characteristics at specific treatment centers; generalization should not be expected. It was hypothesized that, by looking for specific predictors at each treatment center instead of searching for global predictors, treatment matching is feasible, and may be very helpful in reducing dropout rates...|$|R
40|$|Non-response is {{a serious}} threat to the {{external}} validity of longitudinal psychosocial studies. Little is known about potential systematic differences between patients with coronary artery disease who complete a psychosocial study and those who drop out prematurely due to non-response, or whether drop-outs may have a different cardiovascular risk. We studied a cohort of 1132 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). At baseline, all patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Type D Scale (DS 14). At 12 months follow-up, 70. 8 % (n[*]=[*] 802) of patients completed both questionnaires, while 29. 2 % (n[*]=[*] 330) dropped out. We observed significant differences in socio-demographic, clinical, and psychological baseline characteristics between <b>completers</b> and drop-outs. Drop-outs were younger, more likely to smoke, but less often prescribed cardiovascular medications, including calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as compared with <b>completers.</b> Drop-outs more often had depression, anxiety, and negative affectivity, as compared with <b>completers</b> (all p-values < 0. 05). After a median follow-up of 4 years, we found no significant differences in mortality risk between <b>completers</b> and drop-outs (6. 5 vs. 7. 3 %; adjusted HR 1. 34, 95 % CI 0. 82 – 2. 19, respectively). In conclusion, a possible attrition bias occurred, as drop-outs and <b>completers</b> differed systematically on some socio-demographic, clinical, and psychological baseline characteristics. Despite these differences, this did not translate into a poorer short-term prognosis, as there were no differences in the mortality risk of <b>completers</b> vs. drop-outs after a median follow-up of 4 years. In future prospective studies, attention should be paid to attrition bias, and its possible impact on study results and implications should be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the effects of selective attrition on the picture of bereavement adjustment painted by longitudinal studies. Originally, 185 con-jugally and nonconjugally bereaved adults (M age = 50, range 20 - 82) were administered a battery of self-report measures indexing psychological func-tioning and adjustment to loss. Complete data gathered six months later were available from 166 persons (133 <b>completers,</b> 33 dropouts), while for a follow-up conducted three years later, complete data were available from ninety-six <b>completers</b> and seventy dropouts. Based on the women in this sample, discriminant function analysis conducted at the six-month follow-up suggested that nonconjugally bereaved <b>completers</b> had been older, had been more recently bereaved, had experienced more loneliness, had reported their health relative in age peers to be less adequate, and had been more active copers. At three years, nonconjugally bereaved <b>completers</b> had been older, more affluent, and had been more lonely. No differences between refusers and <b>completers</b> were found for the conjugally bereaved at either the six-month or three-month occasions. Regarding attrition effects, these data sug-gest that distinctions between short-term and long-term time frames and between conjugal and nonconjugal bereavement are necessary. These data also indicate that longitudinal studies of nonconjugal bereavement may be presenting an inaccurate picture of post-death adjustment, while attrition bias in studies or conjugal bereavement may be less distorting in its impact...|$|R
