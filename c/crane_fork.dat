50|$|<b>Crane</b> <b>fork</b> or {{elevator}} handled:By {{this approach}} {{the tables are}} limited in size and weight. Typical widths are between 6 and 10 ft, typical lengths are between 12 and 20 ft, though table sizes may vary in size and form. The major distinction {{of this approach is}} that the tables are lifted either with a crane transport fork or by material platform elevators attached {{to the side of the}} building. They are usually transported horizontally to the elevator or crane lifting platform singlehandedly with shifting trolleys depending on their size and construction. Final positioning adjustments can be made by trolley. This technique enjoys popularity in the US, Europe and generally in high labor cost countries. The advantages of this approach in comparison to beam formwork or modular formwork is a further reduction of labor time and cost. Smaller tables are generally easier to customize around geometrically complicated buildings, (round or non rectangular) or to form around columns in comparison to their large counterparts. The disadvantages of this approach are the higher material costs and increased crane time (if lifted with <b>crane</b> <b>fork).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{portable}} {{boat lift}} {{is not a}} boat yard <b>crane,</b> <b>fork</b> lift with elongated forks, or machine, none {{of which can be}} easily transported from location to location. A portable boat lift is not a boat lift which is commonly found attached to a dock. Although some devices allow one person to separate a boat from a trailer or lift a boat {{up and out of the}} water, they are not by definition portable.|$|E
50|$|The museum also {{houses the}} Ipswich Engineering Collection, which {{includes}} many items from well known companies including Ransomes, Sims and Jefferies, Ransomes and Rapier, Cranes, Reavell and Cocksedge. The display includes <b>cranes,</b> <b>fork</b> lift trucks, lawnmowers and agricultural equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} building {{was used to}} supply power to the wharves, and as an electrical workshop. During its years as a powerhouse, the building contained a compressor, an emergency power generator, and transformers. A compressor was installed in 1955 to supply air to the wharves, {{and it was in}} this year that electrical workshop equipment was installed. The workshop maintained 21 <b>cranes,</b> <b>fork</b> lifts, and two stevedoring units. The workshop was still in use by 1958 and possibly later.|$|R
5000|$|MATERIALS HANDLING : MPDS4 MECHANICAL HANDLING is {{a design}} {{application}} {{with a series}} of configurable catalogs of mechanical materials handling components, which can be physically interconnected to form part of an industrial process. It includes catalogs of conveyor belts, <b>cranes,</b> <b>fork</b> lift trucks, industrial racking and robots and allows installation designers to select, lay out, configure, visualise and add intelligence to process machinery in a plant. The module also supports the controlled creation of product specials for materials handling.|$|R
50|$|The airport's Cargo-handling {{facilities}} include <b>cranes,</b> heavy <b>fork</b> lifts, {{roller pallet}} lifts and conveyor belts. There is twenty-four-hour fire protection {{at the airport}} with 112 trained personnel working at the fire station.|$|R
40|$|This manual {{describes}} the safe and cost effective operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair requirements for <b>cranes,</b> hoists, <b>fork</b> trucks, slings, rigging hardware, and hoisting equipment. It {{is intended to}} be a user's guide to requirements, codes, laws, regulations, standards, and practices that apply to Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and its subcontractors...|$|R
50|$|Assembly {{lines are}} {{designed}} for the sequential organization of workers, tools or machines, and parts. The motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible. All parts or assemblies are handled either by conveyors or motorized vehicles such as fork lifts, or gravity, with no manual trucking. Heavy lifting is done by machines such as overhead <b>cranes</b> or <b>fork</b> lifts. Each worker typically performs one simple operation.|$|R
50|$|A typical modern {{recovery}} fleet {{will operate}} a great diversity {{of different types}} of recovery and support vehicles. This will include basic service vans, mobile workshops, lift and tow vehicles often called tow trucks, transporters and trailers. It is not uncommon for them to also operate mobile <b>cranes,</b> road going <b>fork</b> lifts, articulated tractor units and incident support vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the word}} [...] "slip" [...] implies, the ships or boats are moved over the ramp, {{by way of}} <b>crane</b> or <b>fork</b> lift, prior to the move the vessel's hull is coated with grease, which then allows the ship or boat to [...] "slip" [...] off of the ramp and {{progress}} safely into the water. Slipways are used to launch (newly built) large ships, but can only dry-dock or repair smaller ships. Pulling large ships against the greased ramp would require too much force. For dry-docking large ships, one must use carriages supported by wheels or by roller-pallets. These types of dry-docking installations are called [...] "marine railways". Nevertheless the words [...] "slip" [...] and [...] "slipway" [...] are also used for all dry-docking installations that use a ramp.|$|R
50|$|Terminals {{at seven}} {{locations}} namely Kottapuram, Aluva, Maradu, Viakom, Thaneermukam (Chertala), Trikkunnapuzha and Kayamkulam {{have already been}} constructed.Under PDO/PDC mechanism, the PDO was entrusted the work of formulating a project for operation and maintenance of these terminals as a PPP project. The PDO had made a field visit and collected relevant data {{and they were in}} the process of formulating the project. Construction of 8th terminal at Kollam by CPWD was also in progress. For providing facilities for mechanical handling at these terminals, 8 mobile <b>cranes</b> and 8 <b>fork</b> lifts were procured and provided at each terminal.|$|R

Código de referência: IPL/ 2016 /W 2 E_ESTeSLIn several ossupational {{settings}} {{have been}} reported organic dust occupational exposure and in many is common tu use vehicles to transport raw material and final products or even elevators to guarantee workers and material transportation within the facilities. Measurements of particles and sample colection to assess fungal burden were done during the use of one docker's <b>crane,</b> one <b>fork</b> lift and one elevator in waste industry. All reference air sample presented much less air fungal contamination thet inside de cabins. Statistically significant differences were detected in the mass concentration for almost all particles sizes between the cabins and the background where the vehicles was circulating. This pilot study suggests that workers carry fungi from their outdoor work into vehicles cabinets and elevator and exposure to particles still occurs in the cabins. To reduce exposure focus should be on interventions related with ventilation and good hygene parctices. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Telescopic {{systems of}} {{structural}} members with clearance {{are found in}} many applications, e. g., mobile <b>cranes,</b> rack feeders, <b>fork</b> lifters, stacker <b>cranes</b> (see Figure 1). Operating these machines, undesirable vibrations may reduce the performance and increase safety problems. Therefore, this contribution has the aim to reduce these harmful vibrations. For a better understanding, the dynamic behaviour of these constructions is analysed. The main interest is the overlapping area of each two sections of the above described systems (see markings in Figure 1) which is investigated by measurements and by computations. A test rig is constructed to determine the dynamic behaviour by measuring fundamental vibrations and higher frequent oscillations, damping coefficients, special appearances and more. For an appropriate physical model, the governing boundary value problem is derived by applying Hamilton’s principle and a classical discretisation procedure is used to generate a coupled system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations as the corresponding truncated mathematical model. On {{the basis of this}} model, a controller concept for preventing harmful vibrations is developed...|$|R
40|$|A lifting fixture {{has been}} {{designed}} to handle the Samus counters. These counters are being removed from the D-zero area and will be transported off site for further use at another facility. This fixture is designed specifically for this particular application and will be transferred along with the counters. The future use of these counters may entail installation at a facility without access to a crane and therefore a lift fixture suitable for both <b>crane</b> and/or <b>fork</b> lift usage has been created The counters weigh approximately 3000 lbs. and have threaded rods extended through the counter at the top comers for lifting. When these counters were first handled/installed these rods were used in conjunction with appropriate slings and handled by crane. The rods are secured with nuts tightened against the face of the counter. The rod thread is M 16 x 2 ({approx}. 625 -inch dia.) and extends 2 -inch (on average) {{from the face of the}} counter. It is this cantilevered rod that the lift fixture engages with 'C' style plates at the four top comers. The strongback portion of the lift fixture is a steel rectangular tube 8 -inch (vertical) x 4 -inch x. 25 -inch wall, 130 -inch long. 1. 5 -inch square bars are welded perpendicular to the long axis of the rectangular tube at the appropriate lift points and the 'C' plates are fastened to these bars with 3 / 4 - 10 high strength bolts -grade 8. Two short channel sections are positioned-welded-to the bottom of the rectangular tube on 40 feet centers, which are used as locators for fork lift tines. On the top are lifting eyes for sling/crane usage and are rated at 3500 lbs. safe working load each - vertical lift only...|$|R
