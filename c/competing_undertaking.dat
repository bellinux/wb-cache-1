We show that uncoordinated screening behavior of competing financiers may be not only the source of an important financial multiplier, but also an independent source of fluctuations inducing investment cycles. The screening cycle mechanism is robust to generalizations along many dimensions. We are grateful for the comments by seminar participants at the Swedish School of Economics, Londo...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{foreign direct}} investment (FDI) competition in a three-country framework: two Northern countries and one Southern country. We have in mind the competition of Airbus and Boeing in a developing country. The host-country government endogenizes tariffs, while Airbus and Boeing choose domestic output and FDI. Wages and employment in the home countries are negotiated. We find that in the unique equilibrium, both Airbus and Boeing <b>compete</b> to <b>undertake</b> FDI in the developing country. This arises because the host country can play off the multinationals, which in turn stems from three factors: (a) oligopolistic rivalry; (b) quid pro quo FDI; (c) strategic outsourcing-FDI drives down the union wages at home if the host-country wage is sufficiently low. However, if the host-country wage is sufficiently high, the union wage increases under FDI. In such cases, FDI competition benefits the multinationals, the labor unions, {{as well as the}} host country. Copyright � 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} coursework set for final year degree students designed to teach Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The usefulness {{of this approach is}} discussed with respect to its application in future iterations of the coursework. The source data {{was the result of a}} simulation between <b>competing</b> student teams <b>undertaken</b> on a mainstream ERP system provided by the business software vendor SAP A. G. and using the ERPsim software provided by ERPsim Lab at HEC Montreal. The simulation generated data on which Business Intelligence (BI) is typically based and is representative of business activity. The data generated by the simulation exercise was not specifically for FCA, thus it provides a meaningful test of FCA in BI...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{analyses}} of the <b>competing</b> claims were <b>undertaken</b> at the time, with conflicting results. In one such study, Auburn University political scientist James H. Gundlach concluded that {{a detailed analysis of}} the returns, compared with 1998 results and returns from undisputed counties, [...] "strongly suggests a systematic manipulation of the voting results." [...] The Gundlach study also suggested a mechanism by which this could have been effected, and proposed a conclusion that Siegelman won. An earlier analysis reported by the Associated Press, using a less sophisticated comparison of gubernatorial and legislative returns, was claimed to indicate that the revised returns were more accurate, and that Riley probably won. [...] The Gundlach paper offers a refutation of the conclusions of the Associated Press study.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} foreign-direct-investment (FDI) {{competition in}} a three-country framework: two Northern countries and one Southern country. We {{have in mind}} the competition of Airbus and Boeing (or GM and Volkswagen) in a developing country. The host-country government endogeneizes tariffs, while Airbus and Boeing choose domestic output and FDI. Wages and employment in the home countries are bargained over between labor and management. We find that in the unique equilibrium, both Airbus and Boeing <b>compete</b> to <b>undertake</b> FDI in the developing country. This arises because the host country can play off the multinational corporations, which in turn stems from three factors: (a) Oligopolistic rivalry; (b) Quid prod quo FDI, which reduces tariffs; (c) Strategic outsourcing-FDI drives down the union wages at home if the host-country wage is sufficiently low. However, if the host-country wage is sufficiently high, then the union wage increases under FDI. In such cases, FDI competition benefits the multinationals, the labor unions {{as well as the}} host country. If Boeing undertakes FDI while Airbus does not, then: (i) Boeing's market share and profits are higher than Airbus's; (ii) the tariff facing Boeing is lower than that facing Airbus.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis examines the migrationary processes of graduates leaving their home country and their post-migration experiences and aspirations in a receiving state. Using the case study of England, findings are presented from qualitative research with Polish graduates born between the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, and who moved to England after 2004. It is argued that this generation of Polish migrants is particularly important given the profound impacts of socio-cultural and economic transformation in Poland, tied {{to the emergence of}} capitalism, the preparation for accession of Poland to the European Union (EU) and EU citizenship in 2004, on current debates on the geographies of graduate migration within and beyond Europe. Several important findings are revealed by the research. First, it is asserted that perspectives of migration which focus on structure-agency relations (Halfacree, 1995) need to encompass the economic and political aspects of participants sending state at the time of migration, as well as the historical influences on migration decision-making processes. Second, the discussion shows that graduate migration to another country leads to differing approaches to career and life trajectory development after migration and this thesis conceptualises these using the following typology: Continuers, Switchers and Late Awakeners, with dynamism and slippage across the groupings. Third, the findings expose graduate migrant perceptions of becoming and being highly-skilled, and the role of university preparation, and other forms of post-graduate training and potentially strategic acquisitions of citizenship for labour market confidence to <b>compete</b> and <b>undertake</b> professional jobs in Poland and England. Fourth, the thesis stresses that migration is often a first step in graduate migrants life trajectories and it emphasises the importance of a stepping-stone migration, both socially and spatially, and which is embedded within individuals' life-phases and perceptions of home and place. It is argued that this conceptual and geographic contribution to wider studies of graduate migration across countries may have wider resonance to other graduate migrant groups in Europe and beyond...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} focused on the latest {{information}} asymmetry issue in the Czech Republic on the retail banking services market. The problem considers credit union (savings cooperative) business that seemed stable after the problematic restructure 10 years ago. But during this January the payment from Deposit Insurance Fund of the Czech Republic had to compensate the consumers of the MSD credit union. This subject provided services with higher interest rates even during the last years of technically zero interest rate of the central bank. A question information asymmetry and the moral hazard arose again. All that is written in famous study for European central bank by VesalaetGropp supporting the explicit deposit insurance system is correct but the conditions has partially changed. Credit unions try to <b>compete</b> with banks <b>undertaking</b> a higher level of credit risk but still being within Basel II accords. The paper is considering the question of the future development – to try to compete with the conventional banks as FIO credit union successfully did or to return to “Austrian” model. Next future trend is outlined in sum up of the deposit insurance system characteristics backed by other several studies. Also the problem of information asymmetry overcome is being discussed with the result that mostly used monitoring indicator cannot be applied to credit union market...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} dynamic {{extension}} of the classic static model of Bertrand price competition that allows <b>competing</b> duopolists to <b>undertake</b> cost-reducing investments {{in an attempt to}} “leapfrog ” their rival to attain low-cost leadership — at least temporarily. We show that leapfrogging occurs in equilibrium, resolving the Bertrand investment paradox., i. e. leapfrogging explains why firms have an ex ante incentive to undertake cost-reducing investments even though they realize that simultaneous investments to acquire {{the state of the art}} production technology would result in Bertrand price competition in the product market that drives their ex post profits to zero. Our analysis provides a new interpretation of “price wars”. Instead of constituting a punishment for a breakdown of tacit collusion, price wars are fully competitive outcomes that occur when one firm leapfrogs its rival to become the new low cost leader. We show that the equilibrium involves investment preemption only when the firms invest in a deterministically alternating fashion and technological progress is deterministic. We prove that when technological progress is deterministic and firms move in an alternating fashion, the game has a unique Markov perfect equilibrium. When technological progress is stochastic or if firms move simultaneously, equilibria are generally not unique. Unlike the static Bertrand model, the equilibria of the dynamic Bertrand model are generally inefficient. Instead of having too little investment in equilibrium, we show that duopoly investments generally exceed the socially optimum level. Yet, we show that when investment decisions are simultaneous there is a “monopoly ” equilibrium when one firm makes all the investments...|$|R
