40|$|The capsule of {{pathogenic}} bacteria {{is one of}} {{the most}} important virulence factors. Hiss 2 Ì† 7 s method, a standard bacterial capsule stain, is used for <b>capsule</b> <b>identification.</b> However it was difficult to stain the capsules of some bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. This paper presents a stain method based on both Gram stain and Indian-ink stain. The proposed stain method allowed clear identification of the capsule of S. pneumoniae. This method is easy and simple in use, and can be extended to other bacterial species and/or clinical specimens...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} 0. 1 &#x 0025; Trypan Blue dye to stain the anterior capsule for capsulorhexis in mature and hypermature cataracts. Methods: This preliminary study included 25 eyes of 25 patients with a unilateral mature or hypermature cataract, including one case of traumatic mature cataract. In all these cases 0. 2 ml of 0. 1 &#x 0025; trypan blue dye was used to stain the anterior capsule. The efficacy and safety of the dye was evaluated {{on the basis of}} intraoperative and postoperative observations. Results: In all 25 eyes the capsulorhexis was completed. There was peripheral extension of the capsulorhexis in the eye with traumatic cataract and the stained edge of the anterior <b>capsule</b> helped <b>identification</b> and redirection of the capsulorhexis. Successful phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation was performed in all eyes. Adverse reactions related to the dye such as raised intraocular pressure, anterior chamber inflammation and endothelial damage were not observed in the immediate postoperative period or at the end of mean follow-up of 3 months. Conclusion: Trypan blue dye staining of the anterior capsule appears to be a very useful and safe technique that simplifies capsulorhexis in mature and hypermature cataracts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prenatal {{factors may}} {{contribute}} to the development of peanut allergy. We evaluated the risk of childhood peanut allergy in association with pregnancy exposure to Rh immune globulin, folic acid and ingestion of peanut-containing foods. Methods We conducted a web-based case-control survey using the Anaphylaxis Canada Registry, a pre-existing database of persons with a history of anaphylaxis. A total of 1300 case children with reported peanut allergy were compared to 113 control children with shellfish allergy. All were evaluated for maternal exposure in pregnancy to Rh immune globulin and folic acid tablet supplements, as well as maternal avoidance of dietary peanut intake in pregnancy. Results Receipt of Rh immune globulin in pregnancy was not associated with a higher risk of peanut allergy (odds ratio [OR] 0. 86, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 51 to 1. 45), nor was initiation of folic acid tablet supplements before or after conception (OR 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 19 to 1. 48). Complete avoidance of peanut-containing products in pregnancy was associated with a non-significantly lower risk of peanut allergy (OR 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 27 to 1. 03). Conclusion The risk of childhood peanut allergy was not modified by the following common maternal exposures in pregnancy: Rh immune globulin, folic acid or peanut-containing foods. Clinical implications Rh immune globulin, folic acid supplement use and peanut avoidance in pregnancy have yet to be proven to modulate the risk of childhood anaphylaxis to peanuts. <b>Capsule</b> Summary <b>Identification</b> of prenatal factors that contribute to peanut allergy might allow for prevention of this life-threatening condition. This article explores the role of three such factors. </p...|$|R
40|$|General Description: Perennial {{herbaceous}} plant {{with a single}} erect stem 2 - 8 inches tall and {{a single pair of}} broad, parallelveined, pleated leaves at or above the middle of the stem, which is covered with woolly hairs. Flowers droop in a tight cluster of 2 - 4 {{at the tip of the}} stem and consist of greenish-brown or greenish-purple petals and sepals, usually purple-lined or mottled, and a greenish-yellow pouch with brownish-purple margins, often with a purplish tinge. The stem above the leaves becomes erect and elongates as the <b>capsules</b> develop. <b>Identification</b> Tips: Cypripedium fasciculatum is quite distinctive and is not likely to be confused with any other taxon. Even without flowers, the single pair of broad, parallel-veined leaves and the densely hairy stem are quite diagnostic. Phenology: Flowers from early May through mid-June. Range: Occurs in coniferous forests along the Cascade-Sierran axis from Washington to central California and at widely scattered locations in the Rocky Mountains in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. In WA, the species is known from the eastern slopes of the Cascades in the Eastern Cascades physiographic province in Chelan, Kittitas, Klickitat, and Yakima counties, in the Columbia Basin physiographic province in Whitman County, in the Blue Mountains physiographic province in Columbia and Garfield counties, and one occurrence in Pierce County in the Western Cascades physiographic province. There is also a historical record from Skamania County. Habitat: Mid- to late seral Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) or ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) overstories with a closed herbaceous layer and variable shrub layer, mostly on northerly aspects. Elevations range considerably, from approximately 1200 feet to more than 5000 feet above sea level. Associated species include Oregon boxwood (Pachistima myrsinites), oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), spiraea (Spiraea betulifolia), Oregon grape (Berberis nervosa), pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens), heart-leaf arnica (Arnica cordifolia) and elk sedg...|$|R
40|$|Study of the {{biomechanics}} of the {{ocular lens}} {{is imperative to}} increasing {{our understanding of the}} role of the ocular lens in accommodation, to improving current surgical methods (cataract and intraocular lens replacement), and to better qualify the nature and mechanics of injuries sustained to the ocular lens (lens dehiscence, lens perforation, and traumatic cataract). Previous work done to determine and model the mechanical properties of the ocular lens includes non-ideal experimental assumptions and lack of qualified data. The goal of this work is to produce and analyze data suitable for the creation of an ultrastructurally based computational model of the ocular lens and make progress toward the generation of such a model. The creation of a model requires the determination of the material properties as well as identification of the ultrastructure of the tissue to be modeled. Unconfined compression testing of the whole porcine ocular lens, puncture testing of the whole porcine ocular lens, and nanoindentation of the anterior porcine and human lens capsule were performed to generate data from which to calculate material properties of the lens. Cryo-electron tomography and confocal LASER scanning microscopy were employed to determine the ultrastructure of the porcine lens capsule and porcine lens fiber cells, respectively. Test data were produced from the mechanical tests and the fitting of parameters to calculate material properties were started. Potential identification of the type-IV collagen meshwork of the lens <b>capsule</b> and positive <b>identification</b> of the lens fiber cells were achieved. Preliminary modeling work was started with the data available using Abaqus (simulia. com) and Tahoe (tahoe. sourceforge. net) ...|$|R
