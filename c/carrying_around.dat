5|$|As the Allies {{prepared}} for the liberation of Europe, the mass deportations began {{at a rate of}} four trains a day from Hungary to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, each train <b>carrying</b> <b>around</b> 3,000 people. Between 15 May and 8 July 1944, 437,402 Hungarian Jews are recorded as having been sent there on 147 trains, most gassed on arrival. The transports comprised most of the Jewish population outside Budapest, the Hungarian capital.|$|E

5|$|Ships {{carrying}} ice {{needed to}} be particularly strong {{and there was a}} premium placed on recruiting good crews, able to move the cargo quickly to its location before it melted. By the end of the 19th century, the preferred choice was a wooden-hulled vessel, to avoid rust corrosion from the melting ice, while windmill pumps were installed to remove the excess water from the hull using bilge pumps. Ice cargoes tended to cause damage to ships in the longer term, as the constant melting of the ice and the resulting water and steam encouraged dry rot. Shipment sizes varied; depending on the ports and route. The typical late 19th century U.S. vessel was a schooner, <b>carrying</b> <b>around</b> 600 tons (500,000kg) of ice; a large shipment from Norway to England might include up to 900 tons (800,000kg).|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai Suburban Railway, popularly {{referred}} to as Locals forms {{the backbone of the}} city's transport system. It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways. Mumbai's suburban rail systems carried a total of 6.3million passengers every day in 2007. Trains are overcrowded during peak hours, with nine-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually <b>carrying</b> <b>around</b> 4,500 passengers at peak hours. The Mumbai rail network is spread at an expanse of 319 route kilometres. 191 rakes (train-sets) of 9 car and 12 car composition are utilised to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.|$|E
5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, <b>carrying</b> <b>around</b> 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} heavily {{used for the}} {{shipment}} of bricks from the brickworks around Brill, and of cattle and milk from the dairy farms on the Wotton estate. By 1875 the line was <b>carrying</b> <b>around</b> 40,000gallons (180,000l; 48,000USgal) of milk each year. Delivery of linseed cake to the dairy farms and of coal to the area's buildings were also important uses of the line. The line also began to carry large quantities of manure from London to the area's farms, carrying 3,200tons (3,300t) in 1872. As {{it was the only}} physical link between the Tramway and the national railway network, almost all of this traffic passed through Quainton Road station.|$|E
5|$|The {{silk road}} toward the west was opened by the Chinese in the 2nd century CE. The main road left from Xi'an, going either to the north or south of the Taklamakan desert, {{one of the most}} arid in the world, before {{crossing}} the Pamir Mountains. The caravans that employed this method to exchange silk with other merchants were generally quite large, including from 100 to 500 people as well as camels and yaks <b>carrying</b> <b>around</b> 140 kg (300 lb) of merchandise. They linked to Antioch and the coasts of the Mediterranean, about one year's travel from Xi'an. In the South, a second route went by Yemen, Burma, and India before rejoining the northern route.|$|E

25|$|Telescopic rods {{are popular}} among surf fishermen. <b>Carrying</b> <b>around</b> a 12 or 14ft surf fishing rod, even in two pieces, is cumbersome. The shorter the {{sections}} the shorter they close, the more eyes they have, {{and the better}} the power curve is in them. More eyes means better weight and stress distribution throughout the parabolic arc. This translates to further casting, stronger fish fighting abilities, and less breaking of the rod.|$|E

At 7:30am on Friday, 18 June 1982, a postal clerk was crossing Blackfriars Bridge and noticed Calvi's body hanging from the scaffolding beneath.

25|$|The small {{airplanes}} and asphalt-paved airstrip of Caye Caulker Airport may appear small to visitors accustomed to jet airliners and long concrete runways, {{but the system}} of barrier islands support a lively network of air transportation {{with an array of}} travel times. For those passengers preferring a route more commonly adopted by locals, there is a regular water taxi service providing transportation to and from the island. Taxi service is available from the main Belize City airport. The speedboats used are capable of <b>carrying</b> <b>around</b> 50 people. The watercraft typically sport two or three large motors and make the journey in about 45–50 minutes.|$|E
25|$|As T-REX {{began to}} wrap up, CDOT's next major effort began with Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX). It {{could be argued}} that COSMIX was even more {{important}} to Colorado's interests than T-REX had been, since the Colorado Springs corridor of I-25 had seen immense growth over the past four decades, and experienced major choke points all along the 16-mile corridor from Exit 135 (Academy Blvd) in the south to Exit 151 (Briargate Pkwy) in the north. Originally <b>carrying</b> <b>around</b> 8500 vehicles per day in 1960, usage of the former Monument Valley Freeway had grown to an average of 100,000 vehicles per day by 2005.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} September Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin {{convinced}} the trade unions that he owned to begin another strike for Maga's inability to promote national development and ensure {{the welfare of the}} working class.

At the same time members of the UDD organised a motion of censure in the National Assembly. Maga relied on Apithy for help in opposing the motion, and it was ultimately rejected.|$|E
