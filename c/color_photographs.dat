5|$|It is {{presented}} as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page James Cameron's Avatar: The Reusable Scrapbook for children. The Art of Avatar was released on , 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface. In , Abrams Books also released The Making of Avatar, a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> and illustrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry <b>color</b> <b>photographs,</b> so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E

5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E
5|$|Krekeler's text {{uses the}} National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges' {{numerical}} system for recording covered bridges. The {{system is a}} collection of three sets of two digits used to represent the state, the county and the designated bridge respectively. The book includes detailed information on each state's historic bridges before providing an individual listing of surveyed bridges. A typical page includes two entries on a single page. Each entry includes a description of the bridge, its history, a black and white photograph, and a local street map with directions. Interspersed throughout the book {{is a collection of}} <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> ranging from a full page to a quarter page in size. Krekeler states that construction dates prior to 1850 are often questionable because of an absence of records and that these early sources would often contradict one another. Krekeler's bibliography cites an extensive collection of state maps, numerous local newspaper sources and works like World Guide to Covered Bridges by Richard Donovan. The information and sources used are cited {{at the end of each}} entry listing in the book, directly following the directions to the bridge. The book does not contain a typical index and instead favors a listing of bridges after the introduction of the state. The book was published in 1989 by Daring Books.|$|E

25|$|Another very notable {{practitioner}} was Adolf Miethe, {{with whom}} Prokudin-Gorsky studied in Germany in 1902. Miethe was a photochemist who greatly improved the panchromatic {{characteristics of the}} black-and-white photographic materials suitable for use with this method of color photography. He presented projected <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> to the German Imperial Family in 1902 and was exhibiting them {{to the general public}} in 1903, when they also began to appear in periodicals and books. Miethe took the first known aerial <b>color</b> <b>photographs,</b> from a hot air balloon, in 1906.|$|E

25|$|Grit was {{a pioneer}} in the {{introduction}} of offset printing.

25|$|In 1980 his brother, {{cardiologist}} Michael J. Halberstam, {{was shot}} and killed during a home invasion by escaped convict and prolific burglar Bernard C.

25|$|Her cookbooks {{avoid an}} encyclopedic format, and are modeled on coffee table books. With many <b>color</b> <b>photographs,</b> {{including}} a full-page picture facing each recipe, some {{critics argue that}} this method sacrifices space {{that could be used}} for recipes. Nevertheless, her cookbooks have received positive reviews; in 2005, fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis named Garten one of her favorite authors. , Garten's cookbooks have sold over six million copies combined. As of October 2014 she had published nine cookbooks.|$|E

25|$|The format {{supports}} up to 8 {{bits per pixel}} {{for each}} image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> and other images with color gradients, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.|$|E
25|$|A novelization of Tron was {{released}} in 1982, written by American science fiction novelist Brian Daley. It included eight pages of <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> from the movie. Also that year, Disney Senior Staff Publicist Michael Bonifer authored a book entitled The Art of Tron which covered aspects of the pre-production and post-production aspects of Tron. A nonfiction book about {{the making of the}} original film, The Making of Tron: How Tron Changed Visual Effects and Disney Forever, was written by William Kallay and published in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{revelation of}} the letter caused a {{sensation}} at the time, but was soon met with accusations of forgery and misrepresentation. Subsequent study, including handwriting analysis of higher quality <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> of the document, first published in 2000, revealed more possible evidence of forgery, and led scholars such as Craig A. Evans and Emanuel Tov to conclude the work is a hoax, with Smith being the most likely perpetrator. However, while {{an increasing number of}} scholars have been convinced by this view, many still maintain that the Mar Saba letter itself is genuine, and debate continues about the authenticity of the letter and the Secret Gospel it describes.|$|E

25|$|The fact that, {{for many}} years, no other {{scholars}} besides Smith {{were known to}} have seen the manuscript contributed to the suspicions of forgery. This dissipated {{with the publication of}} <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> in 2000, and the revelation that Guy Stroumsa and several others had viewed the manuscript in 1976. In response to the idea that Smith had kept other scholars from inspecting the manuscript, Scott G. Brown noted that he was in no position to do so. The manuscript was still where Smith had left it when Stroumsa and company found it eighteen years later, and it did not disappear until many years after its relocation to Jerusalem and its separation from the book.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{research}} has uncovered {{more about the}} manuscript. In 1977, librarian Father Kallistos Dourvas removed the two pages containing the text from the book to photograph and re-catalog them. However, the re-cataloging never happened; Kallistos later told Charles W. Hedrick and Nikolaus Olympiou that the pages were then kept separately alongside the book at least {{until his retirement in}} 1990. Some time after that, however, the pages were put elsewhere, and various attempts to locate them since that time have been unsuccessful. Olympiou suggests that individuals at the Patriarchate Library may be withholding the pages due to Morton Smith's sensational use of them. Father Kallistos gave his <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> of the manuscript to Hedrick and Olympiou, who published them in The Fourth R in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, Brower {{launched}} the Exhibit Format book series with This Is the American Earth, and in 1962 In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World, with <b>color</b> <b>photographs</b> by Eliot Porter. These coffee-table books, published by their Sierra Club Books division, introduced the Sierra Club {{to a wider}} audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold {{in the first four}} years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as In Wildness. Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.|$|E
