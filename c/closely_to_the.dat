5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that the}} razorbill is the closest living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building.

This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Pinguinus alfrednewtoni was a larger, {{and also}} flightless, {{member of the}} genus Pinguinus that lived during the Early Pliocene. Known from bones found in the Yorktown Formation of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina, it is {{believed}} to have split, along with the great auk, from a common ancestor. Pinguinus alfrednewtoni lived in the western Atlantic, while the great auk lived in the eastern Atlantic. After the former died out following the Pliocene, the great auk took over its territory. The great auk was not related <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other extinct genera of flightless alcids, Mancalla, Praemancalla, and Alcodes.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers.

5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
5|$|This large kiwi {{is one of}} five {{species of}} kiwis {{residing}} in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), Okarito brown kiwi (Apteryx rowi), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii), and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). Great spotted kiwis are related most <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little spotted kiwi. The kiwi genus, Apteryx, is endemic to New Zealand, 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic. Kiwis are placed in the ratite family, which also includes the emu, ostrich, rhea, and cassowary. All ratites are flightless. Kiwi are closely related to the extinct moa bird that once inhabited New Zealand.|$|E

Its episodes are approved by Rare's Gregg Mayles for their applicability to the game. The cartoon was also designed to give viewers tips on how to interact with the in-game piñatas.

5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E
5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.|$|E

5|$|In Hawaii, Blaine {{worked to}} bind the kingdom more <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States {{and to avoid}} its {{becoming}} a British protectorate. When the McKinley Tariff of 1890 eliminated the duty on sugar, Hawaiian sugar-growers looked {{for a way to}} retain their once-exclusive access to the American market. The Hawaiian minister to the United States, Henry A. P. Carter, tried to arrange for Hawaii have complete trade reciprocity with the United States, but Blaine proposed instead that Hawaii become an American protectorate; Carter favored the idea, but the Hawaiian king, Kalākaua, rejected the infringement on his sovereignty. Blaine next procured the appointment of his former newspaper colleague John L. Stevens as minister to Hawaii. Stevens had long believed that the United States should annex Hawaii, and as minister he co-operated with Americans living in Hawaii in their efforts to bring about annexation. Their efforts ultimately culminated in a coup d'état against Kalākaua’s successor, Liliuokalani, in 1893. Blaine’s precise involvement is undocumented, but the results of Stevens’ diplomacy were in accord with his ambitions for American power in the region. The new government petitioned the United States for annexation, but by that time Blaine was no longer in office.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} c. 1150 to 1300, the warm dry summers and less severe winters of the Medieval Warm Period allowed {{cultivation}} at much greater heights {{above sea level}} and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying {{areas such as the}} Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The feudalism introduced under David I, particularly in the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. Barons, who held feudal tenures, had the right to hold baronial courts, which could deal with matters of land ownership. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing systems of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land. The predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system, based on the English model, impracticable in some areas. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E

5|$|The freeway turns east {{again and}} enters Union Township, {{coming to an}} {{interchange}} with CR 614 and Route 173. From here, I-78/US 22 continue east directly {{to the south of}} Route 173, coming to another interchange with that route as well as CR 625. Entering more commercial areas, Route 173 merges onto I-78/US 22 at exit 13. At exit 15, the highway meets an interchange with CR 513, and Route 173 splits from I-78/US 22 by heading north on CR 513. At this point, the freeway runs along the border of Franklin Township to the south and Clinton to the north before entirely entering Clinton and crossing the South Branch Raritan River. I-78/US 22 turns northeast and leaves Clinton for Clinton Township, where it has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for Route 173 that also provides access to Route 31. Immediately after is the interchange with Route 31.

5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of infected cells {{is to produce}} interferon, a cytokine that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting {{the production of a}} large group of proteins mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway. Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the adaptive immune system, which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as T cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus. Various antibodies are generated; some bind <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viral proteins and target them for phagocytosis (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after its}} secession, South Kasaian and Congolese troops clashed after the Congolese central {{government}} ordered an offensive against it. The offensive, {{planned to be}} the first act of an offensive against Katanga, was accompanied by widespread massacres of Baluba and a refugee crisis termed a genocide by some contemporaries. The state was rapidly overrun by Congolese troops. The violence in the suppression of Kasai provided much legitimacy to Joseph Kasa-Vubu's deposition of Patrice Lumumba from the office of Prime Minister in late 1960 and Lumumba's later arrest and assassination. As a result, South Kasai remained on relatively good terms with the new Congolese government from 1961. Its leaders, including Kalonji himself, served in both the South Kasaian government and the Congolese parliament. South Kasai continued to exercise quasi-independence while Congolese and United Nations troops were able to move through the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian gendarmerie. In April 1961, Kalonji took the royal title Mulopwe ("King of the Baluba") to tie the state more <b>closely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pre-colonial Luba Empire. The act divided the South Kasaian authorities and Kalonji was disavowed by the majority of South Kasai's parliamentary representatives in Léopoldville. In December 1961, Kalonji was arrested on a legal pretext in Léopoldville and imprisoned. UN and Congolese troops occupied South Kasai. In September 1962, shortly after his escape from prison and return to South Kasai, Kalonji was ousted by a military coup d'état which forced him into exile and brought the secession to an end.|$|E
