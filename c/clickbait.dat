500|$|Following its broadcast, Eaten Alive {{was widely}} criticized by viewers {{and the media}} for false advertising, as the {{majority}} of the two-hour special dealt with the search for Chumana, and as the anaconda did not swallow him as was advertised. Although promotional material on Discovery Channel's website claimed that Rosolie would enter the anaconda, its press release for the special stated that there was only a possibility that he would. Reaction to the special on social media was negative, with comparisons being drawn to the online practice of <b>clickbait,</b> a Twitter user remarking that [...] "calling this 'Getting Squeezed Really Hard' didn't sound as enticing", and others making references to a line from Sir Mix-a-Lot's song [...] "Baby Got Back" [...] referencing an [...] "anaconda" [...] in connection to the special.|$|E

50|$|By 2014, the {{ubiquity of}} <b>clickbait</b> on the web had begun {{to lead to a}} {{backlash}} against its use. Satirical newspaper The Onion launched a new website, ClickHole, that parodied <b>clickbait</b> websites such as Upworthy and BuzzFeed, and in August 2014, Facebook announced that it was taking technical measures to reduce the impact of <b>clickbait</b> on its social network, using, among other cues, the time spent by the user on visiting the linked page as a way of distinguishing <b>clickbait</b> from other types of content. Ad blockers and a general fall in advertising clicks also affected the <b>clickbait</b> model, as websites moved towards sponsored advertising and native advertising where the content of the article was more important than the click-rate.|$|E
40|$|The {{internet}} {{is changing the}} game for traditional print media, newspapers are now forced to move onto the web. The adjustment from print to the web has created a highly competitive market for most news brands. The increasing amount of information online which is constantly being pushed on the consumer’s from way too many different sources is creatinga different atmosphere for journalists. The need to stay competitive is generating new strategies for the online news brands trying to stay relevant. A new growing phenomenon in this atmosphere is called <b>clickbaiting,</b> which is best described by an exaggerated headline {{with little or no}} connection to the content that the article actually leads too. Focusing on the number of clicks the articles can get, instead of satisfying the consumers need. A gap in literature was identified between building long lasting trust relationship and the current online news media market. This study aim to find the most important factors that influence the consumers trust for <b>clickbaiting</b> online news brands. This was done through an exploration of the influential factors of online brand trust where six underlying factors of online brand trust was identified. Quantitative data was collected through an online survey, asking students of Luleå University of Technology their thoughts about trust in <b>clickbaiting</b> online news sites. A total of 197 full answers were collected and then analyzed through the use of statistical techniques. The conclusions from the data analysis suggested that a combination of the underlying factors brand reputation and good online experience was the most influential for explaining online brand trust. Implying that in practice, a consumer is likely to have a high trust for a <b>clickbaiting</b> news site that consistently provide a positive experience for the consumer, while still keeping up an image of being a reputable news site...|$|R

50|$|By late 2013, <b>clickbait</b> {{articles}} {{had become}} significantly prevalent, leading Facebook's chief product officer Chris Cox's team to hire survey panels {{to assess how}} News Feed was working. Subsequently, Facebook began adding ever-increasing numbers of data points to its algorithm to significantly reduce <b>clickbait.</b>|$|E
50|$|Various writers {{predicted}} that the website will be a long-term success because its content has consistently been creative and targets a wide audience. They assumed {{this to be the}} case as long as ClickHole's audience understand that the website parodies <b>clickbait,</b> and is not <b>clickbait</b> in itself.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clickbait</b> is a pejorative {{term for}} web content whose main {{goal is to}} get users to click on a link to go to a certain webpage. <b>Clickbait</b> {{headlines}} typically aim to exploit the [...] "curiosity gap", providing just enough information to make readers curious, but not enough to satisfy their curiosity without clicking through to the linked content.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clickbait</b> makes {{printing}} a {{web page}} difficult, as the printed version contains ads. This issue {{can be overcome}} using browser extensions such as Print Friendly & PDF in Google Chrome.|$|E
50|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, the techniques employed by <b>clickbait</b> authors {{can be considered}} derivative of yellow journalism, which presented little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead used eye-catching headlines that included exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering, or sensationalism.|$|E
50|$|Fake news {{websites}} deliberately publish hoaxes, propaganda, and disinformation {{to drive}} web traffic inflamed by social media.

Taboola said it would never knowingly allow a fake news ad to be displayed and that it took down the ad immediately. A company spokesperson said Taboola attempts to balance promoting free speech by allowing articles promoting unpopular views, {{with the need to}} screen for fake news or other misleading websites.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue that}} occurs with long web page {{printing}} {{is the use}} of ads known as <b>Clickbait</b> on websites. Therefore, the printed version of a web page with clickbaits will contains ads.

5000|$|Critics have {{dismissed}} The Canary as symptomatic {{of the narrow}} worldview they believe some supporters of Jeremy Corbyn have; one of which being the New Statesman, which has labeled The Canary as [...] "hyper-partisan", due to what it see's as its pro-Corbyn output.

5000|$|Prince Ea {{has been}} criticised by Boyinaband {{on the grounds}} that he doesn't provide sources for his assertions. Ea's claims criticised by Boyinaband include that [...] "the average person spends 4 years looking down at his cellphone", {{claiming}} that depression is simply a state of mind and being aware of depression is proof of not being depressed while simultaneously stating that in a decade depression will be the leading cause of death, that {{studies have shown that the}} average adult has an attention span a second lower than a goldfish, that watching short videos cause ADD, and that genetically modified food is harmful. He has also been criticised for the large amount of <b>clickbait</b> he shares on his Facebook page without disclosing that he is likely paid for the traffic generated to the <b>clickbait</b> articles, and the fact that he claims that social media has a bad influence while at the same time having such a large presence on social media.

5000|$|<b>Clickbait</b> {{has also}} been used to {{political}} ends, and in this respect has been blamed for the rise of post-truth politics. Katherine Viner, editor-in-chief at The Guardian wrote that [...] "chasing down cheap clicks {{at the expense of}} accuracy and veracity" [...] undermined the value of journalism and truth. Emotional subjects with stark headlines are widely shared and clicked, which resulted in what Slate described as an [...] "aggregation of outrage" [...] and a proliferation of websites across the political spectrum - including Breitbart News, Huffington Post, Salon, Townhall and the Gawker Media blogs - which profited by producing shareable short-form pieces offering simple moral judgements on political and cultural issues.|$|E

5000|$|Grayson Haver Currin of Pitchfork Media {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, stating, [...] "At its best, Sleep feels like compositionally rigorous new age music. It’s {{a place in}} which you can settle for a while, with or without a pillow, and emerge only when you are ready to rejoin the restive world." [...] However, Currin was also slightly critical of the release, stating, [...] "Sleep, then, is simply too didactic as a name. It’s a command that tells us how to enjoy something that clearly has other uses. That handle, combined with Richter’s conceit, has turned the record into a kind of <b>clickbait</b> story, too, which seems entirely antithetical to Richter’s point." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bipartisan Report is a pro-liberal, <b>clickbait</b> news outlet, {{known for}} {{creating}} heavily skewed headlines {{to appeal to}} the left. It claims to be [...] "The Internet’s Largest newspaper," [...] an unsubstantiated claim in conflict with the website's Alexa ranking.

5000|$|Stephen Stotch {{comments}} {{to his wife}} Linda how refreshing {{it is to be}} able to simply read the news, without having to deal with the online newspapers, which are filled with sponsored content, <b>clickbait</b> ads and hyperlinks, but she is in a near-catatonic state staring at her smartphone. Principal brings Jimmy in to talk with another disabled student, Nathan, who expresses distress at hearing the word [...] "retarded", but privately Nathan admits to Jimmy that he believes all the changes happening in South Park are not a coincidence and that [...] "a war is coming".

50|$|Quality {{content is}} a very common phrase used to {{describe}} content which aren't focused to increase the <b>clickbait</b> culture but rather {{to help those who}} get through it. Websites considered as content farms manipulate keywords to attract search engines to their website, but are considered to have content of poor quality. Quality content promises lower bounce rates as users find that content helpful and stay for a longer time. In contrast, content farms have higher bounce rates, as users tend not to stay after finding that the content is focused solely on fooling search engines. Several companies fill their web pages with a very high density of keywords and use techniques like LSI to make the page SEO-friendly. The over-use of these techniques are flagged as black-hat SEO techniques by Google algorithms.|$|E
