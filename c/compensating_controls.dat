50|$|The lack of {{encryption}} on SMS messages {{is an area}} {{of concern}} that is often discussed. This concern sometimes arises within the group of the bank’s technology personnel, due to their familiarity and past experience with encryption on the ATM and other payment channels. The lack of encryption is inherent to the SMS banking channel and several banks that use it have overcome their fears by introducing <b>compensating</b> <b>controls</b> and limiting the scope of the SMS banking application to where it offers an advantage over other channels.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} evaluation {{is made of}} the concept of vibration reduction by properly selected oscillatory collective and cyclic control applications. The investigations are based on experimental frequency response data covering advance ratios from approximately 0. 2 to 0. 85. Because there was no instrumentation for the measurement of the pitch and roll vibrations, these values were obtained by properly adding up the flap-bending moments at 3. 3 in. Any other quantity representing pitch/roll vibrations can be compensated for in the same fashion. The calculated control inputs required for vibration reduction stay within acceptable limits. For four of the five conditions tested they are smaller than the values used for the frequency response tests. As to be expected, the <b>compensating</b> <b>controls</b> greatly affect the blade loads, i. e., torsion, flap- and chordwise bending...|$|E

40|$|In June 2009 {{a working}} group of cross-agency subject matter experts was formed to {{identify}} and analyze the issues around E-Authentication and formulate recommendations for their resolution. The workgroup agreed that system owners have differing interpretations of E-Authentication, are investigating different solutions, and are often unable to work with agencies on E-Authentication implementations. As a result, some agencies have implemented <b>compensating</b> <b>controls</b> for meeting respective assurance levels. Therefore, a unified approach must be developed for meeting E-Authentication and single sign-on requirements, and consistently enable agencies to implement E-Authentication for Federal systems that are managed outside the agency, i. e.

40|$|The Article {{examines}} assumptions behind {{literature that}} uncritically assumes that securitization transactions are necessarily efficient, finding that these assumptions are unwarranted. The Article {{is the first}} to view securitization transactions from an unsecured creditor’s perspective, and concludes that from such a perspective, securitization is not the panacea its proponents claim it to be. The article first defines structured finance and describes the nature of the current market for asset-backed securities. Then, it outlines the benefits that securitization provides to originators and other transaction participants. With that background, it turns to the debate on the efficiency of secured transactions, applies the substance of this debate to structured finance transactions, and then examines the equitable challenges that may be made to avoid securitized asset transfers. The Article sounds a cautionary note concerning how securitization results in a general increase in the availability of credit beyond what may be called for by the common welfare. It also questions the widespread assumption that unsecured creditors have knowingly consented to all possible consequences of the securitization transactions in which they participate. Finally, it demonstrates how the rapid expansion of the securitization market has subjected transaction participants and third parties to mounting uncertainty. The article predicts that further research will support the conclusion that securitization is inefficient. The securitization structure is designed to divert value away from the originator, {{in the absence of any}} <b>compensating</b> <b>controls</b> on either the consideration received in exchange for the asset sale, or the debtor’s behavior The originator enjoys the benefits of this distributional inefficiency, at the expense of its unsecured creditors. The article predicts that courts, in the name of equity, will more carefully examine the structure of securitized transactions in connection with their supervision of an originator’s bankruptcy case. When the effects of these transactions are realized, courts and legislatures will take steps to address the distributional inefficiency of these transactions. Given the array of possible widespread and negative consequences of securitization, further exploration of the effects of securitization is urgent. Securitization is an innovation that, like many Wall Street innovations, may have drastically negative consequence...|$|E

The main advantage of the proposed control law is that the human knowledge about the plant under control is be used to design the controller and only one parameter vector in the adaptive mechanism is on-line adjusted.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the accurate trajectory tracking control of a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) based on the slip model prediction. Generally, a nonholonomic WMR may increase the slippage risk, when traveling on outdoor unstructured terrain (such as longitudinal and lateral slippage of wheels). In order to control a WMR stably and accurately under the effect of slippage, an unscented Kalman filter and neural networks (NNs) are applied to estimate the slip model in real time. This method exploits the model approximating capabilities of nonlinear state-space NN, and the unscented Kalman filter is used to train NN's weights online. The slip parameters can be estimated and used to predict the time series of deviation velocity, {{which can be used}} to <b>compensate</b> <b>control</b> inputs of a WMR.

40|$|Weather <b>compensated</b> <b>control</b> (abbreviated WCC) {{is still}} {{frequently}} used in HVAC control of large residential and tertiary buildings. With inadequate parameter settings, {{this type of}} control can result in uncomfortable room temperatures and excessive energy use. Depending on the starting point, energy savings potentials up to 20 % are reported for optimized control parameters of WCC in residential buildings. After a major retrofit that increases {{the relative importance of}} transient heat gains, the savings potential by improving parameter settings can even be larger. This paper investigates a residential apartment case study in detail and demonstrates that (near-) optimal parameters for open loop WCC can be obtained by building simulations. Also, the effect of a (building level) feedback control loop on the WCC parameter optimization using a (wireless) sensor network and building wide actuators has been investigated. For this case, 15 % energy savings have been found for improved open loop control, and up to 60 % potential savings for feedback control (while maintaining comfort). status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a comparative investigation of friction- <b>compensating</b> <b>control</b> strategies {{designed to improve}} low-velocity position tracking performance for servomechanisms. Several control methods are considered including adaptive control and estimation-based control. Additionally, the various controller designs incorporate different friction models ranging from classical friction and Stribeck friction to the less popular Dahl friction model. This investigation of friction models is motivated {{by the fact that}} there is little consensus in the literature on how best to model friction for dynamic friction compensation. The control strategies are compared in an extensive test program involving position tracking experiments on a direct- drive de motor. This effort addresses the current lack of comparative experimental results on friction compensation. The results show that the adaptive and estimation-based controllers outperform more traditional linear controllers. The experiments also yield insight into the appropriateness of the different friction models under the tested operating conditions. In particular, the Dahl model is observed to provide a reliable representation of friction behavior near zero velocity...|$|R

In fact, the CG design procedure consists of enforcing the separation between the compensation requirements from the constraint prescriptions. In this way, a system equipped with a CG [...] ...|$|R
