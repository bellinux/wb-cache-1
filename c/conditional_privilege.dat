50|$|He {{corresponded with}} Francesco Betti, a Roman of noble family, who {{advised him to}} come to Basle and lay his {{difficulties}} before Fausto Paulo Sozzini (Socinus). Pucci reached Basle about May 1577, and held a written disputation with Sozzini on the question of immortality. Pucci regarded all creatures as imperishable; Sozzini denied the natural immortality of man, treating a future life as a <b>conditional</b> <b>privilege.</b> On 4 June Pucci formulated his positions, under ten heads; Sozzini replied on 11 June; Pucci finished a rejoinder on 1 July. The discussion was interrupted by the expulsion of Pucci from Basle. He had publicly maintained an extreme form of Pelagianism, printing theses, ‘De Fide natura hominibus universis insita,’ in which he claimed that all men are by nature in a state of salvation. Soon afterwards an epidemic drove Sozzini from Basle; he completed an answer to Pucci at Zürich on 27 January 1578. This, in the following October, he forwarded to Pucci, who made notes on the margin of the manuscript, but wrote no formal reply.|$|E

40|$|The Court of Appeals of Maryland {{held that}} a party seeking to {{overcome}} a common law <b>conditional</b> <b>privilege</b> in a purely private defamation suit must do so by a preponderance of the evidence. Seley-Radtke v. Hosmane, 450 Md. 468, 474, 149 A. 3 d 573, 576 (2016). The court also held that evidentiary issues not addressed by the court of special appeals {{are not subject to}} review by the court of appeals. Id. at 510, 149 A. 3 d at 598 (citing Md. R. 8 - 131 (b) (1)). Further, the court held that prejudicial evidence irrelevant to a claim is not admissible at trial. Seley-Radtke, 450 Md. at 513 - 14, 149 Md. at 600. Katherine Seley-Radtke (2 ̆ 2 Seley-Radtke 2 ̆ 2) and Ramachandra Hosmane (2 ̆ 2 Hosmane 2 ̆ 2) were professors at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (2 ̆ 2 UMBC 2 ̆ 2). Following allegations that Hosmane sexually assaulted one of his graduate students, Brahmi Shukla (2 ̆ 2 Shukla 2 ̆ 2), UMBC officials conducted an investigation and determined that Hosmane violated UMBC 2 ̆ 7 s sexual harassment policy. On January 1, 2010, Hosmane resigned from his position on the condition that the findings from the UMBC investigation would not be publicized. Later, Hosmane and Shukla entered into a settlement agreement in which Hosmane paid Shukla 10, 000 in return for Shukla dropping any civil and criminal claims against Hosmane...|$|E

25|$|Icher played {{full-time}} on the Ladies European Tour in 2004, {{ending with}} five top ten finishes including a win at the Catalonia Ladies Masters. She retained her non-exempt status at the 2004 LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament by finishing tied fifty-fifth and elected to play her rookie {{season on the}} LPGA beginning the year with <b>conditional</b> playing <b>privileges.</b> A second-place finish at the Corona Morelia Championship in Mexico meant that after the re-rank she earned her full LPGA card for 2005. She finished 30th {{on the money list}} in her rookie season. She returned to the Ladies European Tour to play in the Catalonia Ladies Masters which she successfully defended. She started the 2006 season by pairing with Gwladys Nocera to represent France at the Women's World Cup of Golf.|$|R
50|$|After {{graduating from}} UCLA in June 2009 {{with a degree}} in {{communication}} studies, Joh turned professional and joined the Futures Tour, the official development tour of the LPGA Tour. She won one event on tour in 2010, the ING New England Golf Classic. She finished T22 at the Final LPGA Qualifying Tournament in 2010 to earn <b>conditional</b> playing <b>privileges</b> on the LPGA Tour for 2011 while still retaining privileges on the Futures Tour. She won again on the Futures Tour in 2011 at the South Shore Championship and had two top-30 finishes on the LPGA by the halfway point in the season. Her good performance on the LPGA Tour improved her priority status on the LPGA Tour and gave her entry to more tournaments {{in the second half of}} the 2011 LPGA season.|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} yet seldom noted set of parallels {{exists between}} modern U. S. bank regulation, {{on the one}} hand, and {{what used to be}} garden-variety American corporate law, on the other hand. For example, just as bank charters are matters not of right but of <b>conditional</b> <b>privilege</b> even today, so were all corporate charters not long ago. Just as chartered banks are authorized to engage only in limited, enumerated activities even to- day, so were all corporations restricted not long ago. And just as banks are subject to strict capital regulation even today, so were all corporations not long ago. In this Symposium Article, we argue that these parallels are not merely curious accidents but a reflection of certain foundational dynamics embedded in, and constitutive of, the corporate form itself. Tracing the history of the incorporated American firm, we argue that the corporation is an inherently hybrid public–private entity — an institutionalized and conditional outsourcing to private parties of certain essentially public powers and functions. In effect, it is a form of public–private “franchise” arrangement in which the public is the franchisor and private parties collectively serve as the franchisees. We examine the reasons both for the gradual weakening of this original franchise arrangement as a matter of American corporate law and policy, and for its continuing presence as a matter of bank regulation. We suggest that the “special” salience of banks’ role as public franchisees helps to account for the resilience of the original corporate settlement in U. S. bank regulation. Finally, we consider the normative and practical implications of reviving the “forgotten” franchise view of the corporation more generally and, in the spirit of intellectual experiment, tentatively outline some possibilities for reintroducing public interest- driven conditions in state grants of corporate privilege...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine whether}} and how {{democratic}} procedures can achieve socially desirable public good provision {{in the presence of}} profound uncertainty about the benefits of public goods, i. e., when citizens are able to identify the distribution of benefits only if they aggregate their private information. Some members of the society, however, are harmed by socially desirable policies and aim at manipulating information aggregation by misrepresenting their private information. We show that information can be aggregated and a socially desirable policy can be implemented under a new class of democratic mechanisms involving a sample group. These mechanisms reflect the principles of liberal democracy, are procedurally efficient, and involve a <b>conditional</b> tax <b>privilege</b> of sample group members. This tax treatment motivates sample group members to reveal their private information truthfully before voting takes place. Depending on the distance between two feasible public good levels, the optimal mechanism involves either one or two voting rounds. We show that procedural efficiency cannot be achieved by communication among all citizens prior to voting. Finally, we outline several applications of the mechanism...|$|R
