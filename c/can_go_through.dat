5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess the babies have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
25|$|After {{the game}} is completed, the player <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the levels again to pick up more unlockable items. Beating a boss will unlock three new levels for the next world; for instance, beating the World 1 boss will unlock three new levels for World 2 and so on. There are a total of 24 extra levels to unlock.|$|E
25|$|To ensure self-renewal, {{stem cells}} undergo {{two types of}} cell {{division}} (see Stem cell division and differentiation diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a progenitor cell with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> several rounds of cell division before terminally differentiating into a mature cell. It {{is possible that the}} molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as receptors) between the daughter cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{energy of}} a thermal power station not {{utilized}} in power production must leave the plant {{in the form of}} heat to the environment. This waste heat <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a condenser and be disposed of with cooling water or in cooling towers. If the waste heat is instead utilized for district heating, it is called co-generation. An important class of thermal power station are associated with desalination facilities; these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of natural gas and in these plants, freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products.|$|E
25|$|Aneutronic fusion loses much of {{its energy}} as light. This energy results from the {{acceleration}} and deceleration of charged particles. These speed changes {{can be caused by}} Bremsstrahlung radiation or cyclotron radiation or synchrotron radiation or electric field interactions. The radiation can be estimated using the Larmor formula and comes in the X-ray, IR, UV and visible spectrum. Some of the energy radiated as X-rays may be converted directly to electricity. Because of the photoelectric effect, X-rays passing through an array of conducting foils transfer some of their energy to electrons, which can then be captured electrostatically. Since X-rays <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Defense's Defense Logistics Agency {{is charged}} with off-loading 13,000 MRAPs to 780 {{domestic}} law enforcement agencies on waiting lists for vehicles. The DLA does not transfer property to the agencies, so the vehicles are allocated to the agencies with costs picked up by them or the state, while the vehicles remain {{the property of the}} Defense Department. To receive an armored vehicle, a requesting agency has to meet certain criteria, including justification for use (such as for shooting incidents, SWAT operations and drug interdiction), geographical area and multi-jurisdiction use, the ability to pay for repairs and maintenance, and security and restricted access to the vehicle. Police departments and other agencies in the U.S. can acquire MRAP vehicles through the DLA's 1033 program, which redistributes no longer needed military equipment to state and municipal agencies. Some police departments have picked up surplus MRAPs with no transfer costs or fees. Domestic agencies plan to use them in disaster relief roles, as they <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> flooded areas unlike normal police armored vehicles, and provide security in response to terrorist threats. Some MRAPs used by police forces often have the machine gun turret removed and are repainted black.|$|E

500|$|In one of {{his first}} interviews, Cobain told Sounds {{journalist}} John Robb, [...] "When I write a song the lyrics are the least important thing. I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes I try to make things harder for myself, just to try to make myself a bit more angry. I try out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people. Most of the lyrics on the Bleach album are about my life in Aberdeen." ...|$|E

In 2011, Kerrang! placed the album at number 49 {{on a list of}} [...] "The 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time". The magazine praised the guitar work in [...] "Helter Skelter".

500|$|Lisa is {{transferred}} to Walter's lab, where he gives her special drugs to extract Rusk's thoughts from her mind. Instead, Rusk gains control of Lisa's body and demands {{to know where he}} is. His description of the murderer leads them another naval officer, who tells them Rusk's physically abused wife Teresa (Annie Parisse) hired him for the murder. Believing that he has left her mind, they learn too late that Rusk is still in control of Lisa; he goes to exact revenge on Teresa, but is stopped by Peter before he <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> with the murder. Lisa is eventually able to purge Rusk from her consciousness. The final scene shows an unrelated car crash victim suddenly waking up, mumbling in Russian: [...] "My Star", the pet name Rusk called his wife, meaning that Rusk is back.|$|E
500|$|Ariana Bacle also {{praised the}} episode {{when she wrote}} in Entertainment Weekly {{labeling}} it as [...] "a damn good hour". She added that Meredith, [...] "has gone through so much that she’s earned an entire hour of TV completely focused on just her." [...] Furthermore, the site praised Washington noting {{the portion of the}} episode, that goes on in complete silence as seen through Meredith’s point of view, calling it [...] "especially powerful {{because of the lack of}} sound". Lauren Hoffman from Cosmopolitan lauded the episode for its [...] "amazingly effective storytelling" [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between Meredith and Alex. She further wrote that, [...] "if nothing else, Grey's reminds us that there's no upper limit to the amount of suffering a single person <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> so just grab your people and get ready to roll with it" [...] Praising Washington she noted that, [...] "Denzel and Grey's despite being disparate, could bring each other to new creative heights." ...|$|E
500|$|Tangled Lives [...] is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The plot focuses on, John Hill, a bank cashier who decides to fakes his death after the manager finds his accounts are short.

The cast and credits of the film are unknown, but a surviving film still shows the principal characters. The film was released on September 13, 1910, to positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
50|$|Suite-style {{residence}} halls {{are placed}} into 'Quads': Andrews and Kirkland. They are {{groups of four}} residence halls either in an L pattern (Andrews) or a square pattern (Kirkland).

Only married couples <b>can</b> legally <b>go</b> <b>through</b> gestational surrogacy in Ukraine.|$|R
500|$|The Masked Avengers {{received}} a sudden burst of fame from the prank. They gave more than 300 interviews about the conversation, and were even flown to New York City by CBS {{to appear on}} The Early Show. In an interview, Marc-Antoine Audette and Sébastien Trudel said that they found it [...] "pretty disturbing to see that idiots like us <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> to a vice-presidential candidate", and claimed {{that they were just}} [...] "two stupid comedians with a bad French accent." [...] The Masked Avengers also admitted that the call was [...] "probably the biggest [...] we've ever done." [...] When recalling the experience, Audette said that [...] "once we [...] started making jokes, she didn't seem to mind, and she didn't seem {{to be aware of the}} fact we were making jokes", which according to Audette was when [...] "we were like 'Oh my God this [...] is gonna be long'". The duo also said that they weren't trying to make any political statements with the call, they just like to take high-profile people to task.|$|E
500|$|Cobain usually wrote lyrics for songs {{minutes before}} {{recording}} them. Cobain said, [...] "When I {{write a song}} the lyrics are the least important subject. I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all". Cobain told Spin in 1993 that he [...] "didn't give a flying fuck" [...] what the lyrics on Bleach were about, figuring [...] "Let's just scream some negative lyrics {{and as long as}} they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay", while the lyrics to Nevermind were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to In Utero were [...] "more focused, they're almost built on themes". Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, [...] "I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [...] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are".|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the episode}} {{a rating of}} C−, Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict {{described}} the episode as a [...] "tepid remix of previous Simpsons plots". Ron Martin of 411Mania called the plot [...] "unimaginative" [...] and wrote [...] "I suppose there’s only enough episodes you <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> before Moe’s has to modernize in the most hideous way". IGN reviewer R.L. Shaffer wrote that [...] "Homer the Moe", [...] "The Frying Game", [...] "The Old Man and the Key", and [...] "Sweets and Sour Marge" [...] {{were some of the}} worst episodes of the whole series. However, Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that, even though the episode was too similar to the third season episode [...] "Flaming Moe's", the episode [...] "works reasonably well". He gave the episode a favorable review overall, calling it [...] "one of the year's best episodes". Adam Rayner of Obsessed With Film wrote that the story was [...] "told very well and continued to show the strength of the character of ‘Moe’, who would go on {{to be one of the}} only genuinely funny characters in the following barren years for the show". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com described the episode as one of the best of the season, and Aaron Peck of High-Def Digest stated that the episode was one of his personal favorites.|$|E

5000|$|Leedskalnin's ideas {{may appear}} unusual. He wrote that a mother's most {{important}} {{task is to}} ensure that her daughter remains [...] "chaste and faithful": In case a girl's mamma thinks that there is a boy somewhere who needs experience then she, herself, could pose as an experimental station for that fresh boy to practise on and so save the girl.

2500|$|A program {{associates}} each value with {{at least}} one specific type, but it also can occur that one value is associated with many subtypes. [...] Other entities, such as objects, modules, communication channels, dependencies can become associated with a type. [...] Even a type can become associated with a type. [...] An implementation of a type system could in theory associate identifications called data type (a type of a value), class (a type of an object), and kind (a type of a type, or metatype). These are the abstractions that typing <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> on a hierarchy of levels contained in a system.|$|E
50|$|Every {{memory access}} which a program <b>can</b> perform always <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> a segment.
