40|$|In {{this paper}} we explain {{the decline in}} <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> in Spain since 1968. We use a cointegration {{analysis}} to estimate an individual demand function for cinema, with annual data {{and in terms of}} average attendance per inhabitant.

We also show that television acts as a deterrent with regard to <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1997 cultural economics, cinema, demand, elasticity, cointegration analysis,...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{the growth in}} <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> of the {{preceding}} decade first stagnated and then went into freefall throughout the 1960s. By 1969 West German <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> at 172.2 million visits per year {{was less than a}} quarter of its 1956 post-war peak. As a consequence of this, numerous German production and distribution companies went out of business in the 1950s and 1960s and cinemas across the Federal Republic closed their doors; the number of screens in West Germany almost halved between the beginning and the end of the decade.|$|R

2500|$|With {{the decline}} in <b>cinema</b> <b>attendances</b> in the 1950s and 1960s due to the {{introduction}} of television, the Astor Theatre became a shadow of its former self, eventually reduced to showing pornographic films.

2500|$|Despite {{the advent}} of a regular {{television}} service in the Federal Republic in 1952, <b>cinema</b> <b>attendances</b> continued to grow through much of the 1950s, reaching a peak of 817.5 million visits in 1956. The majority of the films of this period set out to do no more than entertain the audience and had few pretensions to artistry or active engagement with social issues. The defining genre of the period was arguably the Heimatfilm ("homeland film"), in which morally simplistic tales of love and family were played out in a rural setting, often in the mountains of Bavaria, Austria or Switzerland. [...] In their day Heimatfilms were of little interest to more scholarly film critics, but in recent years they {{have been the subject of}} study in relation to what they say about the culture of West Germany in the years of the Wirtschaftswunder.

40|$|I analyse {{the effects}} of <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> on {{psychological}} well-being and happiness. The type of visual stimulation unique to film provokes an emotive response holding therapeutic properties. The collective and controlled experience of this emotive response promotes well-being generally. This analysis differs from most research into the effect of leisure on happiness, anxiety or depression, and well-being because it focuses on {{the effects of}} sensory stimulation and its resulting emotion inducing properties as opposed to leisure pursuits involving physical conditioning. This work differs further by systematically comparing 10 different leisure activities against <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> in their relative affects on happiness and self-reported anxiety and depression. Using data from wave 12 of the British Household Panel Study, I find that <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> has strong positive effects on happiness and stable negative effects on self-reporting of anxiety or depression, even when controlling for various socio-demographic and economic factors. This research confirms, therefore, that cinema is a unique leisure activity with beneficial properties for well-being. ...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{question}} of this thesis was {{the relationship between}} the business cycle and the <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> in the Czech Republic. Other questions are the effect of technological advances, household income and the impact of substitutes and complements to attendance. Similar questions have already examined several papers in different countries, but the results are not identical. The benefit of this work is examining the Czech industry, which from an economic point of view is not analyzed too often. The first part describes the relevant theories: the theory of the business cycle theory, theory of the consumer and demand. Another part contains a description of the analyzed sector, its historical development and an overview of studies that have worked on this issue. Following are two models: the first examining a total annual <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> (1993 - 2013) and the second model focused on the average attendance per projection). In both models was studied <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> dependence on the cyclical component of the unemployment rate and other variables. In both cases, the results suggest that attendance is procyclical. The amount of real wages has a positive impact on attendance. The impact of technological advances on the contrary negative...|$|R

Specifically, it is about the results of the attendance and the revenues, differences between classic cinemas and multiplexes. One chapter is also concerned with the genres of Czech films. The following part describes particular factors which can influence the <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance</b> and these factors are considering the results in the first part.

40|$|In this article, I {{explore the}} extent to which the {{rational}} addiction model developed by Becker and Murphy (1988) can account for <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance,</b> using panel data from 47 Japanese prefectures for the years 1994 - 1998. Controlling for unobserved prefecture-specific fixed effects and an endogeneity bias of the lagged and lead-dependent variables (the volume of <b>cinema</b> <b>attendance),</b> by using a fixed effect two-stage least squares estimation, I find that people in Japan are likely to be addictive. This finding is contrary to that found in the United Kingdom (Cameron, 1999). Further results suggest that the younger the people are, the more video is a favoured substitute for the cinema. If other factors are equal, the past accumulated consumption of young people is, of course, smaller than that of older people. Hence, the addictive behaviour is more attenuated for younger people because of their lesser past consumption. The complementary effect of past consumption is more likely to outweigh the substitution effect of preferring video as people become older. These findings are in accord with the Becker and Murphy (1988) model of rational addiction. ...|$|R
