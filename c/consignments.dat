In what the news item said was the first full load of cargo leaving Buenos Aires in nearly a year, West Corum carried 107,000 animal hides, estimated to be enough for 1,000,000 pairs of shoes, along with <b>consignments</b> of wool and linseed. The ship continued calling at Buenos Aires and Santa Fe, Argentina, as late as 1927, but by 1939, West Corum had been laid up in a reserve fleet at New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Early {{freight traffic}} {{consisted}} of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, sugar beet and swedes, together with {{large volumes of}} peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch. Traffic into the area included manure. In the 1920s, stations notified the control centre at Goole {{of the number of}} wagons they would need for <b>consignments</b> of peas and potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began {{to take some of the}} trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, and those were run if required. The peat works at Hatfield was still supplying an average of six wagon-loads per day.|$|E
40|$|<b>Consignment</b> {{contracts}} {{have been}} widely employed in many industries. Under such contracts, items are sold at a retailer's but the supplier retains the full ownership of the inventory until purchased by consumers; the supplier collects payment from the retailer based on actual units sold. We investigate how competition among retailers influences the supply chain decisions and profits under different <b>consignment</b> arrangements, namely a <b>consignment</b> price contract and a <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share. First, we investigate how these two <b>consignment</b> contracts and a price only contract compare {{from the perspective of}} each supply chain partner. We find that the retailers benefit more from a <b>consignment</b> price contract than from a <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share or a price only contract, regardless of the level of retailer differentiation. The supplier's most beneficial contact, however, critically depends upon the level of retailer differentiation: a <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share is preferable for the supplier if retailer differentiation is strong; otherwise a <b>consignment</b> price contract is preferable. Second, we study how retailer differentiation affects the profits of all supply chain partners. We find that less retailer differentiation improves the supplier's profit for both types of <b>consignment</b> contract. Moreover, less retailer differentiation improves profits of the retailers in a <b>consignment</b> price contract, but not necessarily in a <b>consignment</b> contract with revenue share.

5|$|The German {{raids on}} Nauru {{affected}} the Australian and New Zealand economies {{and were the}} greatest success achieved by German raiders in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. It took ten weeks to resume phosphate shipments from Nauru, {{and the loss of}} ships and damaged infrastructure led to a significant decline in output. The resulting phosphate shortages forced the introduction of fertilizer rationing in New Zealand from July 1941. Komets bombardment of the island also interfered with phosphate <b>consignments</b> to Japan, which caused the Japanese government to threaten to reduce the aid it was providing to Germany. The success of the attacks on Nauru led to rumours in Australia and New Zealand that the raiders had been aided by treachery in the islands. Several investigations were conducted into the rumours and proved them to be unfounded.|$|E

25|$|By 1825, Spark's trading {{business}} had greatly expanded, {{and he was}} chartering ships to coastal trade routes. A year later, his {{business had}} grown even more, and he started a shipping agency. Through this agency, Spark sold incoming cargoes, exporting stores to places such as Hobart, colonial produce to Calcutta, and wool <b>consignments</b> (the first {{of what would be}} very many wool <b>consignments)</b> to London, backloading merchandise when it was possible. Additionally, Spark worked as a sort of agent for farmers and country settlers by purchasing their produce and selling them supplies such as livestock and stores, as well as the occasional ploughman or overseer. At this particular time, Spark owned more than six thousand acres (24km²) of land on the Hunter River and a nine-acre (4 hectare) grant at Woolloomooloo; Spark had developed a passion for land ownership. In 1835, the designer John Verge (who also built Elizabeth Bay House) helped Spark complete his property, now named Tusculum outside of Wolloomooloo Hill (now known as Potts Point). It now houses The Royal Australian Institute of Architects.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} {{containerization}} rapidly spread beyond the shipping industry. Containers were quickly adopted by trucking and rail transport industries for cargo transport not involving sea transport. Manufacturing also evolved {{to adapt to}} take advantage of containers. Companies that once sent small <b>consignments</b> began grouping them into containers. Many cargoes are now designed to fit precisely into containers. The reliability of containers also made just in time manufacturing possible as component suppliers could deliver specific components on regular fixed schedules.|$|E
25|$|Rationalisation of {{the rail}} freight task had also been carried out, with small freight <b>consignments</b> being {{consolidated}} to 'freight centres' from 1976. Moves had also been made towards the operation of block trains carrying a single commodity, rather than trains carrying {{a wider variety of}} freight. Grain became the major commodity carried by rail in Victoria, with the consulting arm of Canadian National commissioned by VicRail in 1983 to find ways of improving efficiency. Recommendations carried out included increasing train sizes to 50 bogie wagons and closing a number of branch lines.|$|E

25|$|In January 1965, Lloyd International {{decided to}} acquire two Bristol Britannia 312 {{turboprops}} from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) {{and to have}} them fitted with special doors and stronger floors to allow the carriage of large-size palletised freight <b>consignments.</b> The first aircraft joined the fleet in April of that year. Aviation Traders won the contract to convert the Britannias into freighters. This involved fitting the aircraft with large forward cargo doors and strengthening the cabin floors. Conversion began during the 1965/6 winter season. This enabled the company to concentrate on long-haul charters, especially between Europe and the Far East. While these aircraft were primarily intended for freight operations, they were also used to transport passengers.|$|E
