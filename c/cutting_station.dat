50|$|The Method of Entry (MOE) {{facility}} is {{a suite of}} facilities to allow the tactical training of method of entry techniques. The facilities contained in this area include various breaching stations, steel <b>cutting</b> <b>station,</b> the Method Of Entry Building and a space for construction to meet client’s specific request (mud walls, etc.). The MOE building is a two-story structure used to train forces in methods of entry techniques.|$|E
50|$|Once {{manufactured}} {{the tops}} need {{only to be}} cut to length, mitered, fitted for assembly, and end capped (only {{if it is a}} visible finished end). A very specific machine for cutting the postform countertop is manufactured by only a few companies, it is commonly called a <b>Cutting</b> <b>Station,</b> Top Saw, or simply Miter Saw. This machine accurately cuts the countertop to field dimensions, making it easy for the installer to make the final scribe cuts on-site to complete the work. Sink cut outs can be made either in the field or at the installers shop.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cutting</b> <b>stations</b> were {{abandoned}} between 1913 and 1924, due to corrosion and leaks of the pipeline, complaints from farmers {{due to the}} location of the pipe on their land, freezing weather, and [...] "deterioration of juice in transit".|$|R

50|$|In 1894 a three-room school {{house was}} built out of red brick, called the 64 District School. It sat on two acres {{on the corner of}} 6200 South and Redwood Road. The name of the school was later changed to the Madison School. Enough musicians lived in the area to {{establish}} a brass band. People in Taylorsville and Bennion depended on growing corn, wheat, oats, and alfalfa. In the 1890s sugar beets became big business and many farmers started to clear additional land to grow them. The beets were hauled to the West Jordan <b>cutting</b> <b>station</b> until 1916 when the West Jordan Sugar Factory was completed. Taylorsville and Bennion remained very small farming towns.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{system is}} described which {{has at least}} one endless band saw blade that is characterized by a continuously regenerated cutting edge and is unidirectionally driven along a pair of courses extended in mutual parallelism through a <b>cutting</b> <b>station</b> located near the midportion of the courses. The blade is supported at the <b>cutting</b> <b>station</b> by pairs of guides continuously rotated through less than 360 deg of angular displacement during each cutting operation in order to continuously regenerate the blade supporting surfaces of the guide. Blade wobble is thus substantially eliminated...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to improve {{the efficiency of the}} supply chain in a Portuguese clothing company. After analyzing and describing the initial status of the company operations, in order to identify problems, a plan of action was developed and new procedures implemented according to the lean thinking principles. These reviewed procedures were based on paradigms such as lean, agile and leagile, as well as some collaborative practices (VMI and CPFR). Through a better coordination of the materials and information flows, using the Raw Materials Warehouse Management System, the company achieved significant reductions in the levels of excess stock and in the storage response time. Additionally, the processing times of raw materials in quality control were improved and the <b>cutting</b> <b>station</b> supply became more efficient.

40|$|A {{heuristic}} {{procedure for}} scheduling production rolls of paper through a finishing operation {{to cut them}} down to finished roll sizes is described. The ratio of service time to interarrival time of production rolls at the initial <b>cutting</b> <b>station</b> is large so that insufficient time is available {{to set it up}} unless a minimum number of production rolls are to be processed in the same manner. Otherwise, some portion of each production roll must go through a reprocessing operation to complete the cutting of finished sizes. The objective is to minimize the cost of trim loss and reprocessing. The procedure generates cutting patterns and usage levels sequentially until all the requirements are satisfied. At each step the search is dependent upon the characteristics of the unsatisfied requirements. A maximum of three solutions is generated for each problem. If none satisfies a predetermined aspiration level, the best of the three is chosen. The procedure was evaluated by scheduling a specific paper production facility and observing the results for a set of 15 problems. For each problem, the best solution was recorded. The overall results from this set of problems were then compared to previously recorded results on problems solved manually. There was a 16 % improvement in solution quality for the heuristic procedure relative to the manual method. ...|$|E
40|$|A change towards {{using more}} {{biofuels}} than fossil fuels {{is taking place}} in Sweden, and in many other parts of the world. This makes the use of fuel pellets increasingly popular, causing a greater demand for sawmill sawdust products. There is a trend towards the use of multiple types of shredders, instead of a single type in each sawmill. The {{purpose of the study was}} to characterize the different flows of saw particles that can be found at Sävar såg when cutting thick or thin wood with different cutting techniques. The saw particles size, shape, moisture content and heat value were analysed by the cutting stations: first cutting fast and slow, second cutting fast and slow, grading fast and slow and planning. The results confirmed the differences in the saw particles characters with regard to particle size, shape and moisture content. There were marginal differences in heating value. Saw particles from first cutting and planning differs from each other based on the characters size, shape and moisture content. Saw particles from the first cutting and the second cutting gave the thickest fractions. The finest saw particles are produced at the grading. There were rather small differences in particle derived from thick and thin timber if fractional distribution, moisture content and form are observed. The feed rate provides differences in fractionation distribution and shape of the saw particles. The results of this study thereby show that it would be possible to assort the saw particles by its characteristics based on the characteristics they have received according to the <b>cutting</b> <b>station</b> they originated from...|$|E
40|$|The {{project is}} a detail study of Energy Balance in cutting line station in Sandvik Mining and {{construction}} group. The aim of the project is reducing temperature and making a temperature balance inside the cutting line. During the recent years, many changes occur in production line. Existing cooling system cannot supply cutting area temperature below the desired level. Electrical Cables are melting due to high inside temperature. We attempted to study the old drawings and existing cooling system in <b>cutting</b> <b>station</b> to find out solutions to optimize and rebuild the old system. First part of study contains checking of preliminary air and water cooling system drawings. In the second part {{we looked at the}} operating cooling system by measuring different available working conditions such as inside temperature, air velocity and cooling water flow rate with different measuring equipment. The study integrate hot and cold stream (cooling air and water system) at different temperature level and in different times through production or non-production hours. Finally results and solutions can give valuable guidance for enterprises on how cooling systems should be expanded, what sizes should the new equipment have, where should the heat recovery exchangers be built, what new pipelines are needed, etc. To find more accurate results, we tried to do all measurements simultaneously, but due to difficult working condition {{it was not possible to}} have all input data at the same time. According to the primary data energy consumption during different times and Peak consumption amounts were calculated. Results consider the differences in cooling system effects inside the cutting line and the system which generates more cooling load and needed more improvements.   The summer and winter conditions are different inside the work area. The simultaneous assurance of ventilation, energy reduction and occupant health remains a design challenge. Working area is a unman area; therefore environmental impact are not considered in this research...|$|E

50|$|Production in Southern Utah was {{wished for}} {{as early as}} 1878. By 1898, locals voted to build a plant in the area. By 1900 they agreed to build the plant in Gunnison, with 77 mi of pipe to support <b>cutting</b> <b>stations.</b> The locals tried to raise $700,000 for this factory. Thomas R. Cutler and Utah Sugar, realizing the locals were going to hire an outside firm to {{construct}} their factory, organized Utah Sugar to do so instead. Utah Sugar paid the freight costs for sugar beets to be shipped to their Lehi factory, then promised to build a factory if 5000 acre were pledged by 1906. The San Pete and Sevier Sugar Company was incorporated with $1 million in capital on August 28, 1905. Officers and stockholders were similar to the Utah Sugar and Idaho Sugar companies. The company planned to construct a factory in Moroni, but drought, blight, and politics with farmers located in the more distant Sevier County caused the plans to be dropped.|$|R
