50|$|Nearby is Seven Mile Beach National Park, a well {{regarded}} {{area for}} bird watching, walking and fishing. Hang gliding, paragliding, sailing, windsurfing, and surfing are also enjoyed here. Black Head is suited to rock fishing, {{though it may}} be dangerous in high seas. A golf course is situated just north of the town. The rainforest remnants on the hill above the town and behind the beach contain interesting sub-tropical species, such as Snow-wood, Illawarra Plum and <b>Camphorwood.</b> The original vegetation was littoral (seaside) rainforest. Possums, wombats and falcons as well as many other indigenous animals may be seen near the town. Whales are commonly spotted in winter months heading north.|$|E
5000|$|The {{business}} grew {{rapidly and}} by the 1960s Wang was a leading businessman and {{a leader of the}} Chinese community. The Australian Dictionary of Biography notes::"Anticipating a growing taste for oriental wares, they prospered almost immediately, obtaining Chinese goods through a Hong Kong agent, and later importing from Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and the Pacific Islands, and, after 1972, mainland China. The Wangs largely pioneered the trade in Chinese cane-ware, bamboo blinds, <b>camphorwood</b> chests, and arts and crafts. Fireworks were among their most lucrative earners. In 1962, wishing to make his first overseas business trip on an Australian passport, David applied for naturalisation six months before he had completed the required fifteen years residence, and succeeded on appeal. He purchased and demolished the Canton Building in Little Bourke Street, erecting in its place a modern emporium, opened in 1964 by Calwell." ...|$|E

This torii was presented to Honolulu and Hawaii by Hiroshima prefecture, the city of Hiroshima and Hiroshima chamber of commerce and industry {{on the occasion of}} the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce.This torii is a scale replica of the Vermilion Grand Torii Gate that is located in the sea in front of the Itukushima Shrine at Miyama town in Hiroshima Prefecture. Miyama island is considered one of the three most scenic views in Japan and the Itsukushima Shrine and this treasured site are honored on the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization heritage list. The image of the torii is known as a symbol of Japan throughout the world.The actual torii stands in a shallow inlet of the Seto Inland Sea. At low tide the seawater recedes and exposes the base of the torii, allowing visitors to walk through the torii. The current torii was erected in 1875, eighth in a continuous series of torii dating back to the 12th century. It is approximately 52 feet (16m) in height, 75 feet (23.3m) in width. Natural <b>camphorwood</b> which is resistant to water is used in the main pillar and was brought in from Miyazaki Prefecture in Kyushu and Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku.The torii in this park is one half the size of the actual torii gate and is made of stainless steel and titanium. It was constructed in Hiroshima. The torii is oriented towards Hiroshima to symbolized the cultural exchange between the two cities and regions.Erected in October, 2001 ...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disorder of the joints}} which afflicts 0. 5 - 1 % of the world’s population, with approximately {{three times as}} many women affected as men. The causes of RA are poorly understood although it is generally accepted that it is an autoimmune disorder triggered by microbial infection (particularly by Proteus spp.). Whilst there is currently no known cure for RA, a wide variety of bushfoods and herbal remedies may be used in traditional medicine to treat (RA) and inflammation. Ninety five extracts from 38 Australian bushfood plant species with a history of ethnobotanical usage were investigated for their ability to control the microbial trigger for RA (P. mirabilis). Fifty six of the extracts (58. 9 %) inhibited the growth of P. mirabilis. Extracts of candlenut, <b>camphorwood,</b> quinine tree leaf, gumbi gumbi, Brush cherry and riberry fruit and Tasmanian pepper peppercorn and leaf were particularly effective Proteus inhibitors. All extracts with Proteus inhibitory activity were also either non-toxic, or of low toxicity in the Artemia nauplii bioassay. The low toxicity of these extracts and their inhibitory bioactivity against Proteus spp. indicate their potential for blocking the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|Timber {{has been}} used as a {{construction}} material in civil infrastructure throughout the world for several millennia and it is still a popular construction material to this day. Degradation of timber due to mechanical and environmental actions, as well as possible higher loads, can necessitate the need for strengthening or repair. The external bonding of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites offers a viable solution. A lack of understanding of the strength and behaviour of FRP-to-timber bonded interfaces is, however, hindering the safe and rational design of FRP strengthening measures for timber structures. The aim of this research project is to enhance understanding of the strength and behaviour of the bonded interface between timber and FRP. Important tangible outcomes of the project include the development of effective bonding systems as well as bond stress-slip models and bond strength model which quantify the bonded interface. In order to achieve these outcomes, an extensive experimental and analytical investigation is conducted. Tests are performed and reported on FRP-to-timber joints as well as FRP-strengthened beams. For the former, softwood (Pine), hardwood (<b>Camphorwood)</b> and glulam timber products have been tested. Variables include (i) externally bonded (EB) plates and near-surface mounted (NSM) plates, (ii) FRP plates formed in a wet lay-up procedure and pultrusion, (iii) bonded length of FRP, (iv) adhesive type, (v) adhesive thickness, (vi) timber species, and (vii) natural growth characteristics of the timber such as annual growth rings and knots. The concept of an effective bond length has been verified from the tests as well as effective procedures and materials for bonding FRP to softwoods and hardwoods. Models are also proposed and validated to quantify the bond strength and bond stress-slip relationships of the joint tests. The strengthening methods are then applied to glulam beams in order to observe the behaviour and strength of the bonding systems on a larger scale as well as on a system that bends. The bond strength model proposed from the joint tests is then assessed against the beam tests. Finally, conclusions are made on the entire program of study. Then, recommendations for future research are proposed. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
