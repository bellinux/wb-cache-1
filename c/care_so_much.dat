After an {{unsuccessful}} first show in which none of her work sold, Nevelson had a falling out with gallery owner Janis over sums he advanced her {{and was unable to}} recoup. Nevelson and Janis entered into a contentious legal battle that left Nevelson broke, depressed, and at risk of becoming homeless. However, at this time Nevelson was offered a funded, six-week artist fellowship at Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now Tamarind Institute) in Los Angeles, which allowed her to escape the drama of New York City. She explained, [...] "I wouldn't ordinarily have gone. I didn't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about the idea of prints at that time but I desperately needed {{to get out of town}} and all of my expenses were paid." ...|$|E
500|$|Catt, Stone and Blackwell went {{together}} to the January, 1892 NAWSA convention in Washington, DC. Along with Isabella Beecher Hooker, Stone, Stanton and Anthony, the [...] "triumvirate" [...] of women's suffrage, were called {{away from the}} convention's opening hours by an unexpected woman suffrage hearing before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Stone told the assembled congressmen [...] "I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel, that we are handicapped as women in {{what we try to}} do for ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens us. You do not <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for us as if we had votes..." [...] Stone argued that men should work to pass laws for equality in property rights between the sexes. Stone demanded an eradication of coverture, the folding of a wife's property into that of her husband. Stone's impromptu speech paled in comparison to Stanton's brilliant outpouring which preceded hers. Stone later published Stanton's speech in its entirety in the Woman's Journal as [...] "Solitude of Self". Back at the NAWSA convention, Anthony was elected president, with Stanton and Stone becoming honorary presidents.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Fresh Blood" [...] was viewed by an estimated 2.88 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of TV Guide praised the episode, commenting that [...] "it {{was really nice}} to get an enjoyable episode high on intensity, brotherly interaction, blood and gore". Although she had grown a [...] "tad bit weary" [...] of the character's continuous attempts to kill Sam, she was still [...] "really sorry to see Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his transformation was a [...] "good twist", and liked that his [...] "black-and-white beliefs" [...] remained the same even after becoming a vampire. She also enjoyed the character of Lucy and her [...] "really sad" [...] ending, and wished that McNab's role had been larger. It was noted that the [...] "brotherly interaction was front and center", and Charles was [...] "beyond happy" [...] that Sam confronted Dean about is behavior. The [...] "moment that [...] been waiting for all season long" [...] finally came to be when Dean took Sam seriously and actually listened to him instead of replying with sarcasm. Charles also deemed the final scene with the brothers to be [...] "just heartbreaking". Likewise, Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune not only gave the episode an A+, but ranked it as the sixth-best episode of the 2007-2008 television season. She praised writer Sera Gamble and director Kim Manners for [...] "creating the best bonding scene we've had all season", and lauded Padalecki and Ackles for [...] "making us <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> and believe so fully that a scene like this can leave us gasping".|$|E

2500|$|... "It's so {{wonderful}} that the fans <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that this {{question about the}} movie just keeps coming up. It's not anything that's actually in the works but is something that's always a possibility, and it's wonderful {{to know that the}} fans want it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When {{we started}} the band about 4 years ago we knew this and so that's okay. Now {{there are more people}} against us ‘cause of these new rules and all these stupid rumours spread by our Norwegian enemies... but I don’t <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> But that’s a bit sad that the black metal {{underground}} scene is totally split." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} [...] "Do {{you prefer}} that your toilet tissue unwinds over {{or under the}} spool?" [...] is featured {{on the cover of}} Barry Sinrod and Mel Poretz's 1989 book The First Really Important Survey of American Habits. The overall result: 68 percent chose over. Sinrod explained, [...] "To me, the essence of the book is the toilet paper question ... Either people don't care, or they <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that they practically cause bodily injury to one another." [...] Poretz observed, [...] "The toilet-paper question galvanizes people almost like the Miller Lite tastes-great/less-filling commercial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Duncan," [...] {{she said}} quietly, [...] "don't think that I mind. You {{did all that}} you could, and indeed I would rather that you <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> But the letters were not destroyed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You seem {{in such a}} hurry! Why are you in such a hurry? After all {{the fine}} things you have said about--about <b>caring</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for me, and all that, you won't stop for anything!' ...|$|R

2500|$|Such {{concerns}} {{are focused on}} the court's application of the federal RFRA law and were driven by national controversy over a state RFRA amendment bill in Arizona. Douglas Laycock, law professor at the University of Virginia, said, [...] "The whole secular left has decided" [...] that RFRA laws [...] "are very dangerous because they <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more about the contraception cases and gay rights." [...] He said RFRA laws are mischaracterized because they do not dictate outcomes favoring religious objectors, they only require courts to use the highest standard of scrutiny on any law challenged. Mark Kernes, Senior Editor and Chief Legal Analyst for AVN magazine stated in an op-ed piece, [...] "If the Hobby Lobby decision supports the 'right' of companies not to make available birth control that will prevent women from 'catching' a pregnancy, what's to keep those same religious companies from arguing that providing access to PrEP drugs like Truvada, which help prevent gays (and, admittedly, everyone) from catching HIV shouldn't similarly be excluded from their health plans?" ...|$|E

60|$|The book-reading public <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{for this}} book {{that it would not}} remain {{satisfied}} with it alone. Again and again it demanded of the author more about Pomona, Euphemia, and Jonas. Hence The Rudder Grangers Abroad and Pomona's Travels.|$|R

6000|$|... "My poor father!" [...] said Lionel presently, [...] "I never guessed he <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about--things.

6000|$|... 'It was I!' she said; 'I {{have lived}} {{every bit of}} the winter over again, and seen that I was always ready to be offended, and somehow I could not help <b>caring</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for what you said, that lesser things from you hurt and cut as other people's did not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was growing}} dusky in the room, and the youth, though still rebellious, was profoundly {{affected}} by this action. His hot anger died away and a swift repentance softened him. [...] "Don't cry, mother," [...] he said, clumsily kneeling beside her. [...] "I didn't think you <b>cared</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about the old thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid," [...] she answered, [...] "that I don't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for the American oyster as I should. But I am {{certainly}} {{glad to get}} back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, a {{rainstorm}} isn't a picnic party," [...] returned Tom. [...] "I wouldn't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> if I wasn't {{so anxious to}} hear from Sam and Dick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No Sally; it's not my secret. I wish I {{could do}} something--help them somehow. Yes, it's sure a terrible mix. I don't <b>care</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about myself." ...|$|E
