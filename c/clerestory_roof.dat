5|$|The District Railway ordered 60 x 7-car {{electric}} {{trains in}} 1903. A {{third of the}} vehicles were made in England, the rest in Belgium and France and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works. Access was by sliding doors, double doors in the centre and single doors at either end. First and third class accommodation were provided in open saloons with electric lighting. The seats were covered with rattan in third class and plush in first. From 1906 the standard formation was six cars, with {{an equal number of}} motor and trailer cars running in either two or four car formations off-peak. By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel. The first batch arrived in 1911, followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design. Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> on the earlier designs. In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars, incompatible with the existing fleet, with three hand-operated double sliding doors on each side.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} four trailers {{were received}} in 1908 followed in 1923 by two more motor cars and in 1925 a new five-car train. To allow {{the introduction of}} 6-car train in 1936 ten trailers units were ordered. The later cars {{did not have a}} <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof,</b> but any car could work in multiple with any other car.|$|E
25|$|Carriage 23 and {{carriage}} 24 - Two {{more similar}} carriages are currently under construction at Maespoeth. Number 23 {{will have a}} plain roof, and number 24 will have a <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof.</b> Work on number 23 is advanced, with the steel frame having been constructed, and assembly of the woodwork for the body commenced in autumn 2015. Number 24 is at an earlier stage, with the main frame currently under construction.|$|E

50|$|London Underground's last <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofed</b> trains {{were the}} 'Q' stock which ceased {{operations}} in 1971.|$|R
50|$|CW 1-15 {{were built}} in 1913-14 with <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs.</b> In 1935 vans 16-20 were built with {{elliptical}} roofs.|$|R
25|$|The first {{train in}} the United Kingdom with {{corridor}} connections between all carriages entered service on 7 March 1890 on the Paddington to Birkenhead route, and further corridor trains were introduced on all the main routes {{over the next few}} years. In 1900 a new Milford Boat Train set introduced electric lights and the communication cord was moved inside the train; until now a passenger needing to stop the train in an emergency had to lean out of the window and pull a cord above the door. At this time carriages generally had a <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> but elliptical roofs were fitted to the GWR steam rail motors in 1903.|$|E
500|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} was trialled on {{carriages}} in the 1880s and this became standard in 1891. As the Highland Railway used vacuum brakes, carriages {{used on the}} Aberdeen to Inverness were dual-fitted. The livery changed in the late 1890s, when the upper half was painted cream and the lower purple lake, with gold lining and lettering. Corridor carriages, [...] long on six wheels, lit with electric lamps using Stone's system and with both classes having access to a lavatory appeared in 1896. Bogie corridor carriages, [...] long and weighing [...] were built for the Aberdeen to Inverness express in 1898 with provision for vestibule connections. The Great North also had Royal Saloon carriage that, unusually for the Great North, was built with a <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof.</b> This was [...] long, lit by electric lamps and with steam heating, and divided into a first class compartment and an attendant's coupe, which was fitted with a cooking stove. Later, shorter six-wheeled and bogie compartment carriages were built for secondary services, and communication cords and steam heating were fitted {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century. No. 34, a 6-wheel carriage built in the 1890s is preserved at the Embsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway as part of the Stately Trains collection.|$|E
2500|$|The LIRR MP54 coaches came {{in three}} general styles. [...] Classes MP54, MP54A and MP54A1 were {{delivered}} with a [...] "railroad" [...] style <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof.</b> [...] Classes MP54B and MP54C were delivered with a smooth, [...] "arch" [...] roof. [...] Finally the MP54D and MP54D1 classes were former steam coaches converted to electric operation with clerestory roofs. [...] Unlike the later PRR cars, the LIRR units were primarily constructed by American Car and Foundry {{with a few}} made by Pressed Steel Car Company or Standard Steel Car Company.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Clerestory</b> <b>roofs</b> {{were used}} on railway {{carriages}} (known as [...] "clerestory carriages") from the mid-1800s into the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|All the {{original}} passenger carriages (built 1911-1922) were about 58 ft long, 9 ft wide and fitted with <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs.</b> The fifteen 1925 cars {{were the same}} dimensions but with curved roofs.|$|R
5000|$|This is not {{to confuse}} with the first Midland Railway Pullman coach {{introduced}} in 1874, named [...] "Midland" [...] which was of <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofed</b> design, imported from the Pullman Company in the USA and assembled in Derby.|$|R
2500|$|Carriage 21 and {{carriage}} 22 {{have been}} designed to appear as similar as possible to the original 19th Century bogie vehicles, but constructed to 21st Century safety standards with a steel chassis based on the Talyllyn Railway's standard bogie carriage design and a steel skeleton with timber cladding for the body. Carriage 21 (completed in May 2003) has a plain roof, and carriage 22 (completed in July 2015) has a <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof,</b> similar to those carried by two original carriages in the 1920s. Since September 2015 the railway has been able to run an authentic-looking [...] "1920s" [...] train with the [...] "Tattoo" [...] locomotive and two bogie carriages 21 and 22.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903 24 {{motor cars}} and 33 {{trailers}} {{were provided by}} Westinghouse. The stock was of an American design, with a <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> and open gated ends. Unheated accommodation was in saloons and the wooden bodies were British built, and the bogies {{had been made by}} Baldwin Locomotive Works in America. First and third class cars were provided, the first class seats being natural rattan and the third class seats being moulded plywood. The livery was maroon with white roofs and [...] "Mersey Railway" [...] in gold leaf on the upper fascia panels. Air brakes were provided with storage reservoirs that were recharged from static compressors at the terminal stations. The motor cars were powered with Westinghouse motors controlled by the Westinghouse low voltage multiple unit train control system.|$|E
2500|$|The Y {{also built}} a small brick single-road engine shed, {{large enough for}} a single locomotive, the shed was {{extended}} by the NER in 1867, retaining the same style (they even dismantled and re-erected the end section of the original building, according to the original contract plans held in the NYMR archives). [...] There was a standard Y house built adjacent to the shed. [...] Both buildings are still standing today, incorporated into a joinery works. [...] The shed lost its <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> {{some time in the}} 1950s according to surviving photographic evidence but for a building about to become redundant (in 1958) BR surprisingly made the roof good as plain slate. [...] This building is not only a rare (if not the only) surviving example of a G.T.Andrews engine shed but it is one of very few rural single track engine sheds still standing.|$|E
25|$|The Key System's first trains were {{composed}} of standard wooden railroad passenger cars, complete with <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs.</b> Atop each of these, {{a pair of}} pantographs, invented and manufactured by the Key System's own shops, were installed to collect current from overhead wires to power a pair of electric motors on each car, one on each truck (bogie).|$|R
5000|$|The North Eastern Railway (NER) {{began using}} EMUs between [...] and [...] on 29 March 1904 and from 25 July 1904 over a {{circular}} route between [...] and Tynemouth, electrified {{with a third}} rail at 600 V DC (see Tyneside Electrics). The EMUs, with BTH electrical equipment, were built at the NER Carriage Works at York with <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first Pullman {{coaches in}} England, which were also <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofed,</b> were {{imported}} and assembled at Derby, where Pullman {{set up an}} assembly plant {{in conjunction with the}} Midland Railway, a predecessor of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The first coach, a sleeping car named [...] "Midland", was assembled and ready for trial running in January 1874.|$|R
2500|$|L10 - This Bo-Bo {{locomotive}} {{was built}} from two Hampstead Gate Stock driving motors. It was constructed at Acton Works in 1930 from cars 1 and 3, originally built in 1907 by the American Car and Foundry Company. The motor ends of both cars were joined back-to-back, and this design {{was the first}} of several similar vehicles constructed from old stock. The vehicle was fitted with adjustable couplers at each end, which could be raised or lowered to cope with tube stock or sub-surface stock. Because of the layout of Acton Works, only the couplings on the southern end, known as the [...] "Acton" [...] end (as opposed to the [...] "Ealing" [...] end), were used, and those at the Ealing end were gradually cannibalised for spares for the Acton end. It was subsequently rebuilt, with flat panels on the sides, rather than the louvred ones of the Hampstead stock, and lost its distinctive <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof.</b> The GE69 motors were replaced with the superior GE212 motors, which included interpoles and roller bearings. It survived until 1978, when it was cut up on site by Cashmores.|$|E

50|$|The {{exterior}} of the trains were of two main styles: the original cars had a <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof,</b> and those built from the late 1920s onward had a simpler arched roof.|$|E
50|$|The G-class was a {{class of}} six trams built by Duncan & Fraser, Adelaide for the Prahran & Malvern Tramways Trust (PMTT). All passed to the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board on 2 February 1920 when it took over the PMTT {{becoming}} the G-class retaining their running numbers. They were similar to the F-class but had arched instead of <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first Pullman Railway Coach {{to enter}} {{service in the}} UK was in 1874, after an {{assembly}} of imports from the US, in an operation pioneered by the Midland Railway, working with George Pullman's Chicago company. The coach [...] "Midland" [...] was of <b>Clerestory</b> <b>Roofed</b> design with balconies at both ends. The concept of luxury coaches spread to the other UK railway companies thereafter.|$|R
50|$|By analogy, {{nineteenth century}} railway coaches with <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs</b> to {{accommodate}} ventilators and lamps above {{the heads of}} standing passengers in the centre while lower to the sides where passengers were seated were called monitors or monitor cars in the U.S.; the raised part of the roof {{was known as a}} turret. In ship design of around 1900, a turret deck was a more austere version of the trunk deck.|$|R
50|$|In 1896, Clyde Engineering {{delivered}} car 123 with an elliptical roof. The 24 others numbered 93-121 had a <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> {{and were}} built by Clyde Engineering and Ritchie Brothers in 1899.|$|E
50|$|The {{sections}} of the roof above the compartments and the <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> above the high tension compartment were removable to enable heavy machinery or control gear to be lifted out for repair.|$|E
5000|$|A 543 [...] "Manakura", 44+1/2 ft <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> kitchen/diner {{carriage}} with {{seating for}} 25, coal fired range and stunning {{stained glass windows}} (in the clerestory). Withdrawn from service in 2002 for an overhaul, the carriage is stored.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s a new [...] "travel centre" [...] (booking and {{information}} office) was added {{on the station}} concourse. The body of the building was faced with light sandstone, with lighting via semicircular arched windows, and an approximately barrel roofed skylight. In {{the same period a}} <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofed</b> waiting room was added {{at the head of the}} station platforms, an architectural homage to both Victorian trainshed <b>roofs</b> and <b>clerestory</b> carriages.|$|R
5000|$|Trainbuilder has {{released}} brass {{models of the}} short W series, at a price of $575+P/H per carriage with lighting included. 35 variants are available, including some each of the AW, BW, ABW, ABU and BU classes; some with arch, some <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs,</b> some with plate, others timber sides and for the ABW, ABU, BW, BU variants, some marked [...] "Second" [...] and others marked [...] "Economy". 1VBW in blue and gold is also available.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars were}} built over a steel truss underframe, with wooden bodies {{constructed}} with cedar and <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs</b> to give ventilation and daytime lighting. Nighttime lighting was initially provided with Pintsch gas, and six-wheeled bogies with eight brake blocks each (two outside the outer wheels and two each per centre wheel) under all vehicles. Drop-toilets for both genders were provided in all passenger vehicles except the dining cars, along with staff toilets in the twelve mail vans.|$|R
50|$|Thirty {{cars were}} built, twenty-six driving motor cars and four trailers. The E stock {{was based on}} the earlier C Stock and D Stock but {{differed}} in that the roof was elliptical rather than the <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> of the C Stock and D Stock.|$|E
50|$|To {{supplement}} the W-series passenger cars, fifteen vans {{were built in}} 1913-1914 with <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof</b> outlines and numbered CW 1-15. The vans were nearly identical to the earlier CV vans numbered 3 to 7, with a slightly wider body {{to take advantage of}} the E type advances in design, but the same capacity and length.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} four trailers {{were received}} in 1908 followed in 1923 by two more motor cars and in 1925 a new five-car train. To allow {{the introduction of}} 6-car train in 1936 ten trailers units were ordered. The later cars {{did not have a}} <b>clerestory</b> <b>roof,</b> but any car could work in multiple with any other car.|$|E
50|$|The Q Stock {{consisted}} of various District line trains built from 1923 (G Stock) until the mid-1930s, originally built with manually operated sliding doors. Following conversion to air operated doors, the trains became collectively known as Q Stock. Given that five {{different types of}} rolling stock were converted to Q Stock, the resulting hybrid trains looked bizarre - with the older carriages having flat sides and <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs,</b> whilst the Q38 had flared sides at floor level.|$|R
50|$|At some time, date uncertain, a <b>clerestory</b> or <b>roof</b> vent {{appears to}} have been removed. This is {{suggested}} by the geometry of timber supports in the ceiling structure.|$|R
50|$|A major {{survey in}} 1974 {{revealed}} new leaks, decay and other deterioration, and a ten-year restoration plan was agreed. Again the roofing required much work. The nave and <b>clerestory</b> <b>roofs</b> were repaired in four stages with new leading. The nave project {{was completed in}} 1984 at a total cost of £1.75 million. The clerestory windows were repaired with the corroded iron replaced with delta bronze and other Grimthorpe work on the clerestory was replaced. Seventy-two new heads for the corbel table were made. Grimthorpe's west front was cracking, again due to the use originally of too strong a mortar, and was repaired.|$|R
