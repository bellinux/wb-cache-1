500|$|Despite its modest debut week, Wrapped in Red {{began to}} gain {{traction}} {{at the beginning}} of the holiday season, selling up to 131,000 copies during Thanksgiving week. It experienced its best sales week after benefiting from NBC's premiere broadcast of Kelly Clarkson's Cautionary Christmas Music Tale, selling up to 136,000 copies on its seventh week of release.

500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because {{it got to}} be a little more rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please <b>Come</b> <b>Home</b> <b>for</b> Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This is going to be different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that to try and get you to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas". Dedicated to Blackstock, the song accounts her holiday after meeting him. She remarked: [...] "Christmas changes, it morphs, it comes to life a little more… It’s just a happier time." ...|$|E
500|$|NPR's Ken Tucker {{described}} the album as a [...] "glossy but heartfelt work" [...] and approvingly compared its contrasting philosophy to Nick Lowe's Quality Street: A Seasonal Selection for All the Family, {{both of which}} he described as [...] "will {{put you in a}} holiday mood". Matt Casarino of PopMatters gave the album a generally favorable review, claiming that [...] "Clarkson plays it safe and spends too much time showing off her upper register, but Wrapped in Red is a warm and romantic addition to the Christmas pop Zeitgeist," [...] adding: [...] "Wrapped in Red doesn’t need edge; it’s just dynamic and varied enough to be satisfying, and it’s light-years better than any of the whitewashed Christmas crap Simon Cowell has inflicted on the world". [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe gave a favorable review, particularly lauding [...] "Underneath the Tree", and described Clarkson's rendering of the Christmas standards as [...] "fairly straight". She added: [...] "She starts gently on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] before belting out the money notes. She ambles assuredly through the soulful favorite [...] "Please <b>Come</b> <b>Home</b> <b>for</b> Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] and hangs by the piano for a torchy “White Christmas." [...] Newsdays music columnist Glenn Gamboa wrote that [...] "Clarkson handles it all expertly — hitting remarkably high notes on [...] "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" [...] and swinging jazzily on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Dunn. The new songs make Wrapped in Red a real gift, as the title track and [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] channel the Phil Spector Christmas albums; and [...] "4 Carats" [...] somehow blends [...] "Stronger" [...] and [...] "Santa Baby". Reviewing for HitFix, Melinda Newman gave the album an [...] "A" [...] rating, praising Clarkson's vocal performances and noting that she and Greg Kurstin [...] "have clearly studied legendary Christmas albums of yore—most notably Spector's A Christmas Gift For You and Andy Williams' Merry Christmas—to lovingly recreate Christmas standards, as well as craft new ones in the image of those sets." [...] Chris Klimek of Slate declared Wrapped in Red as the best of 2013's new Christmas records, noting it for its vintage sound. He also observed that its five original tracks, most notably [...] "Wrapped in Red" [...] and [...] "Underneath the Tree", [...] "have reasonable odds of remaining in the yuletide rotation five years from now." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Jon [...] Caramanica wrote that [...] "Clarkson is very likely the only singer working in pop with a real possibility of creating a modern holiday classic along the lines of Carey's [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", and remarked that her takes on familiar songs, however accomplished, are [...] "also faithful in the way that someone mindful of pop history would be." ...|$|E
