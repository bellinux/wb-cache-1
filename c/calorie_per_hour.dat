50|$|The {{question}} of why men hunt, rather than spend all day extracting palm resources, cannot be explained by energy maximization, since men obtain about 750 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> hunting, and around 1,000 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> extracting palm starch and hearts. Hill {{has suggested that the}} macronutrient content of meat, relative to plants, means that meat is worth more nutritionally than equivalent caloric amounts of palm starch. Hawkes on the other hand, has suggested that Aché men hunt because hunting is a form of costly signaling, rather than exclusively a manner to provision hungry family members.|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} study of energy transformations by the pelagic decapod crustacean Lucifer chacei was made. Three combined stages were cultured and studied: the protozoea-zoea stages, the combined {{early and late}} schizopod stages, and the combined adult stages. Growth rates, dry weight, ash content, and calorific values were determined for each. Number of <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> ingested, assimilated, and respired were also determined {{for each of the}} combined stages. An energy flow diagram was constructed from the data. Growth from egg to adult took slightly more than 3 weeks. Protozoea-zoea and schizopod stages assimilated 10. 1 percent and 10. 4 percent of ingested Dunaliella tertiolecta. Adults assimilated 7. 7 percent of ingested Dunaliella tertiolecta and approximately 22 percent of ingested Artemia salina nauplii. The data indicate that a change from herbivorous larvae to omnivorous adults may have to occur in the natural environment because the older stages cannot obtain enough energy for growth from phytoplankton alone. When data for all stages were combined, gross growth efficiency and net growth efficiency for Lucifer were approximately 10 percent and 81 percent, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A {{calorimeter}} is {{a device}} to measure evolved or adsorbed heat. For our purposes, the heat measured is that associated with radioactive decay and the unit of measurement is the watt. Each time an atom decays, energy is released and absorbed by the surroundings and heat generated. For each isotope, this heat is a constant related to {{the energy of the}} decay particles and the half-life of the isotope. A point which is often overlooked is that calorimetry {{is one of the oldest}} techniques known for measuring radioactivity. In 1903, Pierre Curie and A. Laborde used a twin microcalorimeter to determine that one gram of radium generates about 100 <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> Several months later, Curie and Dewar used liquid oxygen and hydrogen to show that the amount of energy developed by radium and other radioactive elements did not depend on temperature. At that time, this observation was extremely important. It indicated that the nature of radioactivity is entirely different and cannot be compared with any known phenomena. In all other thermal processes known in physics and chemistry, the rate at which heat is developed changes with temperature. In 1942, Monsanto was asked by General Leslie Groves, Head of the Manhattan Project, to accept the responsibility for the chemistry and metallurgy of radioactive polonium. Late in 1943, two Monsanto scientists began a study of the half-life of polonium- 210 using calorimetry...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact on noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring on physical activity measured objectively by use of triaxial accelerometers. METHODS: Twenty-four working men and women performed ambulatory blood pressure plus activity monitoring for 1 working day and evening and activity monitoring alone for a separate day and evening. Blood pressure measures were taken at 20 -minute intervals during the day and 30 -minute intervals in the evening and were accompanied by diary assessments of mood, location, and posture. Comparisons were made of energy expenditure on the 2 days and of activity levels during the minutes surrounding each blood pressure reading and diary completion. RESULTS: Energy expenditure assessed in terms of activity <b>calories</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> was significantly lower during blood pressure plus activity monitoring compared with activity monitoring alone (mean 37. 3, SD = 16. 3 vs. mean = 43. 0, SD = 18. 7 kcal, respectively: p =. 02). Energy expenditure was lower during the 4 minutes surrounding each blood pressure reading than in the intervals between blood pressure readings. However, energy expenditure was also lower in the intervals between blood pressure readings than during comparable times on the activity only monitoring day. Blood pressure, heart rate, and physical activity were moderately correlated within individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory blood pressure recording using automated sphygmomanometers is associated with reduced physical activity during the monitoring day. This is due partly to regular periods of immobility during cuff inflation and deflation and diary completion and partly to more general self-imposed restrictions on activity. This pattern has implications for the representativeness of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and the construction of ambulatory monitoring diaries...|$|R
