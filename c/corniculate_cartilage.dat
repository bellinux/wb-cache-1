5000|$|It {{is named}} by Giovanni Domenico Santorini. The word [...] "Corniculate" [...] has a Latin root [...] "cornu". Cornu means horn like {{projections}}. The projections of <b>Corniculate</b> <b>cartilage</b> look like [...] "horns" [...] hence the name.|$|E
40|$|Using X-ray {{fluoroscopy}} {{we measured}} antero-posterior (A–P) and cranio-caudal (C–C) displacements of the epiglottic tip (ET), <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilage</b> and hyoid bone in seven seated, normal human subjects (age 34 ± 3 years; mean ±s. e. m.; 4 males, 3 females) breathing via a nasal mask or mouthpiece with (RL) and without (UB) a fixed resistive load. During UB, via either mouth or nose, {{there were no}} significant A-P ET movements. During RL via the nose the ET at peak expiratory flow was 2. 6 ± 1. 3 mm cranial to its position at peak inspiratory flow (P < 0. 05, ANOVA). C–C movements of the ET correlated strongly with C-C movements of the <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilage</b> and hyoid bone. The ET, <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilage</b> and hyoid bone (at zero airflow) were situated more caudally during oral UB than for any other condition. When present, epiglottic movements during breathing {{do not appear to be}} independent of those of the larynx and hyoid. Furthermore, epiglottic position may be related to the level of upper airway resistance...|$|E
40|$|In this study, 10 {{samples of}} the larynx of Camelus dromedarius were {{evaluated}} anatomically and histologically. The usual anatomical and histological (H&E and Verhoeff staining methods) were used. For detecting the internal form of larynx, plaster casts were prepared. This study demonstrated that the mean length and width of epiglottis and thyroid cartilages were 8. 21 ± 0. 28, 4. 59 ± 0. 34 cm, 6. 53 ± 0. 28 and ­ 6. 99 ± 0. 15 ­cm, respectively. The average length of dorsal and ventral part of cricoid cartilage was 6. 06 ± 0. 17 and 4. 58 ± 0. 25 cm. The mean length of T head and T handle in arytenoid cartilage was 3. 58 ± 0. 11 and 3. 35 ± 0. 05 cm, respectively. In addition, the average length and width of <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilage</b> was 3. 52 ­ ±­ 0. 03 and 1. 73 ± 0. 04 cm. In this animal, the epiglottis cartilage was long and pointed. Laryngeal prominence in thyroid cartilage was absent. The cuneiform cartilage is very thin and located in the base and sides of epiglottis. Contrary to other animals, the cricoid cartilage of this animal in both dorsal and ventral parts was very thick. Moreover, the vocal and vestibular folds with lateral laryngeal ventricle were present. The histological study showed that epiglottis, corniculate, apex of cuneiform and arytenoid cartilages are made of elastic cartilage and the other cartilages such as thyroid, cricoid and the base of cuneiform cartilages are made of hyaline cartilage. The epithelial tissue of all parts of larynx was stratified squamous nonkeratinized except the cricoid cartilage which had ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilages</b> (cartilages of Santorini) are {{two small}} conical nodules {{consisting}} of elastic cartilage, which articulate with the summits of the arytenoid cartilages and serve to prolong them posteriorly and medially.|$|R
30|$|Upon autopsy, lesions of the 1) epiglottis, 2) <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilages,</b> 3) true vocal cords, and 5) subglottic {{region were}} grossly scored: 0 : no injury; 1 : mucosal {{erythema}} and/or edema; 2 : mucosal erosion; 3 : exposed cartilage.|$|R
50|$|The folds are {{triangular}} in shape, being {{narrow in}} front, wide behind, and sloping obliquely downward and backward. They are bound, in front, by the epiglottis; behind, by the apices of the arytenoid <b>cartilages,</b> the <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilages,</b> and the interarytenoid notch. Within the posterior {{part of each}} aryepiglottic fold exists a cuneiform cartilage which forms whitish prominence, the cuneiform tubercle. The aryepiglottic folds are shortened in laryngomalacia.|$|R
5000|$|The cuneiforms are paired cartilages {{that sit}} {{on top of}} and move with the arytenoids. [...] They are located above {{and in front of}} the <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilages,</b> and the {{presence}} of these two pairs of cartilages result in small bulges {{on the surface of the}} mucous membrane.Covered by the aryepiglottic folds, the cuneiforms form the lateral aspect of the laryngeal inlet, while the corniculates form the posterior aspect, and the epiglottis the anterior.|$|R
5000|$|Corniculate, an Anglicisation of the Latin diminutives corniculata, corniculatum, and corniculatus, {{describes}} an object possessing hornlike extensions. [...] The root is Latin cornu = [...] "horn". The term {{is used to}} describe the shape of the <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilages</b> of the larynx. The horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata) is named for its distinctive horn-like coloration. Likewise Oxalis corniculata (creeping woodsorrel) is named for its two erect capsules, which resemble little horns, and the bird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus and goat's horn mangrove Aegiceras corniculatum are named for their horn-shaped fruits.|$|R
40|$|Comparative studies {{concerned}} the upper air ways of domestic animals are few. So {{this study was}} carried out to compare between the larynx of buffaloes, camels and donkeys. The present investigation was carried out on 39 larynxes, 13 larynxes (7 males, 6 females) of each species. Ten heads from each species were used for gross anatomical study; the remained three heads {{were used for the}} histological study. Results revealed that, the laryngeal cartilages of the three species were consisted of three single cartilages; the thyroid, the cricoid and the epiglottis, and two paired cartilages; the arytenoid and the <b>corniculate.</b> The cuneiform <b>cartilages</b> were paired cartilages present only in the larynx of the donkey. Thyroid, arytenoid and cricoid cartilages were of hyaline type, while the epiglottis, cuniform and <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilages</b> and the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage were of elastic type. The laryngeal epithelium of aditus laryngis, greater part of epiglottis and vocal folds was lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The remained parts of laryngeal epithelium from base of epiglottis and entire parts caudal to vocal folds were lined by pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium with goblet cells. The laryngeal glands of lamina propria were of mixed types in buffaloes and donkeys but in camels it was pure mucous glands. This study will fill a gap in the field of comparative anatomy and help other clinical investigation applied on these animals...|$|R
40|$|Laryngomalacia is {{the most}} common {{condition}} causing inspiratory stridor at or shortly after birth accounting for approximately 60 % of cases. Inspiratory stridor typically occurs after few days or week and is initially mild, but over a period of 6 – 9  months it gets more pronounced. Spontaneous improvement usually occurs over a period of 18  months to 2  years. Although majority of cases of laryngomalacia have benign course without any long-term sequel. Typically symptoms are worse during sleep and supine position while the same improves in prone position. There are 12 cases in the present study with {{the average age of the}} baby was 4. 74  months (142  days). Male to female ratio of 1 : 1. Those babies with life-threatening apnea, significant cyanotic (blue) spells, failure to thrive with feeding difficulty, significant chest wall and neck retractions with breathing and requires oxygen to breathe were included in the study. One patient presented with tracheostomy tube in place. Two babies were preterm. These preterm babies were initially kept on ventilator before the final diagnosis was made. The findings were different in all the cases. The common findings are cyclical collapse of supraglottic larynx with inspiration, short aryepiglottic folds, indrawing of cuneiform and <b>corniculate</b> <b>cartilages</b> forward over the laryngeal inlet resulting in prolapse during inspiration. The surgical procedures in laryngomalacia babies were combined according to the type of laryngomalacia. The procedures performed were supraglottoplasty (Unilateral/Bilateral), epiglottoplasty, aryepiglottoplasty, aryepiglottic fold division, epiglottopexy. The procedures were performed by radiofrequency cautery under general anesthesia. The average hospital stay in nine patients was less then 36  h and more then 7  days in remaining three patients. In tracheostomized patient second surgical procedure was done as after the first procedure failed to decannulate the child. The postoperative period was uneventful. The average follow up was 10  months...|$|R
