50|$|A {{currency}} {{is said to}} be pegged within a band when the central bank specifies a <b>central</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> with reference to a single currency, a cooperative arrangement, or a currency composite. It also specifies a percentage allowable deviation {{on both sides of this}} central rate. Depending on the band width, the central bank has discretion in carrying out its monetary policy. The band itself may be a crawling one, which implies that the central rate is adjusted periodically. Bands may be symmetrically maintained around a crawling central parity (with the band moving in the same direction as this parity does). Alternatively, the band may be allowed to widen gradually without any pre-announced central rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{currency}} reform of January 1, 1963 adopted the peso boliviano, equal to 1,000 bolivianos, {{with an initial}} <b>central</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> of 11·875 per US$1. But inflation soon returned and the peso boliviano was devalued 39.4% on October 27, 1972, with a new official rate of 20·00 per US$1. This rate was maintained until November 30, 1979, when the peso boliviano was put on a controlled float, initially at 25·00 per dollar. Inflation accelerated. The official rate was devalued February 5, 1982 to 44 per US$1. The average exchange rate was 64·12 per in 1982, 229·78 per in 1983, and 2,314 per in 1984. By September 1985 the US dollar was worth a million pesos bolivianos on the black market. President Paz-Estenssoro announced a free exchange rate for the peso, which was floated on August 29, 1985, resulting in an effective devaluation of 95%. All exchange controls were lifted and the exchange rate was set twice weekly according to supply and demand. Its value continued to fall and by January 1986 the government was setting a new exchange rate daily {{in an attempt to}} boost confidence in the economy. After reaching a low of about 2·2 million per US$1, the peso improved and stabilized around 1·8-1·9 million per dollar.|$|E

5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rate</b> Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The <b>central</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we first explain why most microstates (countries {{with less than}} 2 million inhabitants) have gained {{independence}} {{only in the last}} 30 years. Despite the higher costs and risks microstates face, their ability to better accommodate local preferences combined with a more integrated world economy probably explains why the benefits of independence have risen. We explain why microstates at independence have chosen either dollarization, currency board arrangements, or fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> rather than more flexible forms of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems. We then, using the Geweke-Hajvassiliou-Keane multivariate normal simulator, model empirically the determinants of each of the different fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes in microstates and analyze the policy implications.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters concerned with applied econometric modeling of Central European (CE) financial markets. The first chapter ("The Distribution and Dynamics of <b>Central</b> European <b>Exchange</b> Rates: Evidence from Intraday Data") lays out a solid empirical framework for accurate modeling and forecasting of <b>Central</b> European <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> using intraday data. In {{sharp contrast to the}} parametric methodology generally encountered in the empirical literature, the analysis present in this chapter relies on flexible and computationally simple non-parametric approach. The second chapter ("Volatility Transmission in <b>Central</b> European Foreign <b>Exchange</b> Markets") adopts the same non-parametric framework to study the volatility transmission among the CE <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> and the U. S. dollar. In particular, this chapter provides a thorough analysis {{of the extent to which}} shocks to foreign exchange volatility in one forex market transmit to current and future volatility in the other forex markets under study as well as of the dynamic evolution of the corresponding volatility spillovers over time. Finally, the third chapter ("Dependence Structures on Central European Equity Markets") investigates the existence of asymmetric dependence structures between the Central European and major Western equity markets and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there seems}} to be a broad {{consensus}} among economists that purely floating or completely fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> (the so-called corner solutions) are the only viable alternatives of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> management, many countries do not behave according to this paradigm and adopt a strategy within the broad spectrum of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes that is limited by the two corner solutions. These intermediate regimes are characterized by significant foreign exchange market interventions of central banks and a certain degree of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility. We develop a new empirical methodology that identifies three different forms of floating on the basis of a central bank's intervention activity: pure floating (no interventions), independent floating (<b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> smoothing), and managed floating (<b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> targeting). Our cross-country study shows that <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> targeting is at least as important as <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> smoothing. Subsequently we present a monetary policy framework in which central banks use the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> as an operating target of monetary policy. We explain the mechanics of interventions and sterilization and we explain why a central bank has an interest in controlling simultaneously the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and the short-term interest rate. We derive the monetary policy rules for our two operating targets from a simple open economy macro model in which the uncovered interest parity condition and the Monetary Conditions Index play a <b>central</b> role. <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime; floating; interventions; monetary conditions index; monetary policy; sterilization...|$|R
40|$|We use a general-equilibrium {{model to}} explain the rise in global trade and {{payments}} imbalances since the mid- 1990 s, and then to construct adjustment paths to a steady state. Assuming that the shocks giving rise to the imbalances do not suddenly reverse, simulated movements in the U. S. trade deficit and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> are smaller and more gradual than suggested by partial-equilibrium analyses. An important factor reducing {{the size of the}} adjustments is a simulated real interest rate on U. S. external liabilities that is below both the interest rate on external assets and the U. S. real economic growth rate. In addition, the adjustment takes place over an extended period without significantly raising the share of U. S. assets in foreign portfolios, in part because depreciation of the dollar requires continued foreign accumulation of U. S. assets just to keep their portfolio share constant.

In a stoachastic open macroeconomic model {{is characterized by}} purchasing power parity postulate doesn't hold and imperfect capital mobility, we use the Lai and Chang's (2001) "new graphical approach" to interprate if a country is faced with stoachastic disturbance of aggregate supply and the monetary authority adopts the "exchange rate target zones" policy, {{what will be the}} effect of these disturbances on the possible honeymoon effect of relevant macroeconomic variables? The major findings are: (1) The capital mobility degree is the key factor to determine wherther the relevant macroeconomic variables have the honeymoon effect and explain the positive empirical relationships between the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and interests rate which was observed by Kempa and Nelles (1999) or not? (2) If the monetary authority perhaps maintains the target zone policy or realigns the <b>central</b> parity of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> the local people are faced with this uncertain policy, the relative magnitude of capital mobility degree and the probability of local people expect the monetary authority will realign the <b>central</b> parity of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> are the key factors to determine whether the relevant macroeconomic variables own the honeymoon effect and explain the positive empirical relationships between the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and interests rate which was observed by Kempa and Nelles (1999) or not?exchange rate target zone, honeymoon effect, Browian motion, realignment, the relative magnitude of capital mobility degree...|$|R
40|$|A {{traditional}} {{argument in}} favor of flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> is that they insulate output better from real shocks, because the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> can adjust and stabilize demand for domestic goods through expenditure switching. This argument is weakened in models with high foreign currency debt and low <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass-through to import prices. The present study evaluates the empirical relevance of these two factors. We analyze the transmission of real external shocks to the domestic economy under fixed and flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes for a broad sample of countries in a Panel VAR and let the responses vary with foreign currency indebtedness and import structure. We find that flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> do not insulate output better from external shocks if the country imports mainly low pass-through goods and can even amplify the output response if foreign indebtedness is high.

After exploring the characteristics of dollarizing/eurorizing economies, {{we look at the}} merits and costs of unilateral eurorization for Cape Verde, a highly tourism based economy that has become increasingly integrated into the euro-zone area and that has a strong macroeconomic track record. We illustrate that neither the benefits nor the costs of unilateral eurorization are large and conclude that there is no compelling case to change the current <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangement at this point in time. Econometrically, we assess the characteristics of dollarized economies and demonstrate that few of them apply to Cape Verde, further confirming that Cape Verde does not fit the pattern of most dollarizing countries.
