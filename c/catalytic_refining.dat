40|$|<b>Catalytic</b> <b>refining</b> of bio-oil by {{reacting}} with olefin/alcohol over solid acids {{can convert}} bio-oil to oxygen-containing fuels. Reactivities of groups of compounds typically present in bio-oil with 1 -octene (or 1 -butanol) were studied at 120 °C/ 3 h over Dowex 50 WX 2, Amberlyst 15, Amberlyst 36, silica sulfuric acid (SSA) and Cs 2. 5 H 0. 5 PW 12 O 40 supported on K 10 clay (Cs 2. 5 /K 10, 30 wt. %). These compounds include phenol, water, acetic acid, acetaldehyde, hydroxyacetone, d-glucose and 2 -hydroxymethylfuran. Mechanisms {{for the overall}} conversions were proposed. Other olefins (1, 7 -octadiene, cyclohexene, and 2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentene) and alcohols (iso-butanol) with different activities were also investigated. All the olefins and alcohols used were effective but produced varying product selectivities. A complex model bio-oil, synthesized by mixing all the above-stated model compounds, was refined under similar conditions to test the catalyst’s activity. SSA shows the highest hydrothermal stability. Cs 2. 5 /K 10 lost most of its activity. A global reaction pathway is outlined. Simultaneous and competing esterification, etherfication, acetal formation, hydration, isomerization and other equilibria were involved. Synergistic interactions among reactants and products were determined. Acid-catalyzed olefin hydration removed water and drove the esterification and acetal formation equilibria toward ester and acetal products...|$|E

In 1947 it was expanded {{with the building}} of the alkylation and <b>catalytic</b> cracking <b>refining</b> units, and the refining capacity of was increased. From 1947 to 1960, the isomerisation, catalytic reforming, chemicals plants were built and the refining capacity was further increased.

When the results of early studies of smog in Los Angeles were published, Houdry became concerned about the role of smoke stack exhaust and automobile exhaust in air pollution and founded a company called Oxy-Catalyst. Houdry first developed {{catalytic converter}}s for smoke stacks called [...] "cats" [...] for short, and later developed catalytic converters for warehouse forklifts that used low grade, unleaded gasoline.

The company was characterized by its vertically integrated business activities, and was active across the whole spectrum of the oil industry: exploration, production, transport, refining and marketing. It also involved itself in associated industries such as petrochemicals and automobile component manufacturing. It introduced significant commercial and technical innovations, including the first drive-in service station (1913), complimentary road maps, drilling over water at Ferry Lake, and the <b>catalytic</b> cracking <b>refining</b> process (Gulf installed the world's first commercial catalytic cracking unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery complex in 1951). Gulf also established {{the model for the}} integrated, international [...] "oil major", which refers to {{one of a group of}} very large companies that assumed influential and sensitive positions in the countries in which they operated.

40|$|Nanoporous acid {{catalysts}} such as zeolites {{form the}} backbone of <b>catalytic</b> technologies for <b>refining</b> petroleum. 1 With {{the promise of a}} biomass economy, new catalyst systems will have to be discovered, making shape-selective base catalysts especially important because of the high oxygen content in biomass-derived feedstocks. Strongly basic zeolites are attractive candidates, but such materials are notoriously difficult to make due to the strong inherent acidity of aluminosilicates. Several research groups have endeavored to produce strongly basic zeolites by treating zeolites with amines, 2 - 5 but to date there is little compelling evidence that nitrogen is incorporated into zeolite frameworks. Here, we detail synthesis, NMR spectroscopy, and calculations showing that nitrogen adds to both surface and interior oxygen while preserving the zeolite framework. This finding is crucial for the rational design of new biomass-refinement catalysts, allowing 50 years of zeolit...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} biodegradable and non-toxic biofuel produced from renewable resources. Industrially, it is produced by <b>catalytic</b> transesterification of <b>refined</b> vegetable oil with methanol or ethanol. Biodiesel production costs can be reduced by using non-refined feedstocks whose market prices are {{lower than those of}} refined vegetable oils. This work studied the use of tin(II) sulfate (SnSO 4), as catalyst for the simultaneous transesterification and esterification of model acid oil containing high levels of free fatty acids. The influence of experimental parameters, catalyst leaching as well as its reusability was investigated. For a model feedstock containing 70 &# 160;wt. % of free fatty acids (oleic acid), the highest biodiesel yield (92 %) was obtained at 100 &# 186;C, under autogenous pressure, using 5 wt. % of SnSO 4 in excess of ethanol after 3 h of reaction. The catalyst was reused ten times without significant decrease in biodiesel yield...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic {{reforming}} of naphtha {{for improving}} its characteristics {{is one of}} the most important petroleum <b>refining</b> <b>catalytic</b> processes. Modern catalytic reformers utilize dual function platinum-based catalysts which during operation are exposed to the formation of carbonaceous deposits causing gradual deterioration of their activity and alteration of their selectivity. In-situ regeneration has proved to be adequate practice in restoring a catalyst's activity as well as its selectivity. Hence, optimization of regeneration is a vital step of the reforming process. This is usually done under conditions of a general nature that have been recommended by catalyst manufacturers and/or suppliers. Results of thorough laboratory investigations on the thermal behavior of used reforming catalyst (spent samples) revealed that the amount and complexity of the chemical nature of carbonaceous deposits on reforming catalysts are directly related to its life on stream and severity of operating conditions. Optimal regeneration of the catalyst requires specific conditions that take into consideration behavior and combustibility of carbonaceous deposits on its surface. Such information can easily be obtained by applying thermal analysis on catalyst samples which can b...|$|R
30|$|Zeolites have {{received}} much attention for chemical industry and academia owing to their high thermal stability, shape selectivity and high catalytic activity. ZSM- 5, {{a member of}} the zeolite family with high-silica content has been widely employed in petrochemical <b>catalytic</b> processes, oil <b>refining</b> and environmental protection fields, such as cracking, isomerization, aromatization and alkylation processes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Propylene is currently producing from the steam cracking (SC) of light naphtha. However, this process is inefficient to meet the requirements of propylene in the market. Among various alternative sources for propylene production, FCC units are considered as the most promising and largest one [7]. More than 30  % of the worldwide propylene production is from FCC units and this figure will continue to increase [8]. To enhance the propylene yield of FCC units, ZSM- 5 zeolite has been used as an additive in industrial practice since its first commercial use in 1983 [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Because of its unique pore structure, ZSM- 5 zeolite can crack selectively gasoline-range linear or mono-branched hydrocarbons to C 3 -C 4 olefins. And its moderate acidity can largely suppress hydrogen-transfer reactions [10].|$|R
40|$|Many <b>catalytic</b> {{processes}} to <b>refine</b> heavy part {{of crude oil}} have attracted much interest due to declining reserves of light crude oils. This study focused on hydrocracking process of atmospheric distillable residue of Mongolian crude oil in the first time compared {{to those of other}} countries. Residue samples were hydrocracked with a commercial catalyst at 450 °C, 460 °C, 470 °C for 2 h under hydrogen pressure of 10 MPa. The amount of residual fraction (350 °C<BP) decreased to 9. 4 wt% by the hydrocracking of atmospheric distillable residue from Tamsagbulag crude oil. When the ME-AR was hydrocracked, the high consumption of hydrogen was related to the lowest H/C atomic ratio of feed atmospheric residue. The amount of liquid fractions (BP< 350 °C) including gaseous products increased from 45. 4 wt% to 89. 2 wt%, when the reaction temperature increased from 450 °C to 470 °C. The highest yield of the middle fraction for each sample was observed at temperature of 460 °C. On the other hand, the effect of temperature on the yield of middle fraction was not so high as compared with the yields of other fractions. The contents of n-paraffins on midlle and heavy fractions of TB-AR, DQ-AR were similar, but ME-AR’s was around 2 times lower than other after hydrocracking runs.

40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{conducted}} in the Handheld Laboratory at Husqvarna AB {{with the purpose of}} finding the parameters responsible for the performance of the catalytic converters used in the test rig. The catalytic converters are used in the test rig during the long term testing of the chain saws to reduce the hydrocarbon content from the exhaust before it enters into the environment.   To perform this research two approaches were carried out. One with Design of Experiment (DOE) and another using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis. In Design of Experiments parameters that are suspected to be influencing the performance of the <b>catalytic</b> converter were <b>refined.</b> Using these parameters a test plan is made with the help of statistical analysis application Minitab and the tests were carried out in the test rig. Using SEM the effects of aging and its effect on microstructure and chemical composition on the catalyst surface was analyzed. The results from the DoE shows that the exhaust flow, collector diameter and distance to the muffler are responsible for the collection of exhaust. Distance to the muffler and collector length are the factors affecting the conversion of the exhaust. In addition to that exhaust flow is also responsible for the duration of heating coil running time.         The results from the SEM analysis shows that the operating temperature is high due to which there is thermal degradation of catalyst and there is also deactivation due to fouling. Another finding is that the flow on to the catalyst is not uniformly distributed...|$|R
40|$|Two dithiol glutaredoxins (Grxs), Grx 1 and Grx 2, from yeast {{have been}} {{characterized}} to date. A third putative dithiol glutaredoxin-encoding gene (GRX 8) {{has been identified}} in silico. Here we show that deletion of GRX 8 does not result in a reduced growth rate under oxidative stress conditions, nor does it enhance the defects of Deltagrx 1 and Deltagrx 2 single or double mutants. We furthermore compare the enzymatic properties of recombinant ScGrx 8 with the monothiol glutaredoxin ScGrx 7. Molecular models of ScGrx 8 suggest that the protein has a canonical Grx fold, a significantly altered substrate binding site, and a Trp 14 -type cysteine motif at the catalytic center. ScGrx 8 did not bind heavy metal ions and was exclusively monomeric. Apparent k(cat) values for ScGrx 8 in the standard enzymatic assay were about 3 orders of magnitude less than for ScGrx 7, whereas apparent K(m) values were comparable. Mass spectrometric analyses support a ping-pong mechanism for ScGrx 7 and ScGrx 8 with a glutathionylated protein as an intermediate. Reduction kinetics of ScGrx 8 disulfide, glutathionylated ScGrx 8 (C 28 S), and glutathionylated ScGrx 7 revealed {{significant differences between the}} proteins. Surprisingly, mutation of the more C-terminal cysteine residue in the CPDC motif of ScGrx 8 also abolished the slight enzymatic activity, and thus the standard catalytic mechanism for glutathionylated substrates does not apply to the enzyme. In summary, ScGrx 8 has several novel structural and mechanistic features expanding the subclasses of glutaredoxins. A <b>refined</b> <b>catalytic</b> model for monothiol and dithiol glutaredoxins is presented explaining the diversity of enzymatic activities in vitro and pointing to different functions in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} heterogeneous catalyst system, as it is used in numerous technologically important processes, including oil <b>refining,</b> <b>catalytic</b> converters and fuel cells. Hence, many investigators have studied Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 both experimentally and theoretically. Yet, a significant gap exists between experiment and theory since theory models well defined finite systems whereas the commercially available γ-Al 2 O 3 is polycrystalline with ill-defined morphologies, crystallography and impurities. The goal of this thesis project is to synthesize a model Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 heterogeneous catalyst system which is in the appropriate size regime for theoretical modeling. The critical challenge of this project is the creation of single crystal γ-Al 2 O 3 thin films. To achieve this goal, the growth of single crystal γ-Al 2 O 3 thin film on NiAl(110) surface was systematically investigated by oxidation in dry ambient air to determine the optimal oxidation parameters to form a reasonably flat, defect-free, single crystal γ-Al 2 O 3 film. We determined that the optimal oxidation condition was 850 ℃ for 1 hour in air that produced an 80 nm thick film with an RMS value of 10 nm. The model Pt/ γ-Al 2 O 3 system was produced by e-beam evaporation of Pt nanoparticles onto the surface of the γ-Al 2 O 3. We characterized the Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 by transmission electron microscopy techniques for morphological and electronic structure of the nanoparticles and interfaces, respectively. We provide two feasibility studies of obtaining benchmark parameters that could be used by theorists: (1) the interfacial energy through a Wulff-Kashiew analysis of the supported Pt nanoparticles’ shapes and (2) information on the density of states at the interface using electron energy loss spectroscopy. During the course of this study, we also discovered aspects of NiAl oxidation kinetics in the intermediate temperature regime of 650 - 950 ℃ where only γ-Al 2 O 3 forms, not the thermodynamically stable α-Al 2 O 3. For example, crystallinity, epitaxy, and surface roughness of the oxide depends on the oxidation temperature due to temperature-dependent strain and relative diffusion behaviors...|$|R
