40|$|Problem statement: The {{purpose of}} this study is to prove objectively that the market-wholesaler system, {{introduced}} to agricultural wholesale market in Korea for the first time, has better operational efficiency than the existing auction system. From an analytical viewpoint, we estimated the time value of two transaction systems at the agricultural wholesale market using the calculation methods of the congestion cost and the accumulation cost, and estimated the operational efficiencies divided by product family and item. Approach: We used data from the Statistical Resource of Agricultural and Marine Wholesale Market by Year for the research conducted in this study. Results: As a result, we were able to analyze and conclude that the market-wholesaler system had a relatively lower time cost than the auction system by utilizing the time required from the agricultural <b>carrying-in</b> to the preparation for sale by the transaction system at the agricultural wholesale market and calculating the total time cost for 16 main items into the amounts. These results prove that the market wholesaler system has a better efficiency than the auction system. Conclusion: Therefore, if the market-wholesaler system can be enlarged and introduced into Korea’s 32 agricultural wholesale markets as the policy implicates by the study results, we can conclude that the transaction efficiency within the agricultural wholesale market will be better and it will contribute to enhancing the efficiency of the whole agricultural and fishery distribution industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of Ultrasonic Testing (UT) of metal products and constructions with the surface being heated up to 300 - 800 C are considered. It is {{noted that the}} process of UT of objects at chemical plants of heat-power, metallurgy industry etc complicates the need to protect Ultrasonic transducers from heated surfaces, hot air and heat radiation from objects, with the operational conditions becoming dangerous. We offer to use electromagnetic-acoustic (EMA) excitation and signal reception technique that does not require direct mechanical contact of the transducer with a heated surface of the object under test. The EMA transducers (EMAT) are protected from thermal influence by a thin shield made of heat-resisting material with low thermal conductivity; they do not require the use of couplants and are intended {{to be used as a}} part of a serial EMA gauge A 1270 for testing of products heated up to 300 0 C with no additional heat-shielding. The designed time mode follows the scheme. This enables the transducer to work reliably for 8 hours. Such a successful design of the EMAT and the use of a composite protector made of alumina ceramics provide reliable test parameters. The same EMAT can be used to test objects heated up to 700 0 C. There is a developed <b>carrying-in</b> and-out system for the EMAT. The system is provided with a heat-resisting shield that protects the EMAT from thermal influence of the object under test and significantly reduces the influence of it onto an operator. The designed time modes for testing of objects at different temperatures prevents the operating part of the EMAT from overheating and, at the same time provides multiple measurement of heated object thickness. Also there is compensation of the thermal influence from an object onto the US wave velocity. Key words: EMAT, heated products, heat-resistant material, US velocity 1...|$|E
