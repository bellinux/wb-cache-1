He met with many conservative Republican senators, and based on assurances he gave them, he was recommended for the Judiciary Committee's chairmanship in late 2004. He officially assumed that position when the 109th Congress convened on January 4, 2005.|$|E

In this research, 38 unique students added a total of 38 comments during their study. Twenty-four of these <b>comments</b> <b>are</b> related to system, pre-test questions and learning environment. Five of these <b>comments</b> <b>are</b> related to practice, 7 of these are about difficulties and/or relatedness of questions, 3 <b>comments</b> <b>are</b> about lack of hardware and 9 <b>comments</b> <b>are</b> suggestions about system. Fourteen comments consist of meaningless words and/or unrelated words/sentences.|$|R

A few observed that Capaldi's version of the Doctor character is sinister and serious, and contrasted this with the actor's depiction of the character as warm and effusive in his recording.|$|E
5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's <b>comments</b> <b>were</b> {{limited to the}} use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to legislation enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure. He also argues that it would be difficult to explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of judicial review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and would be even more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified judicial review procedure.|$|E

In May 2009, Turkey's head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Bardakoğlu, discounted personal development techniques such as reiki and yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to extremism. His <b>comments</b> <b>were</b> made in the context of reiki and yoga possibly being a form of proselytization at the expense of Islam.|$|E

5|$|In {{the tunnel}} after the match tempers boiled over between staff of both clubs. A slice of pizza {{had been thrown}} at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} unconfirmed until 13 years after the incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His <b>comments</b> <b>were</b> investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E
5|$|From 2001, Varner {{embarked}} on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, {{and the lives of}} merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial <b>comments</b> <b>were</b> offered in Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition, will be explored in Sustaining Animals, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at No Way Out. In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the <b>comments</b> <b>were</b> highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E
40|$|<b>Comments</b> <b>are</b> special {{types of}} {{publications}} whose {{aim is to}} correct or criticize previously published papers. For this reason, <b>comments</b> <b>are</b> believed to make commented papers less worthy or trusty to {{the eyes of the}} scientific community, and thus predestined to have low scientific impact. Here, we show that such belief is not supported by empirical evidence. We consider thirteen major publication outlets in science, and perform systematic comparisons between the citations accumulated by commented and non commented articles. We find that (i) <b>commented</b> papers <b>are,</b> on average, much more cited than non commented papers, and (ii) <b>commented</b> papers <b>are</b> more likely to be among the most cited papers of a journal. Since <b>comments</b> <b>are</b> published soon after criticized papers, <b>comments</b> should <b>be</b> viewed as early indicators of the future impact of criticized papers.

5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that the <b>{{comments}}</b> <b>were</b> unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not make the effort to train for distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could excel in multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E
