That is, we must clearly define what the public benefit will cover and for whom. In the absence of such streamlining the health care system cannot be expected to achieve its goals, and the private system cannot step into an optimally helpful supplementary role.

40|$|While {{the risks}} induced by system {{dependencies}} have been studied; {{little is known}} about modelling complex collections of supposedly independent systems at different geographical locations, which are in reality interdependent due to sharing often-unrecognized common elements. It could be argued that any risk analysis of a large infrastructure that does not take account of such interdependencies is dangerously introspective. We present a top-down, goal-to-dependencies approach to modelling and understanding such Complex Systems, which uses secure, distributed computing protocols to share risk data between the risk models of interdependent systems. We present a Bayesian-sensitivity measure of risk, which is both intuitively satisfying and accords with everyday notions of risk. The <b>core</b> <b>benefit</b> of this approach is to capture dependencies between systems and share risk data such that failure of an entity along the ‘supply chain’ can be rapidly propagated to those who depend on it allowing them to calculate the likely impact and respond accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Software Defined Networks (SDN) give network {{designers}} {{freedom to}} refactor the network control plane. One <b>core</b> <b>benefit</b> of SDN {{is that it}} enables the network control logic to be designed and operated on a global network view, {{as though it were}} a centralized application, rather than a distributed system – logically centralized. Regardless of this abstraction, control plane state and logic must inevitably be physically distributed to achieve responsiveness, reliability, and scalability goals. Consequently, we ask: “How does distributed SDN state impact the performance of a logically centralized control application?” Motivated by this question, we characterize the state exchange points in a distributed SDN control plane and identify two key state distribution trade-offs. We simulate these exchange points in the context of an existing SDN load balancer application. We evaluate the impact of inconsistent global network view on load balancer performance and compare different state management approaches. Our results suggest that SDN control state inconsistency significantly degrades performance of logically centralized control applications agnostic to the underlying state distribution...|$|E

40|$|This {{editorial}} analyzes from {{a variety}} of perspectives the controversial issue of single-blind versus double-blind reviewing. In single-blind reviewing, the reviewer is unknown to the author, but the identity of the author is known to the reviewer. Double-blind reviewing is more symmetric: The identity of the author and the reviewer are not revealed to each other. We first examine the significant scholarly literature regarding blind reviewing. We then list six benefits claimed for double-blind reviewing and 21 possible costs. To compare these benefits and costs, we propose a double-blind policy for TODS that attempts to minimize the costs while retaining the <b>core</b> <b>benefit</b> of fairness that double-blind reviewing provides, and evaluate that policy against each of the listed benefits and costs. Following that is a general discussion considering several questions: What {{does this have to do}} with TODS, does bias exist in computer science, and what is the appropriate decision procedure? We explore the “knobs ” a policy design can manipulate to fine-tune a double-blind review policy. This editorial ends with a specific decision...|$|E
40|$|The {{basic premise}} of {{sustainable}} development is that companies should completely re-evaluate their enterprise work logic and process organization. Most of the necessary changes concern employee stimulation and motivation. If we are truly interested in improving business results {{and the effectiveness of}} business processes – there would be no progress otherwise – we have to strive to break down the barriers between company management (leadership) and employees in order to establish effective relationships between firms and customers. This paper presents research results of process manager activities in modern industrial enterprises, connected with a methodology proposal for the systematically-oriented process manager motivation of employees in accordance with the increased competitiveness of production and administration processes. It also presents an effective methodology of how to increase the positive effects of welldefined employee motivations from the process manager´s perspective. The <b>core</b> <b>benefit</b> of this methodology lies in the design of a systematic approach to the motivation process from the process manager side, allowing for radical performance improvement via production and administrative processes and the increased competitiveness of enterprise processes...|$|E
40|$|Green {{marketing}} ” is {{a relatively}} recent phenomenon; alert consumers {{all over the world}} have become familiar with environmental marketing messages in recent years. In the United States, numerous organizations – even including college campuses – are “going green. ” Recent political and scientific trends are largely responsible for consumer preoccupation with environmentally friendly consumption; concerns about global warming, specifically, have given rise to concerted efforts {{on the part of the}} world‟s shopping public to conserve and preserve. Where once convenience placed first as a <b>core</b> <b>benefit</b> sought by most consumers, “greenness ” is rapidly gaining ground for many. Walter Coddington (1993) defines green marketing as “business practice that takes into account consumer concerns about promoting preservation and conservation of the natural environment ” (p. 3). Coddington was speaking at the time from an American perspective, but green marketing is far from a uniquely American undertaking. Multinational corporations as well as local firms in foreign markets are tapped into the practice in increasing numbers. In a world where local and regional markets are ever converging into global ones, a movement with the potency of the green trend becomes far-reaching with considerable speed. And given that the green movement generally portends to stanch th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the {{fundamental}} concept of ring amplification is introduced and explored. Ring amplifiers enable efficient amplification in scaled environments, and possess {{the benefits of}} efficient slew-based charging, rapid stabilization, compression-immunity (inherent rail-to-rail output swing), and performance that scales with process technology. A basic operational theory is established, and the <b>core</b> <b>benefits</b> of this technique are identified. Measured results from two separate ring amplifier based pipelined ADCs are presented. The first prototype IC, a simple 10. 5 -bit, 61. 5 dB SNDR pipelined ADC which uses only ring amplifiers, is used to demonstrate the <b>core</b> <b>benefits.</b> The second fabricated IC presented is a high-resolution pipelined ADC which employs the technique of Split-CLS to perform efficient, accurate amplification aided by ring amplifiers. The 15 -bit ADC is implemented in a 0. 18 µm CMOS technology and achieves 76. 8 dB SNDR and 95. 4 dB SFDR at 20 Msps while consuming 5. 1 mW, achieving a FoM o...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify the factors of spectator-sport products based on Kotler' s theory concerning structured products, and to clarify the factors related to the spectators' satisfaction. The data was collected through questionnaires distributed to 376 people (343 effective answers) who were at the franchise game of Bambitious Nara belonging to bj League from 2013. The procedure of this study was, first, to locate the factors of product evaluations at Kotler' s product-levels, and second, to identify which factors affected the spectators' satisfaction by using multiple regression analysis. Seven factors were identified by using factor analysis, which were ‘enjoyment of watching the game' presumed as <b>Core</b> <b>Benefit,</b> ‘fascination of bj League,' and ‘amenity of the stadium' presumed as Generic Product, ‘local consciousness projected through the team' and ‘pleasant entertainment' presumed as Expected Product, and ‘charm of character goods' and ‘ease of getting tickets' presumed as Augmented Product. As a result, the spectators' satisfaction was mainly affected by two factors which were ‘local consciousness projected through the team' and ‘enjoyment of watching the game. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Competitive {{advantage}} {{determines the}} success of modern enterprises, such as hospitality companies, on the market. In turn, competitive advantage is gained {{as the result of}} skillful management, taking into account the factors that characterize the company environment. In the management process, methods and concepts that, when properly applied, facilitate the company's innovative activities play the key role, thus contributing to building competitive advantage. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to specify and characterize the methods and management concepts most commonly used by hospitality companies in the process of building competitive advantage. The <b>core</b> <b>benefit</b> of these considerations is that they serve to identify those activities of hospitality companies in which the analyzed methods and concepts found practical application. The final part of the article is devoted to an attempt to identify barriers and problems that significantly limit the use of these methods and concepts. Material and methods. In order to achieve this objective, a survey and interviews were carried out in all three- and four-star hotels in the Rzeszów area in the first quarter of 2012. Results.

At the same time drivers ’ value of time is often {{predicted}} as being the <b>core</b> <b>benefit</b> from new road development schemes (Mackie, Jara-Días, Fowkes, 2001; Beesley, 1965). This paper uses the theoretical perspective of Kahneman & Tversky’s (1979) Prospect Theory to investigate how time is judged in traffic situations. In particular, it is examined how the framing of timeprospects, influence the drivers ’ judgments. To investigate this a questionnaire was distributed on the internet. 213 participants were presented with 6 different situations related to time in traffic and asked to choose between two different time-prospects {{in each of the}} 6 situations. The 6 different choice situations were each framed in both a positive and a negative formulation. The individual participant was presented with only one of the two formulations in each choice situation. The results from the experiment indicate that the framing of the specific choice situation play a role in drivers ’ judgments of time in traffic related situations, as Prospect Theory predicts. Also, the results show that special consideration must be given to judgments of time as compared to choices involving judgments of objects or money, as the perception of time differs from the perception of objects or money...|$|E
