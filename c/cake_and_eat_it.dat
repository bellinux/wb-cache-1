5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> {{with regards to the}} truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E
500|$|After {{the revelation}} {{in the closing}} minutes of [...] "The Bill", the {{character}} of the episode changes. The biggest changes come about in Watkins's Kevin and White's Anya. Kevin changes from a penny pincher referred to as [...] "the professor" [...] apparently in jest to a menacing criminal mastermind. Anya, initially reminiscent of Manuel of Fawlty Towers or a character from 'Allo 'Allo, faces criticism for taking her characterisation too far, allowing the writers, for one critic, to have their <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it.</b> The writers also acknowledge the plot's [...] "silliness" [...] in an almost-fourth-wall-breaking piece of dialogue, with Shearsmith's Archie declaring that the characters' plan [...] "was too elaborate".|$|E
500|$|Though {{defending}} the suit in Illinois might be burdensome on Hemi, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that Illinois courts {{had a strong}} interest in resolving a dispute that involved the state as a party. Moreover, because Illinois law would be applied, the Court also observed that it would be most convenient for Illinois to have the suit adjudicated in an Illinois court. The Court also noted that [...] "Hemi wants to have its <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> too: it wants the benefit of a nationwide business model with none of the exposure. There is nothing constitutionally unfair about allowing Illinois, a state with which Hemi has had sufficient minimum contacts, to exercise personal jurisdiction over Hemi." ...|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "I'm a Little Bit Country", war protesters {{are portrayed}} as needing the war {{supporters}} so that the United States would not become weak and unable to defend itself from attack, while war supporters are shown as needing the war protesters so the U.S. would not seem like a power hungry or tyrannical government.

5000|$|Some Canadian title holders do not employ their British- or French-derived {{titles in}} Canada. One such example being Kenneth Thomson, who, from his father's death in 1976 until {{his own death}} in 2006, held the {{hereditary}} peerage Baron Thomson of Fleet. Thomson once stated in an interview [...] "In London I'm Lord Thomson, in Toronto I'm Ken. I have two sets of Christmas cards and two sets of stationery. You might say I'm having my <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> <b>it</b> too. I'm honouring a promise to my father by being Lord Thomson, {{and at the same}} time I can just be Ken." ...|$|R
500|$|During the {{recording}} of the episode, Hader ad-libbed calypso scat singing, which series creator Loren Bouchard cited as an [...] "amazing [...] when a person comes in and ad-libs music." [...] Bouchard further stated: [...] "There's something so musical about it and he's clearly so talented, but it's also silly and in character. It's nice to have your <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> too." [...] Hader's singing is incorporated into a scene in the episode where Mickey sings while making a hole in Bob's basement wall, and is later reprised in the episode's end credits. The same scene sees Mickey attempting {{to cover up the}} hole with a Big film poster, which serves as a reference to the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeffrey Mace, saying, [...] "Coulson has been doing what he wants, doing his own thing, taking the quinjet out for a spin wherever he needs to go. He’s shooting from the hip {{with a lot of}} these moves he’s making, and I’m sure that’s going to rub the director the wrong way. [...] in who is reportedly a serial killer, so how the director is going to respond to that, we can only wait and see." [...] Bell talked about this, acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience time to get to know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E
500|$|The most criticized {{aspect of}} the Climax Series is the one-game {{advantage}} that is awarded to the regular-season champions for the Final Stage. When the rule was implemented the for the 2008 Climax Series, many players reacted negatively with some describing the rule as [...] "unfair", [...] "bad", [...] "bull" [...] and [...] "messed up". Former player and current manager Alex Ramírez, however, believed that the league champion deserves the advantage. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey believes that the [...] "phantom win" [...] gives the pennant winner {{too much of an}} advantage. According to him, the First Stage bye plus all home games during the Final Stage should be advantage enough for the top-seeded team. He describes the situation as NPB [...] "trying to have its <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too" [...] by trying to reap the benefits of a playoff system while also trying to maintain the traditional showdown of pennant winners in the Japan Series.|$|E
5000|$|On his father's {{death in}} 1976, Thomson succeeded as 2nd Lord Thomson of Fleet. However, Thomson never used his noble title in Canada or {{took up his}} seat in the House of Lords. In a 1980 {{interview}} with Saturday Night magazine, he said, [...] "In London I'm Lord Thomson, in Toronto I'm Ken. I have two sets of Christmas cards and two sets of stationery.

500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{rated the}} episode 8.5/10. He commented that in {{resetting}} {{the events of}} [...] "Sectionals", it [...] "felt a bit rushed", but concluded: [...] "Glee continues to work because <b>it</b> has its <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eats</b> <b>it</b> too. It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always winks at the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also proving how fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky." [...] Hinckley felt that the episode's greatest problems were its pace and execution, observing: [...] "Too many twists and turns feel a little too sudden, leaving us not quite sure how we got from here to there." ...|$|R
5000|$|This means that, {{though the}} moral fictionalist {{is in some}} ways having <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> <b>it,</b> the quasi-realist has a {{seemingly}} even more difficult position to defend. They may feel secure in disagreeing with Bentham that talk of natural rights is [...] "nonsense upon stilts" [...] but they would also argue that such rights could not be said to exist in a realist sense. Quasi-realism captures in some important ways the structure of our ethical experience of the world and why we can assert claims such as [...] "It is wrong to be cruel to children" [...] as if they were facts even though they do not share the properties of facts; namely the inference of independent truth-values.|$|R
500|$|... "Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)" [...] is an R and hip hop song which {{features}} a [...] "rap poem" [...] from Simon and samples her song [...] "You're So Vain". Its composition excoriates an unfaithful lover for attempting to extort money, described as a [...] "mean-spirited duet that rails against enemies." [...] Jackson unveils anger and deceit, saying [...] "Thought you'd get the money too / Greedy motherfuckers try to have their <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too". She also offers a comeuppance to a [...] "baby gigolo" [...] who hollers at [...] "everything that walks / No substance, just small talk." [...] Simon also cited the claims of sampled song [...] "You're So Vain" [...] to be written about Mick Jagger, singing [...] "The apricot scarf was worn by Nick / Nothing in the words refer to Mick". In response to critics regarding it about her divorce, Jackson explained it was directed towards several people, while Jimmy Jam revealed it to be written in regards to music executives and lawyers.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} the episode [...] "was 30 Rocks best episode of the season , if not the best episode ever from this young series." [...] Canning also said that [...] "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock. It was also an episode that once again proved the {{character}} of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half-hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." [...] Canning rated this episode [...] "9.5 out of 10." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that [...] "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell juuuuuuust a bit short.

[...] He thought that [...] "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Overall, [...] another splendid [...] My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, {{and it seemed to me}} like the show was trying to have its <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it,</b> too." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{music videos}} {{contributed to a}} higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, as Jean M. Twenge, author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before (2007) wrote: [...] "In Alfred Kinsey's studies in the 1950s, only 3% of the young women had {{received}} oral sex from a man. By the mid-1990s, however, 75% of women aged 18-24 had experienced cunnilingus. Music videos by female artists have contributed to the trend, with both Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until he's in exactly the right position." [...] Similarly, Paula Kamen in Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution (2000) states that [...] "n the early to mid-1990s, oral sex even reached mainstream music as politically charged demand of truly liberated women," [...] citing TLC, Mary J. Blige and Janet Jackson as examples of female artists simulating cunnilingus in their videos. Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "she celebrated becoming an erotic being... young women a way to have their sexual freedom and their dignity, to have their <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too." [...] She was named Best Female Singer and Female Sex Symbol by Rolling Stone for the year 1993 in pop music. Goren adds that later pop stars such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Pink would rely on image, sex appeal and choreography as much as musical talent.|$|E

Therefore, it must go to war, but allow protests. The United States will go to war on one hand, and use protest to oppose the war on the other. He refers to this as [...] "saying one thing and doing another". One member refers to this as [...] "having our <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> <b>it</b> too". Both sides decide to use the boys to give their opinion about the war, but their plan backfires because their parents interfered with their assignment about the Founding Fathers, the boys don't know what's going on about the war, and Cartman ended up in the hospital; shortly after, Cartman wakes up and delivers his message to the town, who see the truth of that statement and then break out into song. In it, they celebrate their differences and their achievement (100 episodes); ending the song with the line, [...] "For the war, against the war—who cares! 100 episodes!"

2500|$|Sometime around 1940, in an {{apparent}} effort to provide researchers with a [...] "non-controversial" [...] way to have their <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too, the authors of statistical text books began anonymously combining these two strategies by using the p-value {{in place of the}} test statistic (or data) to test against the Neyman–Pearson [...] "significance level". Thus, researchers were encouraged to infer the strength of their data against some null hypothesis using p-values, while also thinking they are retaining the post-data collection objectivity provided by hypothesis testing. It then became customary for the null hypothesis, which was originally some realistic research hypothesis, to be used almost solely as a strawman [...] "nil" [...] hypothesis (one where a treatment has no effect, regardless of the context).|$|E

Then, Mickey's nephews barge the gate down and trample all over Pluto as they hurry to the party. The children give Pluto a small red cart and treat him like a workhorse. They then all start to enjoy themselves at the party. They first take Pluto on the slide, then barge down the swing. Then, they play pin the tail on Pluto to see who can pin Pluto's tail. Soon it is time for lunch and Pluto wants to have a piece of his own cake, but Mickey's nephews prefer to amuse themselves by grabbing every slice of <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> <b>it</b> up, much to Pluto's horror. Eventually, they devour Pluto's birthday <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> leave.

60|$|Of the Oxford Movement {{what remains}} most {{strongly}} in the Victorian Epoch centres round the challenge of Newman, its one great literary man. But the movement as a whole had been of great significance in the very genesis and make up of the society: yet that significance is not quite easy immediately to define. It was certainly not æsthetic ritualism; scarcely one of the Oxford High Churchmen was what we should call a Ritualist. It was certainly not a conscious reaching out towards Rome: except on a Roman Catholic theory which might explain all our unrests by that dim desire. It knew little of Europe, it knew nothing of Ireland, to which any merely Roman Catholic revulsion would obviously have turned. In the first instance, I think, the more it is studied, the more {{it would appear that}} it was a movement of mere religion as such. It was not so much a taste for Catholic dogma, but simply a hunger for dogma. For dogma means the serious satisfaction of the mind. Dogma does not mean the absence of thought, but the end of thought. It was a revolt against the Victorian spirit in one particular aspect of it; which may roughly be called (in a cosy and domestic Victorian metaphor) having your <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> <b>it</b> too. It saw that the solid and serious Victorians were fundamentally frivolous--because they were fundamentally inconsistent.|$|R

5000|$|These asymmetries did {{not bother}} all students, as some viewed the {{differences}} {{as a matter of}} course between two different institutions. This perspective was particularly strong with Radcliffe students who graduated before the turbulent 1960s. One alumna from the 1940s mused that at Radcliffe [...] "we were supremely happy in our own environment. For us, Harvard remained 'the other.' Most of us felt no connection to it;...instead, we enjoyed our own collegiate activities and traditions. [...] Another graduate from the class of 1949 noted that she was [...] "having my <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> <b>it,</b> too.

The women who had chosen to come to Radcliffe all were intelligent, quite independent, and concerned with the world around them." [...] Additionally, Radcliffe offered a cultural advantage over Harvard: even when enrolled in the same courses, Harvard and Radcliffe student took exams separately, as Radcliffe College's honor code necessitated a vastly different exam-taking environment: [...] "Where the men's exam rituals included proctors, dress codes, and a strict requirement of silence, the Radcliffe women took un-proctored exams, relished the chance to wear informal pants instead of skirts, and could enter and exit the building as they wished so long as they did not cheat." [...] Similarly, the Radcliffe honor code provided for more generous library and campus space privileges (for student groups) than the more bureaucratic Harvard systems allowed.|$|R
500|$|The {{producers}} listed various possible directors, but {{at first}} did not consider Matthew Vaughn because he started working on The Last Stand before backing out. After seeing Vaughn's satirical superhero film Kick-Ass (2010), Kinberg decided to contact Vaughn {{to see if he}} would be interested in First Class. When Fox offered Vaughn the [...] "chance to reboot X-Men and put your stamp all over it", he first thought the studio was joking, but accepted after discovering that it was to be set in the 1960s. The director stated that First Class would become the opportunity to combine many of his dream projects: [...] "I got my <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> <b>ate</b> <b>it,</b> managed to do an X-Men movie, and a Bond thing, and a Frankenheimer political thriller at the same time". Vaughn signed on as Singer's replacement in May 2010, and Fox subsequently announced a June 3, 2011 release date. Vaughn also rewrote the script with his screenwriting partner Jane Goldman, adding new characters and changing existing character arcs and dynamics—for instance, the idea of a love triangle between Xavier, Magneto and Moira MacTaggert was cut. The character of Sunspot was also cut, as the director felt that [...] "we didn't have enough time or money" [...] to make the character work. Vaughn and Goldman considered including mentions to the Civil Rights Movement, but ultimately the director felt that [...] "I had enough political subplot in this movie". Vaughn stated that his biggest concern was to both make Erik and Charles' friendship believable given the short timespan of the film, and on how the character of Magneto was built - [...] "Shaw was the villain, but now you're seeing all those elements of Shaw going into Magneto." [...] An action scene that was to have been set in a dream sequence with revolving rooms was scrapped after the release of Inception (2010).|$|R

40|$|Spring is here, {{and after}} a very cold winter, {{activities}} are heating up in the GNU/Linux community. The key word, there is community. It wasn't long ago that I was listening to a podcast on “Linux ” and among the items that was discussed was the VMWARE- Free Software community lawsuit in Germany for violations of the GPL. Evidently, VMWARE had decided to {{not be such a}} good member of the community. There has been a long standing problem with VMWARE and the issues have come to boil over. Nor is the problems being sighted against VMWARE exclusive to them. Everyone want their <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> to <b>eat</b> <b>it</b> too.

Whats is yours is mine and what is mine is mine. Free Software can't work like that. Now to be honest, VMWARE is not the worst actor. There is a broader issue of cutting around the core values that the GPL, and to leave the community with only the slimist pickings. This is the business tactic which is causing a broad problem. This is a problem with Objective C, CLANG, JAVA, Oracle, and also VMWARE. Simon Phipps wrote a fairly comprehensive review of the problem in infoworld 1 and hits the nail on the head when he writes: At first glance, this seemed like a conflict over "module loading. " Vendors commonly write code their legal teams tell them will "insulate " them from the GPL so that they can use Linux drivers in proprietary code. This is a controversial topic among free software advocates, and a lawsuit clarifying the effectiveness of that strategy would be helpful. ...|$|R
