2500|$|When I had {{attained}} {{the age of}} twenty, I {{began to}} study the book Zohar {{and some of the}} Lurianic writings. [...] he who wants to purify himself receives the aid of Heaven; and thus He sent me some of His holy angels and blessed spirits who revealed to me many of the mysteries of the Torah. In that same year, my force having been stimulated by the visions of the angels and the blessed souls, I was undergoing a prolonged fast in the week before the feast of Purim. Having locked myself in a separate room in holiness and purity…the spirit <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>me,</b> my hair stood on end and my knees shook and I beheld the merkabah, and I saw visions of God all day long and all night… ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{anonymous}} interview, the jury foreman stated, [...] "When I {{had to sign}} off on the verdict, the sheet that was given to me—there was just a feeling of disgust that <b>came</b> <b>over</b> <b>me</b> knowing that my signature and [...] signature were {{going to be on the}} same sheet," [...] but that [...] "there was a suspicion of [...] " [...] that played a part in the jury's deliberations.

[...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
