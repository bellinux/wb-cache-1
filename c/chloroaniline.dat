In situ high-pressure Fourier transform infrared measurements were made to study the molecular interactions of CO 2 with the following reactant and reaction intermediates: chloronitrobenzene, chloronitrosobenzene, and N-chlorophenylhydroxylamine. The molecular interaction modifies the reactivity of each species and accordingly the reaction rate and the selectivity.

The thermodynamic stabilities of the aqueous and surface aluminum-aniline and aluminum- 2 -chloroaniline complexes were investigated at 55 $ sp circ$C and 80 $ sp circ$C. Solubility and adsorption experiments place quantitative constraints on the thermodynamic properties of these complexes. No evidence was found for stable Al-aniline or Al- 2 -chloroaniline aqueous complexes. Conversely, the adsorption data provide unequivocal evidence {{for the presence of}} two distinct surface Al-aniline and A-chloroaniline complexes according to the following reactions: (1) $Aniline sp circ + { equiv}Al(OH) sp circ leftrightarrow { equiv}(AlOH(Aniline) sp circ$; (2) $Aniline sp circ + { equiv}Al(O) sp- leftrightarrow { equiv}AlO(Aniline) sp-$; (3) $Chloroaniline sp circ + { equiv}Al(OH) sp circ leftrightarrow { equiv}AlOH(Chloroaniline) sp circ$; (4) $Chloroaniline sp circ + { equiv}Al(OH sb 2) sp+ leftrightarrow { equiv}AlOH sb 2 (<b>Chloroaniline)</b> sp+$. A constant capacitance model is used to quantify the stability constants for reactions (1) - (4), and the results yield equilibrium constant values of 10 $ sp{ 2. 09 }$, 10 $ sp{ 2. 67 }$, 10 $ sp{ 2. 87 }$ and 10 $ sp{ 2. 30 }$ respectively.

40|$|The {{effects on}} {{mitochondrial}} respiration of 15 <b>chloroanilines</b> were recorded {{by using the}} in vitro response of submitochondrial particles (SMP) from beef heart mitochondria. The bioassay procedure for SMP {{is based on the}} process of reverse electron transfer, which can be negatively affected by inhibitors of electron transport, by uncouplers, and by chemicals that impair membrane integrity. The EC 50 values, determined for the tested <b>chloroanilines,</b> indicate a general tendency of increasing toxicity with increasing chlorine substitution. In order to validate the results obtained and to evaluate the capability of the SMP assay to reproduce the toxic effects of the examined compounds on different freshwater species, the EC 50 values were compared with literature data from other biological assays regarding both in vitro systems and whole organisms. A good correlation was found in particular with two widely used testing systems, the Microtox((R)) and the Tetrahymena assays. In addition, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were established between the EC 50 values and various molecular descriptors for hydrophobic, steric, and electronic interactions. The results obtained were utilized to elucidate the mechanism of toxic action of <b>chloroanilines,</b> which are commonly reported to act by the polar narcosis mode of action.

Overall, the hexane/acetone-plus-PTV procedure shows better results than the hexane-plus-LV-OC method in terms of analyte recovery (36 - 109 % versus 5 - 87 %), repeatability (8 - 13 % versus 4 - 31 %) and detection limits. Both approaches allow detection of the <b>chloroanilines</b> in complex soil samples down to the 5 - 50 ng/g range.

The use of <b>chloroaniline</b> dithiocarbamate and <b>chloroaniline</b> as ligands to functionalize the Cd (II) ions provides a new path for solubilization of Cd (II) complex in the chlorobenzene solvent. It removes use of volatile and hazardous chemicals such as pyridine as ligand which are conventionally used to enhance solubility of such complexes. It is the first example of solvothermal process used for in-situ growth of CdS NRs in a polymer matrix. This nanocomposite is used to fabricate hybrid-organic-inorganic-solar cells (HOISC) as donor acceptor combination in the bulk hetrojunction (BHJ) geometry.

40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S) is a corrosive {{and toxic}} gas, which poses serious health and operational risks when present in produced fluids such as condensate, gas and water. Therefore {{efforts have been}} made to remove H 2 S from the sour gas. In today’s world, {{there are a number of}} processes in use for treating “sour” gases containing the acid components H 2 S and CO 2. The goal of the present work is to study the reduction of Metachloronitrobenzene using Hydrogen sulphide and phase transfer catalyst and to study the effect of temperature, catalyst loading, concentration of reactants and temperature on the conversion and selectivity of the product. H 2 S is generally separated from the sour gas to produce elemental sulphur. This process is known as Claus process. Although elemental sulphur is produced, the cost of this process is high because it involves stripping of the H 2 S rich alkanolamine solution to give back the lean alkanolamine solution. However, if we use the absorbed H 2 S solution to produce other chemicals which are beneficial to the chemical industry, then we need not spend a lot on production of elemental sulphur. <b>Chloroanilines</b> are of great importance when it comes to the manufacturing of dyestuffs, drugs and various types of pesticides.

Major part of this report is dedicated to the description of experiments and model formulation and performance. It appeared that the variation in biodegradation rates between soils could be described by a Michaelis-Menten equation with a sorption-corrected dosage (pore water concentration) and a pH-dependent Vmax. The model was used to calculate the biodegradation potential of soils of the European Community and the Netherlands. In the last chapter results of other parts of the research are summarized to give an overview of the project "Prediction of the biodegradation of substituted monocyclic aromatic compounds in soils". It appeared that bound residue formation is related to the soil organic matter content. <b>Chloroanilines</b> showed different affinities for fulvic acids, humic acids and humine. A second chlorinesubstituent decreased bound residue formation. Bound residues were not as inaccessible as we expected, 6 - 10 % of the soil-bound 4 -monochloroaniline-residue was mineralized by microbiological activity.

The parent, Acinetobacter strain DON 26 phenotype Ani 0, was common in river water and assimilated aniline effectively at micromolar concentrations, but was inhibited at higher concentrations of aniline. The Ani 0 phenotype was also characterized by a broad specificity for oxidation of <b>chloroanilines</b> by aniline-induced cells. The mutant Ani+ phenotype was represented by DON 2, isolated from a population of less than 100 cells ml- 1 in a mixed river water culture, and by DON 261, isolated during continuous culture of DON 26. Ani+ strains assimilated aniline at a greater maximum specific rate than the parent {{and were able to}} grow at concentrations of aniline greater than 16 mM. These strains cooxidized phenol after growth at high aniline concentrations, but showed reduced activity toward <b>chloroanilines.</b> These changes plus kinetic data, oxygen uptake data, and the results of auxanography indicate that the mutant has an increased activity and altered specificity of the initial enzyme in the aniline catabolic pathway. The parent strain, DON 26, was at a selective advantage relative to the mutant at low concentrations of aniline, but was replaced by the mutant when aniline concentrations increased. Adaptation of the mixed river water community to aniline involved selection of both phenotypes.

Phenol and 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -chlorophenol were utilized by anaerobic microorganisms, with the concomitant reduction of Fe(sup 3 +) to Fe(sup 2 +). The amount of Fe(sup 2 +) produced in the enrichments was 89 to 138 % of that expected for the stoichiometric degradation of these substrates to CO(inf 2), suggesting complete mineralization at the expense of Fe reduction. Under Fe-reducing conditions, there was initial loss of benzoate and 3 -chlorobenzoate but not of 2 - or 4 -chlorobenzoate. In addition, there was initial microbial utilization of aniline but not of the <b>chloroaniline</b> isomers. There was also initial loss of o-, m-, and p-cresol in our enrichments. None of the dimethylphenol isomers, however, was degraded within 300 days. Furthermore, we tested the capacity of an Fe-reducing, benzoate-grown culture of Geobacter metallireducens GS- 15 to utilize monochlorinated benzoates and phenols. G. metallireducens was able to degrade benzoate and phenol but none of their chlorinated isomers, suggesting that the degradation of chlorophenols in our sediment enrichments may be due to novel Fe-reducing organisms that have yet to be isolated...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{discharge}} water, {{and especially}} {{that from the}} surface treatment industry (ST), contains non-negligible amounts of pollutants even though the legislation is fully respected. In spite of this, no detailed studies list the exact chemical composition of these effluents. The present study reports the results of analyses performed over a 6 -month period involving 15 standard water parameters. Over 160 substances including 33 metals, 58 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 24 chlorophenols (CPs), 16 alkylphenols (APs), 5 <b>chloroanilines</b> (CAs) and 7 polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were monitored. The industrial effluents presented polycontamination involving metals, minerals and organics {{with a high degree}} of qualitative and quantitative variability. Of the 160 substances monitored, 46 were regularly found: 25 inorganics including 8 metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sn, Zn) and 21 organics (4 PAHs, 10 VOCs, 4 CPs and 3 APs). Eighteen were systematically present ed at quantifiable levels. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a literature research belonging to the RUVM-part of a research on the phytotoxicity for 80 priority substances, which was carried out by TNO and RIVM. In the RIVM-part of this research effects of 45 organic substances were determined on germination, growth and mortality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Most of the substances belong the the chlorophenols, chlorobenzenes, <b>chloroanilines,</b> alcohols and amines. Often EC 50 -values determined in Fytotox 2 were lower than EC 50 -values found in literature, espcially for chlorophenols and alcohols. In Fytotox 2 EC 50 -values were mainly lower, because plants were exposed for a longer period in this test. EC 50 -values for algae were generally in agreement with EC 50 -values for higher plants. Root length of intact plants seemed to be the most sensitive parameter to measure effects on the growth of plants. Differences in sensitivity between plant species within one test method were usually small (< factor 3) ...|$|R
40|$|An immunoaffinity solid-phase-extraction sorbent {{has been}} {{developed}} by raising polyclonal antibodies against propanil and covalently bonding them to activated silica. This immunosorbent (IS) had high affinity for propanil and for structurally related phenylurea herbicides whereas structurally related <b>chloroanilines</b> were retained only poorly. Studies of breakthrough volumes, capacity, and calibration ranges of selected pesticides showed that the antibodies have different affinities for each compound. Propanil and phenylureas could be quantitatively recovered by elution with methanol–water; average recoveries were close to 100 %. The IS was also packed in a precolumn and coupled on-line to HPLC–UV. The high selectivity provided by the IS was demonstrated by comparing results with those obtained by use of a non-selective polymeric sorbent when both were used for direct extraction of propanil and phenylureas from a 50 -mL sample of river-Seine water spiked at 0. 1 µg L– 1 or from lemon juice spiked at 50 µg L– 1...|$|R
