40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to measure the level of the European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) price support system (PSS) applied to producers in the EU- 15 and in Turkey. The producer subsidy estimate (PSE) method has been used to determine protection levels for selected cereal products from the beginning of the application of the PSE method in 1986 to date. In addition, this study attempts to examine the empirical findings of the PSE in the light of CAP reforms and EU enlargements during the period 1986 - 2003. The expected contribution {{of this study is to}} determine which support instruments, such as countervailing levies or direct payments (based on limited or unlimited area) against export subsidies, voluntary or <b>compulsory</b> <b>set-aside</b> measures and price interventions, are more appropriate for the CAP in reducing destabilizing effects on trade with selected products between the EU and Turkey with respect to distribution effects (how income is distributed between different groups involved in the production operation process). Does the current PSS of the CAP have positive effects on agricultural producers in Turkey as a non-member country? The major finding of this dissertation is the evaluation of benefits and costs of common agricultural policies of the EU on fair trade. The assessment of the PSE of the EU's CAP will be used to determine the impact of current support measures of the CAP reforms on fair trade and consumer welfare, and how the CAP measures can be reformed for the improvement of producer gain in accordance with fair trade.

40|$|Public {{policies}} {{seeking to}} regulate pesticide use {{must be based}} on a clear identification of the factors influencing such use. Since the agricultural use of pesticides is primarily crop-dependent, agricultural land use change is potentially an important driver of the overall level of pesticide use in a given country. In this paper, we investigate the influence of agricultural land use changes on pesticide use in French agriculture over the period 1989 - 2013, during which important changes in the Common Agricultural Policy took place. Toward that end, we developed a method allowing the direct effects of agricultural land use changes to be disentangled from other factors affecting the intensity of pesticide use. On the basis of standard protection programs defined by crop protection experts,a fixed pesticide use intensity is estimated for 19 annual and perennial crops representing 90 % of French arable land area and the bulk of pesticide use in French agriculture. These coefficients, combined with national agricultural land use statistics, are used to construct an artificial index of pesticide use in France whose variations depend solely on changes in agricultural land use. This index is calculated over the period 1989 - 2013. Our results indicate that the direct impacts of agricultural land use changes on pesticide use in France have varied depending on the time period considered, reflecting the influence of public regulations, notably the <b>compulsory</b> <b>set-aside</b> policy in force during the 1990 s, and market conditions, particularly the context of high prices for cereal grains {{at the end of the}} 2000 s. Over the six years from 2008 to 2013, this index is roughly constant, indicating that the 17 % increase in French pesticide use in 2013 compared to 2008 (as assessed from annual pesticide sales) cannot be even partially attributed to agricultural land use changes. Since 2000, land use changes mainly corresponded to substitutions between crops with similar per-hectare pesticide use intensities, and/or to substitutions with counterbalancing impacts on these intensities. A prospective approach shows that other types of land use changes (e. g. a massive conversion of grassland to arable land or, conversely, a strong diversification of arable crop rotations), could have much higher impacts on pesticide use, with the effect of either offsetting or reinforcing efforts to reduce pesticide use intensity in arable crops. Thus, better coordination is needed between public policies aimed at regulating pesticide use and public policies influencing land use...|$|E
