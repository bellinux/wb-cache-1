50|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{with this}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>system</b> is reduced headroom. Clearance is required between the grid and any pipes or ductwork above {{to install the}} ceiling tiles and light fixtures. In general, a minimum clearance of 100 to 200 mm is often needed between the lowest obstruction {{and the level of}} the ceiling grid. A direct-mount grid may work for those who want the convenience of a dropped ceiling, but have limited headroom. Stretch ceiling supports require less than one inch of vertical space, and no space is required for tiles to be lifted out with a stretch ceiling, but a greater clearance space may be chosen to allow room for MEC or for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
50|$|Joists must {{exhibit the}} {{strength}} to support the anticipated load {{over a long period}} of time. In more developed countries such as the United States, the fabrication and installation of all framing members including joists must meet building code standards. Considering the cross section of a typical joist, the overall depth of the joist is critical in establishing a safe and stable floor or <b>ceiling</b> <b>system.</b> The wider the spacing between the joists, the deeper the joist will need to be to limit stress and deflection under load. Lateral support called dwang, blocking, or strutting increases its stability, preventing the joist from buckling under load. There are approved formulas for calculating the depth required and reducing the depth as needed; however, a rule of thumb for calculating the depth of a wooden floor joist for a residential property is to take half the span in feet, add two, and use the resulting number as the depth in inches; for example, the joist depth required for a 14‑foot span is 9 inches. Many steel joist manufacturers supply load tables in order to allow designers to select the proper joist sizes for their projects.|$|E

40|$|Large {{open plan}} offices have {{advantages}} of low cost construction and flexibility, but they sometimes lack speech privacy and generate sound disturbance {{when people are}} talking. Installing small closed meeting rooms inside open plan offices is a good solution to the problem, but the ceiling increases {{the cost of the}} meeting rooms due to the requirements of fire safety regulations and extra ventilation and lighting systems. Having the ceiling open or removing the ceiling of the meeting rooms is an option; however, the challenge is the low speech privacy caused by sound wave propagation through the opening.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} context of {{more and more}} energy {{efficient}} buildings, performant HVAC systems are required. The solution based on radiant cooling <b>ceiling</b> <b>systems</b> has proven successful in terms of high energy efficiency and good levels of thermal comfort. Nevertheless, {{there is an important}} issue concerning the cooling ceilings: the risk of condensation. As a result, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the thermal comfort and condensation risk for buildings with ventilation <b>systems</b> and cooling <b>ceilings.</b> The approach is based on CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) technique, introducing special methodologies in order to deal with convection and diffusion phenomena for water vapor, required for comprehensive thermal comfort analyzes and condensation mechanisms. The numerical model is applied in the case of a small office, taking into account a radiant cooling ceiling over the entire ceiling surface and two configurations of ventilation systems: mixing ventilation and displacement ventilation. Several simulations have been completed for different conditions concerning the air flow rates of the ventilation systems and temperatures of the cooling ceiling. It has been concluded that mixing ventilation has superior behavior, both in terms of thermal comfort and condensation risk, when warm and moist air is supplied in the room. On the other hand, the results show that when untreated air is supplied by the ventilation system (no matter its configuration, mixing or displacement), thermal comfort in the office cannot be properly assured only by radiant cooling <b>ceiling</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
