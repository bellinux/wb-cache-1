40|$|Abstract: Background: <b>Carbocysteine</b> is a muco-active drug {{with free}} radical {{scavenging}} and anti-inflammatory properties. It is actually approved {{for clinical use}} as adjunctive therapy of respiratory tract disorders characterized by excessive, viscous mucus, including chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD). Objective: The intriguing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of <b>carbocysteine,</b> beyond its known mucolytic activity, are described to explain its therapeutic efficacy and suggest new clinical uses. Methods: After reviewing physiology and preclinical studies, human studies {{on the use of}} <b>carbocysteine</b> in chronic inflammatory diseases, i. e., COPD and cancer cachexia, are reviewed. Results/conclusions: <b>Carbocysteine</b> has been recently recognized as an effective and safe treatment for the long-term management of COPD, able to reduce the incidence of exacerbations and improve patient quality of life. Moreover, <b>carbocysteine</b> was effective in counteracting some symptoms associated with cancer cachexia. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of <b>carbocysteine</b> are more important than mucolysis itself for its therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, <b>carbocysteine</b> may be able to reverse the oxidative stress associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Controlled, randomized studies in humans are warranted...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the effects of <b>carbocysteine</b> in OSAS {{patients}}. A total of 40 patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) were randomly divided into two groups. One group was treated with 1500 mg <b>carbocysteine</b> daily, and the other was treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night. Before treatment and after 6 weeks of treatment, all patients underwent polysomnography and completed questionnaires. Treatment compliance was compared between the two groups. Plasma was collected for various biochemical analyses. Endothelial function was assessed with ultrasound in the <b>carbocysteine</b> group. The proportion of patients who fulfilled the criteria for good compliance was higher in the <b>carbocysteine</b> group (n = 17) than in the CPAP group (n = 11; 100 % vs. 64. 7 %). Compared with baseline values, the <b>carbocysteine</b> group showed significant improvement in their Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (10. 18 ± 4. 28 vs. 6. 82 ± 3. 66; P ≤ 0. 01), apnea-hypopnea index (55. 34 ± 25. 03 vs. 47. 56 ± 27. 32; P ≤ 0. 01), time and percentage of 90 % oxygen desaturation (12. 66 (2. 81; 50. 01) vs. 8. 9 (1. 41; 39. 71); P ≤ 0. 01), and lowest oxygen saturation level (65. 88 ± 14. 86 vs. 70. 41 ± 14. 34; P ≤ 0. 01). Similar changes were also observed in the CPAP group. The CPAP group also showed a decreased oxygen desaturation index and a significant increase in the mean oxygen saturation after treatment, but these increases were not observed in the <b>carbocysteine</b> group. Snoring volume parameters, such as the power spectral density, were significantly reduced in both groups after the treatments. The plasma malondialdehyde level decreased and the superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide levels increased in both groups. The endothelin- 1 level decreased in the CPAP group but did not significantly change in the <b>carbocysteine</b> group. Ultrasonography showed that the intima-media thickness decreased (0. 71 ± 0. 15 vs. 0. 66 ± 0. 15; P ≤ 0. 05) but that flow-mediated dilation did not significantly change in the <b>carbocysteine</b> group. Oral <b>carbocysteine</b> slightly improves sleep disorders by attenuating oxidative stress in patients with moderate to severe OSAS. <b>Carbocysteine</b> may have a role in the treatment of OSAS patients with poor compliance with CPAP treatment. However, the efficiency and feasibility of <b>carbocysteine</b> treatment for OSAS needs further evaluation. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 02015598...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method to determine <b>carbocysteine</b> in human plasma {{was developed and}} fully validated. After methanol-induced protein precipitation of the plasma samples, <b>carbocysteine</b> was subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis using electrospray ionization (ESI). The MS system was operated in the selected ion monitoring (SRM) mode. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Hypurity C 18 column (i. d. 2. 1 mm x 50 mm, particle size 5 μm). The method had a chromatographic running time of 2. 0 min and linear calibration curves over the concentration ranges of 0. 1 - 20 μg/mL for <b>carbocysteine.</b> The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the method was 0. 1 μg/mL for <b>carbocysteine.</b> The intra- and inter-day precision was less than 7 % for all quality control samples at concentrations of 0. 5, 2. 0, and 10. 0 μg/mL.

40|$|Cigarette smoke {{extracts}} (CSE) induce oxidative stress, {{an important}} feature in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), and oxidative stress {{contributes to the}} poor clinical efficacy of corticosteroids in COPD patients. <b>Carbocysteine,</b> an antioxidant and mucolytic agent, is effec- tive in reducing the severity and the rate of exacerbations in COPD patients. The effects of <b>carbocysteine</b> on CSE-induced oxidative stress in bronchial epithelial cells as well as the comparison of these antioxidant effects of <b>carbocysteine</b> with those of fluticasone propionate are unknown. The present study was aimed to assess the effects of <b>carbocysteine</b> (10 − 4 M) in cell survival and intracellular reactive oxygenpecies (ROS) production (by flow cytometry) as well as total glutathione (GSH), heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), nuclear- related factor 2 (Nrf 2) expression and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC- 2) expression/activation in CSE-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells (16 -HBE) and to compare these effects with those of fluticasone propionate (10 − 8 M). CSE, <b>carbocysteine</b> or fluticasone propionate did not induce cell necrosis (propidium positive cells) or cell apoptosis (annexin V- positive/propidium-negative cells) in 16 -HBE. CSE increased ROS production, nuclear Nrf 2 and HO- 1 in 16 -HBE. Fluticasone propionate did not modify intracellular ROS pro- duction, GSH and HDCA- 2 but reduced Nrf 2 and HO- 1 in CSE-stimulated 16 -HBE. <b>Carbocysteine</b> reduced ROS pro- duction and increased GSH, HO- 1, Nrf 2 and HDAC- 2 nuclear expression/activity in CSE-stimulated cells and was more effective than fluticasone propionate in modulating the CSE- mediated effects.

40|$|Background: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is one of}} the commonest diseases characterized by persistent distal airways inflammation. Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy should be the basis of COPD treatment. There is only limited evidence supporting the efficacy of mucolytics like <b>carbocysteine</b> in the preventing COPD exacerbations in inhaled corticosteroid-naïve patients. Aim: To study clinical and immunological effects of <b>carbocysteine</b> in COPD. Materials and methods: During first 2 months, 30 patients with stage II COPD (mean age 55. 9 ± 1. 2   years old) were treated with inhaled glucocorticosteroids and beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonists ‘as required’. Thereafter, the standard therapy was continued in 15 patients; in other 15 patients <b>carbocysteine</b> 1500 mg/day was added. Immune status was studied bi-monthly in all patients: to detect lymphocytes with expression of CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 72 -antigens and CD 23, CD 71, CD 95 and HLA-DR activation markers, monoclonal antibodies were used. Quality of life was assessed using adapted Russian version of St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Results: Compared with the anti-inflammatory therapy, adding <b>carbocysteine</b> to standard therapy of COPD was associated with significantly better quality of life after 4 months of therapy (less negative changes of symptoms and activity scores and improvement of psycho-social function: changes of relevant SGRQ scores were - 3. 4 and - 8. 0; - 1. 9 and - 3. 8; 0. 4 and - 0. 76, respectively). After 4 months, carbocysteine-treated patients demonstrated better improvements in shortness of breath, cough and sputum scores compared with the control group (2 and 2. 2; 1. 5 and 1. 9; 0. 8 and 1. 2, respectively). In <b>carbocysteine</b> group, clinical symptoms improvement correlated with positive changes of immunological status. The patients demonstrated greater significant elevation of total T-lymphocytes (especially CD 8 +-cells), decreased B-cells and increased expression of CD 95 -antigen compared with the standard therapy group.

Aims: Aim {{of this study}} was to explore whether <b>carbocysteine</b> modulated SIRT 1 /FoxO 3 axis, and downstream molecular mechanisms associated to cellular senescence, in a bronchial epithelial cell line (16 -HBE) exposed to cigarette smoke. Methods: 16 HBE cells were stimulated with/without cigarette smoke extracts (CSE) and <b>carbocysteine.</b> Flow cytometry and clonogenic assay were used to assess cell proliferation; western blot analysis was used for assessing nuclear expression of SIRT 1 and FoxO 3. The nuclear co-localization of SIRT 1 and FoxO 3 was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Beta galactosidase (a senescence marker) and SIRT 1 activity were assessed by specific staining and colorimetric assays, respectively. ChiP Assay and flow cytometry were used for assessing survivin gene regulation and protein expression, respectively. Results: CSE decreased cell proliferation, the nuclear expression of SIRT 1 and FoxO 3 and increased beta galactosidase staining. CSE, reduced SIRT 1 activity and FoxO 3 localization on survivin promoter thus increasing survivin expression. In CSE stimulated bronchial epithelial cells <b>carbocysteine</b> reverted these phenomena by increasing cell proliferation, and SIRT 1 and FoxO 3 nuclear expression, and by reducing beta galactosidase staining and survivin expression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The recent {{epidemiological}} {{and experimental}} evidence suggest possible antioxidant effect of <b>carbocysteine</b> {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). AIM: To assess efficacy and tolerability of <b>carbocysteine</b> in the management of stable COPD. METHODS: We performed an observational, non-randomized, open study (a real life study) including 87 patients with stable COPD (group B and D by combined COPD assessment) divided in two groups, examined group (EG) and control group (CG). All participants were treated with the regular treatment of the stable disease, but in the participants of the EG <b>carbocysteine</b> 1, 500 mg daily was added to their regular treatment during the period of two months. The study protocol included completion of the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and spirometric measurements at initial visit {{and at the end of}} the mentioned period. RESULTS: We found significantly lower mean value of the overall CAT score in the EG at the end of the study as compared to its mean value registered at initial visit (26. 9 vs. 24. 3; P = 0. 007). In regard to certain CAT items, we found significantly lower values of the mean scores related to cough phlegm and sleep disturbances as compared to their mean scores at initial visit. In addition, the mean values of the overall CAT scores at initial visit and at the end of the study in controls were similar. In EG we found significantly higher mean value of the MEF 25 - 75 at the end of the study as compared to its mean value registered at initial visit (59. 3 % vs. 67. 2 %; P = 0. 003). There was no significant difference in the mean values of other spirometric parameters at the end of the study as compared to their mean values at initial visit. In controls we registered similar values of all measured spirometric parameters at the end of the study as compared to their values registered at initial visit.

40|$|Objective: Xiaoqinglong {{decoction}} (XQL) {{has been}} used in traditional Chinese medicine as a prescription for asthma treatment. We explored the effects of XQL on mucus hypersecretion and ciliophagy in the airways of mice in which asthma had been induced by ovalbumin (OVA). Methods: Thirty-six mice were sensitized by OVA injection (i. p.) on day- 0 and day- 14 and challenged with 1 % OVA on day 18 – 22. Then, they were divided into three groups: model, <b>carbocysteine</b> and XQL. From day- 15 to day- 22, the XQL group was administered XQL (10  g/kg, p. o.) 1  hour before each aerosol challenge with OVA. To evaluate the effect of XQL on mucus hypersecretion, AB-PAS staining, measurement of serum levels of interleukin (IL) - 13, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analyses, ciliophagy analyses, as well as co-expression of Light Chain 3 (LC 3) and acetylated α-tubulin by immunofluorescence staining were undertaken. Results: Treatment with XQL (10  g/kg) attenuated mucus secretion in the airways, and reduced the positive areas of AB-PAS staining in histopathologic lung tissues (P < . 05). IL- 13 expression in serum (P < . 01), OVA-induced inflammatory changes, and the number of white blood cells (P < . 01) in BALF samples were also reduced. However, the effect on mucus secretion was less apparent in the <b>carbocysteine</b> group compared with the XQL group. XQL treatment also improved the cilia length and elicited a substantial reduction in ciliophagy and LC 3 expression in the tracheal epithelium. Conclusion: XQL can attenuate cilia shortening, aid the clearance function of ciliated epithelial cells, and reduce mucus production in an OVA-induced asthma model in mice.

We studied 30 mild acute COPD, 10 mild stable COPD and 15 healthy subjects. 8 -isoprostane and Interleukine- 6 were measured in their breath condensate through immunoassay. Significantly higher concentrations of exhaled 8 -isoprostane and Interleukine- 6 were found in acute COPD patients compared to stable COPD and healthy controls (21. 8 +/- 5. 1 vs. 13. 2 +/- 2. 0 vs. 4. 7 +/- 1. 8 pg/ml and 7. 4 +/- 0. 9 vs. 5. 8 +/- 0. 2 vs. 2. 7 +/- 0. 6 pg/ml, p< 0. 0001). COPD patients treated with SCMC-Lys showed a marked reduction of exhaled 8 -isoprostane and Interleukine- 6 (8. 9 +/- 1. 5 and 4. 6 +/- 0. 8 pg/ml, p< 0. 0001). These findings suggest that there is an increase of 8 -isoprostane and Interleukine- 6 concentrations in the breath condensate of COPD patients compared to healthy controls especially during acute exacerbations of the disease. Moreover, we showed an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of short-term administration of SCMC-Lys in COPD, suggesting the importance of a further placebo-controlled study that should evaluate the effects of this drug...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCigarette/tobacco smoke/biomass fuel-induced {{oxidative}} and aldehyde/carbonyl stress {{are intimately}} {{associated with the}} progression and exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Therefore, targeting systemic and local oxidative stress with antioxidants/redox modulating agents, or boosting the endogenous levels of antioxidants are likely to have beneficial effects in the treatment/management of COPD. Various antioxidant agents, such as thiol molecules (glutathione and mucolytic drugs, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine and N-acystelyn, erdosteine, fudosteine, ergothioneine, and <b>carbocysteine),</b> have been reported to modulate various cellular and biochemical aspects of COPD. These antioxidants have been found to scavenge and detoxify free radicals and oxidants, regulate of glutathione biosynthesis, control nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, and hence inhibiting inflammatory gene expression. Synthetic molecules, such as specific spin traps like α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone, a catalytic antioxidant (ECSOD mimetic), porphyrins (AEOL 10150 and AEOL 10113), and a superoxide dismutase mimetic M 40419, iNOS and myeloperoxidase inhibitors, lipid peroxidation inhibitors/blockers edaravone, and lazaroids/tirilazad have also been shown to have beneficial effects by inhibiting cigarette smoke-induced inflammatory responses and other carbonyl/oxidative stress-induced cellular alterations. A variety of oxidants, free radicals, and carbonyls/aldehydes are implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, it is therefore, possible that therapeutic administration or supplementation of multiple antioxidants and/or boosting the endogenous levels of antioxidants will be beneficial in the treatment of COPD. This review discusses various novel pharmacological approaches adopted to enhance lung antioxidant levels, and various emerging beneficial and/or prophylactic effects of antioxidant therapeutics in halting or intervening the progression of COPD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen {{radicals}} {{are involved in}} many respiratory diseases, including {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). <b>Carbocysteine</b> lysine salt monohydrate (CLS) is a mucoactive drug effective in the treatment of bronchopulmonary diseases characterized by mucus alterations, including COPD. In the present study, the antioxidant activity of CLS was studied in vitro in three different oxygen radical producing systems, i. e. bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) from patients affected by COPD, ultrasound treated human serum and cultured human lung endothelial cells challenged with elastase. METHODS: BAL, exposed or not to different concentrations of CLS (1. 5 - 30 mM), was assayed for free radical content by fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU) or by cytochrome c reduction kinetics. Human serum was treated with ultrasound in {{the presence or absence of}} CLS (1. 5, 2. 5 mM) or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; 4, 5 mM) and assayed for free radical content by FADU. Human endothelial cells cultured in vitro from pulmonary artery were incubated with elastase (0. 3 IU/mL), in the presence or absence of glutathione (GSH; 0. 65 mM) or CLS (0. 16 mM). The supernatant was tested for cytochrome c reduction kinetics whereas cell homogenates were assessed for xanthine oxidase (XO) content by SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: Results showed that CLS is more effective as an in vitro scavenger in comparison to GSH and NAC. CLS reduced the damage of DNA from healthy donors exposed to COPD-BAL and was able to quench clastogenic activity induced in human serum by exposure to ultrasound at concentrations as low as 2. 5 mM. NAC protect DNA from radical damage, starting from 5 mM. In human lung endothelial cells cultured in presence of elastase, CLS (0. 16 mM) decreased xanthine oxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CLS could act by interfering with the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase into superoxide-producing xanthine oxidase. The antioxidant activity of CLS could contribute to its therapeutic activity by reducing radical damage to different lung structures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Objective: In April 2005 a phase III {{randomized}} {{study was}} started to establish {{which was the}} most effective and safest treatment of cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome and oxidative stress in improving identified primary endpoints: increase of lean body mass, decrease of resting energy expenditure (REE), increase of total daily physical activity, decrease of interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and improvement of fatigue assessed by the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventoty-Short Fom (MFSI-SF). Methods: All patients were given as basic treatment polyphenols plus antioxidant agents alpha-lipoic acid, <b>carbocysteine,</b> and vitamins A, C, and E, all orally. Patients were then randomized to one of the following five arms: 1) medroxyprogesterone acetate/megestrol acetate; 2) pharmacologic nutritional support containing eicosapentaenoic acid; 3) L-carnitine; 4) thalidomide; or 5) medroxyprogesterone acetate/megestrol acetate phis pharmacologic nutritional support Plus L-carnitine plus thalidomide. Treatment duration was 4 mo. The sample comprised 475 patients. Results: By January 2007, 125 patients, well balanced for all clinical characteristics, were included. No severe side effects were observed. As for efficacy, an interim analysis on 125 patients showed an improvement of at least one primary endpoint in arms 3, 4, and 5, whereas arm 2 showed a significant worsening of lean body mass, REE, and MFSI-SF. Analysis of variance comparing the change of primary endpoints between arms showed a significant improvement of REE in favor of arm 5 versus arm 2 and a significant improvement of MFSI-SF in favor of arms 1, 3, and 5 versus arm 2. A significant inferiority of arm 2 versus arms 3, 4, and 5 for the primary endpoints lean body mass, REE, and MFSI-SF was observed on the basis of t test for changes. Conclusion: The interim results obtained thus far seem to suggest that the most effective treatment for cancer-related anorexia/cachexia syndrome and oxidative stress should be a combination regimen. The study is still in progress and the final results should confirm these data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: To {{test the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} an integrated treatment based on a pharmaconutritional support, antioxidants, and drugs, all given orally, in a population of advanced cancer patients with cancer-related anorexia/cachexia and oxidative stress. Patients and Methods: An open early-phase II study was designed according to the Simon two-stage design. The integrated treatment consisted of diet with high polyphenols content (400 mg), antioxidant treatment (300 mg/d alpha-lipoic acid + 2. 7 g/d <b>carbocysteine</b> lysine salt + 400 mg/d vitamin E + 30, 000 IU/d vitamin A + 500 mg/d vitamin C), and pharmaconutritional support enriched with 2 cans per day (n- 3) -PUFA (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), 500 mg/d medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 200 mg/d selective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitor celecoxib. The treatment duration was 4 months. The following variables were evaluated: (a) clinical (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status); W nutritional [lean body mass (LBM), appetite, and resting energy expenditure]; (c) laboratory [proinflammatory cytokines and leptin, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymes]; W quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C 30, Euro QL- 5 D, and MFSI-SF). Results: From July 2002 to January 2005, 44 patients were enrolled. Of these, 39 completed the treatment and were assessable. Body weight increased significantly from baseline as did LBM and appetite. There was an important decrease of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and a negative relationship worthy of note was only found between LBM and IL- 6 changes. As for quality of life evaluation, there was a marked improvement in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C 30, Euro QL- 5 DVAs, and multidimensional fatigue symptom inventory-short form scores. At {{the end of the}} study, 22 of the 39 patients were "responders" or "high responders. " The minimum required was 21; therefore, the treatment was effective and more importantly was shown to be safe.

It is a common, progressive, treatable and {{preventable}} disease. The exacerbation of COPD is associated with the peripheral muscle force, forced expiratory volume in 1  second (FEV 1), the quality of life and mortality. Many studies indicated that the mucoactive medicines could reduce the exacerbations of COPD. This study summarized the efficacy of carbocisteine as a treatment for COPD. Methods: We searched the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) following electronic bibliographic databases: MedLine, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. We additionally searched gray literature database: OpenSIGLE. We also additionally searched the clinical trial registers: ClinicalTrials. gov register and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal. We used RCTs to assess the efficacy of the treatments. We included studies of adults (older than 18  years) with COPD. We excluded studies that were published as protocol or written in non-English language (Number 42016047078). Findings: Our findings included data from four studies involving 1, 357 patients. There was a decrease in the risk of the rate of total number of exacerbations with carbocisteine compared with placebo (- 0. 43; 95 % confidence interval [CI] - 0. 57, - 0. 29, P< 0. 01). Carbocisteine could also {{improve the quality of life}} (- 6. 29; 95 % CI - 9. 30, - 3. 27) and reduce the number of patients with at least one exacerbation (0. 86; 95 % CI 0. 78, 0. 95) compared with placebo. There was no significant difference in the FEV 1 and adverse effects and the rate of hospitalization. Interpretation: Long-term use of carbocisteine (500  mg TID) may be associated with lower exacerbation rates, the smaller number of patients with at least one exacerbation and higher quality of life of patients with COPD.

40|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{may lead}} to oxidative stress (OS) in cancer patients. The first one is the altered energy metabolism which may account for symptoms such as anorexia/cachexia, nausea and vomiting which prevent a normal nutrition and thereby a normal supply of nutrients such as glucose, proteins and vitamins, leading eventually to accumulation of free radicals, which are known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals and others. The second mechanism is a nonspecific chronic activation {{of the immune system}} with an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn may increase the ROS production. Indeed, a chronic inflammatory condition associated with increased OS has been suggested as one of the triggering mechanisms behind the tumor-induced immune suppression. A third mechanism {{may be the result of}} antineoplastic drugs administration: many of these drugs, particularly alkylating agents and cisplatin, are able to produce an excess of ROS and therefore lead to OS. In turn, OS plays a significant role in inducing and worsening cancer cachexia. Consistent experimental and clinical data indicate that OS is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia, although the extent of its contributory role remains to be established. Therefore, OS should be addressed when developing a therapeutic approach for cachectic cancer patients. To counteract ROS and OS several approaches have been tried both in experimental systems and in humans. Among the most used antioxidant agents there are alpha lipoic acid, cysteine-containing compounds, amifostine, reduced glutathione(GSH) and vitamins. Antioxidant vitamins, which include vitamin C, are hypothesized to decrease cancer risk and prevent cancer progression by trapping organic free radicals and/or deactivating reactive oxygen molecules. Indeed, in our previous experimental and clinical studies in advanced-stage cancer patients we demonstrated: 1) the ability of antioxidant agents alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and N-acetyl cisteine (NAC) to restore in vitro several important T cell functions, and 2) the ability of different antioxidant agents, including vitamin C, used alone or in combination, to reduce in vivo ROS levels and to increase the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. In particular, in two recent studies vitamin C was used as a part of an antioxidant treatment in a combined treatment approach for cancer cachexia. In the first, a Phase II study, the combined treatment approach consisting of antioxidants, including Vitamin C, pharmaconutritional support, progestagen, and an anti-cyclooxygenase- 2, resulted in a significant improvement of symptoms of cancer cachexia. In the second, a phase III randomised study, all patients received a basic antioxidant treatment including Vitamin C plus polyphenols, alpha-lipoic acid, <b>carbocysteine,</b> and vitamins A and E, all orally. Patients were then randomized to one of the following five arms: 1) medroxyprogesterone acetate/megestrol acetate; 2) pharmacologic nutritional support containing eicosapentaenoic acid; 3) L-carnitine; 4) thalidomide; or 5) medroxyprogesterone acetate/megestrol acetate plus pharmacologic nutritional support plus L-carnitine plus thalidomide.

40|$|We {{carried out}} an open, non-randomized phase II study {{including}} all patients treated with whatever chemotherapy or combined modality regimen for whatever cancer {{who were in}} clinical objective response (complete response, CR, or partial response, PR) or stable disease (SD). The treatment consisted of administration of recombinant interleukin- 2 (rIL- 2) at a dose of 1. 8 MIU subcutaneously three times/week (every other day) for the first 2 weeks of every month plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 500 mg/day every other day plus antioxidant agents alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg/day and N-acetyl cysteine 1800 mg/day or <b>carbocysteine</b> lysine salt oral solution 2. 7 g/day. The treatment was administered for 1 year except when progression of disease occurred. The primary study endpoints were to define clinical outcome, i. e. duration of response, survival (overall survival, OS and progression-free survival, PFS), the toxicity profile, and the evaluation of quality of life (QL). As secondary endpoints, we measured the changes of lymphocyte count, serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, IL- 2, C-reactive protein (CRP) and leptin, blood levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, GPx and superoxide dismertase, SOD). From July 1998 to June 2003, 42 patients {{were enrolled in the}} study (M/F ratio, 39 / 3; mean age, 62. 5 years). Twenty (47. 6 %) patients were elderly (> 65 years). The majority of patients had either head and neck cancer or lung cancer, 88 % had locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis, and 76 % had ECOG 0. Forty patients were previously treated with chemotherapy (27 also with radiotherapy), two with IL- 2 and interfiron (IFN), one with endocrine therapy and one with only surgery. We obtained an objective response to maintenance treatment of 50 %. Median duration of response was 19 months and median PFS was 33 months. Median duration of maintenance treatment was 12 months, median follow-up duration from diagnosis to June 2003 was 40 months, and median follow-up duration from study entry to June 2003 was 17 months. The median overall survival has not been reached. Toxicity was negligible. As for QL, a significant improvement of cognitive functions was observed, whereas all other functioning and symptom scales did not change significantly. As for laboratory parameters, absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly, IL- 6, IL- 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CRP, and fibrinogen decreased significantly whereas IL- 2 and leptin increased significantly after treatment. ROS decreased significantly, whereas GPx increased significantly after treatment. Patients alive at study end showed a significant increase in absolute lymphocyte count, IL- 2, leptin, and GPx and a significant decrease of proinflammatory cytokines, CRP, fibrinogen, and ROS, whereas patients who died before study end exhibited only a significant increase in absolute lymphocyte count, IL- 2, and GPx and a significant decrease of ROS. Long-term combined maintenance therapy with rIL- 2 + MPA + antioxidant agents is feasible, has a very low toxicity, and results in the improvement of clinical outcome, QL, and laboratory parameters...|$|E
