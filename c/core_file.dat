5000|$|HP ARIES (Automatic Re-translation and Integrated Environment Simulation) is a {{software}} dynamic binary translation system that combines fast code interpretation with two phase dynamic translation to transparently and accurately execute HP 9000 HP-UX applications on HP-UX 11i for HP Integrity servers. The ARIES fast interpreter emulates {{a complete set}} of non-privileged PA-RISC instructions with no user intervention. During interpretation, it monitors the application's execution pattern and translates only the frequently executed code into native Itanium code at runtime. ARIES implements two phase dynamic translation, a technique in which translated code in first phase collects runtime profile information which is used during second phase translation to further optimize the translated code. ARIES stores the dynamically translated code in memory buffer called code cache. Further references to translated basic blocks execute directly in the code cache and do not require additional interpretation or translation. The targets of translated code blocks are back-patched to ensure execution takes place in code cache most of the time. At the end of the emulation, ARIES discards all the translated code without modifying the original application. The ARIES emulation engine also implements Environment Emulation which emulates an HP 9000 HP-UX application's system calls, signal delivery, exception management, threads management, emulation of HP GDB for debugging, and <b>core</b> <b>file</b> creation for the application.|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{developers}} face challenges adapting {{software to}} leverage increasingly heterogeneous architectures. Many systems feature nodes that couple multi-core processors with GPU-based computational accelerators, like the NVIDIA Kepler, or many-core coprocessors, like the Intel Xeon Phi. In order to effectively utilize these systems, application developers need to demonstrate an extremely {{high level of}} parallelism while also coping with the complexities of multiple programming paradigms, including MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and OpenACC. This tutorial provides in-depth exploration of parallel debugging and optimization focused on techniques {{that can be used}} with accelerators and coprocessors.

We discuss optimization techniques like profiling, tracing, and cache memory optimization with tools such as Vampir, Scalasca, Tau, CrayPAT, Vtune and the NVIDIA Visual Profiler. Participants have the opportunity to do hands-on GPU and Intel Xeon Phi debugging and profiling. Additionally, up-to-date capabilities in accelerator and coprocessing computing (e. g.

40|$|Sprockets are a {{lightweight}} method for extending the functionality of distributed file systems. They specifically target file systems implemented at user level and small extensions {{that can be}} expressed with up to several hundred lines of code. Each sprocket is akin to a procedure call that runs inside a transaction that is always rolled back on completion, even if sprocket execution succeeds. Sprockets therefore make no persistent changes to file system state; instead, they communicate their result back to the <b>core</b> <b>file</b> system through a restricted format using a shared memory buffer. The file system validates the result and makes any necessary changes if the validations pass. Sprockets use binary instrumentation {{to ensure that a}} sprocket can safely execute file system code without making changes to persistent state. We have implemented sprockets that perform typespecific handling within file systems such as querying application metadata, application-specific conflict resolution, and handling custom devices such as digital cameras. Our evaluation shows that sprockets can be up to an order of magnitude faster to execute than extensions that utilize operating system services such as fork. We also show that sprockets allow fine-grained isolation and, thus, can catch some bugs that a fork-based implementation cannot. ...|$|E
