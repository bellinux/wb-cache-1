50|$|A <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> (or CRF) is a {{paper or}} {{electronic}} questionnaire specifically used in clinical trial research. The <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> is the tool {{used by the}} sponsor of the clinical trial to collect data from each participating patient. All data on each patient participating in a clinical trial are held and/or documented in the CRF, including adverse events.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{traditional}} medical research study, the principal investigator, Research Coordinator, or other study staff conducts {{an interview with}} the research subject and records the information on a paper or electronic <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form.</b> Using IMR, the research subject instead responds to a questionnaire without the guidance of a research staff member, often performing the action at a time and place disassociated with the research clinic, using only a computer connected to the internet and a standard browser.|$|E
5000|$|A source {{document}} is a document in which data collected for a clinical trialis first recorded. These data are usually later {{entered in the}} <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form.</b> The ICH-GCP guidelines define {{source document}}s as [...] "original documents, data, and records." [...] Source documents contain source data, which is defined as [...] "all information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{clinical}} {{data management}} system or CDMS {{is a tool}} used in clinical research to manage the data of a clinical trial. The clinical trial data gathered at the investigator site in the <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> are stored in the CDMS. To reduce the possibility of errors due to human entry, the systems employ various means to verify the data. Systems for clinical data management can be self-contained {{or part of the}} functionality of a CTMS. A CTMS with clinical data management functionality can help with the validation of clinical data as well as helps the site employ for other important activities like building patient registries and assist in patient recruitment efforts.|$|E

5000|$|The PI is {{responsible}} for the conduct of the trial, however, [...] "it has been said that the CRC is {{the heart and soul of}} the research study and that, ultimately, it is the CRC who carries forward the research goals, thereby playing a significant role in the success of the research study. Most importantly, CRCs are often involved in essential duties that have been traditionally performed by the PI, such as conducting the informed consent process and ensuring compliance with the protocol." [...] The CRC's primary responsibility, as with all clinical research professionals, is the protection of human subjects, but the CRC has many other responsibilities. Although not inclusive, some of the CRC responsibilities include preparing the Institutional Review Board submission, writing the informed consent document, working with the institutional official in contract negotiations, developing a detailed cost analysis, negotiating the budget with the Sponsor (i.e., pharmaceutical company or granting agency), subject recruitment, patient care, adverse event reporting, preparing the <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> (CRF), submitting CRFs and other data to the Sponsor as necessary and study close-out.|$|E
50|$|The <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> (CRF) is {{the data}} {{collection}} tool for the clinical trial and can be paper or electronic. Paper CRFs will be printed, often using No Carbon Required paper, and shipped to the investigative sites conducting the clinical trial for completion after which they are couriered back to Data Management. Electronic CRFs enable data to be typed directly into fields using a computer and transmitted electronically to Data Management.Design of CRFs needs {{to take into account}} the information required to be collected by the clinical trial protocol and intended to be included in statistical analysis. Where available, standard CRF pages may be re-used for collection of data which is common across most clinical trials e.g. subject demographics.Apart from CRF design, electronic trial design also includes edit check programming. Edit checks are used to fire a query message when discrepant data is entered, to map certain data points from one CRF to the other, to calculate certain fields like Subject's Age, BMI etc.. Edit checks help the investigators to enter the right data right at the moment data is entered and also help in increasing the quality of the Clinical trial data.|$|E

30|$|Clinical patient {{characteristics}} and IHT characteristics were prospectively recorded. Data were collected through a <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> {{in part by}} the porter for nonmedical data and by the resident for medical data and adverse events during IHT. This <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> was created for the study and also included the transport protocol of our ICU. Case report forms were stocked with airway equipment. So for every IHT of ventilated patient, a <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> was distributed by the porter and recovered within 1 hour after patient return to his room when storing airway equipment. All case report forms were recovered by one of the investigators each day.|$|E
30|$|ARDS {{according}} to the Berlin Criteria [6]: The endpoints were assessed using the <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> while in the initial ICU and post-ICU by finding all admissions to departments in Denmark; if the department {{was not able to}} administer mechanical ventilation, it was assumed that the patient was not using mechanical ventilation. If the department could administer mechanical ventilation, the patient chart was located and read to ascertain whether the patient received mechanical ventilation. Radiology was registered in the <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form.</b> Bilateral opaque infiltrates not fully explained by other causes were considered suspicious for ARDS and were combined with the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in the definition. An ICU specialist judged whether the patient had ARDS (acute diagnosis in the <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form).</b>|$|E

30|$|To assess intra-observer reproducibility, a {{research}} assistant (Marianna Dumitrescu) filled twice, at least 2  months apart, the <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> of 100 randomly selected patients. In order to evaluate inter-observer reproducibility, two different observers (Marianna Dumitrescu and Marilyn Gaudreau) filled the <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> of the same 100 patients. The number of MODS identified with Proulx and Goldstein definitions was compared using 2 -by- 2 contingency tables. Concordance rate and kappa score (қ) were calculated to assess intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of MODS diagnosis with both sets of criteria.|$|E
30|$|Data were {{collected}} using an electronic <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form.</b> At {{the initiation of}} SAT, the patient was enrolled, and data {{were collected}} (Additional file 1 : Clinical data collection).|$|E
30|$|The <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> (CRF) was {{developed}} and tested by CH, CG, AG, JDC and Dr J. Millo, together {{with other members of}} the GenOSept Consortium. Variables recorded included demographic, clinical and outcome data. A specific electronic <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>form</b> (eCRF) {{was developed}} by Lincoln, Paris, France, using software developed in collaboration with JDC. The database was password-protected, allowing investigators to enter data into the eCRF online, and included audit trail capability for data entry and subsequent modifications. To minimise errors, logical range checks were in place so that the investigators would be alerted if an attempt was made to enter data values outside the expected ranges.|$|E
50|$|ODM is an XML based {{standard}} {{and it is}} an XML schema that provides number of constructs for modeling electronic <b>Case</b> <b>Report</b> <b>Forms</b> (CRFs). ODM is often combined with Study Data Model standard to more fully model trial arms or trial activities. ODM is also used in sending forms data from a clinical trial system to an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Case</b> <b>report</b> <b>forms</b> contain data {{obtained}} during the patient's {{participation in the}} clinical trial. Before {{being sent to the}} sponsor, this data is usually de-identified (not traceable to the patient) by removing the patient's name, medical record number, etc., and giving the patient a unique study number. The supervising Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversees the release of any personally identifiable data to the sponsor.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEfficient {{communication}} of a clinical study protocol and <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>forms</b> during {{all stages of}} a human clinical study is important for many stakeholders. An electronic and structured study representation format {{that can be used}} throughout the whole study life-span can improve such communication and potentially lower total study costs. The most relevant standard for representing clinical study data, applicable to unregulated as well as regulated studies, is the Operational Data Model (ODM) in development since 1999 by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). ODM’s initial objective was exchange of <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>forms</b> data but it is increasingly utilized in other contexts. An ODM extension called Study Design Model, introduced in 2011, provides additional protocol representation elements. Using a case study approach, we evaluated ODM’s ability to capture all necessary protocol elements during a complete clinical study lifecycle in the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health. ODM offers the advantage of a single format for institutions that deal with hundreds or thousands of concurrent clinical studies and maintain a data warehouse for these studies. For each study stage, we present a list of gaps in the ODM standard and identify necessary vendor or institutional extensions that can compensate for such gaps. The current version of ODM (1. 3. 2) has only partial support for study protocol and study registration data mainly because it is outside the original development goal. ODM provides comprehensive support for representation of <b>case</b> <b>report</b> <b>forms</b> (in both the design stage and with patient level data). Inclusion of requirements of observational, non-regulated or investigator-initiated studies (outside Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation) can further improve future revisions of the standard...|$|R
