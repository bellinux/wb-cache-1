50|$|For miter joints {{occurring}} at angles other than 90°, for materials {{of the same}} cross-section the proper cut angle must be determined so that the two pieces to be joined meet flush (i.e. one piece's mitered end is not longer than the adjoining piece). To find the cut angle divide the angle at which the two pieces meet by two. Technically, two different <b>cut</b> <b>angles</b> are required; one for each piece, where the second angle is 90° plus the aforementioned cut angle, but due to angular limitations in common cutting implements (hand circular saws, table saws) a single angle is required and is used to cut the first piece {{in one direction and}} the second piece in the opposite direction.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} {{theories on}} the [...] "ideal" [...] proportions of a diamond {{have been and}} continue to be advocated by various owners of patents on machines to view how well a diamond is cut. These advocate a shift away from grading cut by the use of various angles and proportions toward measuring the performance of a cut stone. A number of specially modified viewers and machines have been developed toward this end. Hearts and Arrows viewers test for the [...] "hearts and arrows" [...] characteristic pattern observable in stones exhibiting high symmetry and particular <b>cut</b> <b>angles.</b> Closely related to Hearts and Arrows viewers is the ASET which tests for light leakage, light return, and proportions. The ASET (and computer simulations of the ASET) are used to test for AGS cut grade. Proponents of these machines argue they help sellers demonstrate the light performance of the diamond in addition to the traditional 4 Cs. Detractors, however, see these machines as marketing tools rather than scientific ones. The GIA has developed a set of criteria for grading the cut of round brilliant stones that is now the standard in the diamond industry and is called Facetware.|$|E
50|$|The {{side cut}} {{is located at}} the {{intersection}} of the side cut of jack rafters row and the pitch column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = side cut of jack rafters. This corresponds to the side cut on the Steel square. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devises in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a side <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> of 29.07° and a two pitch has a side <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.|$|R

FEA method was used to study the damage propagation and failure properties of stiffened composite panels with discrete-source damage. The influence of discrete-source damage on residual strength of the composite panel was also investigated. It has showed that there is high strain concentration at the notch tip. Based on different failure criteria, FEA method with progressive failure procedure was used to simulate the damage progression and failure procedure of the notched stiffened composite panel effectively. The global models were set up firstly to calculate the stress distribution and evaluate the residual strength of the panels with different <b>cut</b> <b>angles.</b> The local model was set up secondly to simulate the local damage and failure extending both in-plane and interface.

40|$|This paper {{brings out}} {{results of a}} {{measurement}} campaign aiming to determine the temperature coefficients of synthetic quartz elastic constants at liquid helium temperature. The method {{is based on the}} relationship between the resonance frequencies of a quartz acoustic cavity and the elastic constants of the material. The temperature coefficients of the elastic constants are extracted from experimental frequency-temperature data collected from a set of resonators of various <b>cut</b> <b>angles,</b> because of the anisotropy of quartz, measured on the very useful cryogenic range [4 K - 15 K]. The knowledge of these temperature coefficients would allow to further design either quartz temperature sensors or conversely frequency-temperature compensated quartz cuts.

40|$|A semi-intelligent {{excavation}} mechanism {{was developed}} for use with the NASA-built Centaur 2 rover prototype. The excavator features a continuously rotatable large bucket supported between two parallel arms, both of which share a single pivot axis near the excavator base attached to the rover. The excavator {{is designed to simulate}} the collection of regolith, such as on the Moon, and to dump the collected soil into a hopper up to one meter tall for processing to extract oxygen. Because the vehicle can be autonomous and the terrain is generally unknown, there is risk of damaging equipment or using excessive power when attempting to extract soil from dense or rocky terrain. To minimize these risks, it is critical for the rover to sense the digging forces and adjust accordingly. It is also important to understand the digging capabilities and limitations of the excavator. This paper discusses the implementation of multiple strain gages as an embedded force measurement system in the excavator's arms. These strain gages can accurately measure and resolve multi-axial forces on the excavator. In order to validate these sensors and characterize the load capabilities, a series of controlled excavation tests were performed at Glenn Research Center with the excavator at various depths and <b>cut</b> <b>angles</b> while supported by a six axis load cell. The results of these tests are both compared to a force estimation model and used for calibration of the embedded strain gages.
