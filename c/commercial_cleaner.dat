40|$|This work {{reports the}} results from the {{comparative}} evaluation of the global cleaning effectiveness of five graffiti colours (black, yellow, green, red and blue) applied on marble samples. Firstly, the chemical characterization of all the spray paints was performed. The binder was investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR), analytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS); fillers and additives were characterized by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and, finally, pigments and dyes were determined by Raman spectroscopy. All paint colours are composed by alkyd binder in which rutile as filler and a lot of different (inorganic and synthetic organic) pigments/dye are dispersed. In addition, a chemometric multivariate analysis was performed exploiting Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCG) was also applied to FTIR-ATR and FTIR-refl spectra of alkyd, (pure or modified) acrylic spray paints and felt-tip pens, to highlight the differences and similarities between various paint brands. Taking into account the different parameters that may affect the cleaning efficiency, three types of samples were compared in this study: unaged marble samples, aged-marble samples and photochemical aged-paint samples. Three different cleaning approaches were compared in terms of their efficacy and invasiveness in the removal of the paint from the substrate: chemical cleaning, laser cleaning and laser followed by chemical cleaning. In particular, the latter method was expected to be more advantageous based on the preliminary, physical removal of the superficial paint layer, so as to minimize the risk of further colour diffusion into the substrate caused by the solvent-based cleaning performed in the second step. Two commercial products were evaluated in the chemical approach: a <b>commercial</b> <b>cleaner</b> and a pure solvent (methylethylketone) supported on a commercial agar gel. Additionally, laser ablation by means of a Q-switched Nd:YAG at wavelength 1064 nm and 532 nm with different fluence values was also evaluated. A multi-analytical approach was also adopted to assess the cleaning effectiveness and harmfulness to the stone. The cleaning efficiency was evaluated in terms of presence of paint residues on the surface, paint diffusion in the marble and damage to the substrate through FTIR, XRF, laser scanner microprofilometry, optical microscope observation in cross section and colorimetric results. The most difficult paint to remove was the red one (alkyd-amino resin). Conoscopic measurements showed the negligible harmfulness of the laser ablation on unaged marble. The combined approach laser followed by chemical cleaning proved the most efficient method in all cases. However, all the cleaning approaches resulted less effective on aged materials (marble or paint) than on unaged ones, due to paint penetration (in the aged marble) and, probably, to the increased polarity (in the aged-paints) ...|$|E

The concept presented comprises a miniaturized dip-sensor for enabling automated on-line testing. In this way, the effect of formulation, concentration and temperature on the cleaning behaviour of various surfactants and <b>commercial</b> <b>cleaners</b> is investigated. For this purpose, the decladded core of an optical fibre was sputtered with gold and afterwards coated with defined layers of stearic acid or animal fat to obtain a kind of model dirtiness. The deposition of stearic acid was performed using a Langmuir Blodgett through, and the sensor followed on-line the deposition of the respective monolayers by UV/VIS spectroscopy, appearing as a distinct and constant shift in wavelength. Moreover, functional coatings were applied above the gold layer to achieve a variation of the hydrophilicity of the sensor surface. The SPR sensor proved to be easy to use, accurate and flexible. It offers a new solution that could replace the existing methods for detergency sensing and with a customized design it could be a useful industry tool since the small size of the dip sensor promises massive testing.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop an economical method of reducing the toxicity of process wastewater from a facility formulating industrial and <b>commercial</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Since the wastewater was discharged to a sewer system and eventually treated in an activated sludge plant, influent toxicity as measured by the Microtox ® test, was of concern to the recipient publicly owned treatment works (POTW). The major source of toxicity was suspected to be nonylphenol-based, ethoxylated surfactants. The pretreatment schemes investigated included powdered activated carbon (PAC) addition in batch tests and activated sludge treatment in continuous flow reactors, with and without activated carbon addition. The average carbon dose required for reduction of toxicity to the target value of ECИГ of 30 % in batch PAC treatment, was 31, 000 mg/l. Biological activated sludge treatment was not capable of reducing toxicity to the required level. High and variable fixed dissolved solids (22, 000 mg/l, on average) in the process wastewater contributed to the poor performance of the activated sludge. Addition of activated carbon to the biological reactors (PACT) was effective in stabilizing biological system performance. The carbon dose required to achieve the target effluent toxicity was 2, 000 mg/l. This is an order of magnitude less than powdered carbon alone thus, demonstrating the economic benefits of the combined biological and activated carbon treatments...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{effectiveness}} of legislation introduced to provide continuity of employment for contract workers in the service sector, during the sale or transfer of a business. A review of minimum standards in 2001 found that workers were materially and psychologically disadvantaged {{by the process of}} contracting out. This study is about whether the subsequent law for specific service workers called Continuity of employment if employees’ work affected by restructuring achieved that outcome. Such a study has not been undertaken to date. The thesis consists of a theoretically-driven narrative, in which the practice of contracting out is explored {{within the context of the}} new social democracy in New Zealand. The theory of risk society and the third way contribute to a critique of the institutionalized individualism of modern society. This critique is supported by stories from nine <b>commercial</b> <b>cleaners</b> and hospital kitchen workers who share recent experiences of a change of contract. These stories serve to illustrate the effectiveness of the new law. The experiences of these workers are gathered through conversations held in interviews and focus groups and provide a link between theory, history and the reality of the frontline. The study concludes that the destiny of contract workers is tied as much to the policy nest in which the employment protection law resides, as the subsequent legislative amendment. The risk of disadvantage to contract workers is linked as much to the processes of institutionalized individualism in modern society and the freedoms incorporated into the Employment Relations Act 2000, as to the new minimum standard providing continuity of employment for workers. I conclude that the existing protections for vulnerable workers are fragile and without minimum entitlements that ensure workers have the capability to access those rights, the risk of material and psychological disadvantage remains high...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Cover crops {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a vital component of conservation agriculture. However, cover crops must produce substantial biomass to be effective. Because of {{the large amount of}} residue produced by many cover crops, they must be managed appropriately to avoid planting problems. Roller‐crimpers have been used to manage cover crops by flattening them and creating a thick mat over the soil surface. A study was conducted to determine the effect of different rolling directions (parallel, diagonal, and perpendicular to cotton planting direction) using a roller/crimper, three different <b>commercial</b> row <b>cleaners</b> (Dawn, Dawn without coulter, and Yetter), and no row cleaner on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) stand, emergence rate, yield, and net returns. The study was conducted at two Alabama locations with a replicated strip plot design. Presented results illustrate two growing and harvest seasons (2004 and 2005). Rye (Secale cereale L.) was chosen as the cover crop due to its potential to produce large amounts of biomass and its popularity with Alabama producers. Rye was rolled at the soft dough growth stage and terminated using Roundup (glyphosate). Data showed that parallel rolling with respect to the planting direction for cotton produced the highest cotton stand and yield in both years. In 2004, the Yetter row cleaner resulted in higher cotton stand and yield for both locations when compared with the Dawn row cleaner.
