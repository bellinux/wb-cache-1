5|$|Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J. Becher, and {{modified}} by the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl by 1731, phlogiston theory stated that all <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> {{were made of}} two parts. One part, called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was burned, while the dephlogisticated part {{was thought to be}} its true form, or calx.|$|E
5|$|Highly <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> {{that leave}} little residue, such as wood or coal, {{were thought to}} be made mostly of phlogiston; {{non-combustible}} substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.|$|E

40|$|Studies on the {{accumulation}} of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> in native forests and plantations are mainly important tool for estimating the risk of forest fires. This study aimed to {{determine the amount of}} <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> in forest stands and in the remaining rain forest located in the municipality of Areia, in Brejo of Paraiba. The collection of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> was carried out in plots of 1 m ², randomly selected areas. The fuel accumulated in the different areas were classified according to the physiological state of alive and dead. The largest amount of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> was obtained {{in the area of the}} Atlantic with 19. 47 Mg ha- 1. The amount of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> alive did not differ between the studied areas...|$|R

5|$|Sardinia and Libya {{were already}} conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus cast anchor off the Promontorium Mercurii, now Cap Bon, {{opposite}} Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Geiseric requested Basiliscus {{to allow him}} five days to draw up the conditions of a peace. During the negotiations, Geiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with <b>combustible</b> <b>materials.</b> During the night, these fire ships were propelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels.|$|E
5|$|Welders {{are also}} often exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. GMAW produces smoke containing particles {{of various types}} of oxides, {{and the size of}} the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, carbon dioxide and ozone gases can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Furthermore, because the use of compressed gases in GMAW pose an explosion and fire risk, some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air and keeping <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> away from the workplace.|$|E
5|$|Welders {{are often}} exposed to {{dangerous}} gases and particulate matter. Processes like flux-cored arc welding and shielded {{metal arc welding}} produce smoke containing particles of various types of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. This is because smaller particles {{have the ability to}} cross the blood–brain barrier. Fumes and gases, such as carbon dioxide, ozone, and fumes containing heavy metals, can be dangerous to welders lacking proper ventilation and training. Exposure to manganese welding fumes, for example, even at low levels (<0.2 mg/m3), may lead to neurological problems or to damage to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or central nervous system. Nano particles can become trapped in the alveolar macrophages of the lungs and induce pulmonary fibrosis. The use of compressed gases and flames in many welding processes poses an explosion and fire risk. Some common precautions include limiting the amount of oxygen in the air, and keeping <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> away from the workplace.|$|E

5|$|As the 18 fireships {{prepared}} in Britain by Mulgrave {{had not yet}} departed {{by the time of}} Cochrane's arrival with the fleet, the captain responding by converting his own over the following week. A number of chasse-marées carrying tar and resin perfect for this role had been captured by the blockade, and Cochrane requisitioned eight military transport ships from the fleet reserve for conversion using these materials. The frigate-storeship HMS Mediator was taken over to be the centrepiece of the attack force. These vessels were laden with explosives and <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> such as rum-soaked hay, and crewed by volunteers from the fleet. On three of the vessels Cochrane had loaded 1,500 barrels of gunpowder, topped by hundreds of artillery shells and thousands of grenades to create an explosion ship, a floating bomb of his own design intended to detonate {{right in the middle of}} the French line. During this process an attack by French boats on the fireships was driven off, with two British sailors killed and one wounded, and on 5 April Cochrane reconnoitered the approaches to Aix Roads, firing shots at the forts and fleet to gauge their responses. He subsequently wrote to Mulgrave suggesting that with an expeditionary force of 20,000 he could seize the defences overlooking the anchorage, sink blockships in the channel and thereby permanently deprive the French of one of their most important naval bases, although his letter was ignored.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of thermal stability in a stockpile of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> is considered. The <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> is any carbon containing material that can react with oxygen {{trapped in a}} stockpile due to exothermic chemical reaction. The complicated process is modelled in a sphere and one-dimensional energy equation is used to solve the problem. The semi-implicit finite difference method (FDM) is applied to tackle the nonlinear differential equation governing the problem. Graphical solutions are displayed to describe effects of embedded kinetic parameters on {{the temperature of the}} system...|$|R
50|$|A {{fire and}} {{explosion}} hazard caused by sparks or hot particles exists everywhere where <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> is machined or processed, transported, filtered or dried. A spark extinguishing system can prevent fires and dust explosions.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} inside cement kilns, combined with the oxidising (oxygen-rich) atmosphere and long residence times, cement kilns are used as a processing option for various types of waste streams: indeed, they efficiently destroy many hazardous organic compounds. The waste streams also often contain <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> which allow the substitution of part of the fossil fuel normally used in the process.|$|E
25|$|Mindful {{of these}} two disasters, the current {{building}} was designed by the New York City firm of Child & DeGroll to be as fireproof as possible, using less <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> like iron and brick. It opened in 1896. Four years later, in 1900, the jail wing {{was added to the}} west. That has been the only significant addition or alteration to the building.|$|E
25|$|The <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> used on Grenfell Tower were {{considerably}} {{cheaper than}} non-combustible alternatives would have been. There {{appear to have}} been intense cost pressures over the Grenfell refurbishment. In June 2017 it was stated the project team chose cheaper cladding that saved £293,368, after the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation mentioned in an email the need for “good costs for Cllr Fielding Mellen ”.|$|E

25|$|The book is {{primarily}} {{designed for use}} by counterterrorism and law enforcement officials. Terrorist Recognition Handbook is structured into six main sections of information and resources. Appendix resources include explanations of <b>combustible</b> <b>materials,</b> a reference to existing terrorist networks, {{and a list of}} works cited. Nance's main thesis throughout the work is that law enforcement officials must remain vigilant for potential terrorist activities. He compares and contrasts the field of counterterrorism to ordinary criminal prevention, noting that in both cases law enforcement officials should become experts on developing awareness of commons behavior patterns of suspects.|$|E

25|$|Stevens sold Anne Galley to the Royal Navy on 22 June 1739 for £1,209 and {{a further}} £87 for ship's stores. On 3 July Anne Galley arrived at Deptford Dockyard for fitting {{out as a}} fire ship. Conversion {{to the role of}} fire ship involverd the {{construction}} of compartments in her hold for the storage of gunpowder and other <b>combustible</b> <b>materials,</b> and the cutting of a series of small chimneys into her deck to help ventilate fires set below. The eight lower deck gun ports had their hinges changed so they would fall open when their supporting ropes had burned through, further fanning any flames. Lastly, she received eight ½-pounder swivel guns along the upper deck railings for anti-personnel use.|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} for the strongly exothermic decomposition of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> are discussed in this paper. <b>Combustible</b> <b>material</b> uniformly distributed between symmetrically heated parallel plates under Sensitized, Arrhenius and Bimolecular reaction rates are also discussed neglecting consumption of material. Approximate analytical expressions of steady state temperature fields are derived by using Homotopy analysis method (HPM) for various values of relevant dimensionless parameters. Analytical results are compounded with perturbation technique and numerical simulation. Analytical results are coinciding with numerical simulation and agreement is noted. The present method simple, less computational and applicable for solving strongly non-linear initial and boundary value problems.

50|$|Because of its extreme {{oxidizing}} potential, T-Stoff was a {{very dangerous}} chemical to handle, so special rubberized suits were required when working with it, as it would react with most cloth, leather, or other <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> and cause it to spontaneously combust.|$|R
25|$|Class 4 is {{the highest}} and most {{dangerous}} class of laser, including all lasers that exceed the Class3B AEL. By definition, a class4 laser can burn the skin, or cause devastating and permanent eye damage {{as a result of}} direct, diffuse or indirect beam viewing. These lasers may ignite <b>combustible</b> <b>materials,</b> and thus may represent a fire risk. These hazards may also apply to indirect or non-specular reflections of the beam, even from apparently matte surfaces meaning that great care must be taken to control the beam path. Class4 lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock. Most industrial, scientific, military, and medical lasers are in this category. Medical lasers can have divergent emissions and require awareness of nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and nominal ocular hazard area (NOHA).|$|E
25|$|Some archaeologists {{believe that}} ancients made shrouds of asbestos, wherein they burned {{the bodies of}} their kings, in order to {{preserve}} only their ashes, and prevent them being mixed with those of wood or other <b>combustible</b> <b>materials</b> commonly used in funeral pyres. Others assert that the ancients used asbestos to make perpetual wicks for sepulchral or other lamps. A famous example is the golden lamp asbestos lychnis, which the sculptor Callimachus made for the Erechtheion. In more recent centuries, asbestos was indeed used for this purpose. Although asbestos causes skin to itch upon contact, ancient literature indicates that it was prescribed for diseases of the skin, and particularly for the itch. It is possible that they used the term asbestos for soapstone, because the two terms have often been confused throughout history.|$|E
25|$|As New York City's World Trade Center {{collapsed}} {{following the}} September 11 attacks, Lower Manhattan was blanketed {{in a mixture}} of building debris and <b>combustible</b> <b>materials.</b> This complex mixture gave rise to the concern that thousands of residents and workers in the area would be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos, lead, glass fibers, and pulverized concrete. More than 1,000 tons of asbestos are thought to have been released into the air following the buildings' destruction. Inhalation of a mixture of asbestos and other toxicants is thought to be linked to the unusually high death rate from cancer of emergency service workers since the disaster. Thousands more are now thought to be at risk of developing cancer due to this exposure with those who have died so far being only the 'tip of the iceberg'. Some commentators have criticised authorities for using asbestos in the buildings' construction.|$|E
30|$|Yunnan’s yearly {{variation}} in wildfire (Fig.  2 b) is considerable, {{because there is}} a very strong connection between the number of wildfire ignitions and drought. Severe droughts in winter and spring, early summer, or midsummer occurred continuously from 2003 to 2007. The drought {{in the spring and summer}} of 2005 and the spring drought in 2006 were the most severe droughts in the last 50 and 20  years, respectively. Frequent droughts yielded a continuous increase in the wildfire ignition number from 2003 to 2006. We speculate that there are three reasons for the unexpected decrease of wildfire ignitions in 2007 : (1) the winter and spring droughts were obviously less severe than those in 2005 and 2006; (2) the spring drought in 2006 caused two wildfires and consumed a great deal of the <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> in the forests, while the drought suppressed the germination and growth of forest plants and further reduced the amount of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> in the forests; and (3) the reduction of <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> that resulted from the abundant wildfires in 2003 – 2005 cannot be ignored. In contrast, the severe freezing rain and snow events in early 2008 greatly reduced the number of winter wildfires, at the same time that winter moisture reduced the number of spring wildfires to the same level observed in 2003. Yet these precipitation events also produced unprecedented amounts of <b>combustible</b> <b>material,</b> which led to a large increase in the number of wildfires in subsequent years. This wildfire increase was enhanced by the spring and summer drought in 2009 and the severe once-in-a-century drought in 2010.|$|R
25|$|The unburnable solid {{remains of}} a <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> left after a fire is called clinker if its melting point is below the flame temperature, so that it fuses and then solidifies as it cools, and ash if its melting point is above the flame temperature.|$|R
50|$|Land management: The grazing of {{livestock}} is sometimes {{used as a}} way to control weeds and undergrowth. For example, in areas prone to wildfires, goats and sheep are set to graze on dry scrub which removes <b>combustible</b> <b>material</b> and reduces the risk of fires.|$|R
