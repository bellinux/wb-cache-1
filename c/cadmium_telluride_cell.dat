40|$|A {{photovoltaic}} cell {{is designed to}} convert sunlight into electrical energy through the photoelectric effect. Solar cells are the most attractive source to harness solar energy; {{it is not only}} has high efficiency, but also protect our environment from pollution and producing zero greenhouse effect. There have been numerous studies on <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> (CdTe) compound in solar cell research. These studies have shown that CdTe can provide a good efficiency and yet be cost effective. This paper presents the investigation of <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> solar <b>cells</b> structure by using MATLAB software. Some important parameters such as drift component, diffusion component, thickness, and the efficiency of the <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> layer were investigated. The study concludes that in order to achieve an efficiency of 28 - 30 %, the thickness of the CdTe layer, the uncompensated acceptor concentration and carrier lifetime should be ≥ 12 µm, ≥ 1016 cm- 3 and ≥ 10 - 11 s respectively...|$|R

The cadmium chloride activation treatment of <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> solar <b>cells</b> is essential for producing high efficiency devices. The treatment has many effects but the most significant is the complete removal of stacking faults in the <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> grains and the diffusion of Chlorine along the grain boundaries of the device. Chlorine decorates all <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> and <b>cadmium</b> sulphide grain boundaries and also builds up along the CdTe/CdS junction.. This paper reveals that by annealing devices to temperatures of 400 ºC to 480 ºC for times ranging from 30 to 600 seconds in moderate vacuum results in the re-appearance of stacking faults {{and the removal of}} Choline from the grain boundaries. STEM analysis confirms the re-appearance of the stacking faults and SIMS and EDX confirm the removal of chlorine from the grain boundaries. This directly corresponds to a lowering in cell efficiency. The study provides further evidence that CdCl 2 diffusion and certain microstructural defects directly affect the performance of <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> photovoltaic devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a combined solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric generator (TEG) system is examined using an analytical model for four different types of commercial PVs and a commercial bismuth telluride TEG. The TEG is applied directly {{on the back of}} the PV, so that the two devices have the same temperature. The PVs considered are crystalline Si (c-Si), amorphous Si (a-Si), copper indium gallium (di) selenide (CIGS) and <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> (CdTe) <b>cells.</b> The degradation of PV performance with temperature is shown to dominate the increase in power produced by the TEG, due to the low efficiency of the TEG. For c-Si, CIGS and CdTe PV cells the combined system produces a lower power and has a lower efficiency than the PV alone, whereas for an a-Si cell the total system performance may be slightly increased by the TEG.

Although the cadmium chloride treatment is an essential process for high efficiency thin film <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> photovoltaic devices, the precise mechanisms involved that improve the <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> layer are not fully understood. The treatment parameters have a narrow window, deviating from these even slightly can be detrimental to cell performance. In this investigation we apply advanced microstructural characterization techniques to {{study the effects of}} varying two parameters: the temperature of the substrate during the cadmium chloride treatment and the length of time of the treatment. In both cases, the devices have been deliberately over-treated. The effect of the over-treatment on the microstructure of <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> solar <b>cells,</b> deposited by close spaced sublimation is investigated and related to cell performance. A range of techniques has been used to observe the changes to the microstructure as well as the chemical and crystallographic changes as a function of treatment parameters. Electrical tests that link the device performance with the microstructural properties of the cells have also been undertaken. Techniques used include Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for sub-grain analysis, EDX for chemical analysis and XPS for composition-depth profiling...|$|R
50|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} <b>cadmium</b> in <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> solar <b>cells</b> (CdTe is only used in a few types of PV panels). Cadmium in its metallic form is a toxic substance that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5-10 g/m²) and with proper emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3-0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions actually arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh. Note that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cadmium</b> Zinc <b>Telluride</b> (CdxZn 1 -xTe or CZT) is a ternary {{semiconductor}} with a tunable bandgap of 1. 44 - 2. 26 eV. Solar cells with efficiencies of 20 % or higher {{can be achieved}} by using a tandem solar cell structure which consists of a top cell and a bottom cell connected in series. In this kind of a structure, the light passes through the top cell first which has a wider bandgap to absorb light of shorter wavelengths and the remaining light passes through the bottom cell with a lower bandgap to absorb light of higher wavelengths. For a tandem cell structure, the ideal bandgap for the top and bottom cell is 1. 7 eV and 1 eV respectively. <b>Cadmium</b> Zinc <b>Telluride</b> is a suitable candidate for the top cell and Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide (CIGS) with a bandgap of around 1 eV is a suitable candidate for the bottom cell. This work involves characterization and optimization of CZT solar cells by Close Spaced Sublimation (CSS). <b>Cadmium</b> Zinc <b>Telluride</b> is deposited by the co sublimation of <b>Cadmium</b> <b>Telluride</b> (CdTe) and Zinc <b>Telluride</b> (ZnTe) chunks. <b>Cadmium</b> Zinc <b>Telluride</b> solar <b>cells</b> were fabricated using Tin Oxide (SnOâ), Zinc Oxide (ZnO) and Zinc Stannate (ZnâSnOâ) films as substrates.

The aim of this investigation is to apply advanced microstructural characterization techniques to study {{the effect of the}} cadmium chloride treatment on the physical properties of <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> solar <b>cells</b> deposited via close-spaced sublimation (CSS) and relate these to cell performance. A range of techniques have been used to observe the microstructural changes as well as the chemical changes before and after cadmium chloride treatment. Electrical measurements that link the device performance with the microstructural properties of the cells have also been undertaken. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) has revealed high densities of stacking faults in the as-grown CdTe samples. Further, it has been observed that these stacking faults are removed during the cadmium chloride treatment. These observations show that the presence of chlorine {{plays an important role in}} the removal of these defects and the subsequent production of high efficiency thin film CdTe solar cells. Elemental analysis in the TEM indicates chlorine rich regions appearing at the CdTe/CdS interface as well as at grain boundaries after the treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractModern {{technology}} {{makes use}} {{of a variety of}} materials to allow for its proper functioning. To explore in detail the relationships connecting materials to the products that require them, we map supply chains for five product platforms (a <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> solar <b>cell,</b> a germanium solar cell, a turbine blade, a lead acid battery, and a hard drive (HD) magnet) using a data ontology that specifies the supply chain actors (nodes) and linkages (e. g., material exchange and contractual relationships) among them. We then propose a set of network indicators (product complexity, producer diversity, supply chain length, and potential bottlenecks) to assess the situation for each platform in the overall supply chain networks. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) the turbine blade displays a high product complexity, defined by the material linkages to the platform; (2) the germanium solar cell is produced by only a few manufacturers globally and requires more physical transformation steps than do the other project platforms; (3) including production quantity and sourcing countries in the assessment shows that a large portion of nodes of the supply chain of the hard-drive magnet are located in potentially unreliable countries. We conclude by discussing how the network analysis of supply chains could be combined with criticality and scenario analyses of abiotic raw materials to comprise a comprehensive picture of product platform risk...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a study of several thin film semiconductor structures of practical technological use either presently or in the near future. The first system studied is an ultra thin film single crystal gallium arsenide layer. The absorption spectra of these layers are measured and transitions at both the F- point and L-point of the Brillouin Zone are observed, the latter are not normally measurable in thicker layers. The observed shift in the F-point absorption edge is attributed to contributions from the Franz-Keldysh Effect and the Moss-Burstein Effect. The temperature dependence of the L-point energy gap is measured and compared with previous data. The next system investigated is an n-type porous silicon layer coated with p-type polyaniline. Both photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectra and the electrical characteristics have been measured for this system. The interface between the two layers {{is found to be}} a rectifying junction consistent with a potential barrier formed at the interface. In forward bias, it is possible to generate electroluminescence in the visible and near infra red regions. The final structure studied is a thin film <b>cadmium</b> sulphide-cadmium <b>telluride</b> solar <b>cell</b> structure. The cells are found to have a low efficiency of around 1 % as grown, but a process of treatment with cadmium chloride and annealing in air improves this by a factor of approximately ten. Photoluminescence measurements on the back surface of the <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> revealed three major emission bands at 1. 59 eV, 1. 55 eV and 1. 45 eV. By varying temperature and incident laser power, attempts at assigning the bands to specific impurity centres in the <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> is made Using a novel bevelling etch technique to prepare samples, depth dependent measurement of the photoluminescence is possible. This reveals that the major changes associated with the improvement in efficiencies occurs at the interface between the CdS and the CdTe...|$|R

30|$|Inorganic {{thin film}} solar cells have {{received}} much attention {{owing to the}} advantages of being low cost and lightweight as compared to their silicon counterparts [1, 2]. They are chemically and physically stable in air in contrast to organic and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells and have achieved very long operating lifetimes under practical settings [3 – 5]. Among them, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS)-based and <b>cadmium</b> <b>telluride</b> (CdTe)-based solar <b>cells</b> are promising and have realized a conversion efficiency of 21.7 % and 19.6 % [6, 7], respectively. In recent years, another candidate material Cu 2 ZnSnSxSe 4 [*]−[*]x (CZTSSe) has been investigated as it is earth-abundant and has an environment-friendly composition [8, 9]. Although an impressive conversion efficiency of 12.6 % has been achieved by a hydrazine-based solution process, this compound encountered complexities in terms of phase and defect control [10]. Additionally, the toxicity of hydrazine has seriously limited its further application [11 – 13]. Recently, binary antimony sulfide (Sb 2 S 3) has gained importance as a thin film solar cell application, owing to its earth abundance, low cost, and the relatively low toxic composition of Sb and S elements [14, 15].|$|R

40|$|The global {{adoption}} {{and use of}} photovoltaic modules (PVMs) as {{the main source of}} energy is the key to realising the UN Millennium Development Goals on Green Energy. The technology – projected to contribute about 20 % of world energy supply by 2050, over 60 % by 2100 and leading to 50 % reduction in global CO 2 emissions – is threatened by its poor performance in tropical climate. Such performance discourages its regional acceptance. The magnitude of crucial module performance influencing factors (cell temperature, wind speed and relative humidity) reach critical values of 90 °C, 0. 2 m/s and 85 %, respectively in tropical climates which negatively impact module performance indices which include power output (PO), power conversion efficiency (PCE) and energy payback time (EPBT). This investigation reviews PVM technologies which include cell, contact and interconnection technologies. It identifies critical technology route(s) with potential to increase operational reliability of PVMs in the tropics when adopted. The cell performance is measured by PO, PCE and EPBT while contacts and interconnections performance is measured by the degree of recombination, shading losses and also the rate of thermo-mechanical degradation. It is found that the mono-crystalline cell has the best PCE of 25 % while the <b>Cadmium</b> <b>Telluride</b> (CdTe) <b>cell</b> has the lowest EPBT of 8 -months. Results show that the poly-crystalline cell has the largest market share amounting to 54 %. The CdTe cell exhibits 0 % drop in PCE at high-temperatures and low irradiance operations – demonstrating least affected PO by the conditions. Further results establish that back contacts and back-to-back interconnection technologies produce the least recombination losses and demonstrate absence of shading in addition to possessing longest interconnection fatigue life. Based on these findings, the authors propose a PVM comprising CdTe cell, back contacts and back-to-back interconnection technologies as the technology with latent capacity to produce improved performance in tropical climates...|$|R
