40|$|Abstract Background <b>Contracting</b> <b>in</b> {{private sector}} is {{promoted}} in developing countries facing human resources shortages {{as a challenge to}} reduce maternal mortality. This study explored provision, practice, performance, barriers to execution and views about <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> specialists for emergency obstetric care (EmOC) in rural India. Methods Facility survey was conducted in all secondary and tertiary public health facilities (44) in three heterogeneous districts in Maharashtra state of India. Interviews (42) were conducted with programme managers and district and block level officials and with public and private EmOC specialists. Locations of private obstetricians in the study districts were identified and mapped. Results Two schemes, namely Janani Suraksha Yojana and Indian Public Health standards (IPHS) provided for <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> EmOC specialists. The IPHS provision was chosen for use mainly due to greater sum for <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> (US $ 30 /service episode vs. 300 US$/month). The positions of EmOC specialists were vacant in 83 % of all facilities that hence had a potential for <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> EmOC specialists. Private specialists were <b>contracted</b> <b>in</b> at 20 % such facilities. The <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> of specialists did not greatly increase EmOC service outputs at facilities, except in facilities with determined leadership. <b>Contracting</b> <b>in</b> specialists was useful for non emergency conditions, but not for obstetric emergencies. The contracts were more of a relational nature with poor monitoring structures. Inadequate infrastructure, longer distance to private specialists, insufficient financial provision for <b>contracting</b> <b>in,</b> and poor management capacities were barriers to effective implementation of <b>contracting</b> <b>in.</b> Dependency on the private sector was a concern among public partners while the private partners viewed <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> as an opportunity to gain experience and credibility. Conclusions Density and geographic distribution of private specialists are important influencing factors in determining feasibility and use of <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> for EmOC. Local circumstances dictate balance between introduction or expansion of contracts with private sector and strengthening public provisions and that neither of these disregard the need to strengthen public systems. Sustainability of <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> arrangements, their effect on increasing coverage of EmOC services in rural areas and overlapping provisions for <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> EmOC specialists are issues for future consideration. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to compare some morphosyntactic {{characteristics}} of the language <b>in</b> <b>contracts</b> <b>in</b> Spanish and Norwegian. My findings are the following: - The <b>contracts</b> <b>in</b> Spanish have a relatively more complex syntactic structure than the Norwegian ones, due to long sentences and {{a high number of}} subordinate clauses. - The impersonal forms of the verb are used to a higher degree <b>in</b> the <b>contracts</b> <b>in</b> Spanish. - Norwegian contracts have a larger amount of passive sentences than the <b>contracts</b> <b>in</b> Spanish, but this is still characteristic of both languages. - Nominalization is common in both languages. - Clichés and fixed phrases are found <b>in</b> the <b>contracts</b> <b>in</b> both languages. However, as the corpus is relatively small, it has not been determined whether {{there is a difference between}} the two languages regarding the frequency of this feature...|$|R

5000|$|California Family Code Section 308 {{provides}} that a marriage validly <b>contracted</b> <b>in</b> another jurisdiction is valid in California.
