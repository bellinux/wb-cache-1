5|$|During <b>closing</b> <b>arguments,</b> {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E
5|$|Coakley's {{rebuttal}} witnesses {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, that very few of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare <b>closing</b> <b>arguments.</b>|$|E

In his <b>closing</b> <b>argument,</b> Thorp reiterated his client's love for Wolfe, and stated that all {{evidence}} and testimony presented by the prosecution was circumstantial. Thorp further emphasised to the jury that no conclusive proof existed that Sangret had murdered Wolfe.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office {{investigated}} Borislav Pelević, {{a former}} SDG member {{and a member}} of the Serbian National Assembly. The investigation was ultimately dropped due to lack of evidence. In 2012, former SDG member Srđan Golubović was arrested in Belgrade at the request of the Prosecutor's Office. Golubović was charged with an indictment listing the names of 78 victims. Clint Williamson, the lead prosecutor, said that other members of the SDG could not be identified because their faces had been covered with masks. As of October 2014, <b>closing</b> <b>arguments</b> had been concluded in the trial of Karadžić, the former President of Republika Srpska, for the massacre, and other crimes against humanity committed in Bijeljina, among other areas, as well as for the genocide at Srebrenica. The ICTY is expected to deliver judgment in Karadžić's case in the first quarter of 2016.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted to raising facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of {{the hair on the}} lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that the}} various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the <b>closing</b> <b>arguments,</b> suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E

40|$|Prosecutorial {{misconduct}} in <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> {{during the}} penalty phase of capital trials {{can be defined}} as 2 ̆ 2 any disparaging or prejudicial statements calculated to influence the jury to consider improper factors in determining life in prison or the death penalty 2 ̆ 2 (J. S. Gaskill, 1991). Improper statements made by the prosecutor during <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> may jeopardize a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s right to a fair trial. While acknowledging such statements as misconduct, courts sometimes permit them on the theory that the presence of improper statements in <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> would not change the juries 2 ̆ 7 verdicts and therefore are not fundamentally unfair (Chapman v. California, 1967). The present study examined whether improper statements made by the prosecutor in <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> during the penalty phase of a capital trial would result in more death penalty recommendations. 320 jury-eligible individuals (160 undergraduates and 160 community members) viewed a videotape based on the penalty phase of an actual capital trial (Brooks v. State, 1977). Results show that individuals exposed to improper statements made by the prosecutor in <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> recommended the death penalty significantly more often than those not exposed to the statements...|$|R

[...] Jenkins published this <b>closing</b> <b>argument</b> in its entirety in his 1979 memoir. Newberry was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and given a light sentence.|$|R
