5|$|Pheochromocytomas are {{tumors of the}} {{adrenal medulla}} that arise from chromaffin cells. They <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety and palpitations. Common signs include {{hypertension}} and tachycardia. Surgery, especially adrenal laparoscopy, {{is the most common}} treatment for small pheochromocytomas.|$|E
5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} can affect dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom of}} the hold shifts easily and <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> free surface effect. The only way to control these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring for the presence of water.|$|E
5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E

5|$|File shells such as Limaria fragilis <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> noxious {{secretion}} when stressed. It has numerous tentacles which fringe its mantle and protrude {{some distance}} from the shell when it is feeding. If attacked, it sheds tentacles in a process known as autotomy. The toxin released by this is distasteful and the detached tentacles continue to writhe which may also serve to distract potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> {{secretion}} {{on their}} brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, {{delivered in a}} bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5|$|Some {{traits are}} governed by only a single gene, but most traits are {{influenced}} by the interactions of many genes. A variation in one of the many genes that contributes to a trait may have only a small effect on the phenotype; together, these genes <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> continuum of possible phenotypic values.|$|E

5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> permanent state of coma.|$|E
5|$|The calls made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E
5|$|The low-lying damp ground <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> {{visual effect}} {{known as a}} Fata Morgana when the Tor appears to rise out of the mist. This optical {{phenomenon}} occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed.

5|$|A lemon drop is a {{cocktail}} with a lemony, {{sweet and sour}} flavor, whereby the sweet and sour ingredients serve to contrast and balance one another. It is a vodka-based cocktail that is prepared {{with the addition of}} lemon juice, triple sec and simple syrup. Plain or citrus-flavored vodka may be used in its preparation, such as citron vodka. Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used. Lemon juice that has been freshly squeezed may be used, which <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> superior drink compared to using commercially prepared lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using the juice from Meyer lemons.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> moderate electric shock {{to defend itself}} against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs. HMMs <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family of possible alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting shallow, sandy areas near rocky reefs, the Japanese sleeper ray is a bottom-dwelling {{predator}} of invertebrates. Like {{other members}} of its family, it <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> strong electric shock from its electric organs for defensive purposes. Females give live birth to litters of up to five pups. The gestating young are sustained at first by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk"). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Vulnerable, due to its susceptibility to trawl fisheries that operate intensively throughout its range.|$|E

5|$|M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of {{the total}} population; their spectra {{resemble}} that of iron-nickel. Some {{are believed to have}} formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope {{does not appear to be}} primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7AU. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.|$|E
5|$|Male elands {{and female}} greater kudus <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> viable male hybrid, {{though it is}} not known if it is sterile. An {{accidental}} crossing of an east African common eland (T. o. pattersonianus) with an east African kudu (T. s. bea) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was sterile, which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic (Bos primigenius) and zebu cows (Bos indicus) have also produced sterile hybrids. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
