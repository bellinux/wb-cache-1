According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if your child {{under the age of}} 6 months is exclusively consuming infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water, there may be an increased chance of dental fluorosis. <b>Consult</b> <b>your</b> child's health care provider for more information."

6000|$|... "Not wrong, my dear madam, only impracticable. What do you think, Marquess, of {{choosing}} a wife in conformity to your principles, and without <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> tastes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Michael Bloomfield, {{you know}} your business," [...] he said, [...] "and {{you have a good}} character. Leave your address. When I have <b>consulted</b> <b>your</b> references, you shall hear from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Leigh, you {{see that}} I have <b>consulted</b> <b>your</b> honor, and that of your poor uncle, by adventuring thus alone. What will you have me do now, {{which may not be}} unfit for me and you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|You'll see most grossly you mistook, If you <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> spelling-book, (The better half {{you say you}} took,) [...] you'll find, sir, ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other two}} {{directors}} laughed. [...] "Pooh!" [...] exclaimed Rogers, softly. [...] "What is that? A {{drop in the}} bucket! <b>Consult</b> <b>your</b> note-book, Warburton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes. Well, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} whether I should not <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> husband about this as well as you," [...] said Clym steadily.|$|E
50|$|Call {{others to}} Islam. Familiarize your {{leadership}} with your activities and never undertake any actions without first <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> leadership. Keep yourself in constant spiritual contact with your community and always consider yourself {{a soldier in}} the barracks awaiting a command.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Had I {{known of}} this, I {{would have done}} what in my flurry I {{did not think of}} doing--set a watch upon him. But why not {{advertise}} for your missing wife as a preliminary, <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> solicitor in the meantime?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I see,'said Mr. Pleydell, 'you {{have got}} {{something}} {{to tell me about}} the Ellangowan business. Is it terrestrial or celestial? What says my military Albumazar? Have you calculated the course of futurity? have you <b>consulted</b> <b>your</b> ephemerides, your almochoden, your almuten?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or if {{you will}} not believe me, ask Susan; you cannot think she is prejudiced against you. Or even <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> father--he is not prejudiced against you. Ask Mr. Arabin--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg, dear sir, {{you will}} not think too much of me, but entirely <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> own judgment--your own sense of--in short, dear father, that you will {{consider}} yourself before your son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pardon me, Madam,' he continued, 'if in my perplexity, I {{presume to}} take counsel with you, and to <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> pleasure. I think I have {{observed}} that you are greatly interested in Miss Florence?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have seen}} her under the most {{favourable}} circumstances. It is the only sort of acquaintance to be relied on. You have <b>consulted</b> <b>your</b> own happiness far more than if you had allowed yourself to be attracted by mere showy gifts.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} singular about these Mowbrays to-night," [...] said Lady Penelope.--"Clara, poor dear angel, is always particular; but I {{should have thought}} Mowbray had too much worldly wisdom to be fanciful.--What are you <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> souvenir for with such attention, my dear Lady Binks?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, captain, I don't," [...] replied Harold Seadrift firmly. [...] "I do {{not blame}} you for <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> own safety, and doing what you believe to be your duty, but I have already said that I shall stick by the ship {{as long as she}} can float." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam, madam," [...] {{cried the}} unfortunate Earl, [...] "do but <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> physicians. They {{will tell you}} that all the {{benefits}} of the Buxton waters will be annulled by an hour in yonder subterranean hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the fewest}} and plainest words, Mr. Keller {{repeated}} what the physician had told him. [...] "Take your own {{time to think}} of it," [...] he added; [...] "and <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> mother first, if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. Since {{they thought}} the matter closed, {{it will be a}} {{pleasant}} surprise, but we'll let that go. Mr. Brandon obviously didn't <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> wishes, but have you any idea what his object was in taking his very unusual line?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{see what}} a dry, shrivelled, {{withered}} old chip it is,' returned Ralph, when the other was at length silent. 'If he were younger, it might be cruel, but as it is--harkee, Mr Bray, he'll die soon, and leave her a rich young widow! Miss Madeline <b>consults</b> <b>your</b> tastes this time; let her consult her own next.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{distinction}} of superior and inferior, Bluewater, {{will one day}} lead you into a confounded scrape, I fear. If you consider Charles Stuart your sovereign, it is not probable that orders issued by a servant of King George will be much respected. I hope you will do nothing hastily, or without <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> oldest and truest friend!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Sir Geoffrey," [...] {{answered}} Bridgenorth, [...] "you {{would better}} have <b>consulted</b> <b>your</b> own safety in adopting that resolution a little sooner--the tongue {{is a little}} member, but it causes much strife.--You, Master Julian, will please to follow me, and without remonstrance or resistance; for you must be aware that I have the means of compelling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is not a}} cureless evil," [...] said I gravely. [...] "Consult some of our learned divines, or <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> own {{excellent}} understanding, Miss Vernon; {{and surely}} the particulars in which our religious creed differs from that in which you have been educated"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is Mr. Moseley come to {{keep you}} company, Grace; so, after all, you must <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> {{headache}} and stay at home. Indeed, my love, I never can consent you should go out. I not only wish, but insist you remain within this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{recommended}} to <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> firm on a matter which requires [...] {{the services of}} a skilled detective and the utmost secrecy. I am [...] coming to London to-morrow, and will call at your office at about [...] half-past ten. Please arrange to be in at that time.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{notwithstanding}} my {{having been}} forced publicly into [...] the chief {{place in the}} Commons, and all that occurred in [...] consequence, I was still constant to my purpose, and in 1855 [...] suggested that {{the leadership of the}} House should be offered to [...] Lord Palmerston, entirely with the view of <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> feelings [...] and facilitating your position.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{what they}} shall be," [...] Pierre said quickly. [...] "We {{have no desire}} to cause you suffering, Horry Sims, and never counted on being forced to remain away so long; but matters couldn't have been changed, for of course we must think of our own safety before <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> comfort. Now, however, you {{will have a chance to}} move around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I say again,' remarked Mrs Nickleby (who, it is {{scarcely}} necessary to observe, had never said so before), 'I say again, that a milliner's and dressmaker's {{is the very}} last description of business, Kate, {{that you should have}} thought of attaching yourself to. I don't make it a reproach to you, my love; but still I will say, that if you had <b>consulted</b> <b>your</b> own mother--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Señor, {{we should}} reflect upon our motives. It is salutary for our {{conscience}} and is recommended (he crossed himself) by our Holy Mother the Church.

6000|$|Lady Bothwell endeavoured to {{maintain}} her proposed incognito, and, as the Doctor ushered them to {{the upper end of}} the room, made a motion declining his courtesy, as unfitted for their condition. [...] "We are poor people, sir," [...] she said; [...] "only my sister's distress has brought us to <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> worship whether--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't {{the least}} idea, Tom; but at any rate, I will <b>consult</b> <b>your</b> father. It is {{something}} {{to learn as much}} as we have, and we certainly seem to have got on the right clue. I never quite despaired, but I feel now pretty certain that we shall get to the bottom of it at last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you have <b>consulted</b> <b>your</b> own humor both in your neglect and your attentions, Duke. The more {{you try to}} excuse yourself, the more inexcusable your conduct appears. I {{do not know how}} to advise you. If Constance is told, you may some day forget all about your present infatuation; and then a mass of {{mischief}} and misery will have been made for nothing. If she is not told, you will be keeping up a cruel deception and wasting her chances of----but she will never care for anybody else." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{was indeed}} true. Nothing is more {{deceptive}} to an inexperienced eye than the apparent {{distance of a}} high mountain-top. When you imagine that the plain below is miles and miles away, and the peak above close at hand, you find, perhaps, on <b>consulting</b> <b>your</b> watch, that the plain cannot be very far distant, and that {{the greater part of}} your work still lies before you. It requires no small amount of resolution to bear up against the depression of spirit caused by frequent mistakes in this matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the risk}} of making you angry I have to speak," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Gray. [...] "I knew your father, and have known you all your life. If this is to make her miserable, and if, as I gather, she has committed no great fault, will it not be--wicked?" [...] Mr. Gray sat silent for a few moments, looking him in the face. [...] "Have you <b>consulted</b> <b>your</b> own conscience, and what it will say to you after a time? She has given all {{that she has to}} you, though {{there has not been a}} shilling,--and no money can repay her. One fault is not pardonable,--one only fault." ...|$|R
