While harassed in this manner, Teodoreanu was already earning a leading place in underground counterculture, where he began circulating his new anti-communist compositions. According to literary critic Ion Simuț, the clandestine poetry of Păstorel, Vasile Voiculescu and Radu Gyr is the only explicit negation of communism to have emerged from 1950s Romania. As other Securitate records show, the public was aware of Teodoreanu's visits to the Securitate, but distinguished between him, who was [...] "called over" [...] to confess, and those who made voluntary denunciations.|$|R

Cuignet soon learned that the most damning evidence brought to the court in 1896 by Henry {{was in fact a}} forgery using two separate documents, later known as the [...] "faux Henry," [...] to achieve the sentence he and his supporters desired. Henry was <b>called</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>questioning</b> on 30 August by Cavaignac and managed to protest his innocence for only an hour before he confessed.

Two weeks before she was scheduled to appear, Weltfish {{was told by the}} trustees of Columbia that her employment contract would not be renewed {{at the end of the}} year. The university said she was being dismissed based on the university's adoption of a new policy against the prolonged use of annual contract-based lecturers. But, the university promoted other lecturers affected by the change to tenured positions rather than dismissing them. Weltfish maintained that she was fired because she was a woman. Later historians have concluded that she was fired because the trustees saw her as a political liability, who could threaten funding, in the tense and charged environment during the years of the red scare.|$|R
