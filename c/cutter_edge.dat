25|$|Routing {{and milling}} are conceptually similar, and end mills {{can be used}} in routers, but routing wood is {{different}} from milling metal in terms of the mechanics involved; the chip formation is different, and the optimal tool geometry is thus different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers may be run at extremely high speeds and so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood cutting mechanism of Type I chips cannot take place. The <b>cutter</b> <b>edge</b> angle is blunt, approaching 90°, and so a Type III chip is formed, with the waste material being produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials. The forces against the cutter are light, so routers may be hand-held.|$|E

Starting with {{an analysis of the}} milling edge radius of the tool, the influence of the downscaling on the edge radius is determined by analyzing the milling force. This simulation is used to predict the extent of tool wear in the same milling operation condition by increasing of the tool edge radius.

In the presence of cutting problems with sharp blades, classi- cal crack-propagation approaches based on cohesive interfaces may prove inadequate. New “directional” cohesive interface elements are here proposed to account for the interaction with the <b>cutter</b> <b>edge.</b> The element small thickness leads to very high eigenfrequencies, which imply overly small stable time-steps.

40|$|Mechanistic {{models of}} the milling process must {{calculate}} the chip geometry and the <b>cutter</b> <b>edge</b> contact length in order to predict milling forces accurately. This task becomes increasingly difficult for the machining of three dimensional parts using complex tool geometry, such as bull nose cutters. In this paper, a mechanistic model of the milling process based on an adaptive and local depth buffer of the computer graphics card is compared to a traditional simulation method. Results are compared using a 3 -axis wedge shaped cut – a tool path with a known chip geometry {{in order to accommodate}} the traditional method. Effects of cutter nose radius on the cutting and edge forces are considered. It is verified that there is little difference (1. 4 % at most) in the predicted force values of the two methods, thereby validating the adaptive depth buffer approach. The numerical simulations are also verified using experimental cutting tests of aluminum, and found to agree closely (within 12 %).

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories and U S Synthetic Corporation have jointly {{conducted}} a multifaceted, baseline experimental study {{to support the}} development of improved drag cutters for advanced drill bits. This study, which involved the production and laboratory testing of different nonstandard cutter lots, evaluated the influence of variations in selected design and processing parameters on cutter loads, wear, and durability in hard-rock environments. The focus was on drag-bit cutters that incorporated ultrahard PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) overlays (i. e., diamond tables) on tungsten carbide substrates. Parameter variations selected for the test cutters included changes in cutter geometry, material composition, and processing conditions. Geometric variables were the diamond-table thickness, the chamfer design for the <b>cutter</b> <b>edge,</b> and the diamond-table/substrate interface configuration. Material and processing variables for the diamond table were, respectively, the nominal diamond particle size and the pressure that was applied during cutter production.

40|$|Under normal {{machining}} conditions, {{the cutting}} forces are {{primarily due to}} the bulk shearing of the workpiece material in a narrow zone called the shear zone. However, under finishing conditions, when the uncut chip thickness is {{of the order of}} the cutting edge radius, a ploughing component of the forces becomes significant as compared to the shear forces. Predicting forces under these conditions requires an estimate of ploughing. A slip-line field is developed to model the ploughing components of the cutting force. The field is based on other slip-line fields developed for a rigid wedge sliding on a half-space and for negative rake angle orthogonal cutting. It incorporates the observed phenomena of a small stable build-up of material adhered to the edge and a raised prow of material formed ahead of the edge. The model shows how ploughing forces are related to <b>cutter</b> <b>edge</b> radius—a larger edge causing larger ploughing forces. A series of experiments were run on 6061 -T 6 aluminum using tools with different edge radii—including some exaggerated in size—and different levels of uncut chip thickness. Resulting force measurements match well to predictions using the proposed slip-line field. The results show great promise for understanding and quantifying the effects of edge radius and worn tool on cutting forces...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{machining}} experiments on the Oil-Palm Empty Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) particleboard {{were carried out}} using a CNC router, to evaluate the tool wearing properties of the composite {{in comparison to the}} conventional wood-material particleboard. A single-fluted tungsten-carbide router bit (12 mm φ, 18 000 rpm), with a rake angle of 15 ° was used in this experiment, in which the depth of cut was 1. 5 mm and feed speed was 4. 5 m min - 1. The router bit machined the edge of the board, moving along the full length before returning to repeat the cycle. The tool was examined for the extent of wear after complete failure had occurred. The result found that the wear pattern was similar in the oil-palm based particleboard and the wood-based particleboard, but the former was twice more abrasive compared to the latter. Microscopic examination of the <b>cutter</b> <b>edge</b> revealed greater incidence of micro-fracture when cutting the oil-palm based particleboard, indicating the presence of hard impurities in the composite. From an economic perspective, the tooling cost for machining oil-palm based particleboard is estimated to be twice of the cost for machining wood-based particleboard. This study shows that the machining properties of oil-palm based particleboard will be a primary concern, if the board is to find widespread application as a potential substitute for wood-based particleboard...|$|E
25|$|The 36-gun frigate Flora was patrolling off Brest on the {{afternoon}} of 10 August 1780 when through the haze she sighted two vessels, a square-rigged vessel and a cutter, about four miles away. As Flora approached, the <b>cutter</b> <b>edged</b> away, while the square-rigged vessel waited, accepting battle. When the two ships were within two cables length the French ship raised her colours and opened fire. The battle lasted about an hour, until Flora, being much cut up, moved closer in. After another 15 minutes the French abandoned their guns and attempted to board, but were repulsed and the crew of Flora boarded her and took possession. She proved to be the frigate La Nymphe, pierced for 40 guns, but mounting only 32, and commanded by the Chevalier Charles-Marie de Trolong du Rumain, who died that evening of his wounds. Flora, as well as her nominal armament of 36 guns, also carried six recently-introduced 18-pounder carronades, which swept the decks of the French ship with grapeshot. In addition Floras guns were heavier, 18- and 9-pounders, against the French ship's 12- and 6-pounders. This is reflected in the number of casualties; 9 killed and 17 wounded on Flora out of a crew of 259, and 55 killed and 81 wounded aboard La Nymphe, from a crew of 291.|$|R

40|$|The {{global market}} {{competition}} {{has put a}} pressure on the industry to reduce lead time and increase quality of parts. In particular, the area of gear cutting tool design requires capability to rapidly produce tool designs with increased tool geometry precision. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore the field of gear shaper cutter design and produce a model and software that would enable creation of more precise cutter designs, faster. A literature survey of involute cylindrical gearing geometry highlights deficiencies in addressing industry requirements of tool manufacturing, as most of the research in the area is focused on problems of gear design, but not tool design. This research, therefore, focuses on the process of gear manufacturing using the gear shaper cutters. It attempts to develop an analytical model and a set of tools that are able to aid the design process of gear shaper cutter. With cylindrical gear being essentially " at" and therefore easier to express an- alytically, the focus of recent papers has shifted to non-cylindrical and non-involute gear trains. Yet the geometry of the tools used to produce cylindrical gears remains largely untapped area, in particular the geometry of gear shaper <b>cutters.</b> The knowl- <b>edge</b> about the profile of the cutter teeth and the profile cut by the cutter in the gear blank are essential for high precision gear manufacturing. The gear shaper cutter is a metal cutting tool and therefore should be re-sharpened on a regular basis. These re-sharpening operations change the profile of the tool and, consequently, the profile of the gear it cuts. The changes in the cutter and gear geometry are analysed in this thesis and a way to calculate the life span of the tool is suggested. Gear shaper cutter profiles usually have one or more modifications to the theoret- ical ideal involute profile applied. Some of these modifications are used to produce a better cutter profile, while other should in turn produce modifications to the gear profile, and, finally, some are used to overcome generated gear profile constraints. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for gear shaper cutter design should be able to show the profile of the cutter and the profile cut by the cutter with arbitrary modifications applied. The analysis and visualisation of gear shaper cutters profiles cut by these cutters is impossible without a clear understanding of the principles of operation of gear generation hardware, generating motion and different machine geometry, all being covered in this thesis. In order to verify the analytical model and the CAD software case studies of the real-life gear shaper cutter designs were performed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 149 - 154) Increasingly, fiber reinforced polymers {{are being}} used in aerospace, naval, and automotive industries due to their high specific strength and high stiffness. Some of the damage problems encountered during machining these materials include: delamination, surface roughness and high rate of tool wear. Major factors that affect damage during machining in these materials are cutting forces, tool geometry, feed rate, and spindle speed. The {{first part of this}} study aims to develop an approximate mechanistic model to predict the cutting forces in the orthogonal cutting of unidirectional fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) when the fiber orientation varies from 00 to 1800. This work utilizes the mechanistic modeling approach for predicting cutting forces and simulating the milling process of fiber reinforced polymers with a straight cutting edge. Specific energy functions were developed by multiple regression analysis (MR) and committee neural network approximation (CN) of milling force data and a cutting model was developed based on these energies and the cutting geometry. Cutting force prediction models were constructed for principal and thrust cutting directions. The models are based on the specific cutting energy principle and account {{for a wide range of}} fiber orientations and chip thickness. Results from two forms of non-linear modeling methods, non-linear regression and committee neural networks, were compared. It was found that the committee neural networks provide better prediction capability of smoothing and capturing the inherent non-linearity in the data. The model predictions were found to be in good agreement with experimental results over entire range of fiber orientations from 0 * to 180 *. The second part of this study dealt with an improved mechanistic cutting force model for complex tool geometry by sectioning the helical cutting edge into a stacked series of straight <b>edge</b> <b>cutter</b> segments with angular offsets and calculating the forces for each segment, then adding the forces for all segments of the cutting edge. The scope of this work is to establish a three dimensional cutting force prediction model for complex cutting tool geometry using orthogonal machining database developed in first part. The cutting forces predicted have shown a good agreement with experimental results. The third part of this study dealt with building a generalized model to predict cutting forces for any combination of process parameters such as spindle speed (nt), feed rate (Vf), depth of cut (ae), rake angle (αi) and workpiece fiber layup direction ψ. Committee neural network is constructed using machining parameters – chip thickness (ac), fiber orientation angle (θ), spindle speed (nt) and feed rate (Vf) as input variables and average specific cutting energy values, (Kc and Kt) as output variables. Exhaustive experimentation is conducted to develop the model and to validate it. The training of the networks is performed with experimental machining data. Results showed that the model provides good results for unidirectional composites for all fiber orientation. The experimental results show a reasonably good fit to the predicted values, suggesting that the current approach is successful and well suitable for studying the machining of fiber reinforced polymers. Results also showed that the cutting forces are directly dependent on fiber orientation, chip thickness, rake angle, spindle speed, and feed rate...|$|R
40|$|Most drill wear {{monitoring}} {{research found}} in the literature is based on conventional vibration technologies. However, these conventional approaches still have not attracted real interest from manufacturers for multiples of reasons: some of these techniques are not practical and use complicated Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) systems with less value in industry. In addition, they are also prone to give spurious drill deterioration warnings in industrial environments. Therefore, drills are normally replaced at estimated preset intervals, sometimes long before they are worn or by expertise judgment. Two of the great problems in the implementation of these systems in drilling are: the poor signal-to-noise ratio and the lack of system-made sensors for drilling, as is prevalent in machining operations with straight <b>edge</b> <b>cutters.</b> In order to overcome the noise problems, many researchers recommend advanced and sophisticated signal processing while the work of Rehorn et al. (2005) advises the following possibilities to deal with the lack of commercial system-made sensors:  Some research should be directed towards developing some form of instrumented tool for drill operations.  Since the use of custom-made sensors is being ignored in drilling operations, effort should be focused on intelligent or innovative use of available sensor technology. It is expected that the latter could minimize implementation problems and allows an optimal drill utilization rate by means of modern and smart sensors. In addition to the accelerometer sensor commonly used in conventional methods, this work has considered two other sensor-based methods to monitor the drill wear indirectly. These methods entail the use of an instrumented drill with strain gauges to measure the torque and the use of an encoder to measure the Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS). The signals from these sensors were analyzed using signal processing techniques such as, statistical parameters, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and a ii preliminary Time-Frequency (TF) analysis. A preliminary investigation has revealed that the use of a Regression Analysis (RA) based on a higher order polynomial function can very well follow and give prognosis of the development of the monitored parameters. The experimental investigation has revealed that all the above monitoring systems are sensitive to the deterioration of the drill condition. This work is however particularly concerned with the use of IAS on the spindle of the drill, compared to conventional monitoring systems for drill condition monitoring. This comparison reveals that the IAS approach can generate diagnostic information similar to vibration and torque measurements, without some of the instrumentation complications. This similitude seems to be logical, as {{it is well known that}} the increase of friction between the drill and workpiece due to wear increase the torque and consequently it should reduce or at least affect the spindle rotational speed. However, the use of a drill instrumented with a strain gauge is not practical, because of the inconvenience it causes on production machines. By contrast, the IAS could be measured quite easily by means of an encoder, a tachometer or some other smart rotational speed sensors. Thus, one could take advantage of advanced techniques in digital time interval analysis applied to a carrier signal from a multiple pulse per revolution encoder on the rotating shaft, to improve the analysis of chain pulses. As it will be shown in this dissertation, the encoder resolution does not sensibly affect the analysis. Therefore, one can easily replace encoders by any smart transducers that have become more popular in rotating machinery. Consequently, a non-contact transducer for example could effectively be used in on-line drill condition monitoring such as the use of lasers or time passage encoder-based systems. This work has gained from previous research performed in Tool Condition Monitoring TCM, and presents a sensor that is already available in the arsenal of sensors and could be an open door for a practical and reliable sensor in automated drilling. iii In conclusion, this dissertation strives to answer the following question: Which one of these methods could challenge the need from manufacturers by monitoring and diagnosing drill condition in a practical and reliable manner? Past research has sufficiently proved the weakness of conventional technologies in industry despite good results in the laboratory. In addition, delayed diagnosis due to time-consuming data processing is not beneficial for automated drilling, especially when the drill wears rapidly at the end of its life. No advanced signal processing is required for the proposed technique, as satisfactory results are obtained using common time domain signal processing methods. The recommended monitoring choice will definitely depend on the sensor that is practical and reliable in industry.
