He had been guiding the programmes for new advanced reactors, under design and development at BARC, Mumbai, to utilise thorium as fuel. These programmes include the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR), which produces most of its power from thorium and has several innovative passive safety systems. Most of the technological innovations in the design of AHWR have been validated under his guidance, in large experimental facilities. He has contributed substantially to design and development of Indian High Temperature Reactors intended for hydrogen generation and has been instrumental in the guiding the design and development of Compact High Temperature Reactor (CHTR), which will serve as technology demonstrator for future larger high temperature reactors. Another salient objective of the CHTR is to demonstrate the technologies needed for transportable nuclear power packs capable of being deployed in remote areas with practically no need for skilled operation and no need to refuel for 15 years. This first-of-its-kind design incorporates thorium based <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> type nuclear fuel, a reactor physics design to achieve inherently safe neutronic characteristics, use molten lead-bismuth as coolant driven by natural circulation, passive emergency cooling systems that deliver core heat to atmosphere, passive shutdown device and passive control devices capable of operation at very high temperatures.

In its application for transmutation, the GT-MHR {{is referred to as}} the Deep-Burn MHR (DB-MHR). This Fuel Development Plan (FDP) describes part of the overall program being undertaken by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), utilities, and industry to evaluate the use of the GT-MHR to transmute transuranic nuclides from spent nuclear fuel. The Fuel Development Plan (FDP) includes the work on fuel necessary to support the design and licensing of the DB-MHR. The FDP is organized into ten sections. Section 1 provides a summary of the most important features of the plan, including cost and schedule information. Section 2 describes the DB-MHR concept, the features of its fuel and the plan to develop <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuel for transmutation. Section 3 describes the knowledge base for fabrication of coated particles, the experience with irradiation performance of <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuels, the database for fission product transport in HTGR cores, and describes test data and calculations for the performance of <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuel while in a repository. Section 4 presents the fuel performance requirements in terms of as-manufactured quality and performance of the fuel coatings under irradiation and accident conditions. These requirements are provisional because the design of the DB-MHR is in an early stage. However, the requirements are presented in this preliminary form to guide the initial work on the fuel development. Section 4 also presents limits on the irradiation conditions to which the <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuel can be subjected for the core design. These limits are based on past irradiation experience. Section 5 describes the Design Data Needs to: (1) fabricate the <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuel, (2) predict its performance in the reactor core, (3) predict the radionuclide release rates from the reactor core, and (4) predict the performance of spent fuel in a geological repository. The heart of this fuel development plan is Section 6, which describes the development activities proposed to satisfy the DDNs presented in Section 5. The development scope is divided into Fuel Process Development, Fuel Materials Development, Fission Product Transport, and Spent Fuel Disposal. Section 7 describes the facilities to be used.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this INERI project is to develop improved fuel behavior models for gas reactor <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuels and to develop improved coated-particle fuel designs {{that can be used}} reliably at very high burnups and potentially in fast gas-cooled reactors. Thermomechanical, thermophysical, and physiochemical material properties data were compiled by both the US and the French and preliminary assessments conducted. Comparison between U. S. and European data revealed many similarities and a few important differences. In all cases, the data needed for accurate fuel performance modeling of <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuel at high burnup were lacking. The development of the INEEL fuel performance model, PARFUME, continued from earlier efforts. The statistical model being used to simulate the detailed finite element calculations is being upgraded and improved to allow for changes in fuel design attributes (e. g. thickness of layers, dimensions of kernel) as well as changes in important material properties to increase the flexibility of the code. In addition, modeling of other potentially important failure modes such as debonding and asphericity was started. A paper on the status of the model was presented at the HTR- 2002 meeting in Petten, Netherlands in April 2002, and a paper on the statistical method was submitted to the Journal of Nuclear Material in September 2002. Benchmarking of the model against Japanese and an older DRAGON irradiation are planned. Preliminary calculations of the stresses in a <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> have been calculated by the CEA using the ATLAS finite element model. This model and the material properties and constitutive relationships will be incorporated into a more general software platform termed Pleiades. Pleiades will be able to analyze different fuel forms at different scales (from particle to fuel body) and also handle the statistical variability in <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuel. Diffusion couple experiments to study Ag and Pd transport through SiC were conducted. Analysis and characterization of the samples continues. Two active transport mechanisms are proposed: diffusion in SiC and release through SiC cracks or another, as yet undetermined, path. Silver concentration profiles determined by XPS analysis suggest diffusion within the SiC layer, most likely dominated by grain boundary diffusion. However, diffusion coefficients calculated from mass loss measurements suggest a much faster release path, postulated as small cracks or flaws that provide open paths with little resistance to silver migration.

40|$|The {{basic unit}} of the fuel {{in the core of}} a High Temperature Reactor (HTR) with block or spherical fuel, {{elements}} is the <b>coated</b> <b>particle.</b> These coated particles consist of small spherical pyrocarbon (PyO) and siliconcarbide (SiC) coated fuel kernels. High stresses may be induced into the coatings during irradiation due to the fission gas pressure, the irradiation induced dimensional changes of the PyC layers and the kernel swelling. A schematic description of the <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> is given in figure 1. It has the fuel kernel 200 - 800 μm in diameter. This is surrounded by a porous PyC layer 30 - 100 μm thick, the so-called buffer layer which has to accommodate the fission gases and recoils. Then follows another coating shell. It may either consist of one dense PyC layer with a thickness of 100 μm (BISO particle) or a combination of two dense PyC layers, with a thickness of 35 μm each and a SiC interlayer with a thickness of 35 μm (TRISO particle). The outer coating shell combination PyC-SiC-PyC acts as a pressurevessel for the fission gases, and a diffusion barrier for the solid fission products. The SiC interlayer improves the retention of the solid fission products as well as the mechanical stability of the shell (1) (2). In order to optimize the <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> with respect to its mechanical performance it is desirable to have a model to predict the stresses in the coating during irradiation.

The particles were dry dispersed and size selected at 200 [*]nm, and we determined the fraction of dust particles nucleating ice at various temperatures and RHw. Under water-subsaturated conditions, compared to bare dust particles, we found that <b>coated</b> <b>particles</b> showed a reduction in their ice nucleation ability. Under water-supersaturated conditions, however, we did not observe a significant coating effect (i. e., the bare and <b>coated</b> dust <b>particles</b> had nearly similar nucleating properties). X-ray diffraction patterns of the <b>coated</b> <b>particles</b> indicated that acid treatment altered the crystalline nature of the surface and caused structural disorder; thus, we concluded that the lack of such structured order reduced the ice nucleation efficiency of the <b>coated</b> <b>particles</b> in deposition ice nucleation mode.

Sustainability calls for recycling of all minor actinides (MAs) in the core and a breeding gain close to unity. A fuel cycle is designed allowing operation over a long period, requiring re-fueling with 238 U only.

40|$|Roy Huddle, having {{invented the}} <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> in Harwell 1957, {{stated in the}} early 1970 s that we know now {{everything}} about particles and coatings and should be going over to deal with other problems. This was {{on the occasion of}} the Dragon fuel performance information meeting London 1973 : How wrong a genius be! It took until 1978 that really good particles were made in Germany, then during the Japanese HTTR production in the 1990 s and finally the Chinese 2000 - 2001 campaign for HTR- 10. Here, we present a review of history and present status. Today, good fuel is measured by different standards from the seventies: where 9 * 10 (- 4) initial free heavy metal fraction was typical for early AVR carbide fuel and 3 * 10 (- 4) initial free heavy metal fraction was acceptable for oxide fuel in THTR, we insist on values more than an order of magnitude below this value today. Half a percent of particle failure at the end-of-irradiation, another ancient standard, is not even acceptable today, even for the most severe accidents. While legislation and licensing has not changed, one of the reasons we insist on these improvements is the preference for passive systems rather than active controls of earlier times. After renewed HTGR interest, we are reporting about the start of new or reactivated <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> work in several parts of the world, considering the aspects of designs/traditional and new materials, manufacturing technologies/quality control/quality assurance, irradiation and accident performance, modeling and performance predictions, and fuel cycle aspects and spent fuel treatment. In very general terms, the <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> should be strong, reliable, retentive, and affordable. These properties have to be quantified and will be eventually optimized for a specific application system. Results obtained so far indicate that the same particle can be used for steam cycle applications with 700 - 750 degrees C helium coolant gas exit, for gas turbine applications at 850 - 900 degrees C and for process heat/hydrogen generation applications with 950 degrees C outlet temperatures. There is a clear set of standards for modem high quality fuel in terms of low levels of heavy metal contamination, manufacture-induced particle defects during fuel body and fuel element making, irradiation/accident induced particle failures and limits on fission product release from intact particles. While gas-cooled reactor design is still open-ended with blocks for the prismatic and spherical fuel elements for the pebble-bed design, there is near worldwide agreement on high quality fuel: a 500 pin diameter UO 2 kernel of 10 % enrichment is surrounded by a 100 mu m thick sacrificial buffer layer to be followed by a dense inner pyrocarbon layer, a high quality silicon carbide layer of 35 mu m thickness and theoretical density and another outer pyrocarbon layer. Good performance has been demonstrated both under operational and under accident conditions, i. e. to 10 % FIMA and maximum 1600 degrees C afterwards. And it is the wide-ranging demonstration experience that makes this particle superior. Recommendations are made for further work: 1. Generation of data for presently manufactured materials, e. g. SiC strength and strength distribution, PyC creep and shrinkage and many more material data sets. 2. Renewed start of irradiation and accident testing of modem <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> fuel. 3. Analysis of existing and newly created data with a view to demonstrate satisfactory performance at burnups beyond 10 % FIMA and complete fission product retention even in accidents that go beyond 1600 degrees C for a short period of time. This work should proceed at both national and international level...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{chemical}} vapor deposition of ZrC and C [...] ZrC alloys has been developed. This process {{has been applied to}} the fabrication of <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> nuclear fuels of the type used in the large High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor. A powder feeder is used to supply ZrCl$sub 4 $ to the fluidized bed coating furnace where it undergoes reaction with a hydrocarbon to form ZrC. Quantitative metering of the ZrCl$sub 4 $ makes it possible to control the deposition of the ZrC and the codeposition of the C [...] ZrC alloys on the fuel particles. Examples of both types of coats made using the described technique are discussed and illustrated. (auth...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the quality of}} sulphur-coated urea was {{determined}} by the urea dissolution rate and analysed by electron microscopy. Particles of urea were coated in a two-dimensional spouted bed, having a 60 ° slanted base angle and an atomization nozzle installed at the base. Elementary sulphur was liquefied and atomized on the particles. The experiments were planned with the objective of verifying the influences of flowrates of sulphur and atomized air and the temperature of the air used in the spouted bed {{on the quality of the}} <b>coated</b> <b>particle</b> surface. The temperature of the spout air and the flowrate of the atomized air showed a significant influence on the quality of the coating...|$|E
50|$|The pan coating process, {{widely used}} in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, is among the oldest industrial procedures for forming small, <b>coated</b> <b>particles</b> or tablets. The particles are tumbled in a pan or other device while the coating material is applied slowly.|$|R
40|$|The {{polysaccharide}} from cell {{walls of}} coagulase-positive staphylococci <b>coated</b> both latex <b>particles</b> and tanned red cells for agglutination by human sera and by specific staphylococcal antisera. Treatment with trypsin or autoclaving destroyed {{the capacity of}} polysaccharide to <b>coat</b> <b>particles</b> but did not affect precipitation of antibody. Periodic acid destroyed both properties. The teichoic acid portion of the staphylococcal polysaccharide displayed precipitin activity similar to polysaccharide, {{but it did not}} <b>coat</b> either latex <b>particles</b> or tanned red cells. Teichoic acid did, however, inhibit specific agglutination of polysaccharide-coated particles or cells...|$|R
40|$|Wire arc {{spraying}} using repetitively pulsed, high temperature gas jets, usually {{referred to as}} plasma jets, and generated by capillary discharges, substantially increases the velocity of atomized and entrained molten droplets. The quality of coatings produced is improved by increasing the velocity with which <b>coating</b> <b>particles</b> impact the <b>coated</b> surface. The effectiveness of wire-{{arc spraying}} is improved by replacing the usual atomizing air stream with a rapidly pulsed high velocity plasma jet. Pulsed power provides higher <b>coating</b> <b>particle</b> velocities leading to improved coatings. 50 micron aluminum droplets with velocities of 1500 m/s are produced. Pulsed plasma jet spraying provides the means to coat the insides of pipes, tubes, and engine block cylinders with very high velocity droplet impact...|$|R
