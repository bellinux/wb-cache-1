Southbound containers were loaded by shippers in the Yukon and moved by rail, ship, and truck to their consignees without opening.

500|$|Severe {{competition}} {{following the}} building of excess container shipping capacity by many companies badly affected ML's trade and profitability. The company's vessels were by then smaller than average in the industry, leading to higher operating costs per unit of cargo carried. Their operations were further severely affected during the mid-1970s by both official and unofficial strikes by dock workers. The service to Canada ended in 1979, and by the early 1980s only five [...] "Manchester" [...] ships remained– the 30,000 ton <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> Manchester Challenge and four 1,600–4,000 ton vessels: Manchester Crown, Manchester Trader, Manchester Faith and Manchester City. The line had by then ceased using the Port of Manchester, and the four smaller vessels were operating to the Mediterranean out of Ellesmere Port, [...] closer to the sea on the lower reaches of the ship canal.|$|E
500|$|Manchester Liners {{established}} regular sailings {{by large}} ocean-going vessels. In late 1898 the Manchester City, at 7,698gross tons, became the largest vessel {{to reach the}} terminal docks. Carrying cattle and general cargo, it was met by the Lord Mayor of Manchester and a large welcoming crowd. [...] In 1968 Manchester Liners converted its fleet to container vessels only. To service them it built two dedicated container terminals next to No. 9 Dock. The four container vessels commissioned that year, each of 11,898 gross tons, were the largest ever to make regular use of the terminal docks at Salford. [...] In 1974 the canal handled 2.9million long tons (3.25million short tons) of dry cargo, 27 per cent of which was carried by Manchester Liners. The dry tonnage was, and is still, greatly supplemented by crude and refined oil products transported in large tanker ships {{to and from the}} Queen Elizabeth II Dock at Eastham and the Stanlow Refinery just east of Ellesmere Port, and also in smaller tankers to Runcorn. The limitations imposed by the canal on the maximum size of <b>container</b> <b>vessel</b> meant that by the mid-1970s Manchester Liners was becoming uncompetitive; the company sold its last ship in 1985.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of measures to reduce ship borne Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is recently of high {{priority of the}} International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Shipping {{is by far the}} most energy efficient mode of transport but society has started to critically view also CO 2 -emissions from shipping. <b>Container</b> <b>vessels</b> which are the bloodlines of the global supply chains have relatively high installed power to achieve fast and reliable services. This paper first looks into the historic energy efficiency of <b>container</b> <b>vessels</b> using available public data. The current energy efficiency is presented based on data provided by operating <b>container</b> <b>vessels.</b> It is documented that with proper emission predictions and knowledge on emission abatement potentials, policy makers and ship designers and operators will be able to make the right decisions for future shipping. The emission projections show, however, that currently discussed CO 2 -emission targets will probably not be met...|$|R
