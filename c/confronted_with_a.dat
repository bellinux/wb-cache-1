5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|In the {{circumstances}} {{it was hardly}} possible for the new king to show adaptability or tolerance or diplomatic skill, which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships. <b>Confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with grim determination and implacable ferocity. Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion and mistrust. But, in spite of all, the name of this great defender of the faith {{is one of the most}} memorable in Ethiopian history.|$|E

Charlie insists {{that it is necessary to}} appoint a new person to fill the position, but the president is reluctant to take the step. As the episode ends, Bartlet is searching for a good pen, and realizes the full depth of his dependence on Mrs. Landingham.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneously {{with their}} {{appearance}} on the Hamch'ang road at the southern base of the Mun'gyong plateau north of Sangju, the North Koreans approached on the secondary mountain road to the west. On July 22, F Company of the 35th Infantry was also attacked north of Hamch'ang, when it was <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> North Korean battalion three times its size. The company fought effectively and inflicted heavy casualties, though the next day rains caused flooding of a river to the unit's rear and cut off its route of supply. Assisted by artillery, {{it was able to}} disengage.|$|E
5|$|When Guybrush {{returns to}} LeChuck's ship with the elixir, he learns that LeChuck has {{returned}} to Mêlée IslandTM to marry Elaine at the church. He promptly returns to Mêlée IslandTM and gatecrashes the wedding, only to ruin Elaine's own plan for escape; in the process he loses the elixir. Now <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> furious LeChuck, Guybrush is savagely beaten by the ghost pirate in a fight ranging across the island. The fight eventually arrives at the island's ship emporium, where Guybrush finds a bottle of root beer. Substituting the beverage for the lost elixir, he sprays LeChuck, destroying the ghost pirate. With LeChuck defeated, Guybrush and Elaine enjoy a romantic moment, watching fireworks caused by LeChuck exploding.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1936, the {{management}} of the New York Philharmonic was <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame {{the management of the}} orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|KG 1, meanwhile, {{had a clear}} run to its target. The {{battles with}} KG 76 had drawn {{in four of the}} five RAF Squadrons. Still, the British sent No. 615 Squadron and its 15 Spitfires to deal with KG 1. They were <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large number of Bf 109s from JG 54, escorting the He 111s. The German fighters {{successfully}} defended their charges and the RAF fighters could not break through to the bombers, which were flying in stepped-up waves from 12 to 15,000 feet. Most of the German bomber crews noted the absence of fighter opposition and speculated that the RAF might be {{at the end of its}} tether. Most of the personnel at Biggin Hill had time to take cover before the bombers arrived. KG 1 lost only one He 111 and one another damaged but failed to damage Biggin Hill. It is likely the losses sustained by KG 1 were inflicted by Spitfires from No. 65 Squadron RAF which stumbled across of their He 111s while 615 and JG 54 were locked in combat.|$|E
5|$|Soult {{could not}} besiege so strong a {{fortress}} as Badajoz with his reduced force and therefore changed his plans. Sending his light cavalry under Brig. Gen. André Briche to take Mérida and leaving four squadrons of dragoons at Albuera {{to watch the}} garrison at Badajoz, he marched with {{the remainder of his}} army to invest Olivenza. Wellington had previously advised Gen. Pedro Caro de La Romana, commander of the Spanish Army of Extremadura, either to destroy the fortification at Olivenza or to repair its defenses and fully garrison it; La Romana in turn had instructed Mendizabal to slight the fortress, but Mendizabal ignored this order and instead reinforced the garrison with four infantry battalions. Soult, arriving on 11 January, was therefore <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strongly garrisoned—but untenable—fortress. The heavy French artillery finally began to arrive on 19 January, and by 22 January a poorly repaired breach in the fortress' walls had been reopened. The garrison surrendered on 23 January, with over 4,000 Spanish troops from the Army of Extremadura taken captive.|$|E

25|$|Triple X {{syndrome}} can {{be diagnosed}} prenatally through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. Between 1985-1987, this figure dropped to 56%.

25|$|When disturbed, its alarm note is a harsh jay-like k(w)eee, greee or jaaa, often {{repeated}} twice. The {{more excited}} the birds become, the higher and faster the calls get, via chek-chek-chek to a rattle trr-trr-trr or an explosive aak-aak-aak. A {{bird of prey}} alert is given with a whistle breezeek. Knuk calls are given by adults <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> potential threat to their young. To beg for food – young to adults or pairmembers to each other –, rows of waik calls are given. This species sometimes tries to attract small songbirds by mimicking their calls, so it may attempt to catch them for food.|$|E
