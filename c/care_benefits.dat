25|$|Income {{generally}} includes most {{types of}} receipts that enrich the taxpayer, including compensation for services, gain from {{sale of goods}} or other property, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, annuities, pensions, {{and all manner of}} other items.

40|$|In {{recent years}} Austrian family policy {{was aimed at}} {{improving}} individual work-life balances and increasing the participation of fathers. This included introducing child <b>care</b> <b>benefit</b> months that cannot be transferred between partners, adding a short-term income-dependent option to the original lump-sum child <b>care</b> <b>benefit</b> payments, creating additional child care facilities for under-three-year-olds and offering afternoon care for school children. Nevertheless, monetary benefits are still considerably more prevalent in Austria than in other countries. In combination with other schemes, such as long-term child <b>care</b> <b>benefit</b> options, the substantially lower earnings on average {{of women in the}} labour market and, not least, marked popular scepticism of working mothers with small children, the current structure of family benefits tends to bolster a family model which provides for mothers to undertake most of the care duties and for fathers to pursue the role of main bread-winner.

25|$|The {{exemption}} of employer-sponsored {{health benefits}} from federal income and payroll taxes distorts {{the health care}} market. The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded health <b>care</b> <b>benefits</b> as a taxable benefit in kind to the employee. The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated $150billion a year. Some regard this as being disadvantageous {{to people who have}} to buy insurance in the individual market which must be paid from income received after tax.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s and 2000s, many {{employers}} who promised lifetime health coverage to their retirees limited or eliminated those benefits. ERISA {{does not provide}} for vesting of health <b>care</b> <b>benefits</b> {{in the way that}} employees become vested in their accrued pension benefits. Employees and retirees who were promised lifetime health coverage may be able to enforce those promises by suing the employer for breach of contract, or by challenging the right of the health benefit plan to change its plan documents to eliminate promised benefits.|$|E

25|$|Particularly {{in rural}} areas, the Allende Government {{launched}} a campaign against illiteracy, while adult education programs expanded, together with educational opportunities for workers. From 1971 through to 1973, enrollments in kindergarten, primary, secondary, and postsecondary schools all increased. The Allende Government encouraged more doctors to begin their practices in rural and low-income urban areas, and built additional hospitals, maternity clinics, and especially neighborhood health centers that remained open longer hours to serve the poor. Improved sanitation and housing facilities for low-income neighborhoods also equalized health <b>care</b> <b>benefits,</b> while hospital councils and local health councils were established in neighborhood health centers {{as a means of}} democratizing the administration of health policies. These councils gave central government civil servants, local government officials, health service employees, and community workers the right to review budgetary decisions.|$|E
25|$|Following his retirement, Day {{wrote an}} autobiographical {{account of his}} {{experiences}} as a prisoner of war, Return with Honor, followed by Duty, Honor, Country, which updated his autobiography to include his post–Air Force years. Among other endeavors, in 1996 Day filed a class action lawsuit for breach of contract against the United States government on behalf of military retirees who were stripped of their military medical <b>care</b> <b>benefits</b> at age 65 and told to apply for Medicare. Although winning {{the case in the}} district court in 2001, the judgment against the U.S. was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2002. Congress later redressed this situation by establishing the TRICARE for Life (TFL) program, which restored TRICARE military medical benefits for career military retirees over the age of 65, making the retirees eligible for both programs with Medicare as the primary payer and TRICARE as the secondary payer.|$|E
50|$|A Long Term <b>Care</b> <b>Benefit</b> Plan is {{also known}} as an Assurance Benefit Plan. A Benefit Plan is {{separate}} from a long term care insurance policy because it allows policy holders to use any form of life insurance policies to pay for long term care. The plan converts a death benefit into a living benefit. Life insurance policies can be converted into a Long Term <b>Care</b> <b>Benefit</b> Plan for 30 to 60 percent of the policy amount to be used for long term care. The sale of a life insurance policy can keep people off Medicaid. By exchanging a life insurance policy for a Long Term <b>Care</b> <b>Benefit</b> Plan, the benefits go toward long term care including assisted living, home health care, and nursing homes. The conversion takes away the responsibility of premium payments from the family and there is no wait period before benefits begin. The policy transfer is subject to regulatory standards in each state. Benefits are deposited into a FDIC-insured benefit account that follows federal and state banking regulations and is held by a nationally chartered bank and trust company. The benefit payments are then made directly to the health care facility on a monthly basis.|$|R
