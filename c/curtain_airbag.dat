5000|$|Curtain airbags {{have been}} said to reduce brain injury or {{fatalities}} by up to 45% in a side impact with an SUV. These airbags come in various forms (e.g., tubular, curtain, door-mounted) depending {{on the needs of}} the application.

50|$|The Volvo C70 {{retractable}} hardtop {{includes a}} door-mounted side-impact protection inflatable curtain which inflates upward {{from the interior}} belt-line - vs. downward like the typical <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag.</b> The curtain has an extra stiff construction with double rows of slats that are slightly offset from each other. This allows them to remain upright and offer effective head protection even with an open window. The curtain also deflates slowly to provide protection should the car roll over.|$|E
50|$|In May 1998, Toyota began {{offering}} a side <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag</b> deploying {{from the roof}} on the Progrés. In 1998 the Volvo S80 was given roof-mounted curtain airbags to protect both front and rear passengers. Curtain airbags were then made standard equipment on all new Volvo cars from 2000 except for the first generation C70 which received an enlarged side torso airbag that also protects the head of front seat occupants. The second generation C70 convertible received the world's first door-mounted side-curtain airbags that deployed upwards.|$|E

50|$|Euro NCAP {{evaluated}} the V70 in 2007 awarding it 5 of 5 stars for adult occupant protection. The V70 scored 15 of 16 {{points in the}} front test and 16 of 16 in the side test. The car was penalised 1 point in the pole test for improper deployment of the <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag</b> in both the original test and the re-test. The car received one of two points available in the pole test. The V70 was granted an additional two points for seat belt reminders of three available in this category. The V70 received a total of 34 of 37 points and therefore five stars (33-37) in EuroNCAP's evaluation.|$|E

50|$|The Acura RDX is {{the second}} Acura vehicle to feature the Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body {{structure}} {{which is designed to}} absorb energy from a collision. The RDX comes standard with six airbags, including dual front airbags, front side airbags and dual side curtain airbags. The front airbags use a dual-threshold, dual-stage technology that can adjust the timing and speed of each airbag deployment depending on the degree of impact and the driver's or front passenger's seat belt usage. If sensors deem the front passenger too small (less than 65 lb), the front airbag is designed not to deploy. The front passenger's side airbag is also designed to shut off if a child or small-statured adult is leaning into the airbag's deployment path. In the event of a sufficient side impact or roll-over, the side <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag</b> deploys from above the door frames of the affected side, with coverage for both the front and rear occupants on that side, and stays inflated longer than if there were a collision.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) the Cobalt {{receives}} an overall top score of [...] "Good" [...] for front collisions.However, it receives a [...] "Poor" [...] overall score for side impacts without side <b>curtain</b> <b>airbags,</b> and an [...] "Acceptable" [...] overall score with side <b>curtain</b> <b>airbags.</b> In 2008 side <b>curtain</b> <b>airbags</b> became standard but the Cobalt's structure {{remains the same}} and consequently in structure/safety category of the IIHS's side impact test the Cobalt receives a [...] "Marginal" [...] score. Side airbags are limited to the curtain type, torso type side airbags are unavailable. According to the IIHS's injury measurements taken from the side impact test the driver's torso is given a [...] "Marginal" [...] score.|$|R

40|$|Several new {{varieties}} of airbags are under consideration for development. However, their commercialization decision must be {{backed by a}} positive Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA) outcome. In this study, we propose a CBA framework for the frontal center <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag,</b> a newly designed safety system intended to reduce the injury risk of rear-seat passengers. The proposed CBA covers not only economic benefits of the producer but also the effectiveness in sustainable reduction of the fatal and injury rate. In this context, with accumulated field data on road traffic accidents, a forecasting method reflecting the reduced casualties and the market share of vehicle sales associated with frontal center <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag</b> is utilized. Our {{results suggest that the}} use of frontal center curtain airbags helps {{to reduce the number of}} casualties with a Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) of 3 or above by 87. 4 %. Furthermore, both the initial market penetration rate and price of the frontal center <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag</b> significantly influence its socioeconomic benefits. By evaluating the effectiveness of the frontal center <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag,</b> our study can contribute to the decision making for its commercialization...|$|E
40|$|Traffic related {{trauma is}} {{the most common cause of}} {{fatality}} and severe injury to children in developed countries. The majority of these fatalities and injuries are caused by frontal and side impacts. Researchers agree that the head {{is the most}} important body region to protect for all ages of children, while the thorax is equally important for older children. Injury epidemiology has shown that special attention is needed for the 3 -year-olds in boosters and the 12 -year-olds in seat belts only. The aim of this thesis is to develop mathematical frontal and side impact models and to use them to investigate and define the beneficial characteristics of restraint systems and other crash-related car parameters. It must be emphasized that children are better protected in rear-facing child restraints; they should remain rear-facing for as long as possible. Most children have outgrown the large rear-facing restraints by the age of about 4 years. This work concentrates on injury mitigation for those who have transited to forward-facing restraints. Models for two load cases were developed and validated. One of them was a frontal impact type, and the other was a near-side impact type. The frontal model was used both for a parameter study, to define beneficial restraint system characteristics for 3 -year-olds, and for reconstructing three crashes in order to evaluate the head kinematics of the occupant model. The characteristics of the side impact load case were defined by analyzing real life crashes involving child occupants. The near-side impact model was used for a parameter study to define beneficial restraint system characteristics for 3 - and 12 -year-olds. It was also used to evaluate and propose improvements to the restraint systems within a range of common sitting positions for 12 -year-olds. The validations carried out here showed that the models developed were suitable tools for conducting comparative studies of injury mitigation systems in both frontal and near-side impacts. The parameter studies showed that several of the restraint systems for adults also reduced the values measured by the child model. In the near-side impact, a <b>curtain</b> <b>airbag,</b> a thorax-pelvis airbag and a seat belt with a pretensioner reduced the head and chest injury measures of the two occupant models. To help mitigate injuries resulting from a frontal impact, the upper belt anchor point should be positioned so that the belt is routed near mid-shoulder (slightly toward the neck) and encloses the shoulder (tight fit). The lap belt anchor points should be positioned to make the lap belt angle as horizontal as possible without inducing submarining. Seat belts with pretensioners and load limiters also reduced the head injury measures for the 3 -year-old occupant model. In side impacts, the results of the evaluation of common sitting positions suggested that extensive outboard, inboard and forward positions should be discouraged, while the restraint systems should be adapted to function with slight inboard, outboard and forward positions. This can be achieved with side supports integrated in the seat back, pre-impact (pre-brake) trigged seat belts, high performance full cell coverage curtain airbags, and/or thorax-pelvis airbags with an extended cover area. These findings are significant contributions to the continuous work of mitigating traffic accident induced injuries and fatalities to children...|$|E
