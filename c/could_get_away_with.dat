No records of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with,</b> we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the band's {{popularity}} {{began to}} soar as the band, especially Dee and Jay Jay, {{started to talk}} (rap) to the audience about current topics of the day between songs.

25|$|The Wykagyl {{course is}} hilly, tree-lined and very {{beautiful}} accented by its stone tees. It is old fashioned, primarily because the three architects who were mainly {{responsible for the}} layout of the course - Lawrence Van Enen, Donald Ross and A. W. Tillinghast - all practiced their art over 60 years ago. Because of this it has small greens and more blind shots than any architect <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> designing today.|$|E

50|$|String datatypes have {{historically}} allocated one byte per character, and, although the exact character set varied by region, character encodings were similar enough that programmers <b>could</b> often <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> ignoring this, since characters a program treated specially (such as period and space and comma) {{were in the}} same place in all the encodings a program would encounter. These character sets were typically based on ASCII or EBCDIC.|$|R
25|$|The main {{proponent of}} using {{ejection}} seats was James Chamberlin, {{head of the}} engineering division of NASA's Space Force Task Group. Chamberlin had never liked the Mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight. He reviewed several films of Atlas and Titan II ICBM failures, which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the Titan II would produce a much smaller explosion, thus the spacecraft <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> ejection seats.|$|E
25|$|In the one-day series again Pakistan in the UAE, BBC Sport {{commentator}} Jonathan Agnew {{stated that}} Hales' technique {{was simply too}} fallible outside off stump, planting his front foot on middle stump and playing with a bat two feet away from his body. Agnew surmised that whilst in 20 and 50 over cricket with no slips Hales <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> this issue, in test cricket he could not. In the first three tests in South Africa, Hales' technique was cruelly exposed by their fast-bowling attack. In the first Tests he made scores of 10 and 26, although England {{went on to win}} the game by 241 runs. In a high scoring second Test, Hales made 60 in the first innings but was dismissed for just five in the second. In the third Test, he was out for one in the first innings as England made 323. He was out for 18 in the second innings, as England went onto secure a seven wicket victory. In the final match of the series, he again struggled, and after making 15 in the first innings, he was out for just one in the second innings as England were bowled out for just 101. Despite the heavy defeat, England won the series 2-1.|$|E
500|$|The {{part where}} Connie asks for safe passage to New Zealand was a [...] "sly {{personal}} reference" [...] to Cross, as the writer himself {{resides in the}} country. In one scene, Lucas can be seen breaking into a car and getting his hands on various items that {{would be useful to}} help set up traps against the FSB officers. Throughout the episode's development, the items kept changing. There were also staff discussions about what they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> in terms of the protagonists killing FSB officers. The most prominent discussions included Harry strangling one officer with his necktie, and Lucas shooting another in the head in cold blood despite being unarmed and subdued.|$|E

500|$|Met by an {{audience}} largely {{unaware of the}} Daddies' eclectic background, Soul Caddy was received negatively by both fans and critics, {{one of the more}} prevalent criticisms being its lack of swing tracks. Many reviewers chastised the band for what was being seen as an abandonment of their swing [...] "roots" [...] in favor of a trendier sound, while some criticized the Daddies' entire musical aesthetic — UGO's Hip Online stated bluntly, [...] "covering five or six genres on one album is just insane". The Los Angeles Daily News placed Soul Caddy on their list of the 10 worst albums of 2000, the reviewer wondering what made a swing band [...] "think it <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> an album of recycled psychedelic pop".|$|E

[...] "I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them.

500|$|The song {{opens with}} 45 seconds of soft synthesizers and {{ethereal}} vocals, somewhat akin in atmospherics to the group's early 1980s songs [...] "Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Drowning Man"; during this, Bono laments that [...] "sometimes I feel like checking out." [...] This {{is followed by}} the entrance of drums and guitar in a familiar U2 rhythm, as Bono describes the burdens of love and how he is [...] "in the black; can't see or be seen." [...] Each verse culminates with the refrain [...] "Baby, baby, baby, light my way." [...] Flood, who engineered and mixed the recording, noted that there was considerable laughter and debate during the sessions about whether Bono <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> singing the repeated [...] "baby"s, one of the most heavily used clichés in pop songs and one that he had avoided up to that point in his songwriting; Flood later commented that [...] "he got away with it alright." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, she guessed {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} guess it was Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{created by}} Victor Miller, Jason's final design was a {{combined}} effort by Miller, Ron Kurz, and Tom Savini. The name [...] "Jason" [...] {{is a combination}} of [...] "Josh" [...] and [...] "Ian", Miller's two sons, and [...] "Voorhees" [...] was inspired by a girl that Miller knew at high school whose last name was Van Voorhees. Miller felt it was a [...] "creepy-sounding name", which was perfect for his character. Miller initially wrote Jason as a normal-looking child, but the crew behind the film decided he needed to be deformed. Victor Miller explained Jason was not meant to be a creature from the [...] "Black Lagoon" [...] in his script, and scripted Jason as a mentally disabled young boy; it was Savini who made Jason deformed. Ron Kurz confirmed that Miller's version of Jason was that of a normal child, but claims that it was his idea to turn Jason into a [...] "mongoloid creature", and have him [...] "jump out of the lake {{at the end of the}} film". Miller later agreed the ending would not have been as good if he looked like [...] "Betsy Palmer at eight years old". Miller wrote a scene where Alice dreams she is attacked in a canoe by Jason, and then she wakes up in a hospital bed. Miller's intention was to get as close to Carries ending as possible. Savini believed having Jason pop out of the lake would be psychologically disturbing to the audience, and since Alice is supposed to be dreaming, the crew <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> adding anything they wanted.|$|E
500|$|Journalists have {{described}} [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" [...] as a satire on American politics. Joanne Ostrow, a reviewer for The Denver Post, said only a cartoon <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> [...] "such pointed satire" [...] of American political campaigning and advertising that is {{featured in the}} episode. She compared it to the [...] "counter-cultural posture" [...] television shows such as Second City Television and Saturday Night Live took in the mid-1970s: [...] "In those days, this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time. , it's still relegated to the (distant) fourth network, {{but at least the}} time is prime." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk wrote: [...] "The writers of The Simpsons have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political/social commentary takes a step closer to the foreground during this episode." [...] Al Jean, current show runner of The Simpsons, has himself admitted in an interview that the show is of a [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (one of the writers of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are libertarian. The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.|$|E
60|$|The Belgian nodded. He was {{thinking}} rapidly. If he could persuade Achmet Zek {{to send him}} {{in command of the}} party which took Lady Greystoke north it would give him the opportunity he craved to make his escape from his chief.

50|$|One of Wang's {{most notorious}} and {{successful}} attempt occurred during Chiang's {{first attempt to}} spread his power to Guizhou by establishing Kuomintang party memberships in Guizhou that was previously non-existent. Wang first refused Chiang's request, but later {{when he realized that}} he <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it, Wang answered Chiang by claiming that everyone in Guizhou would become a member of Kuomintang. Chiang was too far away to offer any actual help to his recruiters in Guizhou, and as a result, recruiters had to randomly circle names from the local population registry in order to fulfill their task and Wang thus successfully thwarted Chiang's initial takeover attempt.|$|R
5000|$|Villa further {{states that}} Other Losses wrongly cites a March CCS {{directive}} to Eisenhower, claiming that it directs Eisenhower to {{not take any}} prisoners after Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, when in fact, the directive states that those taken after V-E day should not be designated as [...] "Prisoners of War" [...] under the Geneva Convention. In fact, JCS 1067 required Eisenhower to continue to take prisoners after V-E Day. Moreover, if Bacque truly believes that Eisenhower was supposed to stop taking prisoners, Villa states that Bacque {{does not explain how}} Eisenhower <b>could</b> have <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> taking 2 million prisoners after this date without CCS action.|$|R
500|$|Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat {{wanted the}} episode to be [...] "big" [...] {{and say that}} [...] "we are turning {{it up to a}} level, we are really going mad with it". Atmospheric {{lighting}} was added by director of photography Stephan Pehrsson, who wanted to give it a movie feel. Moffat chose Stonehenge as the primary location for the episode because the monument was large and important enough to be suitable for the fall of someone as powerful as the Doctor. Filming was done at the real Stonehenge in Wiltshire on the night of 2 February 2010. The cast and crew had to abide by regulations; they were not allowed to touch the stones, bring heavy equipment in, and the lighting had to be done from the floor. They could only afford to shoot during one night and spent the only hour of daylight in the morning shooting a three-minute dialogue sequence. This proved to be a challenge, as it typically took {{an hour and a half}} to film similar scenes. The rest of the scenes set at Stonehenge were filmed with a lightweight replica set up in Margam Country Park called [...] "Foamhenge" [...] over four nights. Director Toby Haynes thought that they had [...] "established" [...] Stonehenge at the real site and now <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> seeing less of it. The Doctor's speech to the alien spaceships was filmed 3 February, while Rory shooting Amy was shot on 4 February. The weather conditions were very cold with wind and rain which caused difficulties as it was hard to communicate over the wind. Haynes wanted the Doctor's speech to be his [...] "big, pop-star moment" [...] and to look as if he was addressing a large site such as Wembley Stadium.|$|E
500|$|... "Treasure" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard wrote that one [...] "gets {{the feeling that}} 'Treasure', with its grand harmonies, classically kooky hooks and slyly sexual undertones, is the musical mode that makes Mars the happiest", while Spins Dan Hyman favorably compared [...] "Treasure" [...] {{to the work of}} American disco artist Donna Summer. Journalist Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a rating of 4 out of 5, and noted that it [...] "sounds like a modern day 'Rock with You', a feat that few <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> pulling off so authentically". Katie Hasty, while reviewing the songs of the summer of 2013, said [...] "it looks like it was culled straight out of Soul Train". Ryan Reed of Paste Magazine gave the song a positive review, and described [...] "Treasure" [...] as a [...] "stripper-theme funk-pop with gooey synth pads and enormous slap-bass fills that punch through like air-humps". Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commented that [...] "Treasure" [...] is [...] "creamy Michael Jackson/Prince-schooled disco soul", while Matt Cibula from Pop Matters also compared the [...] "funky" [...] song to the work of those two musicians when he said that [...] "Treasure" [...] "knows that a flirt beats a bleat any day". Matthew Horton from BBC Music wrote that the track has a [...] "sugary early 80s funk", and that it [...] "is lathered in so much slap bass it starts to sting". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club wrote that for this [...] "disco-spiked" [...] song, Mars [...] "capably sells himself as a one-man Maroon 5". Tim Sendra of AllMusic found that the song had a [...] "easy-going charm" [...] of the previous album, and described it as [...] "MJ-inspired disco jam". On a mixed review for The Scotsman, Fiona Shepherd wrote that [...] "Treasure" [...] is [...] "likeable pop funk".|$|E
2500|$|John Willes (1778 in Headcorn, Kent – 5 August 1852 in Staunton, Gloucester) was an English cricketer who, {{though he}} made only five known {{first-class}} appearances, {{had a significant}} impact on the game's history and development.

500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them.

I very much doubted that this was the case." ...|$|R
50|$|In the story, Gandil {{admitted}} to leading the plot {{to throw the}} Series and expressed guilt and remorse over having done so. However, he claimed that after an initial payment was made, the players actually abandoned the plan and had ultimately tried their best to win. According to Gandil's story, the rumors which had spread about the Series being fixed (triggered by a sudden influx of money being bet on the Reds) caused the players to conclude that they <b>could</b> never <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> throwing the Series, as their every move would be closely scrutinized. Instead, they decided to betray the gamblers and keep the cash. While he believed that Landis' decision to ban them all was draconian, he felt they deserved to be banned just for talking to the gamblers.|$|R
5000|$|Jacob Robinson of Daily Review {{gave the}} album 2.5 out of 5, saying; [...] "Album opener and lead single [...] "Hallelujah" [...] has a stomping beat and a shout-along chorus that creates some dynamics. [...] "Cut Me Loose" [...] manages to mesh soulful organ with some crunchy guitars in a {{pleasing}} manner. The {{best of the}} bunch is the title track, which at attempts to challenge the group’s song writing abilities and shows they can extend themselves. Other than that, it's a pretty same-same host of dull, mid-tempo rockers. They <b>could</b> probably <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it {{if any of the}} songs had a really cracking hook to stick in your brain like [...] "My Gun" [...] or [...] "Lay it Down" [...] did on their first album — but it does not." ...|$|R

2500|$|Although Willes {{had quit}} the game, {{he had made}} his point and others were willing to pick his ball up and persevere. In 1826, Sussex had the best team in England and were {{acclaimed}} as the [...] "Champion County" [...] in some quarters. Their success owed much to the prowess of two top-class bowlers William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge, both of whom were champions of the roundarm style, when they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it. Lillywhite was one of the all-time great bowlers and was nicknamed [...] "the Nonpareil".|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the films}} noir of the classic period were {{similarly}} low- and modestly budgeted features without major stars—B movies either literally or in spirit. In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character <b>could</b> literally <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> murder or be seen sharing a bed with anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time.|$|R
5000|$|Contrasting the {{recording}} of Vitals to that of their previous album, Meany has stated that [...] "The challenge for this record was how few notes <b>could</b> we <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with?</b> We would overplay all the time, recording this record, {{but then it was}} a process of trying to now skim it back. What are the essential parts of the song? We were trying to see how loud we could let simplicity happen for each song idea." [...] He also explained that the process was highly collaborative, with all band members sharing responsibilities: [...] "Our approach on this record was not, 'All right, you do guitar. You do bass. You do drums.' It was, 'OK, today we're doing drums. Today we're doing synths.' All four of us, speaking into whatever the part was, were trying to find the best part." ...|$|R
