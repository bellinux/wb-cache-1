Apoptosis was induced by etoposide (an inhibitor of topoisomerase II), by the calcium ionophore ionomycin or by cross-linking of membrane immunoglobulins (Ig) with anti-Ig-antibodies. Two types of apoptosis could be defined. Apoptosis resulting in small DNA fragments (180 – 200 base pairs and multiples thereof) {{was associated with a}} typical ‘ladder’ in agarose gel electrophoresis and a decrease in cell DNA content assessed by flow cytometry. Conversely apoptosis with large DNA fragments (100 – 150 kilobase pairs) was only demonstrated by <b>clamped</b> homogeneous <b>electric</b> field but was not associated with decreased cell DNA content or the observation of DNA ladders.

40|$|Here we {{demonstrate}} that MnTe epitaxial films with zinc-blend structure and MnTe/ZnTe multilayers should show ferroelectric polarization in antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered state and thus belong to multiferroics.

Orientation of ferroelectric polarization is coupled with orientation of AFM vector and thus can be controlled by application of the external magnetic field. Due to the <b>clamping</b> of <b>electric</b> and magnetic order parameters, domain structure in MnTe is governed by two mechanisms: depolarizing field produced by electric dipoles and destressing field produced by magnetoelastic dipoles.

Incorporation of arachidonic acid acyl chains in the phospholipids of cellular membranes of mouse fibroblast LM cells enhanced their sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of eupatoriopicrin. In the clonogenic assay (2 h exposure) 90 % cell kill was found with 14. 4 muM eupatoriopicrin in normal cells and 11. 7 muM in cells enriched with arachidonic acid (PUFA cells). After incubation with eupatoriopicrin a more rapid loss of membrane integrity and more lysis was found for PUFA cells in the trypan blue exclusion assay. Using gas chromatography, it was shown that the spectrum of fatty acid acyl chains in the phospholipids of normal cells remained unchanged after 2 h incubation with 20 muM eupatoripicrin, followed by 24 h post-incubation. In PUFA cells the polyunsaturated fatty acids were found to degrade possibly due to lipid peroxidation. Using the alkaline unwinding assay and <b>clamped</b> homogeneous <b>electric</b> field electrophoresis, more DNA damage was found in PUFA cells than in normal cells after treatment with eupatoriopicrin. However, because in normal cells, in which PUFA were nearly absent, DNA damage was found as well, it is concluded that lipid peroxidation plays at most a minor role in eupatoriopicrin-induced cell killing...|$|R

The discriminatory power and reproducibility of Hunter’s modified scheme of Phongpaichit’s morphotyping has been evaluated on 28 C. albicans isolates recovered from the oral cavity of asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-positive subjects, and compared to two molecular typing methods: randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting, and contour <b>clamped</b> homogeneous <b>electric</b> field (CHEF) electrophoretic karyotyping. Morpho-logical features of streak colonies allowed to distinguish 11 different morphotypes while RAPD fingerprinting yielded 25 different patterns and CHEF electrophoresis recognized 9 karyotypes.

NotI and XbaI generated 36 and 33 restriction endonuclease digestion profiles (REDP), respectively. By combining the results of both enzymes, 42 unique genomic groups were differentiated. DNA fragments were transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with digoxigenin-labelled oligonucleotide probes to the ail gene and virulence plasmid to determine hybridization patterns and the potential virulence of the strains. The strains were tested {{for the presence of}} the plasmid by PFGE-CHEF and phenotypic characteristics encoded for by the virulence plasmid. Thirty of the 60 Y. enterocolitica strains tested harbored the virulence plasmid. The specificity of the ail and pYV probes was 100 % when tested with 68 Yersinia strains and 19 different non-Yersinia strains. Sixteen selected Y. enterocolitica strains were tested for their virulence by lethality in iron- and desferrioxamine-sensitized mice. No correlation between REDP and the virulence of the strains was observed. The observed REDP and the hybridization patterns were very homogeneous within a serogroup and independent of the source of isolation.

Various human, animal, food, and environmental isolates, {{as well as}} strains representing other Listeria species, were separately digested with rarely cutting endonucleases. Of 176 L. monocytogenes strains analyzed, the enzymes AscI and ApaI established 63 and 72 unique restriction endonuclease digestion profiles (REDP), respectively. The 22 non-L. monocytogenes strains exhibited 18 AscI and 19 ApaI unique REDP. Statistical analyses of REDP information using the Dice coincidence index and principal component analysis revealed two distinct genomic divisions of L. monocytogenes that also correlated with the flagellar (H) antigen type: division I contained serovar 1 / 2 a, 1 / 2 c, 3 a, and 3 c stains and division II contained serovar 1 / 2 b, 3 b, 4 b, 4 d, and 4 e strains. Division I isolates digested with ApaI were further grouped into cluster IA (serovar 1 / 2 c and 3 c) and cluster IB (serovar 1 / 2 a and 3 a) strains. Likewise, division II isolates digested with ApaI were further grouped into cluster IIA (serovar 1 / 2 b and 3 b) and cluster IIB (serovar 4 b, 4 d, and 4 e) strains.

Cellular toxicity was analysed under oxic conditions with the microculture tetrazolium assay. For the platinum and radiation toxicity with the clinically relevant dose ranges applied, this assay {{was used to}} obtain information on cell survival after the treatments. Apart from effects on cell survival effects on DNA were also investigated. Configurational DNA changes could be induced by platinum drugs and thereby these drugs might change the frequency of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs). DNA fragmentation assayed with the <b>clamped</b> homogeneous <b>electric</b> field (CHEF) technique {{was used as a}} measure for dsbs in DNA. The radiosensitising effect of the platinum drugs was expressed as enhancement ratio (ER) calculated directly from survival levels of the initial slope of the curve.

Carboplatin showed increased enhancement with prolonged incubation up to 1. 21 in GLC 4 and was equally effective as cisplatin in GLC 4 -CDDP.

Induction and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in a freshly prepared cell suspension from a RIF- 1 tumor (irradiated ex vivo) was compared with DSB induction and repair in exponentially growing RIF- 1 cells in culture (irradiated in vitro). Methods and Materials: A murine RIF- 1 tumor grown in vivo was digested, and cells {{were exposed to}} x-rays (ex vivo) at doses of 1 to 75 Gy. DNA damage was measured using CHEF (<b>clamped</b> homogeneous <b>electric</b> fields) electrophoresis. Repair kinetics were studied at 37 degrees C for 4 h after irradiation, Radiosensitivity was determined by clonogenic assay, and cell cycle distributions by flow cytometry. For comparison, a trypsinized suspension of exponentially growing RIF- 1 cells in vitro was run parallel with each ex vivo experiment. Results: Induction of DSBs, expressed as % DNA extracted from the plug, was similar in the in vitro and ex vivo irradiated cells, Compared to repair rates in in vitro cultured RIF- 1 cells, repair kinetics in a freshly prepared cell suspension from the tumor were decreased, unrelated to differences in radiosensitivity. Differences in repair could not be explained by endogenous DNA degradation, nor by influences of enzymes used for digestion of the tumor. A lower plating efficiency and differences in ploidy (as revealed by how cytometry) were the only reproducible differences between in vivo and in vitro grown cells that may explain the differences in repair kinetics.

Attempts were made to develop a high efficiency isolation and regeneration system for both L. edodes and P. sajor-caju. Relatively low yields of protoplasts from L. edodes and their poor regenerative ability limited their use. Howewer, Pleurotus spp. were found to be quite amenable to protoplast isolation, yielding constantly high yields of viable protoplasts. Extensive mating-type analysis of monokaryotic isolates of L. edodus was carried out. Characterization of 17 commercial strains of L. edodes were found to have 9 different A factors and 10 different B factors, whilst four wild-type isolates from China were shown to have 8 different A factors and 8 different B factors. Analysis of several L. edodus strains revealed anomalous ratios of mating-type factors in basidiospore progeny which deviated from the expected 1 : 1 : 1 : 1. Four strains having this imbalance had several A and B factors in common. Protoplasts were used to obtain neohaplonts from dikaryotic mycelia, however, the ratio of the two nuclear types often deviated from the 1 : 1 ratio of the dikayon.

There was no evidence of more than one chromosomal location or more than one copy of the nisin gene. The restriction patterns indicated that the size of the L. lactis genome is about 2, 500 kb. The previously observed (G. W. Buchman, S. Banerjee, and J. N. Hansen, J. Biol. Chem. 263 : 16260 - 16266, 1988) downstream open reading frame (ORF) was fully sequenced to reveal an 851 -amino-acid coding region, an upstream putative mRNA processing site, and a putative rho-independent terminator. The ORF was analyzed for secondary structural features, and the sequence data bases were searched for homologies. The ORF contained many amphipathic helices, a C-terminal transmembrane helix, and homologies to some membrane-associated proteins. It lacked an N-terminal membrane insertion sequence and accordingly appears to be associated with, and anchored to, the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. An additional ORF that possessed a ribosome-binding sequence and tandem promoters, indicating {{the beginning of a new}} operon, was identified still farther downstream. The results were consistent with the nisin gene being part of a polycistronic operon with a size greater than 8. 5 kb...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been made on the cam-clamping device. In this article, we consider specifically the calculations of cam geometry, calculations of clamping force and clamping torque, conditions for self-locking, and conditions for contact strength. Machine fixtures are essential {{in the process of}} mechanical manufacturing. There are many different types of fixtures, such as manual jig, pneumatic <b>clamps,</b> hydraulic fixtures, <b>electric</b> fixtures, etc. There are also many ways of clamping, such as incline clamp, screw clamp, eccentric circle clamp, hinge clamp [1], among which the eccentric circle clamp finds wide applications, especially in fast-clamping devices. Although the circular eccentric fixture possesses the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and low cost, it suffers the drawbacks of small clamping force, short clamping-surface travel distance, and unreliable self-locking mechanism. The cam-clamping device discussesed in this article involves replaceing the eccentric circle with a cam, as shown in Fig. 1. The cam profile curve can be designed according to any requirements. The advantages of this replacement are obvious, in addition to preserving the advantages of the circular eccentric fixture, the cam-clamping can be designed according to the actual needs of clamping paths and selection of the appropriate cam profile to improve the self-locking...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between moderate-dose radiation and cisplatin or carboplatin was studied in a cisplatin-sensitive (GLC 4) and -resistant (GLC 4 -CDDP) human small-cell lung cancer cell line. Cellular toxicity was analysed under oxic conditions with the microculture tetrazolium assay. For the platinum and radiation toxicity with the clinically relevant dose ranges applied, this assay {{was used to}} obtain information on cell survival after the treatments. Apart from effects on cell survival effects on DNA were also investigated. Configurational DNA changes could be induced by platinum drugs and thereby these drugs might change the frequency of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs). DNA fragmentation assayed with the <b>clamped</b> homogeneous <b>electric</b> field (CHEF) technique {{was used as a}} measure for dsbs in DNA. The radiosensitising effect of the platinum drugs was expressed as enhancement ratio (ER) calculated directly from survival levels of the initial slope of the curve. The highest ER for cisplatin in GLC 4 was 1. 39 and in GLC 4 -CDDP 1. 38. These were all at 75 % cell survival. Carboplatin showed increased enhancement with prolonged incubation up to 1. 21 in GLC 4 and was equally effective as cisplatin in GLC 4 -CDDP. According to isobologram analysis, prolonged incubation with both platinum drugs showed at least additivity with radiation for both cell lines at clinically achievable doses. GLC 4 -CDDP showed cross-resistance to radiation. The radiosensitising capacity of both lung cancer cell lines was not dependent on their platinum sensitivity. The formation of dsbs in DNA directly after radiation was not influenced by pretreatment of either drug in the sensitive or in the resistant cell line. Drug treatment resulted in decreased DNA extractability in control as well as in irradiated cells. Modest enhancement ratio for radiosensitisation by platinum drugs cannot be explained on the level of dsb formation in DNA in both cell lines. Interaction of radiation with the clinically less toxic carboplatin can be improved by prolonged low-dose carboplatin exposure before irradiation and is as potent as cisplatin in the resistant lung cancer cell line. This suggests an advantage in combining radiation and carboplatin in lung cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|Smart Structures and Materials 2005 : Smart Structures and Integrated Systems, San Diego, California, USA, 6 - 10 March 2005 The {{development}} of a novel piezoelectric induced-strain actuator possessing an innovative internal amplifying structure is presented in this paper. This actuator basically consists of a metal frame and two lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric ceramic patches. The metal frame is bent to form an open trapezoid, where its center part has a specially designed saddle-like unit and its slanting legs are attached with PZT patches. The saddle-like unit has an amplifying-lever mechanism at the corners to increase the displacement output of the whole actuator even its legs are mechanically <b>clamped.</b> When an <b>electric</b> field is applied across {{the thickness of the}} PZT patches, the patches induce deformations on the whole actuator through the piezoelectric d 31 effect. The saddle-like unit can relax the constraints at the joints between the unit and the legs by stretching itself during bending. Piezoelectric finite element analysis is used to maximize the work output of displacement and blocked force of the actuator under different geometric parameters. The results are in good agreement with those obtained from quasi-static measurements, showing that the actuator has work output comparable to and larger than the existing induced-strain actuators (e. g., THUNDER) under fixed mounting conditions. Therefore, the actuator has great potential for use in various practical smart structures and integrated systems, including active-passive vibration isolation and micro-positioning.
