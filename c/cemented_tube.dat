50|$|The {{origins of}} the {{neighborhood}} date from 1905, when Iñigo Noriega proposed urbanizing what was then called Colonia La Paz.

The project then stalled. In 1913, the Agrícola y Colonizadora Mexicana Company proposed a similar project, but this, too, ran into problems. By 1920, there were houses and blocks but only semi-organized, with houses and other properties encroaching on other private properties and colonias. At this time, a large canal still ran through the area. To the side of this canal, the Cuauhtémoc borough decided to build a large road to the side it, which is Calzada de Chabacano.

Opaque polyethylene, brass (pretreated with Clearfil SE bond), and transparent polyethylene tubes respectively, were filled with the different <b>cements.</b> The <b>tubes</b> were 20 mm long with an inner diameter of 1. 6 or 1. 8 mm.

The specimens were trimmed to an hour-glass shape with a neck diameter of 1 mm, stored in water (37 °C, 24 h), and subjected to microtensile testing (1 mm min− 1). SEM analysis was carried out on chemically cured samples of DC Core Automix C = 0 and C = 25. Data were statistically analyzed (Two-way ANOVA, Tukey's post hoc test, p < 0. 05).

40|$|Background The {{value of}} {{external}} fixation in complex hand injuries is well established. Expenses and technical difficulties of commercial mini external fixator sets {{have led to}} the innovation of handmade external fixators. These fixators are used as versatile facilities to treat certain hand fractures. Usually, these structures are made by k-wires crossed filled with <b>cement</b> plastic <b>tube.</b> However, these fixators have multiple deficiencies that should be addressed. Objectives In this study, we described in detail the surgical technique of a handmade concrete like mini external fixator and report its clinical use and results. Methods Our handmade external fixator was applied for 52 patients with 56 fractures. Only 5 % of the fractures were closed, non-comminuted extra-articular, and the other 51 fractures were more complex injuries. The mean follow up time was 9. 3 months. At the end of the follow up, radiologic and functional assessment (DASH: Disability of arm, shoulder and hand and TAM: Total active motion) was evaluated. Results All 56 fractures were united completely. None of the cases experienced pin loosening or reduction loss. Of the fractures, 8. 9 % malunited due to fracture complexity. The mean dash score was 3. 76. TAM was excellent in 45 % of the fractures; it was good in 7 % and fair in 4 %. Conclusions This type of handmade external fixator is simple, lightweight, and cheap. Furthermore, all implements are readily available in most operating fields. The probability of loosening has been greatly diminished because of the concrete like structure. Easy and fast assembly and good clinical and functional results are the other advantages of this technique.

40|$|Debonding at casing-cement {{interfaces}} poses a leakage pathway {{risk that}} may compromise well integrity in CO 2 storage systems. The present study addresses {{the effects of}} long-range, CO 2 -induced, reactive transport on the conductance of such interfacial pathways. This is done by means of reactive flow-through experiments, performed on simulated wellbore systems consisting of cement-filled steel tubes, measuring 1. 2 – 6. 0  m in length. These were prepared by casting Class G HSR Portland <b>cement</b> into steel <b>tubes</b> (inner diameter 6 – 8  mm), followed by curing for 6 – 12 months. The tubes were subsequently pressurized to permanently inflate them off the cement, creating debonded cement-steel interfaces. Four experiments were performed, at temperatures of 60 – 80  °C, employing flow-through of CO 2 -bearing fluid at mean pressures of 10 – 15  MPa, controlling the pressure difference at 0. 12 – 4. 8  MPa, while measuring flow-rate. The results show decreases in sample permeability of 2 – 4 orders, which microstructural observations reveal {{to be associated with}} downstream precipitation of calcium carbonates, possibly aided by migration of fines. This demonstrates that reactive-flow on the metre-scale significantly enhances the self-sealing potential of cement-casing interfaces relative to near-static reaction experiments. The results and method presented can be used not only to understand the long-range behaviour of annuli in wells qualitatively, but also to test reactive transport models which can then be applied at the field scale...|$|R
40|$|At present, the aeration-assisted cutting-carrying {{technology}} {{is faced with}} complexities in the drilling of CBM multi-branch horizontal wells. For example, the aerating pressure is hardly maintained, and the borehole instability may happen. In view of these prominent problems, the technology of double casing tubes & a binary cycle system suitable for CBM multi-branch horizontal wells was developed according to the Venturi principle by means of parasitic tube insufflation which is used for well control simulation system. Then, a multiphase flow finite element model was established for the fluid-cutting particle system in this drilling condition. This technology was tested in field. Double-casing <b>tubes</b> <b>cementing</b> is adopted in this technology and a jet generator is installed {{at the bottom of}} the inner casing. In the process of drilling, the drilling fluid injected through double intermediate casing annulus is converted by the jet generator into a high-efficiency steering water jet, which, together with the water jet generated by the bit nozzle, increases the fluid returning rate in the inner annulus space. It is indicated from simulation results that the cutting-carrying effect is the best when the included angle between the nozzle of the jet generator and the vertical direction is 30 °. Besides, the influential laws of cutting size, primary cycle volume, accessory cycle volume and drilling velocity on hole cleaning are figured out. It is concluded that this technology increases the flow rate of drilling fluid in annulus space, the returning rate of drilling fluid significantly and the cutting-carrying capacity.

40|$|An area {{of massive}} barite {{precipitations}} was studied at a tectonic horst in 1500 m water depth in the Derugin Basin, Sea of Okhotsk. Seafloor observations and dredge samples showed irregular, block- to column-shaped barite build-ups up to 10 m high which were {{scattered over the}} seafloor along an observation track 3. 5 km long. High methane concentrations {{in the water column}} show that methane expulsion and probably carbonate precipitation is a recently active process. Small fields of chemoautotrophic clams (Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp.) at the seafloor provide additional evidence for active fluid venting. The white to yellow barites show a very porous and often layered internal fabric, and are typically covered by dark-brown Mn-rich sediment; electron microprobe spectroscopy measurements of barite sub-samples show a Ba substitution of up to 10. 5 mol% of Sr. Rare idiomorphic pyrite crystals (~ 1 %) in the barite fabric imply the presence of H 2 S. This was confirmed by clusters of living chemoautotrophic tube worms (1 mm in diameter) found in pores and channels within the barite. Microscopic examination showed that micritic aragonite and Mg-calcite aggregates or crusts are common authigenic precipitations within the barite fabric. Equivalent micritic carbonates and barite carbonate <b>cemented</b> worm <b>tubes</b> were recovered from sediment cores taken {{in the vicinity of the}} barite build-up area. Negative d 13 C values of these carbonates (>- 43. 5 per mill PDB) indicate methane as major carbon source; d 18 O values between 4. 04 and 5. 88 per mill PDB correspond to formation temperatures, which are certainly below 5 °C. One core also contained shells of Calyptogena sp. at different core depths with 14 C-ages ranging from 20 680 to > 49 080 yr. Pore water analyses revealed that fluids also contain high amounts of Ba; they also show decreasing SO 4 ** 2 - concentrations and a parallel increase of H 2 S with depth. Additionally, S and O isotope data of barite sulfate (d 34 S: 21. 0 - 38. 6 per mill CDT; d 18 O: 9. 0 - 17. 6 per mill SMOW) strongly point to biological sulfate reduction processes. The isotope ranges of both S and O can be exclusively explained as the result of a mixture of residual sulfate after a biological sulfate reduction and isotopic fractionation with 'normal' seawater sulfate. While massive barite deposits are commonly assumed to be of hydrothermal origin, the assemblage of cheomautotrophic clams, methane-derived carbonates, and non-thermally equilibrated barite sulfate strongly implies that these barites have formed at ambient bottom water temperatures and form the features of a Giant Cold Seep setting that has been active for at least 49 000 yr...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a full-scale grouting {{test in the}} Törnskog Tunnel. The tunnel {{is part of the}} Nordlänken project north of Stockholm, which has two separated tunnel tubes. The test was conducted during production of the tunnel during spring 2005 in chainage from 12012 to 12112. A new concept of grouting was designed and executed based on the grouting material silica sol with the brand name Meyco MP 320. Silica sol has been succesfully tested before in field tests in Hallandåsen 2003 and in Äspö HRL 2004. This test is the first test with silica sol in full production of a tunnel in hard rock. The initiative was taken by the National Road Administration, Oden Anläggningsentreprenad and AB BESAB. Design of the grouting procedure were based on a standard tests for characterisation of the rock mass. With use of a pareto-distribution curve, the hydraulic apertures of the fractures could be computed, further the hydraulic apertures was used to estimate the inflows to the tunnel. The demands set on the allowable leakage into the tunnel resulted that hydraulic apertures down to 14 &# 956;m needed to be sealed. Cement can penetrate and seal apertures down to 0. 05 - 0. 1 mm and therefore it was necessary to use a grout material that has a better penetrability, like silica sol. The grout, named Meyco MP 320, was chosen and the design parameters were established: grout pressure, gel time, grouting time. The desired penetration was 1. 2 m in order to limit unnecessary spread of the grout. The design was different than the traditional grouting methods with demands set on the effective grouting time at a prescribed pressure. All grout fans were carefully monitored using hydraulic tests, before and after grouting as well as control of the actual grouting. Last, the result of the grouting was complemented with a drip characterisation. Two types of grout fans were used. One with the above mentioned grout procedure and one based on the grouting procedure normally used in the Törnskogs Tunnel, but with silica sol instead of cement. The first type fan was used when the rock quality was poor. The other when the rock quality was better. The test with these type fans with silica sol were conducted in one tunnel tube, T 201, the other tube was grouted with cement following the standard procedure used in the project. This enabled a comparison of the sealing effect between the <b>cement</b> grouted tunnel <b>tube</b> and silica sol grouted tube. The results of the grouting showed that 8 out of totally 9 grouting fans were successful. The designed fans were used in five cases were the rock mass were presumed to be of poor quality, that is with larger fracture zones present. The objective for this field test was to limit the inflow of water to tunnel corresponding to value of the transmissivity of 3. 2 &# 1468; 10 - 7 m 2 /s for the grouted section of 100 m. After grouting the achieved transmissivity was calculated to be 6. 2 &# 1468; 10 - 7 m 2 /s. The achieved value of the transmissivity is rather close to the desired; the achieved value considers all fans, including the unsuccessful one. No significant conclusion could be made with the comparison of the sealing effect using cement or silica sol as a grouting agent. The conclusion is that the technique of grouting is very important and more effort needs to be done regarding the grouting time...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{substantial}} emerging interest for fundamental and applied research on the reinforcement of polymeric materials using nanotechnology. In the biomedical industry, development of novel bone cement composite materials with enhanced mechanical properties is of tremendous potential importance. The most universally used injectable bone cement is made of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA); however, the major disadvantage of PMMA is its non-biodegradability. Polymers such as poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) and polycaprolactone (PCL) are biodegradable, but suffer {{from a lack of}} mechanical properties. The aim of this research was to test the efficacy of these biodegradable polymers integrating nanotechnology for the development of composite biomaterials with improved mechanical properties sufficient for bone cements. This goal was investigated through a range of different studies. Focusing on nanostructured titania (n-TiO 2) initially, titania nanofibers (n-TiO 2 fibers) and nanowires (n-TiO 2 wires) were introduced into a PPF matrix for potential use as an orthopaedic biomaterial to treat skeletal bone defects and diseases such as osteonecrosis. PPF was modified with maleic anhydride to provide functionality for the coordination of PPF to the surface of TiO 2 nanofibers through a ring-opening reaction. The synthesis and modification of PPF were confirmed by NMR (1 H and 13 C) and XPS. The reaction chemistry of the functionalized PPF and nano-TiO 2 was also investigated by XPS and FTIR analyses. The PPF-grafted nano-TiO 2 was further employed in the development of bone cement composites by crosslinking/polymerization in the presence of N-vinyl pyrrolidone. Mechanical testing of the resulting bone cement composites demonstrated a significant enhancement of the tensile and flexural properties attributed to the chemical bonding between the PPF matrix and TiO 2 nanofibers. On the basis of the determined mechanical properties, an optimum composition was found at 5 wt% loading of n-TiO 2 fiber (0. 5 % in the starting composition) which provided a significant increase in Young’s modulus (153 %), tensile strength (113 %), flexural modulus (196 %), and flexural strength (126 %) when compared with the unfilled PPF. These improvements were attributed to the chemical linkage of the filler to the polymer matrix which enhances the transfer of a mechanical load to the n-TiO 2 fiber, leading to an increase in the mechanical properties of the bone cement composite. Secondly, bone formation is an angiogenesis-dependent process, and the need for treatment modalities that enhance neovascularization is especially important for bone regeneration in necrotic bone. A bone cement system capable of delivering an angiogenic modulator in a controlled manner may have the ability to boost the angiogenic response when injected to an osteonecrotic lesion. Therefore, an angiogenic agent, ginsenoside Rg 1, was incorporated into an orthopedic PPF-based cement. Additionally, Sr-doped TiO 2 nanofibers synthesized in supercritical CO 2 were added to the cement formulation as an alternative radiopacifier to enable visualization of the bone cement composites and potential monitoring of the healing and loosening processes. XPS analysis showed that Sr 2 + was doped in the crystalline matrix of anatase with the formation of SrTiO 3. The strong interfacial adhesion between PPF and nanofibers were characterized by SEM, FTIR, XPS, and thermal analyses and mechanical testing. The Sr-doped n-TiO 2 fibers were shown to provide reasonably higher radiopacity to the PPF matrix, which is 0. 32 ± 0. 03 mm Al, than the unmodified fibers at the same loading level (0. 20 ± 0. 01 mm Al). In addition, bone cement composites loaded with ginsenoside Rg 1 were found to provide a high drug release without sacrificing the mechanical properties of the bone <b>cement.</b> Furthermore, <b>tube</b> formation bioassays suggested that human umbilical vein endothelial cell lines would rearrange and align into a tubular structure in the presence of ginsenoside Rg 1. Consequently, the proposed cement combines the immediate mechanical support given by the chemical bonding between the filler/polymer and optimum radiopacity (0. 30 ± 0. 12 mm Al) due to the incorporation of the Sr-doped TiO 2 nanofibers to PPF matrix. Thirdly, because of the unique biological activities of ginsenoside Rg 1, upregulating in vitro proliferation, migration, chemo-invasion, and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), Rg 1 can be incorporated into scaffold materials for bone tissue engineering applications. This incorporation could be achieved by encapsulation of ginsenoside Rg 1 in biodegradable microspheres of PPF. Rg 1 -loaded PPF microspheres were prepared by both a double emulsion and a microfluidic technique {{for the first time in}} this research. The size and morphology of the Rg 1 -loaded PPF microspheres were characterized by SEM, showing unimodal 50 - 65 μm size diameters using the microfluidic technique, ideal for easy flowing powders required in commercial formulations. The PPF microspheres produced from the microfluidic technique gave high encapsulation efficiencies of up to 95. 35 ± 0. 82 %, while those obtained from a conventional double emulsion method gave a much broader size distribution in the range of 2 - 45 μm with lower encapsulation efficiencies of 78. 48 ± 1. 68 %. Release profiles were studied and quantified by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, with the results showing a lower initial burst in the release of Rg 1 from the unimodal microspheres prepared by the microfluidic technique than from the double emulsion method. The burst effect was followed by a slow release profile which can be used for long term drug delivery applications to maintain the ginsenoside Rg 1 concentration for an extended time period. Moreover, the released Rg 1 showed a significant stimulatory effect on angiogenesis behavior and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Therefore, PPF microspheres developed in this study have potential for next-generation biomedical agents in drug-release devices for bone tissue engineering. Finally, the use of hydroxyapatite HAp is rather limited for heavy load-bearing applications due to low mechanical reliability and poor processability. Therefore, immobilization of a biocompatible metal/metal oxide on the surface of HAp has been receiving increased attention for applications involving the enhancement of mechanical properties of biocompatible prostheses. A novel nanostructured HAp and a composite of HAp and TiO 2 with ultrafine structure and significantly improved mechanical properties were prepared using combined co-precipitation and sol-gel method in the green solvent, scCO 2, and incorporated into polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix to develop scaffolds with enhanced physical and mechanical properties for bone regeneration. SEM and TEM analyses were employed to examine the morphology of the HAp nanoplates and HAp-TiO 2 nanocomposites. The presence of Ti, O, Ca, and P in the HAp-TiO 2 nanocomposites was detected by EDX. In addition, the effect of metal alkoxide concentration, reaction temperature, and pressure on the morphology, crystallinity, and surface area of the resulting nanostructured composites was examined using SEM, XRD, and the BET method. Chemical composition of the products were characterized using FTIR, XPS, and XANES analyses. TGA analysis was performed to investigate thermal behavior of the synthesized nanomaterials. Mechanical testing revealed a significant increase in the Young’s modulus (88. 6 %), tensile strength (122 %), flexural modulus (47 %), and flexural strength (59. 6 %) of PCL/HAp-TiO 2 composites containing 20 wt % HAp-TiO 2 compared to PCL/HAp composites...|$|R
