5|$|In 1989, {{while doing}} {{promotion}} for the album, the band were asked what shows {{they would like}} to appear on. The band jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that {{they would like to}} appear on Dance Party USA, since it was the most absurd option they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because {{she came back to}} help Mr. Burns.|$|E
5|$|They {{decide to}} name their new baby Bart, {{as it is}} the first name they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that Homer did not think other {{children}} would make fun of. The two marry in a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spend their wedding night at Marge's family's house, sleeping on a couch in the living room, which irritates Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma.|$|E
60|$|But he <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{himself or}} of {{anything}} in the future. He had forgotten Heron, Paris, the world; he <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her.|$|R
60|$|She did not answer. She <b>could</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her appalling shame.|$|R
60|$|Sam'l <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a good reply at the moment, so {{he laughed}} good-naturedly.|$|R
5|$|According to Tanaka, the Beach Boys were {{repeatedly}} referenced {{between him}} and Suzuki, {{and that he would}} often listen to co-founder Brian Wilson's 1988 eponymous album while on the way to Suzuki's home. Suzuki has stated that the percussive arranging in the game's soundtrack was based on the Beach Boys' albums Smile (unreleased) and Smiley Smile (1967), which both contained American themes shared with Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle (1968). To Suzuki, Smile evoked the bright and dark aspects of America, while Song Cycle displayed a hazy sound mixed with American humor and hints of Ray Bradbury, a style which he considered essential to the soundtrack of Mother. Tanaka recalls Randy Newman being the first quintessentially American composer he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> and that his albums Little Criminals (1977) and Land of Dreams (1988) were influential. While Suzuki corroborated with his own affinity for Harry Nilsson's Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), he also cited John Lennon as a strong influence due to the common theme of love in his music, which was also a prominent theme in the game, and that his album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970) helped him to avoid excessive instrumentation over the SNES's technical constraints.|$|E
25|$|Reportedly, {{the king}} offered Louis any gift he would care {{to ask of}} him, and all Louis <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was a donkey-drawn {{carriage}} to help him in his water-carrying business.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Moreira married Vicenta, his {{troubles}} began. The Deputy Mayor of the area, known as Don Francisco, had also {{fallen in love}} with La Vicenta, so as a form of vengeance he began charging Moreira fines for everything he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> real or imaginary. The first thing he did was charge Moreira 500 pesos for having his wedding celebration without proper authorization.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any retort to this, so I {{asked if}} Mrs. Strickland had children.|$|R
60|$|So that now, {{though he}} wanted dreadfully to forbid {{something}} else, he <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything.|$|R
60|$|I <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> betraying {{the poor}} {{woman who had}} given it to me, and {{remained}} silent.|$|R
25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{nothing other than}} to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't {{going to make it}} back.|$|E
25|$|Macquarie {{had been}} {{impressed}} with Foveaux's administration. He put Foveaux's name forward to succeed Collins as Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania because he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> no one more fitting, and considered {{that he could}} not have acted otherwise with regard to Bligh. However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810 he was court-martialled for assenting to Bligh being deposed and imprisoned; Macquarie's recommendation was ignored. Foveaux was taken back into active service in 1811 and promoted lieutenant-colonel of the Greek Light Infantry; he pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general.|$|E
25|$|The Blackwell Company {{also ran}} a coupon {{campaign}} that offered “free” {{goods to the}} consumers of the Bull Durham brand. Coupons were included in every pack of Bull Durham Tobacco. After a consumer had saved up a set amount of coupons {{he or she could}} cash them in for an item of equivalent value. For example, for 100 coupons and one dollar one could get a gold plated watch. There were over 180 rewards each costing a different number of coupons. This advertising style was unique for its time and increased sales as people had double the incentive to buy the product. This style of advertising is still seen in companies today. The company and especially Carr used every angle of advertising they <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> in order to promote Bull Durham. These advertising techniques were completely unique for their time and many of the methods have greatly influenced modern day advertising.|$|E

60|$|Before I <b>could</b> even <b>think</b> <b>of</b> an answer, he {{was gone}} and I was alone with Kit and the night.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{thought for}} a minute or two. He was so deeply moved by her {{distress}} that he <b>could</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> himself.|$|R
25|$|A {{retreating}} Siraj-ud-Daulah met the British at Plassey. He {{had to make}} camp 27 {{miles away}} from Murshidabad. On 23 June 1757 Siraj-ud-Daulah called on Mir Jafar because he was saddened by the sudden fall of Mir Mardan who was a very dear companion of Siraj in battles. The Nawab asked for help from Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar advised Siraj to retreat for that day. The Nawab made the blunder in giving the order to stop the fight. Following his command, the soldiers of the Nawab were returning to their camps. At that time, Robert Clive attacked the soldiers with his army. At such a sudden attack, the army of Siraj became indisciplined and <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> no way to fight. So all fled away in such a situation. Betrayed by a conspiracy plotted by Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Krishna Chandra, Omichund etc., he lost the battle and had to escape. He went first to Murshidabad and then to Patna by boat, but was eventually arrested by Mir Jafar's soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression created {{economic}} obstacles for the park, and Owen {{lost her}} congressional seat. Coe, however, worked tirelessly for the park's establishment in Washington D.C. He sent coconuts to congressmen, President Herbert Hoover, and the Secretary of the Interior. While {{the concept of}} what landscapes were worth protecting were developing {{in the minds of}} scientists and politicians, Coe used any tactic he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> to advance the idea of Everglades National Park, even equating its powers with the mythical Fountain of Youth. He took Congressional appointees from the Department of the Interior on tours through the Everglades, and though attempts to establish the park failed twice, it finally passed in May 1934. It carried a provision that the federal government would not be responsible for buying lands for the park, but its establishment ensured that no more land would be purchased from the protected area. Removing the prospect of developing lands in South Florida angered many state politicians. Newly elected governor Fred P. Cone fired Coe and left the Everglades Tropic National Park Commission without any guidance.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} {{received}} only one textual revision. In 1978, Geisel {{agreed to a}} slight rewording, renaming the character who appears {{near the end of}} the story a [...] "Chinese man" [...] instead of a [...] "Chinaman". He also agreed to remove the character's pigtail and the yellow coloring from the character's skin. However, he denied on multiple occasions requests from feminists to change the lines [...] "Sayanyone <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that,/ Jack or Fred or Joe or Nat/ Say, even Jane <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that." ...|$|E

500|$|Scholarly {{analysis}} {{is provided by}} Maledicta publisher Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and Oxford English Dictionary editor Jesse Sheidlower. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg says, [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that [...] as standing in {{for most of the}} changes that happened in the 20th century, at least many of the important ones".|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Zeroes", which Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{called the most}} heartening and successful track on the album, is, according to Bowie, a nostalgia trip: [...] "I wanted to put in every 60s cliche I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of!</b> 'Stopping and preaching and letting love in,' all those things. I hope there's a humorous undertone to it. But the subtext is definitely that the trappings of rock are not what they're made out to be." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{followed}} her same [...] "writing ritual" [...] {{that she had}} followed for years and used in writing all of her books and poetry: she rented a hotel room, closeted herself there from the early morning to the afternoon, and wrote on legal pads. After deciding upon the theme [...] "America", she wrote down everything she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> about the country, which she then [...] "pushed and squeezed into a poetic form". Angelou recited the poem on January 20, 1993.|$|E

500|$|Hughes {{said that}} he had Broderick in mind when he wrote the screenplay, saying Broderick was the only actor he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> who could pull off the role, calling him clever and charming. [...] "Certain guys would have played Ferris and you would have thought, 'Where's my wallet?'" [...] Hughes said. [...] "I had to have that look; that charm had to come through. Jimmy Stewart could have played Ferris at 15...I needed Matthew." [...] Other actors who were {{considered}} for the role included Jim Carrey, John Cusack, Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox.|$|E
500|$|Andy tells Michael he {{is going}} to [...] "get my Lost on", a {{reference}} to the ABC science fiction drama television series. Andy sings The Cranberries' 1994 hit song [...] "Zombie", which was the most annoying song Helms and Krasinski <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> for Andy to sing. Dwight later returns to the office wearing a sweatshirt prominently displaying Battlestar Galactica, a Syfy military science fiction television series. When referring to Andy's weirdness, Michael mentions radio broadcaster Marv Albert, who was convicted of sexual assault in the late 1990s.|$|E
500|$|In a March 2010 {{interview}} with The Montreal Gazette, Maida looked back fondly on {{the making of}} the album and while saying it took a while to get it right both musically and lyrically, he said [...] "I appreciate the work I did lyrically; it does all tie together. As I sing these songs, it has that feeling of fixing things, and kind of where Ray was going in terms of being able to fix anything and possibly living beyond the realm of any human being and whatever anyone <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a human living." ...|$|E
