50|$|Insulation is an {{important}} part of the furnace because it improves efficiency by minimizing heat escape from the heated chamber. Refractory materials such as firebrick, <b>castable</b> <b>refractories</b> and ceramic fibre, are used for insulation.

In this work, high alumina <b>refractory</b> <b>castables</b> based on the alumina-rich zone of the Al 2 O 3 -MgO-CaO ternary phase equilibrium diagram were prepared by adding synthetic spinel, periclase and dolomite via three processing routes.

Alumina, {{with high}} melting point (2050 ºC), high {{hardness}} and mechanical strength, and excellent abrasion resistance, {{is one of the}} most common raw materials used in self-flow <b>refractory</b> <b>castables</b> (SFRC) for monolithic linings and is commercially available in various fine to coarse size classes. However, the performance of the refractory lining depends not only on the properties of its ingredients but also on its easy installation (good flowability). The aim of this work was to evaluate the relationship between the flowability index (FI) of fresh castable and the specific surface area (SSA) of its particles, which is mostly determined by the finer particles content. The results obtained showed that, by controlling the proportion between matrix and aggregate, it is possible to control the SSA of the <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> and find a mathematical relationship between the specific surface area and the minimum flowability index required to obtain a self-flow <b>refractory</b> <b>castable.</b> It is, thus, possible to optimize the <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> size composition and obtain an estimate for FI as a function of SSA.

Commercially available refractories were exposed to coal gasifier reactor environments, reproduced in the laboratory with a high-temperature, high-pressure test facility, followed by extensive postexposure evaluation. Thirty-six <b>castable</b> or gunnable <b>refractories</b> and cements and 24 refractory brick were evaluated. The behavior of <b>castable</b> <b>refractories</b> reinforced with stainless steel fibers was also examined. Gas environments that were evaluated included steam, H 2, CO 2, CO, and typical high-and low-Btu gas mixtures. Exposure pressures ranged from 100 to 1, 000 psig, temperatures from 5000 to 1, 1000 C, for periods from 50 h to 2, 000 h. In some exposures, sodium and/or potassium hydroxide were introduced in order to simulate a high-alkali environment. It was found that intermediate-and low-alumina refractories produced from domestically available raw materials, rather than high-alumina refractories produced from imported raw materials, gave the best service as liner materials and that alkali attack was probably not a serious problem with most refractories.

Tracy has been developing a way of translating the marks from etched metal plates and silkscreen images {{onto the surface of}} cast plaster. The direct interaction with this surface and the relationship which resulted between the oil based ink of the etched plate and the surface layer of the water based ink laid down by the silk screen, offered many potential combinations, creating a versatile and unique medium that was printed, yet retained a relief surface.

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{rates of}} petroleum coke, char, and residual oil were measured in molten sodium phosphate. Both oxygen and steam {{were used as}} oxidants, {{and a variety of}} reactor configurations were studied. Reactors consisted of fused ceramic parts sealed into a reactor configuration using <b>castable</b> <b>refractory.</b> The reaction rate of carbon particles in a bubbling molten phosphate slurry was found to depend upon the rate of particle-bubble contacting. Upon contact, direct conversion of carbon particles with the gas phase occurs due to the large carbon-molten sodium phosphate contact angle (136 °). The potential flow solution for flow around a bubble where particles are assumed to follow the streamlines gave a consistent picture of bubble-particle contacting. The reactivity of the carbon in the bulk liquid was found to be negligible due to the low solubility of oxygen in the melt. Gas phase (no salt) results were generated to establish base cases and to examine treatment effects on the reactivity of green sponge and green needle cokes. The reactivities of both were favorably affected by toluene extraction and adversely affected by calcination to 1300 K. Extraction decreased the agglomerating nature of the sponge coke. Both extracts were largely aromatic with the needle coke extract being more so. Molten sodium phosphate was found to catalyze the gasification of petroleum coke by steam and by oxygen. Such catalytic effects are limited due to the large carbon-salt contact angle and may be obscured in slurry reactors by the rate of particle-bubble contacting being slow. The steam reforming of residual oil revealed that the carbonized product in the molten salt phase closely resembled sponge petroleum coke (as produced by delayed coking). Cold model experiments employing water and polymeric beads revealed that dilute slurries of small, non-wetting particles decreased the rise velocity of single bubbles and increased the rate of bubble coalescence in swarms.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of advanced coal-fired power systems, higher working, fluid temperatures must be reached. To protect some system surfaces, they are covered with corrosion-resistant refractories. Corrosion is the degradation of material surfaces or grain boundaries by chemical reactions with melts, liquids, or gases, causing loss of material and, consequently, a decrease in strength of the structure. In order to develop methods of reducing corrosion, the microstructure that is attacked must be identified along with the mechanism and rates of the attack. Once identified, methods for reducing corrosion rates can be developed. In order to determine the reactivity of a refractory to a slag, several tests have been developed. The most common are the cup slag test, drip slag test American Society for Testing and Materials ([ASTM] C 768), gradient slag test, rotary slag test (ASTM C 874) and the dip-and- spin test. Among these tests, the cup slag test is the only static test method and the most commonly used.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of the waste treatment plant (WTP) being built at the Hanford Site {{is not sufficient to}} process all of the tank waste accumulated from more than 40 years of nuclear materials production. Bulk vitrification can accelerate tank waste treatment by providing some supplemental low-activity waste (LAW) treatment capacity. Bulk vitrification combines LAW and glass-forming chemicals in a large metal container and melts the contents using electrical resistance heating. A <b>castable</b> <b>refractory</b> block (CRB) is used along with sand to insulate the container from the heat generated while melting the contents into a glass waste form. This report describes engineering-scale (ES) and full-scale (FS) tests that have been conducted. Several ES tests showed that a small fraction of soluble Tc moves in the CRB and results in a groundwater peak different than WTP glass. The total soluble Tc- 99 fraction in the FS CRB is expected to be different than that determined in the ES tests, but until FS test results are available, the best-estimate soluble Tc- 99 fraction from the ES tests {{has been used as a}} conservative estimate. The first FS test results are from cold simulant tests that have been spiked with Re. An estimated scale-up factor extrapolates the Tc- 99 data collected at the ES to the FS bulk vitrification waste package. Test FS- 38 A tested the refractory design and did not have a Re spike. Samples were taken and analyzed to help determine Re CRB background concentrations using a Re-spiked, six-tank composite simulant mixed with soil and glass formers to produce the waste feed. Although this feed is not physically the same as the Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System feed, the chemical make-up is the same. Extensive sampling of the CRB was planned, but difficulties with the test prevented completion of a full box.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the work {{reported}} here is to analyze the potential effect of the release of technetium (Tc) from metal inclusions in bulk vitrification waste packages once they are placed in the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF). As part of the strategy for immobilizing waste from the underground tanks at Hanford, selected wastes will be immobilized using bulk vitrification. During analyses of the glass produced in engineering-scale tests, metal inclusions were found in the glass product. This report contains the results from experiments designed to quantify the corrosion rates of metal inclusions found in the glass product from AMEC Test ES- 32 B and simulations designed to compare the rate of Tc release from the metal inclusions to the release of Tc from glass produced with the bulk vitrification process. In the simulations, the Tc in the metal inclusions was assumed to be released congruently during metal corrosion as soluble TcO 4 -. The experimental results and modeling calculations show that the metal corrosion rate will, under all conceivable conditions at the IDF, be dominated by the presence of the passivating layer and corrosion products on the metal particles. As a result, the release of Tc from the metal particles at the surfaces of fractures in the glass releases at a rate similar to the Tc present as a soluble salt. The release of the remaining Tc in the metal is controlled by the dissolution of the glass matrix. To summarize, the release of 99 Tc from the BV glass within precipitated Fe is directly proportional to the diameter of the Fe particles and to the amount of precipitated Fe. However, the main contribution to the Tc release from the iron particles is over the same time period as the release of the soluble Tc salt. For the base case used in this study (0. 48 mass% of 0. 5 mm diameter metal particles homogeneously distributed in the BV glass), the release of 99 Tc from the metal is approximately the same as the release from 0. 3 mass% soluble Tc salt in the <b>castable</b> <b>refractory</b> block and it is released over the same time period as the salt. Therefore, to limit the impact of precipitated Fe on the release of 99 Tc, both the amount of precipitated Fe in the BV glass and the diameter of these particles should be minimized...|$|E
40|$|Bulk {{vitrification}} (BV) {{was selected}} for a pilot-scale test and demonstration facility for supplemental treatment to accelerate the cleanup of low-activity waste (LAW) at the Hanford U. S. DOE Site. During engineering-scale (ES) tests, {{a small fraction of}} radioactive Tc (and Re, its nonradioactive surrogate) were transferred out of the LAW glass feed and molten LAW glass, and deposited on the surface and within the pores of the <b>castable</b> <b>refractory</b> block (CRB). Laboratory experiments were undertaken to understand the mechanisms of the transport Tc/Re into the CRB during vitrification and to evaluate various means of CRB protection against the deposition of leachable Tc/Re. The tests used Re as a chemical surrogate for Tc. The tests with the baseline CRB showed that the molten LAW penetrates into CRB pores before it converts to glass, leaving deposits of sulfates and chlorides when the nitrate components decompose. Na 2 O from the LAW reacts with the CRB to create a durable glass phase that may contain Tc/Re. Limited data from a single CRB sample taken from an ES experiment indicate that, while a fraction of Tc/Re is present in the CRB in a readily leachable form, most of the Tc/Re deposited in the refractory is retained {{in the form of a}} durable glass phase. In addition, the molten salts from the LAW, mainly sulfates, chlorides, and nitrates, begin to evaporate from BV feeds at temperatures below 800 C and condense on solid surfaces at temperatures below 530 C. Three approaches aimed at reducing or preventing the deposition of soluble Tc/Re within the CRB were proposed: metal lining, sealing the CRB surface with a glaze, and lining the CRB with ceramic tiles. Metal liners were deemed unsuitable because evaluations showed that they can cause unacceptable distortions of the electric field in the BV system. Sodium silicate and a low-alkali borosilicate glaze were selected for testing. The glazes slowed down molten salt condensate penetration, but did little to reduce the penetration of molten salt. Out of several refractory tile candidates, only greystone and fused-cast alumina-zirconia-silica (AZS) refractory remained intact and well bonded to the CRB after firing to 1000 C. The deformation of the refractory-tile composite was avoided by prefiring the greystone tile to 800 C. Condensed vapors did not penetrate the tiles, but Re salts condensed on their surface. Refractory corrosion tests indicated that a 0. 25 -inch-thick greystone tile would not corrode during a BV melt. Tiles can reduce both vapor penetration and molten salt penetration, but vapor deposition above the melt line will occur even on tiles. The Tc/Re transport scenario was outlined as follows. At temperatures below 700 C, molten ionic salt (MIS) that includes all the Tc/Re penetrates, by capillarity, from the feed into the CRB open porosity. At approximately 750 C, the MIS decomposes through the loss of NOx, leaving mainly sulfate and chloride salts. The Na 2 O formed in the decomposition of the nitrates reacts with insoluble grains in the feed and with the aluminosilicates in the CRB to form more viscous liquids that reduce further liquid penetration into the CRB. At 800 to 1000 C, a continuous glass phase traps the remains of the MIS in the form of inclusions in the bulk glass melt. At 1000 to 1200 C, the salt inclusions in the glass slowly dissolve but also rise to the surface. The Tc/Re salts also evaporate from the free surface of the glass melt that is rapidly renewed by convective currents. The vapors condense on cooler surfaces in the upper portion of the CRB, the box lid, and the off-gas system...|$|E

In the present work, the performance of CA as an anti-hydration additive in <b>refractory</b> <b>castables</b> was evaluated by hydration tests, mechanical strength and apparent volumetric expansion (AVE) measurements and thermogravimetry. The results attained have shown that CA effectiveness depends strongly on the amount added and by the interaction with other raw materials in the composition, in particular calcium aluminate cement.

40|$|The University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC), in {{partnership}} with United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) under a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) contract, has designed, constructed, and operated a 3. 0 -million Btu/hr (3. 2 x 10 {sup 6 } kJ/hr) slagging furnace system (SFS). Successful operation has demonstrated that the SFS meets design objectives and is well suited for testing very high-temperature heat exchanger concepts. Test results have shown that a high-temperature radiant air heater (RAH) panel designed and constructed by UTRC and used in the SFS can produce a 2000 F (1094 C) process air stream. To support the pilot-scale work, the EERC has also constructed laboratory- and bench-scale equipment which {{was used to determine}} the corrosion resistance of refractory and structural materials and develop methods to improve corrosion resistance. DOE projects that from 1995 to 2015, worldwide use of electricity will double to approach 20 trillion kilowatt hours. This growth comes during a time of concern over global warming, thought by many policy makers to be caused primarily by increases from coal-fired boilers in carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) emissions through the use of fossil fuels. Assuming limits on CO{sub 2 } emissions from coal-fired boilers are imposed in the future, the most economical CO{sub 2 } mitigation option may be efficiency improvements. Unless efficiency improvements are made in coal-fired power plants, utilities may be forced to turn to more expensive fuels or buy CO{sub 2 } credits. One way to improve the efficiency of a coal-fired power plant is to use a combined cycle involving a typical steam cycle along with an indirectly fired turbine cycle using very high-temperature but low-pressure air as the working fluid. At the heart of an indirectly fired turbine combined-cycle power system are very high-temperature heat exchangers that can produce clean air at up to 2600 F (1427 C) and 250 psi (17 bar) to turn an aeroderivative turbine. The overall system design can be very similar to that of a typical pulverized coal-fired boiler system, except that ceramics and alloys are used to carry the very high-temperature air rather than steam. This design makes the combined-cycle system especially suitable as a boiler-repowering technology. With the use of a gas-fired duct heater, efficiencies of 55 % can be achieved, leading to reductions in CO{sub 2 } emissions of 40 % as compared to today's coal-fired systems. On the basis of work completed to date, the high-temperature advanced furnace (HITAF) concept appears to offer a higher-efficiency technology option for coal-fired power generation systems than conventional pulverized coal firing. Concept analyses have demonstrated the ability to achieve program objectives for emissions (10 % of New Source Performance Standards, i. e., 0. 003 lb/MMBtu of particulate), efficiency (47 %- 55 %), and cost of electricity (10 %- 25 % below today's cost). Higher-efficiency technology options for new plants as well as repowering are important to the power generation industry in order to conserve valuable fossil fuel resources, reduce the quantity of pollutants (air and water) and solid wastes generated per MW, and reduce the cost of power production in a deregulated industry. Possibly more important than their potential application in a new high-temperature power system, the RAH panel and convective air heater tube bank are potential retrofit technology options for existing coal-fired boilers to improve plant efficiencies. Therefore, further development of these process air-based high-temperature heat exchangers and their potential for commercial application is directly applicable to the development of enabling technologies in support of the Vision 21 program objectives. The objective of the work documented in this report was to improve the performance of the UTRC high-temperature heat exchanger, demonstrate the fuel flexibility of the slagging combustor, and test methods for reducing corrosion of brick and <b>castable</b> <b>refractory</b> in such combustion environments. Specific technical issues of interest included measuring the effects of coatings on heat transfer in the RAH, determining the general impact of firing a lower-iron bituminous coal on the operation of the RAH panel and SFS, and the development of ways to treat slag and refractories to decrease corrosion rates...|$|E
50|$|Regardless of how complex or {{sophisticated}} the <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> is that {{is selected}} for an application, the physical properties of the material can be drastically reduced if care is not taken during the mixing, pouring, and curing processes.

Unfortunately, lining quality is often compromised by field conditions during material placement. Precast roof panels ready for shipment. Project schedules, crew skill levels, equipment availability, job cost pressures, or other demands can sometimes influence proper refractory installation. Improper water addition, mix time variations, over- or under-vibration, and improper curing can drastically affect material quality. With precast shapes, cast in a controlled shop environment, the physical properties of a castable can be more fully optimized.|$|R

At high temperatures many other advantages are observed, such as the superior corrosion and thermal shock resistances, due to the mullite phase formed by the reaction between alumina and microsilica in the working conditions. Nevertheless, papers relating {{to the effect of}} microsílica addition during drying stage are scarce, specifically concerning the explosion behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to establish the relationship between microsílica content and curing temperature variation with some refractory castables' properties. The results showed that higher contents of microsilica on the <b>refractory</b> <b>castables</b> composition promote higher mechanical strength and a reduction of permeability, modifying the castable explosion behavior.

The hydration and structure development of cementitous compositions with CW and CWt were investigated.

The impact of CWt additive on <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> properties was investigated.

Two kinds of slags with 9. 02 and 4. 14 CaO/SiO 2 ratios were studied for slag resistance by means of crucible tests. The corrosion thickness increases with increase in magnesia content in all the designed compositions. The slag penetration decreases with increases in spinel content. Taking into account these results a <b>refractory</b> <b>castable</b> composition for its positioning into a steelmaking ladle was chosen.
