A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line-out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations are <b>compatible</b> with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs.

Square released the game for download in late 2008 for Japanese i-mode, EZweb <b>compatible</b> phones, and Yahoo! Mobile <b>compatible</b> phones. The port removed the bestiary mode and original Game Boy version of the game, and condensed some of the in-game cutscenes. It added Japanese kanji support and extra shops with new equipment throughout the quest.|$|E

Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ <b>compatible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early in the game's history, TSR took {{no action}} against small publishers' {{production}} of D <b>compatible</b> material, and even licensed Judges Guild to produce D materials for several years, such as City State of the Invincible Overlord. This attitude {{changed in the}} mid-1980s when TSR took legal action {{to try to prevent}} others from publishing <b>compatible</b> material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies. Although TSR took legal action against several publishers in an attempt to restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance. TSR itself ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.|$|E

5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are <b>compatible</b> with each other. Being <b>compatible</b> may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches are <b>compatible</b> with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E

40|$|State {{minimization}} of incompletely specified machines is {{an important}} step of FSM synthesis. An exact algorithm consists of generation of prime <b>compatibles</b> and solution of a binate covering problem. This paper presents an implicit algorithm for exact state minimization of FSM’s. We describe how to do implicit prime computation and implicit binate covering. We show that we can handle sets of <b>compatibles</b> and prime <b>compatibles</b> of cardinality up to 2 1500. We present the first published algorithm for fully implicit exact binate covering. We show that we can reduce and solve binate tables with up to 10 6 rows and columns. The entire branch-and-bound procedure is carried on implicitly. We indicate also where such examples arise in practice. ...|$|R
