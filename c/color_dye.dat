5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a <b>color.</b> <b>Dye</b> may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E
2500|$|Tekhelet (תכלת) is a <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> {{which the}} Hebrew Bible {{commands}} the Jews {{to use for}} one, two, or four of the eight half-strings hanging down (as interpreted in Rabbinic Judaism), or a number of cords ranging from one up to {{the same amount of}} threads as the non-Tekhelet threads (according to opinions in Karaite Judaism). At some point following the destruction of the Second Temple, the knowledge and tradition about the correct method of the dye was lost for Rabbinic Judaism in Israel and since then, most Rabbinic diaspora Jews and Israeli Jews as well have worn plain white Tzitziyot without any dyes. Tekhelet, which appears 48 times in the Tanakh – translated by the Greek Old Testament ('Septuagint') as iakinthinos ( [...] , blue) – is a specific blue-violet dye produced, according to the Rabbis, from a creature referred to as a Ḥillazon, other blue dyes being unacceptable. Some explain the black stripes found on many traditional prayer shawls as representing the loss of this dye.|$|E
5000|$|Another appearance-altering item is hair dye, {{which can}} be bought and applied {{immediately}} to change a character's hair <b>color.</b> <b>Dye</b> is available in red, yellow, black, violet and white, as well as bleach which returns hair back to its original color.|$|E
5000|$|Dip dye (also {{known as}} [...] "tip dyeing") is a hair {{coloring}} style that involves dipping {{the ends of}} the hair into dye. The dye used can be either a naturally <b>colored</b> <b>dye</b> or a bright <b>colored</b> <b>dye,</b> the latter being the more popular choice.|$|R
50|$|Splash {{effects are}} created by dying the {{unsealed}} porous surface in lighter colors and then splashing darker <b>color</b> <b>dyes</b> onto the surface. Aqueous and solvent-based dye mixtures may also be alternately applied since the <b>colored</b> <b>dyes</b> will resist each other and leave spotted effects.|$|R

5000|$|The {{leaves are}} thick and leathery. They contain glucosides, resins, {{colouring}} pigments, gums, starches, and malic acid. They {{are rich in}} aluminum. Yellow <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> can be extracted. Leaves and roots are used as a medicine for dysentery and as an astringent.|$|E
50|$|Icing can {{be formed}} into shapes such as flowers and leaves using a pastry bag. Such decorations are commonplace on {{birthday}} and wedding cakes. Chef's <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> (food coloring) is commonly added to icing mixtures {{to achieve the}} desired color. Sprinkles, coloring mist, edible ink designs, or other decorations are often used on top of icing.|$|E
50|$|Leopold Godowsky, Jr. and Leopold Mannes, {{working with}} the Eastman Kodak Company, {{developed}} Kodachrome, the first commercially successful color film to use the subtractive method. Kodachrome was introduced in 1935 as 16mm motion picture film, and in 1936 as 35mm film for still cameras. The Kodachrome films contained no <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> couplers; these were added during processing.|$|E

50|$|The Bamun {{developed}} an extensive artistic culture at their capital of Foumban {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century. During Njoya’s reign six <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> pits were maintained. The Mbum imported indigo-dyed raffia-sewn cloth from the Hausa as royal cloth. This royal cloth was called Ntieya, and Hausa craftsmen were kept at palace workshops to supply nobles and teach the art of dyeing.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{high speed}} {{measurements}} of the WIPD™ allows {{for the use of}} paint ball cannons to be used to be synchronously triggered to mark faulty wheels with a <b>color</b> <b>dye.</b> This marker dye can for instance be of fluorescent (UV sensitive) or environmentally friendly paint types. This option would be particularly useful for situations where poor infrastructure in underdeveloped geographical areas exist.|$|E
50|$|The {{product line}} {{evolved over the}} {{following}} decade, adding items such as trivets, ornaments, and the first NameTrains, a derivative line of the Troll’s Toy Workshop line alphabet letter car line. Originally finished with a clear coat, the NameTrains rapidly increased in popularity. As more retailers expressed interest in having colored letters, a non-toxic <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> stain was developed and the first colored NameTrains appeared {{on the market in}} 1994.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, {{at the low}} {{temperature}} {{the color of the}} shirt is the combination of the color of the encapsulated <b>colored</b> <b>dye</b> with the <b>color</b> of the <b>dyed</b> fabric, while at higher temperatures the capsules become colorless and the color of the fabric prevails.|$|R
50|$|The Indiana Speleological Survey {{continues}} to explore Binkley Cave. Through {{the use of}} <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> in waterways, two local springs {{have been identified as}} the final destination of two yet unexplored cave passageways. Exploration of these waterways would add several miles to the cave's explored length. As of the end of 2015, the surveyed cave length was 42.57 miles with the potential for at least ten miles to be discovered in the distant future.|$|E
50|$|Escallonia resinosa is {{a source}} of {{firewood}} and wood of good quality throughout its range. This tree species furnishes a hard wood for tools and is often used to manufacture chaquitacllas (a tool used for soil plowing) by the indigenous peoples of the Andes since ancient times. The wood was also probably used by the Incas to make a type of ceremonial vases called kero. Leaves are used as a source of a beige <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> applied to cotton and wool.|$|E
50|$|The <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> {{in these}} modern iron gall {{formulas}} {{functions as a}} temporary colorant to make these inks clearly visible whilst writing. The ferrogallic compounds through a gradual oxidation process cause an observable gradual color change to gray/black whilst these inks completely dry and makes the writing waterproof. The color change behavior of the ink also depends on {{the properties of the}} used paper. In general, the darkening process will progress more quickly and pronounced on papers containing relatively much bleaching agent residues.|$|E

50|$|One gunnery {{advantage}} the Americans had was the radar-controlled Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System. The {{brains of}} the system was the Ford Mark I Fire Control Computer, which provided coordinated automatic firing solutions for her 5-inch guns merely by pointing the gun director at the target. Crude by comparison, the Japanese used optical range finders aided by splash <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> markers in each shell, color-coded to the firing ship. At this point, the Japanese were unable to find the range of their attacker.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} {{components of}} time-based media art must {{be examined in}} order to understand their physical condition. With film, physical examination will identify a variety of deterioration processes, such as vinegar syndrome in safety films or <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> fading in color film stock. It is important to identify these early, not only to try to prevent further deterioration, but to intervene with treatment or to make a duplicate copy. Without the examination process, time-based media may degrade beyond repair and possibly be lost entirely.|$|E

50|$|Inks ideally {{should be}} fairly free-flowing, free of sediment, and non-corrosive, though this {{generally}} excludes permanence and prevents large-scale commercial use of some <b>colored</b> <b>dyes.</b> Proper care and selection of ink will prevent most problems.|$|R
5000|$|Dyeing - {{all of the}} raw {{materials}} for the natural dyes are harvested from the rainforest. The Iban have traditionally made use {{of a large number}} of plants to produce a range of rich beautiful dyes. The rengat plant produces an ‘indigo’ colour in many different tones. The akar penawar landak is used to obtain yellow <b>color</b> <b>dye.</b> For the Engkudu dye, if kapok or quicklime is added the colour will turn brown. The yarn is dipped into the combination, turned until it is well saturated and left to soak before it is dried under the sun. after the dye process yarns are further prepared by tying sections to build up the design.|$|E
50|$|The two inboard drop {{tanks of}} Surya Kiran Kiran Mk.2 {{aircraft}} have been modified to carry <b>color</b> <b>dye</b> for generating smoke. Diesel {{is used for}} generating white smoke and colored dye is mixed with diesel to generate colored smoke. Because of the smoke modification, only the two outboard drop tanks {{can be used to}} carry fuel, which gives Surya Kiran aircraft a maximum range of 280 km. For displays, Suryakiran aircraft fly only with two inboard drop tanks, which carry dye for smoke generation.The team has formed up again with 4 Hawk aircraft, with a new paint scheme. In October 2015, the Defense Ministry concluded negotiations between HAL and BAE Systems for the purchase of twenty BAE Systems Hawk Mk.132 aircraft for the Surya Kiran which will be dedicated to the aerobatics display role and fitted with smoke canisters.|$|E
