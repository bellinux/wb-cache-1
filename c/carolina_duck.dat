40|$|Our {{conceptions of}} nature and our {{relation}} with it are to no small degree colored by the great romantic success stories of nature conservation. Among these, stories of rare birds seem to strike a special chord. The rarer a bird is, it seems, the stronger is its effect. Thus, the tales of the Californian Condor and the Whooping Crane catch our imagination even more {{than those of the}} Bald Eagle or the <b>Carolina</b> <b>Duck,</b> even though the latter were saved much more succesfully than the former. Somehow, we like the idea of birds, large, strikingly beautiful, that seemingly belong to another era of vast, unspoilt wildernesses that are lost forever. While we like to hear success stories, the great failures of nature conser-vation are less gladly remembered, but still strongly present in our common memory. Of these, none seems to have a greater impact than the saga of the Ivory Billed Woodpecker. Here was a bird, large, strikingly beautiful, barely clinging to life in the last suitable tract of old-growth riverine forest in the Southern States. Already considered extinct by many, it was rediscovered, filmed, and studied by James Tanner, only to disappear again when eco-nomic interests triumphed over conservation efforts. While the Singer Tract is gone forever, it is becoming increasingly clear that, sixty years on, the ivory bill is still with us. Leaving ornithologists, indoctrinated for so long by Tanner’s paradigms, struggling to cope with the new situation. Three questions, so obvious that few speak them out loud, immediately come to our mind. Why did the ivory bill survive, when it was supposed to disappear with the Singer Tract? Why did nobody find the bird in the past sixty years? And, why do we up to today not have hard evidence of its existence? As we will see, these questions are strongly influenced by th...|$|E

50|$|At 0900 UTC on October 26, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued {{from the mouth of}} the Savannah River in South Carolina to Oregon Inlet, North Carolina, including Pamlico Sound. Twelve hours later, the portion of the tropical storm watch from the Santee River in South <b>Carolina</b> to <b>Duck,</b> North <b>Carolina,</b> including Pamlico Sound, was upgraded to a warning. Governor of North Carolina Beverly Perdue declared a state of emergency for 38 eastern counties on October 26, which took effect on the following day. By October 29, the state of emergency was extended to 24 counties in western North Carolina, with up to a foot (30 cm) of snow attributed to Sandy anticipated in higher elevations. The National Park Service closed at least five sections of the Blue Ridge Parkway.|$|R
50|$|Golden's {{fourth season}} at Miami {{was seen as}} a {{disappointment}} by many. The Hurricanes began the season with a 6-3 record, but lost their next four games beginning with a heartbreaking home loss to defending National Champions Florida State and concluding with an uninspired defeat at the hands of South <b>Carolina</b> in the <b>Duck</b> Commander Independence Bowl. Golden's Hurricanes finished the season 6-7 despite being picked by many experts to win the ACC Coastal Division Championship and seven of its players being drafted by NFL franchises.|$|R
50|$|The Ducks {{went on a}} roll in {{the month}} of January winning 8 of 11 games. Throughout the month, however, all of Anaheim's wins were very close games with the Ducks winning by only one goal with the {{exception}} of the 6-0 victory over Columbus on January 7. Anaheim was on a long homestand during the first half of the month and started with a 1-1 record in the new year by defeating the defending champion Blackhawks and falling to the Nashville Predators in front of the smallest home crowd of the season (a mere 12,216). After that loss, they took advantage of home ice by taking down the Blue Jackets, rival Sharks, and Blues. Anaheim then fell to the Phoenix Coyotes in a short one game road trip to the desert but then came home to defeat the Edmonton Oilers on January 16 in their final home game until after the All-Star Game. Heading out on the road, the Ducks were to face the Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, and Columbus Blue Jackets. Overall, Anaheim had a very good road trip only falling to Toronto. The game against the Leafs was significant because it was the first time former Ducks netminder (and Ducks starter in the 2003 and 2007 finals) J.S. Giguere would face his old team. Giguere got the best of Anaheim by posting a 5-2 victory. The game at Montreal was also significant because it was Ducks centerman Saku Koivu's first time playing at the Bell Centre since he signed with Anaheim prior to the 2009-10 season. The Canadien faithful gave Koivu an incredibly warm welcome, but in the end, the patrons at the Bell Centre were not pleased with the final result as Anaheim skated away with a 4-3 shootout victory. Going into the All-Star Game, the Ducks had 60 points, enough to be in the top 8 and were honored to send 3 players to the festivities in Raleigh, North <b>Carolina.</b> <b>Ducks</b> winger Corey Perry was selected alongside goaltender Jonas Hiller (the only goaltender from the Western Conference) to participate in the game. Rookie defenseman Cam Fowler also attended, but he (along with many other rookies) were only there to compete in the skills tournament.|$|R
40|$|The American black duck, {{along with}} the wood duck, mallard, teal and others, {{is a member of}} the group of ducks called dabbling ducks. Dabbling ducks are {{recognized}} by their ability to “jump ” vertically from the water when taking flight and by their “dabbling ” method of feeding in which they tip up, expos-ing their rump, when feeding in shallow water. The other group of ducks—the divers—are so named because they dive completely under water to feed. Diving ducks must also “run ” across the water before being able to take flight. Examples of diving ducks include canvasbacks, redheads and scaup. In North <b>Carolina,</b> black <b>ducks</b> nest in coastal marshes at low densities and occasionally in beaver ponds. However, black ducks may be seen throughout the state in winter after birds from the North have made their fall migration. Description Aptly named, the black duck is a mottled brown-black duck that is similar in appearance to the more common hen (female) mallard, but it has a much darker body. There is a noticeable contrast between the light brown head an...|$|R

40|$|Much {{effort has}} focused on {{modeling}} and measuring the energy costs of free existence and the foraging strategies of animals. However, few studies have quantitatively linked these approaches to the patch structure of foods in the field. We developed an individual—based model that relates field measurements of the dispersion of benthic foods to search costs and foraging profitability of diving ducks. On Lake Mattamuskeet, North <b>Carolina,</b> Canvasback <b>ducks</b> (Aythya valisineria) eat only the belowground winter buds of the submerged plant Vallisneria americana. We measured and modeled the patch structure of winter buds {{at the level of}} potential foraging loci, defined as contiguous circles 1 m in diameter. In the field and in the model, Canvasbacks make repeated vertical dives in such loci, foraging in the sediments by touch, before surface—swimming to another locus. We quantified first—order patchiness by fitting a negative binomial distribution to core samples taken at 50 -m intervals along transects, to yield the frequencies of loci with different bud densities. Second-order patchiness was measured by taking cores at 1 -m increments radiating from each sampling point, and regressing bud density at each sampling point on densities at these increments. No significant correlations were found, indicating that Canvasbacks could not predict food densities based on densities in nearby foraging loci. For the model, we generated food grids from the negative binomial distributions of core samples. Energy costs of diving were calculated by applying aerobic efficiencies (mechanical power output / aerobic power input) to biomechanical models. Unlike respirometry alone, this method accounts for effects on dive costs of varying water depth and dive duration. We used measurements of Canvasback intake rates at different bud densities to calculate profitability (energy intake minus expenditure) for each dive. Multivariate uncertainty analyses (Latin hypercube) indicated that profitability for Canvasbacks foraging on Vallisneria buds is determined mainly by food—item size and locomotor costs of descent. Bud metabolizable energy, water temperature, bud dispersion, and search and handling time coefficients of the functional response for intake rate have relatively minor influence. Individual-parameter perturbations indicated that to maintain the same foraging benefits, the total area of Vallisneria habitat would have to increase by 1. 4 -fold if dry mass per bud decreased from 0. 10 to 0. 03 g, and by 2. 1 -fold if water depth increased from 0. 5 to 2 m. Our method allows study of interactions between patch structure and foraging energetics without detailed spatial mapping of foods, which is not feasible at appropriate scales for highly mobile benthivores. The model yields estimates of energy balance, contaminant intake, and amount and quality of foraging habitat required to sustain diving duck populations under varying environmental conditions. More accurate prediction of giving-up times and giving-up food densities will require better understanding of the time scale over which ducks balance their energy budgets...|$|R
