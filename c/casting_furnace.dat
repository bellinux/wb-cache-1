50|$|A {{melting furnace}} is {{necessary}} only when spin casting with metal. Understandably the metal {{must be in}} a molten state prior to introduction into the mold. However, {{it is necessary for}} a spin <b>casting</b> <b>furnace</b> to have a temperature controller as there is an approximate range that works best for each metal. For example, a particular zinc alloy is typically cast between 775 and 800 °F, whereas it actually melts much lower around 500 °F. If the metal is introduced to the mold at a higher temperature (in this case, above 800 °F), it will start to wear the silicone down prematurely, greatly shortening the mold life. If the metal is introduced at significantly lower temperatures (below 775 °F), its solidification time will similarly be shortened resulting in incomplete or low quality castings. Therefore, spin casting with metal requires not only a furnace with fine temperature control, but knowledge of at what range to cast.|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{thermal analysis}} technique {{was developed to}} analyze an inductively heated <b>casting</b> <b>furnace.</b> Initial operation of the vacuum <b>casting</b> <b>furnace</b> indicated that the outer shell of the vessel was exceeding the temperature design limit. The <b>casting</b> <b>furnace</b> is very complex and not easily modeled {{in a short period}} of time through the use of general purpose heat transfer codes. The model took into consideration conduction, natural convection, phase change, radiation heat transfer, and induction heating. The furnace was constructed from ceramic materials, stainless steel, copper, graphite, and other materials. To develop a model based on first principles within a couple of weeks was not considered possible. The alternate approach was to develop a simplified numerical model that relied heavily on experimental data. The purpose of the model was to accurately predict the maximum vessel shell temperatures. A basic 5 node transient model was developed for the complete system. The resultant model predicted the transient heatup of the <b>casting</b> <b>furnace</b> and was able to predict the maximum shell temperature to within 5 C. The model was also capable of predicting the effect of different operations on the shell temperature. This type of modeling approach can be used to troubleshoot existing heat transfer equipment problems, study the effect of different operating sequences, and give insight into the redesign of similar equipment...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} design of a {{radio-frequency}} induction-heated rod <b>casting</b> <b>furnace</b> that permits the preparation of polycrystalline ingots of intermetallic compounds under ultra-high vacuum compatible conditions. The central part of the system is a bespoke water-cooled Hukin crucible supporting a casting mold. Depending on the choice of mold, typical rods have a diameter between 6 mm and 10 mm and a length up to 90 mm, suitable for single-crystal growth by means of float-zoning. The setup is all-metal sealed and may be baked out. We find that the resulting ultra-high vacuum represents an important precondition for processing compounds with high vapor pressures under a high-purity argon atmosphere up to 3 bar.
