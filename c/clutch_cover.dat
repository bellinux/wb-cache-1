40|$|In {{contemporary}} vehicles, {{friction clutches}} {{are exposed to}} increased engine performances, i. e. increased torque, particularly for vehicles equipped with diesel engines. Demands for low mass and low moments of inertia of the moving parts are more pronounced. Towards the aim of meeting those demands, {{there is a tendency}} for manufacturing of <b>clutch</b> <b>covers</b> by drawing from a thin tin sheet metal, thus decreasing their axial stiffness, and increasing the path of the release bearing. Such a situation in conditions of increasing vehicle speed endangers the fast and precise work and functionality of the friction clutch. Concomitantly, the effort and the work that the driver needs to make and do during its clutch release increase. These factors need to be within certain limits. This paper provides an analysis of a possible response to this kind of challenges. The focus is pertinent to the analytical and experimental analysis of the capacity to decrease backlash in the process of release of the clutch with an inexpensive technological procedure for profiling the fingers of the diaphragm-spring as a way to increase their stiffness. The impact of the analyzed interventions on the dynamic durability of the diaphragm-spring is also assessed through an adequate experiment.

40|$|Hot {{stamping}} {{has been}} widely studied and increasingly applied in the automotive industry. This process is characterized by its ability to stamp high strength steels, yielding products with high mechanical strength, thus reducing the weight of stamped components and therefore the vehicles weight. It also demands less energy because steel sheets can be heated by induction, more efficient than electric furnaces. With controlled thinning, {{it is possible to}} manufacture thinner stamped parts with high mechanical strength, therefore it is necessary to know the formability limits to prevent failure and achieve the largest possible thickness reduction. In this work the hot formability of DIN 27 MnCrB 5 steel sheets 4 mm thick, under thinning conditibns was evaluated by numerical simulation with the finite element (FEM) software Forge 2008. Tensile tests were carried out at 500, 600, 700, and 800 degrees C and with strain rates from 0. 1 to 4 s(- 1). With the results of tensile tests, it was possible to calculate Hensel-Spittel coefficients to model the steel sheet and simulate the hot Nakazima test to evaluate the highest dome which could be formed without failure risks caused by sheet thinning. Simulation results obtained with specimens 200 mm long and 125, 150 or 200 mm wide that were stamped at 930 degrees C, showed the radial position and dome height associated to plastic instability as well provided the thickness distribution along the specimen. The numerical results were compared to experimental tests and showed a good agreement in terms of failure initiation and localization. As a result, a new numerical and experimental strategy was elaborated to define the hot formability based on the plastic instability and necking localization as a function of stamping temperature and blank dimensions. This strategy proved to be useful to define the safe formability region and therefore the larger thickness reduction that can be done during hot stamping to reduce vehicular components weight and to avoid cracks and failures usually observed in components like <b>clutch</b> <b>covers.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Context Loss of eggs to predators is a {{major cause}} of {{reproductive}} failure among birds. It is especially pronounced among ground-nesting birds because their eggs are accessible {{to a wide range of}} predators. Few studies document the main causes of clutch fate of ground-nesting birds. Aims The main objective of the present study was to identify the major egg predator of red-capped plovers (Charadrius ruficapillus). We also investigated the effectiveness of the following two primary strategies available to the plovers to avoid egg predation: (1) the placement of <b>clutches</b> under vegetative <b>cover</b> and (2) avoiding predators by nesting outside the peak season of predator occurrence. Methods Remote-sensing cameras were deployed on plover nests to identify egg predators and nests were monitored over four breeding seasons to document reproductive success and fate. An experiment using false clutches with model eggs investigated the influence of nest cover on the risk of egg predation throughout the year. Line-transect surveys were conducted to estimate the abundance of egg predators in and around the wetlands. Key results The little raven (Corvus mellori) was the major egg predator identified in 78. 6 % of red-capped plover clutches and in 92. 4 % of false clutches that were camera-monitored. The hatching success of plover eggs was not influenced by nest cover (P≤ 0. 36), but model egg survival in false clutches improved significantly with the presence of nest cover (P≤ 0. 02). The abundance of little ravens increased during the plover breeding season and was highly negatively correlated with false clutch survival (rpearson≤- 0. 768, P≤ 0. 005). Conclusions Little ravens were the major predator of red-capped plover eggs and their abundance increased significantly during the plover breeding season. Any influence of nest cover on hatching success of eggs may have been masked by the extremely high rate of egg loss associated with the increased little raven abundance during the plover breeding season. Implications The high rate of egg predation is likely to have negative consequences on the local red-capped plover population, suggesting management is warranted. Little raven populations have expanded and, thus, their impact as egg predators needs to be investigated especially on threatened species. Journal compilatio...|$|R
