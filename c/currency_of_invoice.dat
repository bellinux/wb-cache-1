We find an empirical relationship between the riskiness of the exchange rate and the fraction of imports invoiced in the importer¡¯s currency, the exporter¡¯s currency, and a third country currency. The higher the volatility of the exchange rate, the larger is the fraction of imports invoiced in the importer¡¯s currency. Consequently, the fraction of invoicing in the exporter¡¯s or a third country currency is inversely related to the volatility of the exchange rate. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the yen's role as a <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>invoice</b> and {{financial}} asset. Further aspects of the internationalisation of the yen (e. g. non-resident borrowing in yen) are not dealt with directly. The relatively small importance of the yen in trade invoicing suggests that the "transaction balance" portion of yen holdings has been small. This argument is further reinforced {{by the fact that}} the growth of non-resident holdings of yen assets has been closely related to the development of the exchange rate, coupled with the low level of yen sight accounts with Japanese banks. This implies that the advantage that the Japanese economy would enjoy from internationalisation is small, since the major advantage to the home country of an international currency is that it can fund part of its imports with non- or low-interest bearing liabilities. Furthermore, the exchange rate has been made more vulnerable to external shocks, although direct disturbance on of the domestic financial market has so far not been too serious. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis studies {{inflation}} dynamics, investigating both {{reasons why}} prices change, {{and why they}} sometimes do not. It investigates four areas that are of interest to monetary policy makers, but where our knowledge is incomplete. The first area investigated is the causes of price stickiness at the firm level. Insight is given by a large survey of price-setting behaviour of New Zealand firms. There is a large degree of heterogeneity in price-setting practices between, and within, sectors. Explicit contracts, implicit contracts and strategic complementarity are the most widely recognised causes of price rigidity. Menu costs and sticky information are not widely recognised. The second area investigated is how exporters price, {{and in particular the}} decisions over <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>invoice</b> and whether to differentiate prices across markets. In sharp contrast to commonly held views, we find that primary sector firms do differentiate prices across markets. Indeed, these firms are more likely to do so in New Zealand than firms in other sectors. Larger, and more productive firms, are more likely to differentiate prices. This thesis then studies the influence that global inflation factors have on domestic inflation. A CPI database for 223 countries and territories extends the previous research, which focuses on high income countries. Global factors explain a large share of the variance of national inflation rates in advanced countries, but not for less developed countries. More generally, global factors have greater influence in countries with higher GDP per capita, financial development and central bank transparency. Global factors explain a large share of the variance of food and energy prices but a much smaller share of the variance of other sub-components. Finally, this thesis carries out the first systematic analysis of the impact on inflation of disasters caused by natural hazards. There is a large degree of heterogeneity, with disasters having little significant effect in advanced countries, but having effects that can persist for years in developing economies. There are also differences between types of disasters and sub-indices of inflation. Storms have a short-run impact on food price inflation that lasts for the first two quarters, before being reversed in the subsequent two. Earthquakes reduce CPI inflation excluding food, housing and energy...|$|E

40|$|I {{define and}} provide {{empirical}} evidence for an “International Price System ” in global trade employing data for thirty-five {{developed and developing}} countries. This price system is characterized by two features. First, the overwhelming share of world trade is invoiced in very few currencies, with the dollar the dominant currency. Second, international prices, in their <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>invoicing,</b> are not very sensitive to exchange rates at horizons of up to two years. In this system, a good proxy for a country’s inflation sensitivity to exchange rate fluctuations is the fraction <b>of</b> its imports <b>invoiced</b> in a foreign currency. U. S. inflation is consequently more insulated from exchange rate shocks, while other countries are highly sensitive to it. Exchange rate depreciations (appreciations) make U. S. exports cheaper (expensive), while for other countries they mainly raise (lower) mark-ups and hence profits. U. S. monetary policy has spillover effects on inflation in other countries, while spillovers from other countries monetary policies on to U. S. inflation are more muted. ∗This paper was prepared for the 2015 Jackson Hole Symposium.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the firm-level pricing behavior of Japanese exports to present new evidence and determinants <b>of</b> an <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> We interviewed twenty-three major Japanese exporting firms {{to collect information}} on their currency invoicing behavior and also on their explicit policy/strategy for choosing an invoice currency. New findings in the destination breakdown of the share <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> are presented in four major exporting industries: automobile, electric machinery, general machinery and electronic component industries. We also propose six possible determinants <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> in Japanese exports: (i) intra- or inter-firm trade; (ii) cost of exchange rate hedging; (iii) the degree of market competition and differentiation of exporting products; (iv) the share of exporting products customarily traded in U. S. dollars; (v) exports from an Asian production base to the U. S. market; (vi) explicit policy of choosing a specific currency for invoicing. By constructing a firm-level dataset obtained from annual securities and financial reports of each sample firm, we conduct both cross-section OLS and probit estimation to empirically examine the determinants <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> at a firm-level export. Our novel findings are three-fold. First, importers' currency invoicing is prevalent in Japanese exports to developed countries. Since most exports of sample firms are destined for local subsidiaries that face severe competition in the local markets, Japanese parent firms have a strong tendency to take on exchange rate risk by invoicing in the importer's currency, {{which is consistent with}} the pricing-to-market (PTM) behavior discussed in the literature. Second, a large share of exports of electronics products that are customarily invoiced in U. S. dollars promotes U. S. -dollar invoicing even in exports to non-U. S. markets. Third, although Japanese firms have shifted their production bases to Asian countries, exports from these Asian bases tend to be invoiced in U. S. dollars as long as the final destination market is the United States. Given that U. S. -dollar invoicing is prevalent in Asia, both Japanese and Asian firms take exchange rate risks against the U. S. dollar. Establishing a common currency basket in Asia is worth considering to mitigate the exchange rate risk for both Japanese and Asian firms. ...|$|R

40|$|Stability in {{exchange}} rates {{has been the}} objective of several international monetary agreements since the early twentieth century. Thus the par value <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> was determined {{in terms of a}} specified amount of gold, under the gold standard, whilst, the Bretton Woods agreement and the Smithsonian agreement defined the value <b>of</b> each <b>currency</b> in terms <b>of</b> the dollar, where the dollar was defined in terms of gold. Nevertheless, all these various systems have failed to eliminate the arguments between the proponents and the opponents of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes. Although the major industrial countries have adopted a relatively flexible exchange rate regime, most developing countries have held their currencies pegged to the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> a major industrial country, or a basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies,</b> with the aim of meeting a particular macroeconomic criterion. The choice of pegs tends to be influenced by trade shares, however, adopted according to the objective function the domestic authorities aim to fulfil. The literature has defined several macroeconomic objectives of a peg but found no particular peg to be universally adopted by all developing countries. An examination <b>of</b> the contract <b>invoicing</b> literature shows that, international trade involves incurring of risk by firms, exporters and importers. This risk is partly determined by the choice <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> denomination <b>of</b> contracts, which firms are expected to seek means of minimizing. With respect to currencies used to invoice contracts, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that it is the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> the exporter which tends to be used to denominate trade contracts. However, on an ad hoc basis, certain commodities and raw materials were found to be invoiced in vehicle currencies, such as the dollar. Moreover, the choice <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>invoicing</b> is found to be influenced by many factors. In particular, inflation differentials were essential. Low inflation currencies are generally preferred by trading partners. A major issue of concern discussed in the literature is the potential effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the volume of international trade. The evidence on this has gone both ways. Some have argued that these fluctuations are of less concern because firms can use the forward market as means of reducing their impact. The analytical framework presented in the present thesis deals with an important issue for the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). These economies depend on oil revenues as the main source of income. Consequently, both government and private spending rely heavily on the oil sector. However, analyzing this invoicing policy without considering the behavior of the exchange rates between the <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> these countries and those of their major trading partners, would be misleading. Thus, the present model adopts an integrative approach aimed at choosing a currency or a basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies</b> for <b>invoicing</b> oil, and determining how the choices of the same arrangements or alternative arrangements adopted for pegging the domestic currencies can affect the welfare function adopted for the choice <b>of</b> <b>currency(s)</b> for <b>invoicing</b> oil. This welfare function, as it is argued in the thesis, is based on stabilizing the real, rather than the nominal, value of oil revenues. The historical perspective has demonstrated close correlations between inflation rates, money growth rates and oil revenues in the GCC economies. Moreover, the dependence of these economies on oil revenues as the major source of income, has been argued to be the decisive factor that has resulted in their currencies being pegged to the dollar. The results from the estimation, however, do not support a peg to the dollar, nor invoicing oil in dollars. Nonetheless, other single currencies have failed to fulfill the optimality condition, thus favoring pegging to a trade-weighted basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies,</b> and an <b>invoicing</b> scheme for oil which is based on a basket <b>of</b> <b>currencies.</b> Trade shares prove to be important, since deviations from purchasing power parity are passed via them. Despite the different levels of stability resulting from alternative combinations <b>of</b> peg and <b>invoice</b> choices, statistical evidence concludes that there are no significant differences amongst the resulting variances of the real value of oil revenues in terms <b>of</b> the domestic <b>currencies</b> <b>of</b> the GCC member states. Accordingly, it may be argued that if the sole objective of the authorities in these countries is to stabilize the real value of oil revenues, any choice of the alternatives considered in the present thesis would yield the same result in terms of stability...|$|R
40|$|In these essays, I examine quantitatively some of {{the classic}} {{questions}} {{in the field of}} International Economics: What is the impact of international trade on consumption and productivity? How does international trade affect income inequality? How do exchange rates movements affect real output and productivity? This dissertation is composed of three chapters, each covering one of these topics. The first chapter, based on my paper "Measured Gains from International Trade" with Ariel Burstein, revisits the measurement of welfare gains from trade liberalizations. Economists so far have measured these gains using one of two alternative approaches. A first approach uses structural models to infer unobservable welfare gains from changes in trade costs or in trade patterns. A second approach documents the empirical link between the level or the change in international trade and aggregate indicators of economic activity. This chapter connects these two approaches by studying the relationship between the theoretical welfare gains from trade and observable aggregate measures of economic activity, such as real GDP and real consumption, as constructed by national statistical agencies. Across a wide range of models, we find that measured real GDP and productivity rise in response to reductions in variable trade costs if GDP deflators capture the decline in trade costs. On the other hand, welfare gains from tariffs reductions are only reflected on real GDP if tariff revenues at constant prices rise. The second chapter analyzes the impact of capital equipment imports on income inequality across 53 countries. The chapter is based on my paper "Importing Skill Biased Technology" with Ariel Burstein and Jonathan Vogel. Capital equipment, such as computers and industrial machinery, is mostly operated by skilled workers and generally takes on routine tasks that are otherwise performed by unskilled workers. When a country imports capital equipment, it raises the relative demand of skilled versus unskilled workers, increasing income inequality. The chapter develops a tractable model of international trade in capital goods to quantify these effects. In doing so, it provides sufficient statistics and transparent formulas that will enable development practitioners to independently assess how trade in capital goods affects income inequality. We estimate that imports of equipment account for 16 percent of the income gap between skilled and unskilled workers in the median country in our sample, and for a much larger magnitude in economies that heavily rely on imported capital equipment. We also show that imports of capital equipment are essential to increase productivity and income in developing countries, both for skilled and unskilled workers, although my findings suggest these imports will disproportionately benefit the skilled segment of the population. In the third chapter, "Exchange Rates, Aggregate Productivity and the <b>Currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>Invoicing</b> <b>of</b> International Trade", I use a novel dataset on prices and quantities from Chilean customs and a model of international prices with nominal rigidities to study how movements in nominal exchange rates can impact aggregate output and productivity. Empirically, I show that export prices are rigid in the currency in which exports are invoiced, so the relative price <b>of</b> firms <b>invoicing</b> in different currencies fluctuates with the exchange rate. I exploit this feature of the data to estimate how quantities <b>of</b> firms <b>invoicing</b> in different currencies selling in a common destination move with the exchange rate. I find this elasticity to be low, indicating that exchange rate movements have limited expenditure switching effects. I then ask how the observed variation in markups generated by exchange rate movements affects aggregate productivity by affecting the allocation of production across firms. Guided by a quantitative open economy model disciplined by some features of my data, I show that a 10 percent change in the exchange rate changes productivity in the tradable sector by 0. 5 percent. Alternative parameterizations that do not account for the observed heterogeneity in invoicing predict changes in productivity at least five times smaller. This implies that taking heterogeneity into account is key for understanding the quantitative effects of exchange rates on productivity...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} a {{well-known}} puzzle why the yen has not been used more in trade invoicing among Japanese exporters. Despite the yen’s status as an only fully convertible currency in Asia, two patterns stand out as puzzling features of an excessively small share of yen invoicing: First, a strong tendency of Japanese exporters to choose importer's currency in their exports to advanced countries, and second, the prevalence <b>of</b> US dollar <b>invoicing</b> in Japanese exports to East Asia even though Japanese firms have built a regional production network {{in the last two}} decades.

40|$|We advance an {{explanation}} for the choice <b>of</b> the <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> international trade contracts on the basis of strategic bargaining considerations. The choice <b>of</b> the <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> originates in a situation in which each trader takes into account the other party's bargaining power. The latter depends on the individual discount factor, whether one is the first or second proposer, and whether one is on the short or long side of the market. Along these lines we explain the Grassman bias for trade contracts to be invoiced in the exporter's currency.

40|$|This is the author’s final, {{accepted}} and refereed manuscript to the article. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to examine the choice <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> for Norwegian salmon exporters. The choice <b>of</b> <b>invoicing</b> <b>currency</b> will affect prices in different markets as well as risk, factors that are increasingly important as the supply chain for salmon is becoming more sophisticated and more transactions mechanisms are introduced. The results indicate that destination-specific market characteristics have impacts as to the choice <b>of</b> <b>invoicing</b> strategy.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{an individual}} firm's choice <b>of</b> <b>invoicing</b> <b>currency</b> under {{exchange rate volatility}}. Greater exchange rate volatility amplifies the representative firm's desire to 'herd' relative to all other considerations that may affect the currency denomination decision. By 'herding' a firm chooses a <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> denomination so that the firm's price and the competition's price {{are affected by the}} exchange rate in a similar manner. Contrary to previous research, the results herein suggest that individual firms may invoice in a relatively volatile currency as long as its competitor's invoice in the same volatile currency.

The {{state of the art}} of benchmarking of document analysis systems is presented, based on the processing levels: Document Page Segmentation, Text Recognition, Document Classification, and Information Extraction. The restriction to invoices enables and requires a more purposeful, i. e. detailed, targetting of the benchmarking procedures (acquisition of ground truth data, system runs, comparison of data, condensation into meaningful numbers). Therefore the processing <b>of</b> <b>invoices</b> is dissected. The involved data structures are elicited and presented. These are provided, being the building blocks of the actual benchmarking <b>of</b> <b>invoice</b> analysis systems. ...|$|R
