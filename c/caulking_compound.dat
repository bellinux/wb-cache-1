40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to try out the {{methodology}} of craft science being under development at the Department of Conservation, University of Gothenburg, where crafts man work within for example horticulture is the subject of scientific analysis. The purpose of this work is to investigate and illustrate the practical knowledge of the content statements and relevance mainly in Anders Rosenstens appendage ”Allahanda frukt-bärande träns wård, hwilka höra Til Trägården” in the 1700 ’s scripture, ”Stadsmajorens ANDERS ROSENSTENS (1687 - 1740) Grundeliga Underwisning Om Skogars skötsel [...] . ” and thus contribute to a better knowledge and understanding of the historical gardener-knowledge with focus on depth, practice and significance. Methodo-logy used is mainly qualitative investigative methods. Primarily interpretive analyzes of both Rosensten text and the reference texts selected. Work on fruit tree care is broken down into various proce-dural schedules. Rosensten's advice and guidance, including Trozelius additions, are analyzed and compared with reputable and well-documented gardener opinions and advice from the 1600 -, 1700 -, 1800 -, 1900 – century, and even with modern perceptions and advice. The craft of scientific methodology has also been tested by practical experiment of manufacturing <b>caulking</b> <b>compound</b> starting from Rosensten´s recipes. Rosensten´s views in fruit tree care are everything from almost ancient to much modern notions. For instance with regard to certain measures in tree care, so as to cut cardiac roots of, to Rosenstens perception that summer and fall is a good time for pruning. Rosensten follow primarily his contemporaries’ opinions about fruit tree care. He omits two key areas of the subject, the propagation of fruit-trees by grafting and pruning. These two areas are maybe the two areas of which the sources have had most opinions and perceptions, leading to a suspicion that Rosensten had perhaps not as deep knowledge of the subject fruit tree care. This work is mainly to regard as a methodology study. The survey carried out is primarily theoretical with an element of practical experiments in the form of caulking compounds. The theoretical investigation needs to be complemented by practical experiments and trials of alleged advice and opinions to improve the understanding of selected methods. The methodology used works and {{is a step in the}} right direction but it needs to be refined and standardizedExamensarbete för avläggande av filosofie masterexamen i Kulturvård, 30 hp Institutionen för kulturvård Göteborgs universitet 2014 : 3...|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, worker bees {{will even}} gather various <b>caulking</b> <b>compounds</b> of human manufacture, when the usual sources are more {{difficult}} to obtain. The properties of the propolis depend on the exact sources used by each individual hive; therefore any potential medicinal properties that may be present in one hive's propolis may be absent from another's, or from another sample in the same hive.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} a new cyclic fatigue test apparatus (CFTA) {{developed at the}} USDA Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory. The new CFTA is computer controlled and powered by electric linear actuators. Computer con trol allows the CFTA to subject specimens to specific strain/time profiles or replicate input strain data in real time from thermal and/or moisture driven cyclic movement of materials such as metals, glass, ceramics, and wood. The CFTA was designed for outdoor sealant testing but is readily adaptable for testing other materials. BACKGROUND Sealants and <b>caulking</b> <b>compounds</b> are used to prevent moisture intrusion into the structure and living space of residential and commercial buildings. This is necessary to maintain safe, comfortable living conditions for occupants and to prevent water damage to building struc tures. In outdoor use, sealants and <b>caulking</b> <b>compounds</b> are subjected to physical strains caused by the expansion and contraction of building materials as temperature and relative humidit...|$|R
25|$|Silicones {{are often}} used in {{waterproofing}} treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and <b>caulking</b> <b>compounds.</b> Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil. Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some superalloys.|$|R
50|$|Alternating silicon-oxygen chains with {{hydrogen}} {{attached to}} the remaining silicon bonds form the ubiquitous silicon-based polymeric materials known as silicones. These compounds containing silicon-oxygen and occasionally silicon-carbon bonds {{have the capability to}} act as bonding intermediates between glass and organic compounds, and to form polymers with useful properties such as impermeability to water, flexibility and resistance to chemical attack. Silicones are often used in waterproofing treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and <b>caulking</b> <b>compounds.</b> Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil.|$|R
40|$|Crosslinked 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazole {{elastomers}} {{were prepared}} either by thermally condensing a monomer having the formula HwN(HON) C-R-Q, wherein Q is a triazine ring forming group such as nitrile or amidine, or by {{a mixture of}} said monomer with RC(NOH) NH 22, with R in these formulas standing for a bivalent organic radical containing fluorine, hydrogen, or trifluoromethyl. In the monomer charge, the overall proportions of amidoxime groups to triazine ring forming groups varies depending {{on the extent of}} crosslinking desired in the final polymer. The heat and chemical resistant elastomers disclosed can serve, for instance, as adhesives, <b>caulking</b> <b>compounds,</b> channel sealants, fuel tank liners...|$|R
50|$|Halmeg Linseed oil was {{manufactured}} on a 5-acre Mill {{located at}} the end of Punt Road, overlooking Looking Glass Bay. The linseed oil was used in the manufacture of lead paint and varnish, as well as putties, <b>caulking</b> <b>compounds,</b> printing inks and linoleum. The production plant was established in 1923. The revolutionary extraction process did not work at first. Despite this, one hundred guests toured the new mill at its official opening. Harold Meggit, owner of the plant, increased employees wages, also advising {{that there would be no}} jobs, no wages if a new solution to distil the oil could not be found. The employees put forward hundreds of suggestions, and two were implemented, producing the finest linseed oil in the industry. In later years, Halmeg was the first to produce Safflower Oil in Australia. It also introduced a profit sharing scheme for its employees. The site closed in 1974.|$|R

50|$|The {{diversity}} of {{resources for the}} Gabrielino Indians was mainly due to {{the wide range of}} biotic zones in their territory. These included beach and coastal regions, fresh and salt water regions, chaparral and grassland zones, and even woodland and mountain regions. Faunal resources included land mammals, fish, insects, reptiles, and sea-mammals. Floral resources included trees, plants, seeds, bulbs, and sea grasses. Mineral resources included obsidian, chert, and other types of stones to make tools and <b>caulking</b> or adhesive <b>compounds.</b> These three resource categories satisfied all the material needs of the Gabrielino Indians.|$|R
