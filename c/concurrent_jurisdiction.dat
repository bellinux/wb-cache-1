Part II examines the jurisdictional implications of the decision and concludes that most, if not all, reserved rights cases will now be tried in state courts. Parts III and IV explore the problems of exclusive state control of these claims. Part III describes the justifications for a federal forum in reserved rights cases and suggests that the policies underlying the doctrine of protective jurisdiction be applied to preserve federal adjudication of reserved rights.

25|$|The Chief Justice may direct {{that the}} District Court {{to hear and}} {{determine}} certain types of proceedings when he thinks it is necessary or expedient to improve efficiency in the administration of justice and to provide for the speedier disposal of proceedings started in the High Court. In 1996 aspects of the High Court's jurisdiction to hear matrimonial cases were transferred to a dedicated Family Court, which is constituted as a District Court. As of December 2007, the Family Court hears proceedings relating to divorce, division of matrimonial assets and guardianship of children, including matters over which it has <b>concurrent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> with the Syariah Court. However, contested applications for the division of matrimonial assets where the net value asserted by any party to the proceedings is of or above $1.5 million are transferred back to the High Court. Decisions made by the Family Court may be appealed to the High Court, but no further appeal may be brought to the Court of Appeal unless the Court of Appeal or a Judge of the High Court grants leave for such an appeal.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of Constantinople increased, {{but it was}} gradual. From the death of Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been resident only in the years 337-8, 347–51, 358–61, 368–69. Its status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus, who held office from 11 December 359 until 361. The urban prefects had <b>concurrent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome. The emperor Valens, who hated the city and spent only one year there, nevertheless built the Palace of Hebdomon {{on the shore of}} the Propontis near the Golden Gate, probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to Zeno and Basiliscus were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. Theodosius I founded the Church of John the Baptist to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the Topkapı Palace), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of Aphrodite into a coach house for the Praetorian Prefect; Arcadius built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.|$|E

However, these early attempts were rebuffed due to concerns over jurisdiction, particularly because the early proposals would have established a federal Supreme Court exercising both original (trial) <b>jurisdiction</b> and <b>concurrent</b> appellate <b>jurisdiction</b> potentially in conflict with existing courts administered by Ontario and Quebec.|$|R

500|$|After two years, Cisneros was re-arrested on February 25, 1998, {{and held}} without bond. According to county jail records, {{she was arrested}} for the same murder-for-hire charges as the first time. The FBI did not {{elaborate}} initially on the charges, but stated she was indicted by a federal grant jury for using interstate or foreign commerce facilities to orchestrate the murder. The indictment's hearing was held {{two weeks before the}} statute of limitations ran out. Cameron County officials said that charging Cisneros again was not double jeopardy, which protects individuals from being charged for the same crime more than once, because she was charged federally. They argued the new indictment included new charges not discussed in the previous trial, and that there are some areas that allow for <b>concurrent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> that can lead to someone being charged for separate crimes under the same circumstances. If convicted again, Cisneros was facing another life in prison sentence and a US$250,000 fine. Her defense stated they would plead not guilty and ask for a jury trial. The prosecution said that Martínez agreed to serve as their primary witness again. The defense criticized the new indictment stating it was vague and did not include new information.|$|E
40|$|Although Massachusetts {{became the}} leading {{jurisdiction}} for trust {{law in the}} United States across the nineteenth century, it never established a separate court resembling the High Court of Chancery in England. This Article asks how the judicial system of Massachusetts functioned without a separate court of chancery. The Article explains that Massachusetts managed by gradually integrating the distinctive elements of English equity into its common law courts. Beginning in the 1690 s, the legislature passed laws authorizing components of equity {{for use in the}} common law courts. By 1836 the commonwealth 2 ̆ 7 s Supreme Judicial Court could oversee discovery, entertain cases with multiple parties, and grant injunctions and- specific performance. The court could also administer certain areas of substantive law, including trust, guardianship, and settlement of estates, that in England belonged to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery. Thus, the Supreme Judicial Court had <b>concurrent</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> in law and equity early in the nineteenth century. In this respect the court resembled the federal courts before the merger of law and equity in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938.

2500|$|The Robinsons' Oklahoma {{attorney}} {{brought the}} lawsuit {{in state court}} in Creek County, Oklahoma, the county in which the accident had occurred. Creek County {{was at that time}} known as home {{to some of the most}} plaintiff sympathetic juries in the country. [...] However, since the lawsuit met requirements for <b>concurrent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in both state and federal court, Audi and Volkswagen would have had the ability to ask for the case to be removed from state court in Creek County and taken directly to federal court. One of the factors which governs <b>concurrent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is diversity of citizenship, or whether a defendant and plaintiff are from the same state. In the case of multiple defendants, if one defendants' state citizenship matches the plaintiff's, concurrent federal jurisdiction does not apply and the case cannot be removed to federal court unless the case concerns a matter of federal law. It has therefore been stated that the reason the Robinsons' attorney added the New York regional distributor and New York dealership as defendants was to prevent Audi and Volkswagen from being able to remove the case from what was generally seen as a Creek County pro-plaintiffs' jury to what would be a federal court jury in Tulsa that might be more sympathetic to the car manufacturers' case. [...] The Robinsons had not yet completed a move to Arizona, so they were still considered to be legal residents of New York.|$|E
