40|$|This study investigates {{propagation}} buckling of subsea pipe-in-pipe (PIP) systems under hydrostatic pressure. Unlike {{in previous}} studies, PIP systems consisting of <b>carrier</b> <b>pipes</b> with a diameter-to-thickness (D=t) ratio {{in the range}} 26 - 40 are examined here.

The comparison indicates that the proposed modified analytical expression provides a more accurate lower-bound estimate of the propagation buckling pressure of PIP systems compared with the existing equations, especially for higher D=t ratios. The novel RST and CRST protocols proposed for PIP systems give lower-bound estimates of the propagation pressure. The FE analysis outcomes demonstrate that the lengths of PIP system transition zones are almost twice the corresponding lengths in single pipes.

30|$|An {{analysis}} method for the buckling process of a pipe section with a random pipelay imperfection is proposed. Four basic lateral modes, acquired by finite-element (FE) eigenvalue buckling analysis, are combined {{to provide the}} needed grid configurations for describing a real pipelay imperfection and an arc-length algorithm is {{used to analyze the}} snap-through process of the shell-element-grid model under nonlinear frictional boundary conditions. This paper also presents evaluation methods for the lateral buckling of two types of pipe-in-pipe systems that are used in the offshore oil and gas industry. For evaluating the buckling and postbuckling of compliant pipe-in-pipe systems FE analyses were carried out to judge the occurrence of the system buckling and furthermore to check postbuckling stresses induced in the buckles. The calculated results of the modified Riks algorithm indicate that only when high temperature would not trigger an abrupt short-wavelength buckle and when no yielding has been induced in the unavoidable long-wavelength buckles, the thermal stability and safety of compliant pipe-in-pipe systems can be proved. In the non-compliant pipe-in-pipe systems, firstly small-amplitude buckles of the <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> may occur in the annulus between <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> and casing pipe and the contact forces between the spacers and the casing pipe may drive the buckle of the pipe-in-pipe systems on the seabed. Based on the classical analytical solution of pipe buckling, four potential buckling modes corresponding to finite-element models are developed to evaluate the stability and the postbuckling strength of such pipe-in-pipe systems.|$|E

For this reason, the thermal performance of bundle-insulated flowlines has been studied with a general-purpose, finite-element, partial-differential equation solver. Steady-state and transient cooldown performance were analyzed for six different bundle configurations. Overall heat transfer coefficients for individual flowlines within a bundle have been determined in addition to cooldown performance for different insulation levels and pipe sizes. These results have been compared with results obtained for the simple bundle geometry of a pipe-in-pipe system, and found comparable. To expedite the calculation of overall heat transfer coefficients for bundle flowlines, simplified heat transfer calculations were developed as an approximation to the finite-element solutions.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} pipeline {{safety and}} develops {{a mathematical model}} for predicting illegal intrusion. The model idealizes a typical pipeline structure as a pipe-in-pipe double beam, consisting of the process pipe encased in a larger diameter outer <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> resting on an elastic soil foundation. Intrusion is considered to consist of hammering and cutting activities on the casing pipe which transmits shock motion to the process pipe. From the solution feedback control algorithms have been proposed for designing surveillance instruments which assist in mitigating the problem of illegal intrusion for harvesting of crude oil. A point sensor was used to simulate the response to intrusive hammering action induced on the casing pipe in a 2 m segment of the process pipe in an example. Sensor was conFigureured to measure displacement response at intervals of 2 seconds at (0. 00, 0. 06, 0. 12,…, 2. 00) m sampling points.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{relating to}} the thermal management of hydrocarbon fluids issuing from (typically sub-sea) wells and passing through flow lines to a processing facility (typically an offshore platform). The hydrocarbon fluids must be kept at a temperature above that at which solids (typically waxes or hydrates) are formed. One way of achieving this “Thermal Management” is to place the flow lines inside a <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> through which is also passed (in a separate pipe) a heating fluid (typically hot water). The design of such “bundle” systems is a significant challenge because of the complex combined natural convection and radiation heat transfer processes involved. In related work, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods {{are being used to}} predict these complex processes and the principal objective of the work described in this thesis was to carry out new experiments to validate these predictions. Experiments were carried out on an industrial scale 5 -Pipe Bundle covering the full range of bundle orientations from horizontal to vertical so as to be able to simulate horizontal and inclined flow lines and risers. The bundle chosen was 3 m long with a 30 inch (762 mm) internal diameter <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> with 4 pipes mounted inside it. The four internal pipes were respectively a 14 inch (355. 6 mm) outside diameter pipe, a 8 inch (219. 1 mm) outside diameter pipe and two 4 inch (114. 3 mm) outside diameter pipes. These 4 pipes represented the hydrocarbon product pipe, the test pipe and the heating flow and return pipes in a typical industrial bundle. A support mechanism on which the bundle can be rotated from 0 to 360 ° was designed and constructed. In the experiments, the surface temperatures of each pipe surface were kept constant but differences were imposed between the respective surfaces. Heat flow rates from or to each pipe surface in the bundle were measured using a calorimetric method and the results were compared with those predicted using the ANSYS CFD code. Good agreement was obtained between the heat flows measured and those calculated from the code. This thesis also describes an analytical and numerical work on natural convection heat transfer inside a vertical pipe taking into account the effect of solids formation by freezing of the fluid at the wall.

40|$|District {{heating and}} steam {{distribution}} through an underground network of pipes {{dates back to}} the late 1800 s. Many systems exist today with piping networks that exceed 50 years of service life. The age of these systems has taken its toll resulting in the thermal inefficiency of the network. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates there are 20, 000 miles of heat distribution pipes. Millions of dollars a year are lost due to the ineffective thermal efficiency of these pipes. This inefficiency contributes to excess fuel burned at the plant, resulting in excess emissions that contribute to global warming. Steam distribution networks exist in major metropolitan areas, military bases and university campuses. The costs to replace these systems due to poor thermal efficiency would cost billions of dollars. In most cases, the steel <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> is still in good condition and the outer conduit is intact; however, the insulation surrounding this pipe has degraded or fallen off and washed away.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} is to propose and develop a cost {{effective}} production design concept suitable for oil reservoirs situated in deep (1500 m) water which can be quickly and safely installed in areas with limited weather windows. The proposed design is based upon a steel catenary riser which will connect an FPSO directly into either a wellhead or seabed pipeline system thereby eliminating both the connection complexes and high cost associated with a central manifold. The catenary geometry will ensure that the structure is inherently compliant whilst a <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> arrangement will provide structural protection and buoyancy to a flowline bundle contained within. The interface between the riser and the surface production vessel is a critical part of any riser system and so for the purposes of this study two design arrangements are considered. The first is based upon a direct connection between an FPSO turret and riser whereas the second is a hybrid design in which the riser is supported by a sub-surface buoy which is hydraulically connected to an FPSO using flexible flowlines. This hybrid connection has the advantage of decoupling FPSO and riser motions. Design development is carried out by examining a range of critical areas...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{outlines}} {{the advantages of}} using trenchless methods for the rehabilitation of pipelines made of steel, concrete, cast iron etc. The authors describe causes of <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> ageing and methods of their inspection and renovation. The technical aspects of choosing the renovation methods are also presented. The paper includes a decision-making flowchart for choosing the carrier pipes renovations. Design/methodology/approach: The 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s saw an explosion of new pipe installation and repair techniques which minimize the need to dig continuous trenches to bury the pipeline, so called ‘trenchless technologies’. The trenchless technologies have been widely applied for the rehabilitation of various pipelines such as sewage systems, gas pipelines or water supply systems. There has been characterized the swagelining technology {{which is based on}} one of the metal working technologies and namely the sinking of pipes. Findings: The PE pipe stress in the drawing die zone has been analyzed and an attempt has been made to analyze the mechanisms causing the elastic recovery of PE pipes. There have also been presented the diameter changes as the parameter of the elastic recovery which is a result of our own research conducted in accordance with the program developed. Research limitations/implications: Each pipeline renovation method has its advantages and disadvantages, possibilities and limitations, depending on the application. Practical implications: The work is an example of analysis of chosen trenchless renovation on the example of swageling technology. Originality/value: The trenchless renovation of pipelines certainly will be more readily used in the future because of wearing out of pipelines. The other reason is the lack of space for new utilities, increasing costs and road-surface restoration requirements...|$|E

The definitive version is available from: [URL] road carriageway and pavement sub-surface of many UK highways are drained by Highway Filter Drains (HFD). These are gravel filled trenches fitted with a porous <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> at the base that convey surface and sub-surface water to an outfall. HFD are typically characterized as free draining upon construction however, over time the voids of the granular medium become filled due to the intrusion of fines washed from the adjacent earthworks or pavement surface. The lack of understanding of the deterioration mechanisms and the absence of a structured fouling characterization limit the assessment of operational and residual HFD life to qualitative or subjective estimation of in-service performance. This extends to maintenance procedures that are predominately reactive. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of HFD performance and drainage media condition assessment. It then presents a method of fouling characterization based on assessment of samples from in service drains. Three fouling scales are thus suggested; the percentage drain fouling, the foulant-aggregate ratio and the free voids ratio. In-service HFD are found to be functioning at an acceptable standard with a limited number of localized failures attributed to highly fouled layers at the surface of the trench. It is proposed that a rational evaluation of a HFD section should employ means other than just visual indicators. The fouling assessment is linked to laboratory permeability tests conducted with different levels of filter material fouling. It is found that the extent, spreading and type of fouling are important to determine how the filter aggregate performs...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} the {{development}} of our urban landscape have seen the introduction of larger buildings with vast roof areas especially in localised business and industry parks. It is anticipated that the onset of climate change will see increased intensities and volumes of rainfall which will place significant pressures on the roof drainage systems for these buildings, potentially leading to failure and major flooding. There is an urgent need to examine alternative forms of roof drainage and a potential future solution is the adoption of siphonic roof drainage systems. However, it has been identified that there is a universal lack of understanding of the hydraulic performance of siphonic systems, particularly with regard to multi-outlet systems. The work presented in this thesis describes a comprehensive experimental programme of research using novel and sophisticated measurement techniques including flourometry and particle image velocimetry, to increase the understanding of the hydraulic performance of multi-outlet siphonic roof drainage systems. The overall aim was to deliver a step change and better understanding of the performance of such systems and how they may be better designed. A total of 63 steady flow tests were completed using the siphonic roof drainage test facility at the University of Sheffield. The results from this study support key findings that within a multi-outlet siphonic system the flow rate through each individual outlet is contrary to existing design practice and significantly different flow regimes occurred within the horizontal <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe.</b> Hence, current approaches applied in conventional siphonic roof drainage practice and design software should be reviewed. The outputs from this study have highlighted the need for further research to better understand the performance of multi-outlet siphonic roof drainage systems. These topics may be addressed with the technology and methodologies developed within the experimental programme of research reported in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} {{for reducing the}} energy consumption in society has increased during the last decades due to an increased environmental awareness. One way to decrease the energy losses in the building sector {{is to improve the}} thermal insulation of building envelopes and installations and thereby decrease the heat losses. This thesis analyzes two types of novel insulation with low thermal conductivity; aerogel blankets and vacuum insulation panels. The thesis aims to investigate the possible benefits from using these novel insulations, but also to evaluate new considerations related to the high insulation performance. The insulations have been tested in two applications: 1. 	A wooden stud wall with aerogel blankets as insulation 2. 	Hybrid insulated district heating pipes where aerogel blankets or vacuum insulation panels have been wrapped around the <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> and polyurethane have been used to fill the rest of the casing pipe. Thermal properties and moisture properties have been measured in laboratory by guarded heat flow meter, guarded hot pipe, transient plane source and wet cup method. District heating pipes with vacuum insulation panels have also been measured in field. The measured properties have been used in numerical simulations to evaluate the heat losses and the risk of moisture related damages for both applications. The studies show promising results for aerogel blanket insulated walls where the wall thickness was reduced by 40 percent compared to a conventional Swedish wall. However, the effect on the moisture conditions from the thermal bridges through the studs has to be considered in order to avoid damages. For district heating pipes, the vacuum insulation panels showed the most promising results with a decrease in the heat losses by 15 to 25 percent depending on the dimensions of the pipe and the thickness of the vacuum insulation panels. In hybrid insulation double pipes with vacuum insulation, the position of the thermal bridges {{at the edges of the}} panel has a large impact on the total heat losses. The thesis also examines some challenges when measuring the properties of the novel insulation. The thermal conductivity of aerogel blankets improves with an increased compression of the samples. The properties of the curved vacuum insulation panels used in the district heating pipes are difficult to measure since there is an impact from the thermal bridges along the edges, which might be influenced by surrounding materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{doctoral}} Thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (Eng. D.) at Loughborough UniversityAcross {{a large part of}} the UK highways network the carriageway and pavement foundations are drained by Highway Filter Drains (HFDs). A HFD is a linear trench constructed either at the pavement edge or central reserve, fitted with a porous <b>carrier</b> <b>pipe</b> at the base and backfilled with an initially highly porous aggregate material. This arrangement enables the swift removal of surface runoff and subsurface water from the pavement system minimising road user hazards and eliminating risk of structural damage to the pavement sub-base. The highly porous backfill filters throughout its operational life fines washed from the pavement wearing course or adjacent land. HFDs have been found to be prone to collecting near the basal sections (pipe) or surface layers contaminants or detritus that causes the filter media to gradually block. The process has been defined as HFD clogging and it has been found to lead to reduced drainage capacity and potentially severe drop of serviceability. O&M contractual agreements for DBFO projects usually propose in-service and handback requirements for all assets included in the concession portfolio. Different performance thresholds are thus prescribed for pavements, structures, ancillary assets or street lighting. Similar definitions can be retrieved for drainage assets in such agreements, and these include HFDs. Performance metrics are defined though in a generic language and residual life (a key indicator for major assets that usually drives long-term maintenance planning) is prescribed without indicative means to evaluate such a parameter. Most of pavement maintenance is carried out nowadays using proactive management thinking and engineered assessment of benefits and costs of alternative strategies (what-if scenarios). Such a proactive regime is founded upon data driven processes and asset specific ageing / renewal understanding. Within the spectrum of road management, maintenance Life Cycle Costs are usually generated and updated on an annual basis using inventory and condition data linked to a Decision Support Tool (DST). This enables the assessment and optimisation of investment requirements and projection of deterioration and of treatment impacts aligned to continuous monitoring of asset performance. Following this paradigm shift in infrastructure management, a similar structured methodology to optimise HFD maintenance planning is desired and is introduced in this thesis. The work presented enables the identification of proactive maintenance drivers and potential routes in applying a systemised HFD appraisal and monitoring system. An evaluation of Asset Management prerequisites is thus discussed linked to an overview of strategic requirements to establish such a proactive approach. The thesis identifies condition assessment protocols and focuses on developing the means to evaluate deteriorated characteristics of in service drains using destructive and non-destructive techniques. A probabilistic HFD ageing / renewal model is also proposed using Markov chains. This builds upon existing deterioration understanding and links back to current treatment options and impacts. A filter drain decision support toolkit is lastly developed to support maintenance planning and strategy generation...|$|E
