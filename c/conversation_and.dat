5|$|In 1898, Bresslau met {{her future}} husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, they {{developed}} a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both to develop their lives while enjoying each other's companionship, <b>conversation,</b> <b>and</b> virtues. The one thing that united the pair was their shared ideology: {{to take care of}} others.|$|E
40|$|<b>Conversations</b> <b>and</b> {{observations}} about school-based data and individual improvements in classroom practices can form {{some of the}} more powerful parts of a school’s overall approach to professional learning deliberately aimed at gaining improvements. The success of such strategies depends on the development of a school culture of trust, and the use of effective communication strategies. In this paper Professor Kathryn Moyle outlines the steps school leadership can take in establishing a basis for <b>conversations</b> <b>and</b> observations, conducting coaching <b>and</b> mentoring <b>conversations</b> <b>and</b> building a culture of trust. The focus in this paper is on the professional learning purposes of using data coupled with <b>conversations</b> <b>and</b> observations, rather than their use for accountability purposes...|$|R

Michael knows Maria is right but Ric thinks he might have made a mistake and he explains to Maddy that he is withdrawing her interview offer. Maddy is devastated.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a <b>conversation,</b> <b>and</b> André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{their school}} years, {{children}} {{continue to build}} their vocabulary. In particular, children begin to learn abstract words.

The phonological loop and serial order short-term memory may both {{play an important role}} in vocabulary development.|$|E

However, as the TV show {{was not part of}} Microsoft's project, the closure of Xbox Entertainment Studios did not affect the progress of the TV show production. It was created by Lifeboat Productions, who worked closely with Remedy through Skype <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> screenplay review. Many scenes had to be shot twice due to the game's alternate content and branching nature. Three writers from Remedy also contributed to the TV show content.|$|E

The Virginia Tech Review Panel report, also released in August 2007, placed this diagnosis in the spring of Cho's eighth-grade year, and his parents sought treatment for him through medication and therapy. In high school, Cho was placed in special education under the 'emotional disturbance' classification. He was excused from oral presentations and participation in class <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> received 50 minutes a month of speech therapy.

5|$|Along with {{intellectual}} pursuits, the gentry exhibited {{habits and}} cultured hobbies which marked their social status and refinement. The erudite term of enjoying {{the company of}} the 'nine guests' (九客, jiuke)—an extension of the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar—was a metaphor for accepted gentry pastimes of playing the Chinese zither, playing Chinese chess, Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, <b>conversation,</b> <b>and</b> drinking wine. The painted artwork of the gentry shifted dramatically in style from Northern to Southern Song, due to underlying political, demographic, and social circumstance. Northern Song gentry and officials, who were concerned largely with tackling issues of national interest and not much for local affairs, preferred painting huge landscape scenes where any individuals were but tiny figures immersed within a larger context. During the Southern Song, political, familial, and social concerns became heavily embedded with localized interests; these changes correlate with the chief style of Southern Song paintings, where small, intimate scenes with a primary focus on individuals was emphasized.|$|E

5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E

5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a <b>conversation,</b> <b>and</b> that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, Sirivudh {{talked about}} his desire to assassinate Hun Sen during an {{interview}} with So Naro, who was the secretary-general of the Khmer Journalists Association. A few days later Ung Phan, a FUNCINPEC minister who had close ties with Hun Sen, called Sirivudh and accused him of getting involved in receiving kickbacks for printing Cambodian passports. Sirivudh angrily denied the accusations and threatened to kill Hun Sen over the phone. The phone conversation was recorded, and Ung Phan passed the recorded phone conversation to CPP co-minister of the interior Sar Kheng. Hun Sen learnt of the <b>conversation</b> <b>and</b> became enraged at Sirivudh's comments, and pressured Ranariddh and other FUNCINPEC ministers to strip his parliamentary immunity {{so that he could}} be arrested. Sirivudh was arrested and briefly placed in detention, but subsequently exiled to France when Sihanouk intervened in the case.|$|E
