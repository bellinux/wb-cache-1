5000|$|During the 1970s, Lauren, Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis became {{particularly}} {{known for}} their sportswear designs, made in all-natural fibres such as wool, <b>combed</b> <b>cotton,</b> and linen, which placed them at the top tier of American fashion design alongside the Anne Klein label (designed by Donna Karan and Louis Dell'Olio). Newsweek in 1975 described Calvin Klein as having styled his clean, casual separates with the authority of a couture designer, and by 1985, Martin described him as [...] "one of the great American stylists" [...] with a solid international reputation and worldwide influence entirely based on his skills as a sportswear designer. The industry empires of Lauren and Calvin Klein would be joined in the mid-1980s by Donna Karan's own-name label and Tommy Hilfiger, each of whom created distinctive wardrobes for the American woman based upon stylish but wearable, comfortable and interchangeable multi-purpose clothes that combined practicability with luxury. These clothes were also designed to have a long, stylish and undated life, rather than to only be fashionable for one season. In 1976, the designer Zoran brought out {{the first of a}} number of collections of extremely simple garments made of the finest quality fabrics; garments that barely changed over the years and which became cult objects to his wealthy clientele. In 1993, the fashion journalist Suzy Menkes declared Zoran's less-is-more sportswear prophetic of the early 1990s modernist trend, whilst Zoran stated that the work of Calvin Klein, Karan, and the Anne Klein label epitomised the [...] "comfort, simplicity, and practicality" [...] associated with sportswear. Most early 21st century sportswear design follows in the footsteps of these designers. Other notable sportswear designers of the late 20th century include Norma Kamali, whose 1980s fashionable garments made from sweatshirt fabric were highly influential; [...] Marc Jacobs, whose eponymous label renowned for layered informality in both day and evening wear was founded in 1986, and Isaac Mizrahi, who presented his first collection in 1987.|$|E

Compact ring spun cotton yarns showed higher tex values and lower weight loss than <b>combed</b> ring spun <b>cotton</b> yarns under the same counts. Coefficient of variation of yarns increased slightly after singeing treatment. The unevenness of yarn was divided into two parts: basic unevenness of yarn body and hairiness unevenness, to explain the worse yarn evenness after singeing treatment. In this way, the effect of singeing on yarn properties was investigated thoroughly so as to improve yarn quality with less hairiness and good evenness. ...|$|R
25|$|From the 1890s, {{the mills}} {{produced}} Viyella, {{a mixture of}} cotton with Merino wool, which produces a soft fabric. They continued to flourish, as various extensions show. The Upper Mill was extended in the 1890s, when a fourth storey was added, and again, probably in 1913, when extensions {{were added to the}} north and rear. A large <b>combing</b> shed, where <b>cotton</b> fibres were straightened and aligned prior to the production of fabric, was built just below it in 1913. This was a two-storey building, with a single storey wing at the back. It was extended in 1952, when an extra two floors were added to the main shed, and a three-storey block was added at the side. At this point, it became a mill, and is now called Mill 2. The Lower Mill was also extended, but because it was much larger than the Upper Mill when it was built, and the extensions were relatively small, it retains more of its original character. There were 980 workers employed at the site in 1934, but decline gradually set in. The first workers houses were demolished in 1961, to be followed by the school, the baths and the Mechanics Institute. By 1987, production had moved abroad, and the mills closed. Bolsover District Council bought the mill buildings in 1992, using compulsory purchase powers, and they have been revitalised, to be used for light industry and offices. The mill ponds have also survived.|$|R

40|$|Cotton {{knitted fabrics}} were {{manufactured}} with different yarn types (conventional ring spun yarn and torque-free ring spun yarn) with different fibre types (<b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> and combed Supima cotton) and yarn fineness (Ne 30 and Ne 40). These fabrics were then dyed with {{three types of}} dye (reactive, direct and sulphur dye) with three dye concentrations (0. 1 %, 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % on-weight of fabric (owf)) in three colours (red, yellow and blue). This study examined the impact of constructional parameters and dyeing on ultraviolet (UV) protection properties of cotton knitted fabric. In-vitro test with spectrophotometer was used for evaluating the UV protection property of dyed cotton knitted fabrics. Among the six parameters investigated, fineness of yarn and dye concentration were the most significant factors affecting UPF while the color effect is the least significant. Experimental results revealed that the UPF value of dyed fabrics made from <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> is generally higher than the combed Supima cotton since <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> is composed of shorter fibres which facilitate the blocking or absorption of UV radiation. Second, fabrics made with twist yarn (i. e. ring spun yarn) have higher UPF value than the corresponding ESTex one (i. e. Torque-free yarn) in general since fabrics made with ring spun yarn tend to shrink during wet processing {{and so it is}} more compact. Third, the UPF value of fabrics made with 30 Ne yarn was higher than the 40 Ne one since it is thicker and has lower fabric porosity. Fourth, fabrics dyed with lower concentration of dye gave the lowest UPF. Fifth, the sulphur dyed samples performed worse than the reactive and direct dyed samples in terms of UV protection property. Sixth, there is no significant difference in UPF for red, yellow and blue coloured fabrics. Seventh, this study also demonstrated that lightness of fabric is negatively related to UV protection property. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

Engineering fabrics with desirable thermo-physiological properties suited for specific applications such as active wear, intimate wear is a big challenge for textile manufacturers as gamut of fibre, yarn and fabric parameters are known to influence the thermo-physiological properties. The present study was undertaken with an aim to explore suitable combination of fibre and yarn variables for engineering polyesterâ€“cotton plated fabrics with good thermo-physiological properties. Categorical variables i.e. outer layer yarn type and inner layer fibre linear density were found to affect the thermal, moisture vapour and liquid moisture transfer properties of developed test samples. Fabrics knitted with carded yarn and polyester fibre of high linear density showed high thermal resistance and would feel warmer on initial skin contact owing to low thermal absorptivity. However, the air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate increased with combination of <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> yarn in the outer and coarse polyester fibre in the inner layer. Combed yarn fabrics were superior in trans planar wicking compared to carded yarn fabrics which showed higher water absorbency and would be slow drying fabrics.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems that cotton knitted fabrics present during the manufacturing process is their dimensional instability, which needs to be minimised. Some of the variables that intervene in fabric shrinkage are related with its structural characteristics, use of fiber when producing yarn, the yarn count used or the dyeing process employed. Conducted under real factory conditions, the present study attempted to model the behaviour of a fabric structure after a dyeing process by contributing several algorithms that calculate dyed fabric stability after the first wash cycle. Small-diameter circular machines are used to produce garments with no side seams. This is the reason why a list of machines that produce the same fabrics for different widths needs to be made available to produce all the sizes of a given garment.

40|$|The fibre {{properties}} of cotton, which vary widely according to genetic and environmental conditions, determine its price and textile processing performance and product quality. It is therefore {{hardly surprising that}} cotton fibre properties are routinely measured for trading and quality control purposes, {{with a great deal}} of research having been, and still being, devoted towards developing instruments which enable the various fibre properties to be measured rapidly and accurately. In many cases, it is also necessary to be able to measure {{properties of}} cotton fibres when they have already been converted into yarn and fabric form. To do so, the yarn has to be dismantled into its component fibres, preferably without significantly changing the fibre properties. This could only be done by manually untwisting the yarn and carefully extracting the fibres from the untwisted yarn, care being taken not to break or lose any fibres in the process. This is a time consuming, laborious and labour intensive process. In view of this, a â€žyarn dismantlerâ€Ÿ which could automatically, cost effectively and within acceptable time frames, dismantle a cotton yarn into its constituent fibres, without undue damage or changes to the fibres, was developed and patented. This thesis reports the results of research undertaken to further develop, evaluate and optimize the yarn dismantler into the final prototype, as well as those relating to its practical applications, including tracking changes in fibre properties during miniature and pilot scale processing, up to, and including the yarn stage. Initial research undertaken on the original bench and first prototype models indicated that, although they produced very promising results, certain improvements and modifications were necessary, if the dismantler was to perform in an efficient and operator friendly manner at the required speeds. These included changes in the axial position of the untwisting spindle and the perforated screen of the suction drum, increasing the air suction at the perforated drum, installing a new motor for the untwisting spindle drive, separating the drives to the different parts of the unit in order to control them independently, integrating a more effective steaming unit into the unit etc. It was found that the dismantling rate had to be set to equal about 95 percent of the original twist in the yarn, and that steaming of the dismantled (untwisted) yarn on the perforated drum was necessary in order to eliminate any twist liveliness (residual torque) in the dismantled yarn, and enable it to be handled and tested on the AFIS instrument. When the final prototype Yarn Dismantler was produced, incorporating all the above mentioned improvements, it functioned very well at dismantling speeds of at least 2 m/min, enabling the length of yarn required for subsequent AFIS testing to be dismantled within an acceptable time of less than 10 minutes, with excellent reproducibility and repeatability of results, also under commercial conditions. It was found that the AFIS measured length characteristics of fibres from the instrument dismantled yarns compared very well with those of fibres from manually dismantled yarns, differences in fibre length generally being less than 1 mm, and it was concluded from these and other evaluation tests, that the yarn dismantler produced fibres without any significant fibre breakage. Some limited tests, carried out on commercially produced carded and combed yarns, indicated that short fibre content and dust and trash levels, as measured by the AFIS on fibres from dismantled yarn, together with the corresponding Uster Statistics, could enable a carded cotton yarn to be distinguished from a <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> yarn. Statistical analysis of fibre test results obtained at the different stages during miniature and pilot plant scale processing of various cottons, clearly showed that very significant changes in fibre properties could be caused by certain of the processes. For example, significant fibre breakage occurred during the drafting on the spinning frame, prior to twist insertion. The thesis provides detailed results of changes in various fibre properties, including length, short fibre content, maturity, immature fibre content, seed coat neps and fibrous neps, which occurred from the lint to the final yarn, as well as on the relationship between the properties of the fibres from the dismantled yarn and those from the lint. The results obtained have clearly demonstrated the practical value of the yarn dismantler in enabling yarns to be automatically dismantled into their constituent fibres, which can then be tested by an instrument, such as the AFIS, and the test results related to those of the original lint fibres, thereby opening up many fields of research and practical applications, some of which are captured under â€žRecommended Further Work...|$|E
