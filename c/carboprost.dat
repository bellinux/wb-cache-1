50|$|A {{significant}} deactivating {{metabolic transformation}} of natural prostaglandins is enzymatic oxidation of the C-15 hydroxyl to the corresponding ketone.

The resulting mixture of tertiary carbinols (2) is transformed to oxytocic <b>carboprost</b> (3) by standard transformations, including sepoaration of diastereomers, so that the final product is the C-15 analogue.

50|$|The {{first step}} in {{management}} of uterine atony is uterine massage. The next step is pharmacological therapies, {{the first of which}} is oxytocin, used because it initiates rhythmic contractions of the uterus, compressing the spiral arteries which should reduce bleeding. The next step in the pharmacological management is the use of methylergometrine, which is an ergot derivative, much like that use in the abortive treatment of migraines. Its side effect of hypertension means its use should not be used in those with hypertension or pre-eclampsia.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare <b>carboprost</b> with {{oxytocin}} for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in females with a high risk of PPH undergoing cesarean delivery. Patients were randomly divided into three groups that received different uterotonics (oxytocin, <b>carboprost</b> and oxytocin plus <b>carboprost)</b> during cesarean section, following the delivery of the infant. A total of 117 females (age range, 19 - 40 years) at 35 - 40 weeks gestation who deliv-ered by cesarean between December, 2010 and May, 2012 were included in this study. There were 29 cases of twins, 12 cases of polyhydramnios, 23 cases of placenta previa and 53 cases of fetal macrosomia. There were 37 patients in the oxytocin group, 36 in the <b>carboprost</b> group and 44 in the oxytocin plus <b>carboprost</b> group. No significant differences were identified in maternal age, gravidity/parity, gestational age and reason for cesarean delivery between the three groups. The median blood loss in the oxytocin, <b>carboprost</b> and oxytocin plus <b>carboprost</b> groups was 610, 438 and 520 ml, respectively. The blood loss in the <b>carboprost</b> group was significantly lower than that in the oxytocin and oxytocin plus <b>carboprost</b> groups (both P< 0. 05). Vomiting occurred in eight patients from the <b>carboprost</b> group, two from the oxytocin group and two from the oxytocin plus <b>carboprost</b> group (P= 0. 036). <b>Carboprost</b> was more effective than oxytocin in preventing PPH in high-risk patients undergoing cesarean delivery...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Postpartum {{hemorrhage}} is an obstetric emergency {{that accounts}} for 25 % of maternal deaths worldwide. Initial management consists of uterotonic administration but in cases {{in which there is}} a failure of response to medication, uterine cavity tamponade can be effective. This is the first reported case of successful Bakri balloon placement in the management of postpartum hemorrhage at the time of cesarean delivery in a patient with a bicornuate uterus. Presentation of case: The patient was a primigravid female who presented at 40 weeks and 1  day gestation with known bicornuate uterus and findings suggestive of placental abruption. Labor was subsequently induced and magnesium was administered after a diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features was made. Cesarean delivery was then performed for category II fetal heart rate tracing remote from delivery. Intraoperative course was significant for uterine atony unresponsive to oxytocin, <b>carboprost,</b> methylergonovine and misoprostol administration. The right uterine horn was noted to be markedly atonic compared to the left. A Bakri balloon was then placed transvaginally and inflated with 600  mL of saline in this location. Atony then resolved. Discussion: Although uterine malformation is not a documented contraindication to Bakri balloon placement, there is no literature on its efficacy in the treatment of hemorrhage in the presence of this anomaly. Conclusion: In the management of postpartum hemorrhage, Bakri balloon placement is associated with success in the presence of a bicornuate uterus. Care should be taken to direct insertion of the balloon in the appropriate location...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Modern {{methods of}} {{medically}} induced abortions {{are being used}} in many countries all over the world. These methods are safe and effective when used in an appropriate way. Drugs used for medical abortion. The most widely used regimens for drug induced abortions include antiprogestogen mifepriston followed by administration of a synthetic prostaglandin analogue - gemeprost vaginally or misoprostol orally or vaginally. When used for abortions up to 9 and 7 weeks of pregnancy, this method has efficacy up to 98 %. The regimen between 9 and 12 completed weeks is still under investigation. Methods for medical abortion after 12 completed weeks since last menstrual period include several regimens and medications - combination of mifepriston and repeated doses of misoprostol, misoprostol or gemeprost alone, methotrexate, synthetic prostaglandin analogues, oxytocin and some others. Medical abortions at our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Novi Sad, Clinical Center Vojvodine, Serbia. Medical abortions in the second trimester were introduced at our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Novi Sad, Serbia, in early 1980 s using prostaglandin analogues. This method was improved in year 2000 introducing two dinoprostone gels intracervically/extraamnially instead of just one, for cervical preparation before intramuscular application of <b>carboprost</b> thrometamine, which led to significantly shorter abortion interval. During the years 2003 / 2004 we took part successfully {{in one of the}} multicentric WHO projects for investigating new regimens on early medical abortions with mifepriston and misoprostol. Conclusions. Modern methods of medical abortions are safe and effective for termination of unwanted pregnancies in the first and second trimester...|$|E

We assigned a quality rating to each included article and a strength of evidence rating to each body of literature. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and vaginal misoprostol were more effective than oxytocin in bringing about vaginal delivery within 24 hours but were associated with more uterine hyperstimulation. Mechanical methods reduced uterine hyperstimulation compared with PGE 2 and misoprostol, but increased maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity compared with other methods. Membrane sweeping reduced post-term gestations. Most included studies were too small to evaluate risk for rare adverse outcomes.

40|$|Medical regimens using {{mifepristone}} {{in combination}} with prostaglandins have been widely available for women undergoing termination of pregnancy (TOP) at 10 - 16 weeks' gestation in China. We undertook a systematic review to compare different regimens of mifepristone with prostaglandins for TOP at 10 - 16 weeks' gestation. We searched multiple electronic databases for English and Chinese language reports (1990 - 2007) including MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database. Included were trials comparing mifepristone with prostaglandins (misoprostol, gemeprost or <b>carboprost</b> (PG 05)) {{to each other for}} women at 10 - 16 weeks' gestation. Outcomes were successful abortion rates, induction-to-expulsion time, blood loss and side effects. Data were processed with RevMan 5 software. Nineteen trials comparing mifepristone with prostaglandin (misoprostol and PG 05) were found of which 14 contributed to meta-analyses (4206 women). The quality of reports was poor. The effectiveness of vaginal mifepristone/misoprostol was super than mifepristone/PG 05 (RR 1. 14, 95 %CI 1. 05 - 1. 22) as was induction-to-expulsion time, blood loss and side effects. When comparing misoprostol/mifepristone 150 mg to misoprostol/mifepristone 200 mg, no difference in TOP success rates were found (RR 0. 98, 95 %CI 0. 96 - 1. 01). Misoprostol vaginally compared to orally significantly increased the TOP success rate (RR 1. 12, 95 %CI 1. 01 - 1. 24). Gastrointestinal symptoms and fever occurred more often in misoprostol oral group (RR 1. 67, 95 %CI 1. 46 - 1. 91). Medical regimens of mifepristone/prostaglandins were effective and safe for TOP at 10 - 16 weeks' gestation.
