5|$|The Scotch-Irish began immigrating to the Middle Colonies {{in waves}} after 1717. They {{primarily}} pushed {{farther into the}} western frontier of the colonies, where they repeatedly <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Indians. Other groups included the French Huguenots, Welsh, Dutch, Swedes, Swiss, and Scots Highlanders.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{ruler of}} modest {{historical}} significance, Marko {{became a major}} character in South Slavic oral tradition. He is venerated as a national hero by the Serbs, Macedonians and Bulgarians, remembered in Balkan folklore as a fearless and powerful protector of the weak, who fought against injustice and <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Turks during the Ottoman occupation.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, {{a number}} of serious {{concerns}} <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> company. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large power plant in India. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.|$|E

5|$|At dawn, Tanaka {{learned that}} the palace had been invaded. He went there and <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> rebellious officers, berating them for acting {{contrary}} {{to the spirit of}} the Japanese army. He convinced them to return to their barracks. By 08:00, the rebellion was entirely dismantled, having succeeded in holding the palace grounds for much of the night but failing to find the recordings.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to capture}} Taegu {{as part of}} the Great Naktong Offensive, the North Korean People's Army's 1st and 13th Divisions {{advanced}} to the hill masses north of the city where they <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> US Army's 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK Army's 1st Division. The North Koreans sought to occupy a number of hill masses, most prominently Hill 902, known to South Koreans as Ka-san, for the ancient fortress situated atop it.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Anzen or Dazimon {{was fought}} on 22 July 838 at Anzen or Dazimon (now Dazmana, Turkey) between the Byzantine Empire {{and the forces}} of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids had {{launched}} a huge expedition with two separate armies in retaliation for the Byzantine emperor Theophilos's successes the previous year, and aimed to sack Amorion, one of Byzantium's largest cities. Theophilos with his army <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> smaller Muslim army, under the Iranian vassal prince Afshin, at Dazimon.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{conquest of}} the Jaffna kingdom {{occurred}} after Portuguese traders arrived at the rival Kotte Kingdom in the southwest of modern Sri Lanka in 1505. Many kings of Jaffna, such as Cankili I, initially <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese in their attempts at converting the locals to Roman Catholicism, but eventually made peace with them.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> ICU. However, with local support, the ICU captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
5|$|A further {{problem for}} the pair was Jackson's insistence on being around children. Though she never {{believed}} he was a pedophile—"I wouldn't have let him near my kids if I thought that"—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations. One evening at Neverland, Presley <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant Jackson, resulting in another argument. Upon being called selfish, the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors. Presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant, that the issue was about them.|$|E

5|$|A {{new problem}} <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Confederates. The {{dead and wounded}} of Grant's army lay {{in the heat of}} Mississippi summer, the odor of the {{deceased}} men and horses fouling the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mansur in the {{meantime}} used his time more effectively: he mobilized troops in Syria and Iran and brought them to Iraq, and recalled Isa ibn Musa from Medina to lead them. Finally, Ibrahim decided to march on Kufa, but on the way he abandoned this plan and turned back. Instead of returning to Basra, however, he encamped at Bakhamra, a location on the road between the two cities. There, on 21 January, Ibrahim with his troops, reduced by defections to some 15,000 men, <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Abbasid army under Isa ibn Musa. Isa's vanguard was at first beaten, but the battle ended in a crushing Abbasid victory. Ibrahim himself was heavily wounded and escaped {{with a handful of}} supporters. He died of his wounds on 14 February 763, signalling the end of the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E

5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often {{in front of}} the crew and the native Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E
5|$|During John's reign, Byzantium faced many difficulties: enemies <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> empire on all sides. An {{invasion}} of nomadic horsemen {{from the north}} threatened Byzantine control in the Balkans, and the Turks were harassing Byzantine territory in Asia Minor. However, John soon proved himself just as determined and energetic as his predecessor. At the Battle of Beroia, John personally led the imperial armies against the Pecheneg invaders. With {{the aid of the}} emperor's elite troops, the Varangian Guard, the tribal horsemen were decisively crushed. The emperor's victory was so emphatic that the Pechenegs soon disappeared as an independent people.|$|E
5|$|In , {{the evil}} sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces {{to conquer the}} realms. By , after several fights, the sorcerers emerge victorious having killed most of Earthrealms' warriors until Raiden steps forth to oppose them. The Dragon King Onaga, who had been freed by Reptile {{at the end of}} Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, had deceived Shujinko into searching for six pieces of Kamidogu, the source of Onaga's power. Onaga then <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> {{alliance}} of Raiden, Shang Tsung, and Quan Chi and thus obtained Quan Chi's amulet, the final piece of his power. Only a few warriors remained to combat against the Dragon King and his forces. Shujinko eventually triumphed over the Dragon King and removed his threat to the Mortal Kombat universe.|$|E

5|$|Jogaila was {{the last}} pagan ruler of medieval Lithuania. After he became King of Poland, {{as a result of}} the Union of Krewo, the newly formed Polish-Lithuanian union <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> growing power of the Teutonic Knights. The allied victory at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, {{followed}} by the Peace of Thorn, secured the Polish and Lithuanian borders and marked the emergence of the Polish–Lithuanian alliance as a significant force in Europe. The reign of Władysław II Jagiełło extended Polish frontiers and is often considered the beginning of Poland's Golden Age.|$|E
5|$|On 15June 1389 Serbian forces led by Prince Lazar, Vuk Branković, and Tvrtko's nobleman Vlatko Vuković of Zachlumia, <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman army led by Sultan Murad I at the Battle of Kosovo, {{the best-known}} battle in medieval Serbian history. With {{the bulk of}} both armies wiped out and Lazar and Murad killed, {{the outcome of the}} battle was inconclusive. In its {{aftermath}} the Serbs had insufficient manpower to defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Serbian principalities which were not already Ottoman vassals became such over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Harith's death, Ghassanid {{territory}} {{was attacked}} by Qabus ibn al-Mundhir, the new Lakhmid ruler, who sought {{to take advantage of}} the situation. Qabus's forces were repulsed and Mundhir invaded Lakhmid territory in turn, seizing much plunder. As he turned back, the Lakhmids again <b>confronted</b> <b>the</b> Ghassanid army, but suffered a heavy defeat. After this success, Mundhir wrote to the Byzantine emperor Justin II (r. 565–578) asking for gold for his men. This request reportedly angered Justin, who sent instructions to his local commander to lure the Ghassanid ruler into a trap and have him killed. But the letter fell into Mundhir's hands, who then severed his relations with the Empire and refused to commit his forces during the war with Persia that began in 572.|$|E
