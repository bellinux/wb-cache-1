Of course the boulders and stones must have gone clean over. That shows what a narrow escape we have had; for if that outer rock had been {{a foot or so}} higher, the skin would have caved in, and our place would have been filled <b>chock</b> <b>up</b> with snow in a moment. Waal, we may as well turn in again, for I feel cold to the bones already." ...|$|E

The son of a famous German linguist, with all the benefits of both European and American educations, this young man was unusually erudite and a pleasure in class because of the comparisons he could draw among linguistic traditions. Still, {{it was evident that}} he was politely sitting through the course in order to <b>chock</b> <b>up</b> a required elective; he clearly felt no affinity toward the subject matter. Suddenly he reappeared last week, tremendously animated, speaking so fast I could barely follow him. His dissertation, an analysis of resultative constructions, had run into a series of dead-ends, eventually exhausting all the syntactic theories available, and, despite himself, everywhere he looked he was seeing semantic prototypes and their effects. Then came the confession: “I never really thought I would take cognitive linguistics seriously. ” I could only smile and reply, “Welcome back. ” Fortunately I had just returned from a biennial meeting of the International Cognitive Linguistic...|$|E

40|$|The Mumbai Metropolitan Region {{is growing}} in terms of population, industry, {{educational}} and commercial units. The daily requirements of commodities and services by all units have increased fast. Plastic is used extensively for packing, protection and service of various commodities. The use of plastic is much higher by industry and households in region. In Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation, the density of population is higher. The concentration of small and large industries is more. Therefore the plastic use is much higher for different purposes. It leads to more waste of plastic. In Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation, the population and industrial units are less. Therefore plastic waste is less generated. Theaters are generating less plastic waste in metropolitan region. The Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and municipal corporations in Thane district will continuously generate more plastic waste in future. The Tobit regression model shows that plastic waste is positively co-related and statistically significant with pollution and industry in region. Therefore the comprehensive policies are required to reduce plastic waste. This is because plastic waste is affecting {{on the health of}} human being. It also affects negatively on soil, air and water. The entire food supply chain gets affected due to plastic waste. The water logging is common due to plastic waste in region. It <b>chock</b> <b>ups</b> the drainage system and it becomes the ground for mosquitoes. It further leads to dengue, malaria and other diseases in region. Municipal corporations must collect plastic in separate bins and process it. The plastic and e-waste can be utilized for road construction in region. All the policies will certainly help to reduce the plastic waste and maintain the clean environment in region...|$|R

"They were {{drawing the}} wagon along {{to harness the}} horse in, and the horse-block was in the way; so they both got hold of the shafts, and Jack wanted to pull it around towards the right, while Jerry {{said it would be}} better to have it go to the left. So they pulled, one one way, and the other the other, and thus they got it <b>up</b> <b>chock</b> against the horse-block, one shaft on each side. Here they stood pulling in {{opposition}} for some time, and all the while their father was waiting for them to turn the wagon, and harness the horse." ...|$|R
