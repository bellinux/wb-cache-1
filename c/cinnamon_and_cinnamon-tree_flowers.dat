5000|$|Type II split {{cinnamon}} opaline cocks are bred by mating <b>Cinnamons</b> to Opalines <b>and</b> {{have the}} <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Opaline mutant alleles on opposite chromatids, symbolised as cin+-op/cin-op+. Geneticists call this repulsion rather than Type II. Because of the separation, the <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Opaline alleles from Type II birds {{tend to be}} inherited separately in their progeny. When mated to Normal hens, Type II cocks produce predominantly <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Opaline hens, with <b>Cinnamon</b> Opaline <b>and</b> Normal hens resulting rarely from cross-overs. Roughly {{one third of the}} hens will be Cinnamon, one third Opaline, one sixth <b>Cinnamon</b> Opaline <b>and</b> one sixth Normal.|$|R
50|$|Cocks split {{for both}} <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Ino have one <b>Cinnamon</b> allele <b>and</b> one Ino allele {{together}} with one {{each of the}} corresponding wild-type alleles. The linkage between the <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Ino genes gives rise to two types of split cinnamon-ino cocks, both visually identical.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> {{turmeric}} powders on performance, and blood parameters of broiler chickens under heat stress were investigated. 200 one-day-old male chicks (Ross 308) {{were used in}} a completely randomized design with four treatments and five replicates with 10 birds in each replicate. All birds were treated with heat stress (32 οC) and were either fed no any supplement (control), or 0. 5 % turmeric, 0. 5 % <b>cinnamon,</b> <b>and</b> a blend of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> turmeric (0. 25 % each) when they were 25 to 42 days of age. We found that supplementation of turmeric, <b>cinnamon,</b> <b>and</b> their combination increased feed intake and body weight gain compared to control birds (P 0. 05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> turmeric either alone or together improve the performance of broiler chickens under heat stress by reducing lipid peroxidation...|$|R
5000|$|Type I split {{cinnamon}} opalines cocks are bred by mating Cinnamon Opalines to Normals {{and have}} the two mutant alleles on the same chromatid, symbolised as cin+-op+/cin-op. Geneticists call this coupling rather than Type I. Because of the linkage, the <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Opaline alleles from Type I cocks tend to be inherited together in their progeny. When mated to Normal hens, Type I cocks produce predominantly <b>Cinnamon</b> Opaline <b>and</b> Normal hens, with <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Opaline hens resulting rarely from a cross-over. Roughly {{one third of the}} hens will be Cinnamon-Opaline, one third Normal, one sixth <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> one sixth Opaline.|$|R
5000|$|Type II split {{cinnamon}} ino cocks are bred by mating <b>Cinnamons</b> to Inos <b>and</b> {{have the}} <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Ino mutant alleles on opposite chromatids, symbolised as cin+-ino/cin-ino+. Geneticists call this 'repulsion' rather than 'Type II'. Because of the separation, the <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Ino alleles from Type II birds {{tend to be}} inherited separately in their progeny. When mated to Normal hens, Type II cocks produce predominantly <b>Cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> Ino hens, with Cinnamon-Ino (Lacewing) and Normal hens resulting extremely rarely from cross-overs. Roughly 48% of the hens will be Cinnamon, 48% Ino, 2% Cinnamon-Opaline (Lacewing) and 2% Normal.|$|R

The higher ratios of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> clove oils (3 : 1, 5 : 1 and 7 : 1) were stronger inhibitors than the lower ratios of <b>cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> clove oils (1 : 1, 1 : 3, 1 : 5 and 1 : 7) <b>and</b> the pure <b>cinnamon</b> or clove oil. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the combined <b>cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> clove oils at the ratio 5 : 1 {{was determined to be}} 50 μL/mL for all moulds. Antifungal activity of the combined <b>cinnamon</b> <b>and</b> clove oils (5 : 1) at a concentration of    50 μL/mL was further examined on rubberwood specimens under storage conditions of 30 °C and 100 %RH.
