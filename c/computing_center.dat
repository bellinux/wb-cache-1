5|$|Bertie the Brain was a {{computer}} game of tic-tac-toe, built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. Kates had previously worked at Rogers Majestic designing and building radar tubes during World War II, {{then after the}} war pursued graduate studies in the <b>computing</b> <b>center</b> at the University of Toronto while continuing to work at Rogers Majestic. While there, he helped build the University of Toronto Electronic Computer (UTEC), {{one of the first}} working computers in the world. He also designed his own miniature version of the vacuum tube, called the additron tube, which he registered with the Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers' Association on 20 March 1951 as type 6047.|$|E

25|$|Another unique {{building}} is the Voorhees <b>Computing</b> <b>Center</b> (VCC). Originally the St.Joseph's Seminary chapel, built in 1933, {{the building was}} acquired by Rensselaer in 1958, and after renovation served as the institute's library from 1960 until {{the completion of the}} new Folsom Library, in 1976. The Folsom Library, located adjacent to the <b>computing</b> <b>center,</b> has a concrete exterior that was designed to harmonize with the light gray brick of the chapel; architecturally, it is an excellent example of the modern brutalist style. Subsequently, the university was unsure {{of what to do with}} the chapel, or whether to keep it at all, but in 1979 decided to preserve it and renovate it to house computer labs and facilities to support the institute's computing initiatives. Today the VCC serves as the backbone for the institute's data and telephony infrastructure.|$|E

In January 1959, McDonnell Aircraft Corporation was chosen to be prime contractor for the spacecraft. Two weeks earlier, North American Aviation, based in Los Angeles, was awarded a contract for Little Joe, a small rocket {{to be used for}} development of the launch escape system. The World Wide Tracking Network for communication between the ground and spacecraft during a flight was awarded to the Western Electric Company. Redstone rockets for suborbital launches were manufactured in Huntsville, Alabama by the Chrysler Corporation and Atlas rockets by Convair in San Diego, California. For manned launches, the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was made available by the USAF. This was also the site of the Mercury Control Center while the <b>computing</b> <b>center</b> of the communication network was in Goddard Space Center, Maryland. Little Joe rockets were launched from Wallops Island, Virginia. Astronaut training took place at Langley Research Center in Virginia, Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio, and Naval Air Development Center Johnsville in Warminster, PA. Langley wind tunnels together with a rocket sled track at Holloman Air Force Base at Alamogordo, New Mexico were used for aerodynamic studies. Both Navy and Air Force aircraft were made available {{for the development of the}} spacecraft's landing system, and Navy ships and Navy and Marine Corps helicopters were made available for recovery.
