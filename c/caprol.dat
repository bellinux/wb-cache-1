40|$|Low aqueous {{solubility}} {{leads to}} low and variable oral bioavailability of a compound. This problem is encountered more and more since the application of genomics, high-throughput screening, robotics, combinatorial chemistry, informatics, and miniaturization in the drug discovery area. Many approaches have been investigated to improve oral bioavailability by enhancing drug solubility e. g. salts, solid dispersions, water-soluble drug complexes (i. e. cyclodextrins) or increasing the surface area available for dissolution using silica-based materials or solid dispersions. To date, the formulation process of poorly soluble compounds is still driven by trial and error. The main objective of this project is to find possible links between the physicochemical properties of a drug candidate and its potential to be formulated in a stable delivery form withadequate systemic exposure following oral administration. This would allow constructing a rational formulation protocol for poorly water-soluble drugs. Within the framework of these general scopes, the specific objectives in this dissertation are to explore the formulate-ability of ten model compounds with different physicochemical profile as SMEDDS, to evaluate in vitro and in vivo lipid-based drug delivery systems for improving oral bioavailability of the poorly water-soluble drug fenofibrate and to study the complexation between the model compounds and five different CDs. In the first study, ten poorly water-soluble drugs, exhibiting different physicochemical properties were formulated as SMEDDSaccording to generally accepted procedures. The first step was the selection of excipients based on the solubility of the compounds in these excipients. The solubility of the compounds was determined in various oils(long and medium chain) and surfactants (HLB > 12 and HLB The effect of the GI process {{on the performance of}} SMEDDS formulations was further studied and compared to other lipid-based formulations of fenofibrate. Four different systems (Tween 80  Captex 200 P, Tween 80  Capmul MCM, Tween 80  <b>Caprol</b> 3 GO and Tween 80  soybean oil) for delivery of fenofibrate were studied in vitro in various biorelevant media and in vivo in rats. In SGFsp and FaSSIF, only the Tween 80  Captex 200 P system resulted in a stable fenofibrate concentration, but no supersaturation was achieved. The other three systems created fenofibrate supersaturation; however they did not maintain it. In FeSSIF, all lipid-based formulations resulted in 100 % dissolution of fenofibrate duringthe experiment, which represented a supersaturated state for Tween 80  Capmul MCM and Tween 80  <b>Caprol</b> 3 GO systems. In bothFaSSIF and FeSSIF, the lipid-based formulations yielded a higher fenofibrate concentration than the commercialized form of fenofibrate (Lipanthyl Micronized®). The oral bioavailability of fenofibrate from the lipid-based delivery systems was tested in rats and compared to that of Lipanthyl Micronized®. No significant difference in the in vivo performancewas observed among the four tested lipid-based formulations both in thefasted and the fed states. The in vivo performance of all lipid-based formulations was better than that of Lipanthyl Micronized®, in the fasted {{as well as in the}} fed state. The fact that the in vitro differences in pharmaceutical performance were not translated into in vivo differences may partially be attributed to the continuous excretion of bilein rats. This study clearly illustrates that the use of lipid-based formulations is an attractive strategy to enhance the intestinal absorptionof the poorly water-soluble compound fenofibrate In the second part of this dissertation, complexation between model compounds and five different CDs was studied. The apparent solubility of the model compoundsin the presence of five different cyclodextrins, was determined using aphase solubility study. All five CDs were able to increase the aqueous solubility of the eight compounds used in this study. In most cases, thesolubility increase of the compounds in the presence of these CDs was linear (AL type phase solubility diagram). The BS type phase solubility diagram was observed with γ-CD and three compounds, namely methylprednisolone, danazol and carbamazepine. In the presence of HP-β-CD and HP-γ-CD, the increase of fenofibrate solubility resultedin a curve which deviates positively from linearity, indicating an AP system. The stability constants obtained for compounds in complexes with various CDs showed that complex stability was highly dependent on the CDcavity size and type of substitution. In most cases, except for methylprednisolone, the apparent complex formation constants with β-CDswere higher than those with γ-CDs. Comparing the K 1 : 1 value for β-CD and its derivatives, it was shown that for most of the compounds, derivatives have a higher K 1 : 1 value, again except for methylprednisolone. A rational complexation study by 1 H-NMR was carried out. Inclusion complex formation was confirmed for methylprednisolone with threeCDs (γ-CD, HP-γ-CD, HP-β-CD), for danazol and carbamazepine with HP-β-CD and HP-γ-CD, for diazepam, fenofibrate, phenytoin and indomethacine with HP-β-CD; however, no inclusioncomplex formation was observed for nifedipine with HP-β-CD as in the 2 D ROESY 1 H-NMR experiments, no cross-peaks between protons of nifedipine and H 3  or H 5 , which are situated inside the cavity of HP-β-CD, were found. Applying 1 H-NMR data in the continuous variation method was used to determine the stoichiometry of the complex. The obtained results in this dissertation help to gain a better understanding of some underlying factors explaining the success of formulating a drug as SMEDDS and/or a complex with CDs. However, a lot of work remains to be done in order to reach universally applicable and validated conclusions which would allow establishing a clear link between the physicochemical properties of a compound and it formulate-ability. status: publishe...|$|E
