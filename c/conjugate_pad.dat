5000|$|The first element (the sample pad) acts as {{a sponge}} and holds an excess of sample fluid. Once soaked, the fluid migrates to the second element (<b>conjugate</b> <b>pad)</b> in which the {{manufacturer}} has stored the so-called conjugate, a dried format of bio-active particles (see below) in a salt-sugar matrix that contains everything to guarantee an optimized chemical reaction between the target molecule (e.g., an antigen) and its chemical partner (e.g., antibody) that has been immobilized on the particle's surface. While the sample fluid dissolves the salt-sugar matrix, it also dissolves the particles and in one combined transport action the sample and conjugate mix while flowing through the porous structure. In this way, the analyte binds to the particles while migrating further through the third capillary bed. This material has one or more areas (often called stripes) where a third molecule has been immobilized by the manufacturer. By the time the sample-conjugate mix reaches these strips, analyte has been bound on the particle and the third 'capture' molecule binds the complex. After a while, when more and more fluid has passed the stripes, particles accumulate and the stripe-area changes color. Typically {{there are at least}} two stripes: one (the control) that captures any particle and thereby shows that reaction conditions and technology worked fine, the second contains a specific capture molecule and only captures those particles onto which an analyte molecule has been immobilized. After passing these reaction zones the fluid enters the final porous material, the wick, that simply {{acts as a}} waste container.|$|E

The valve used the principle of electrowetting and was able to be actuated at low voltage. The valve consisted of two silver electrodes which were encountered in series within a microfluidic channel. The second electrode was modified with a hydrophobic monolayer resulting in a cessation of capillary flow. A potential of 4 V resulted in a 70 ° reduction in water contact angle within ten seconds which allowed capillary flow to continue. The final device represented a microfluidic valve for capillary flow microfluidics realized on PMMA substrate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{demonstrated}} a multistep 2 -dimensional paper network immunoassay based on controlled rehydration of patterned, dried reagents. Previous work {{has shown that}} signal enhancement improves the limit of detection in 2 -dimensional paper network assays, but until now, reagents have only been included as wet or dried in separate <b>conjugate</b> <b>pads</b> placed at the upstream end of the assay device. Wet reagents are not ideal for point-of-care because they must be refrigerated and typically limit automation and require more user steps. <b>Conjugate</b> <b>pads</b> allow drying but do not offer any control of the reagent distribution upon rehydration and can {{be a source of}} error when pads do not contact the assay membrane uniformly. Furthermore, each reagent is dried on a separate pad, increasing the fabrication complexity when implementing multistep assays that require several different reagents. Conversely, our novel method allows for consistent, controlled rehydration from patterned reagent storage depots directly within the paper membrane. In this assay demonstration, four separate reagents were patterned in different regions of the assay device: a gold-antibody conjugate used for antigen detection and three different signal enhancement components that must not be mixed until immediately before use. To show the viability of patterning and drying reagents directly onto a paper device for dry reagent storage and subsequent controlled release, we tested this device with the malaria antigen Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP 2) as an example of target analyte. In this demonstration, the signal enhancement step increases the visible signal by roughly 3 -fold and decreases the analytical limit of detection by 2. 75 -fold.

Reciprocating flow was generated on the CD chip through a simple rotation-pause operation to facilitate rapid DNA hybridization. When rotated the CD chip, the sample solution was driven into the hybridization channel by centrifugal force. When stopped the CD chip, the sample plug was pulled backward through the channel by capillary force. The hybridization assay was firstly validated with control samples and was then used to analyze 30 clinical samples from pregnant women with suspected PKU fetus. The on-chip DNA hybridization was completed in 15 min with a sample consumption as low as 1. 5 mu L, and the limit-of-detection (LOD) of DNA template was 0. 7 ng/mu L Among the 30 samples tested, V 245 V mutation was identified in 4 cases while R 243 Q mutation was detected in one case. Results of the hybridization assay were confirmed by DNA sequencing. This CD-chip based hybridization assay features short analysis time, simple operation and low cost, thus {{has the potential to}} serve as the tool for PKU screening. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract Hierarchical multiresolution {{analysis}} {{is an important}} tool {{for the analysis of}} signals. Since this multiresolution representation provides a pyramid like framework for representing signals, it can extract signal information effectively via levels by levels. On the other hand, a signal can be nonlinearly and adaptively represented as a sum of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) via the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm. Nevertheless, as the IMFs are obtained only when the EMD algorithm converges, no further iterative sifting process will be performed directly when the EMD algorithm is applied to an IMF. As a result, the same IMF will be resulted and further level decompositions of the IMFs cannot be obtained directly by the EMD algorithm. In other words, the hierarchical multiresolution analysis cannot be performed via the EMD algorithm directly. This paper is to address this issue by performing a nonlinear and adaptive hierarchical multiresolution analysis based on the EMD algorithm via a frequency domain approach. In the beginning, an IMF is expressed in the frequency domain by applying discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to it. Next, zeros are inserted to the DFT sequence and a <b>conjugate</b> symmetric zero <b>padded</b> DFT sequence is obtained. Then, inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is applied to the zero padded DFT sequence and a new signal expressed in the time domain is obtained. Actually, the next level IMFs can be obtained by applying the EMD algorithm to this signal. However, the lengths of these next level IMFs are increased. To reduce these lengths, first DFT is applied to each next level IMF. Second, the DFT coefficients of each next level IMF at the positions where the zeros are inserted before are removed. Finally, by applying IDFT to the shorten DFT sequence of each next level IMF, the final set of next level IMFs are obtained. It is shown in this paper that the original IMF can be perfectly reconstructed. Moreover, computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method can reach a component with less number of levels of decomposition compared to that of the conventional linear and nonadaptive wavelets and filter bank approaches. Also, as no filter is involved in our proposed method, there is no spectral leakage in various levels of decomposition introduced by our proposed method. Whereas there could be some significant leakage components in the various levels of decomposition introduced by the wavelets and filter bank approaches.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{microfluidics}} is expanding {{into what is}} known as paper microfluidics. This uses a paper platform rather than materials (i. e. PDMS, PMMA) that are commonly used in microfluidics research. Current devices require an expensive manufacturing process and external sources to power the device. Such devices are not practical in low resource environments. As a consequence, it is the goal of this Thesis to develop a three-dimensional, multiplexed assay chip using nitrocellulose membranes. This device comprises of multiple layers of nitrocellulose membranes with defined fluidic channels. The multiple layers are bound together using double backed tape, and imbedded between the layers are conjugate reagents. In the detection region both antibodies and aptamers were evaluated. The fiberglass pad where conjugate reagents would be contained, were initially saturated in dye. As sample was inputted into the three-dimensional chip, the fluid path could be visualized. Without the use of the <b>conjugate</b> <b>pad</b> the chip’s four detection regions showed detection within one minute of one another. However, the addition of this fibrous pad skewed time points dramatically. The hypothesis that a three-dimensional chip could be designed to detect different biomarkers in a multi-analyte sample was satisfied. However, simultaneous detection was only possible if the <b>conjugate</b> <b>pad</b> was either neglected or, possibly, a different material was used. Additionally, current lateral flow assay technologies, another research area that paper microfluidics spawns from, use antibodies in order to capture biomarkers in sample and provide visual signal to the user. However, antibodies are sensitive to denaturation with pH and temperature, whereas aptamers can withstand much more extreme environmental conditions. A two-dimensional nitrocellulose chip was designed to compare antibodies and aptamers as capture reagents to detect VEGF, using colloidal gold as a particle to visualize detection. Both monoclonal and polyclonal anti-VEGF antibodies were used and showed no signal. On the other hand, the anti-VEGF aptamer produced a visual signal when conjugated to biotin on its 5 ’ end. This data was further validated by a separate project analyzing the binding kinetics of the antibody and the aptamer using Surface Plasmon Resonance. Therefore, the hypothesis that aptamers {{could be used as a}} possible capture reagent in a paper microfluidic chip for the detection of VEGF was satisfied...|$|E

One hundred sera samples from clinical patients with gastric cancer and healthy people were used to confirm specificity of this strip method; results showed that established strip method own 100  % reproducibility and 100  % specificity compared with Roche electrochemiluminescence assay results. In conclusion, CdSe/ZnS quantum dot-labeled lateral flow strips for detection of CA 72 - 4 could realize rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of clinical samples and could own great potential in clinical translation in near future.|$|E
40|$|Trypanosoma such as Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative {{agents for}} African {{sleeping}} sickness and Chagas disease, respectively, have important influence on human health. The {{methods such as}} microscopic examination, immunological methods, and molecular methods are used for the identification and detection of Trypanosoma, {{but none of these}} methods are ideal to mass screening of samples such as onset of outbreak, epidemiological surveys, and blood unit screening. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} an assay which can rapidly, sensitively and specifically detect Trypanosoma. In this study, Ru(bpy) 32 +-doped silica nanoparticles (RuSNP) were used to target nucleic acid sequences in a lateral flow fluorescent assay. This assay was developed to improve the sensitivity and lower the limit of detection as compared to the traditional lateral flow assay. The assay targeted both the spliced leader sequence as well as the polyA tail of the mRNA. The surface of spherical RuSNP was modified by glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GOPTMS). Amine-terminated oligonucleotides as a bioreceptor were immobilized onto the RuSNP via the interaction between the NH 2 and the epoxy group of the GOPTMS. The conjugate complexes formed were immobilized on the <b>conjugate</b> <b>pad,</b> and the capture oligonucleotides used for test and control lines were immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane. The effects of the amount of RuSNP, GOPTMS, amine-capped oligonucleotides, and capture oligonucleotides on the test line on the performance of the test strips were investigated and optimized. The fluorescence intensity was evaluated by using a fluorescent microplate reader. The experimental results showed that the nucleic acid sequence-based and RuSNP-labeled lateral flow assay was very sensitive compared with the gold-labeled test strips and the chemiluminescent test strips we developed previously, and that the limit of detection (LOD) of the test strips developed is 0. 4 fmol. The LOD can further be reduced about one order of magnitude when dipstick format was used...|$|E
40|$|Lateral {{flow test}} strips have {{dominated}} the rapid diagnostics landscape for decades. Recently, the emergence of paper microfluidics has brought new functionalities to these porous materials, {{and the search for}} instrument-free point-of-care devices has driven the development of different types of energy sources to fulfill their power needs. This work presents the development of microfluidic fuel cells as paper-based power sources in a standard lateral flow test format. These fuel cells benefit from the laminar flow occurring in a porous material by capillarity to separately react with two parallel streams, anolyte and catholyte, without an ionic exchange membrane or external pumps. It has been shown that the devices are capable of delivering power densities in the range of 1 - 5 mW cm- 2 using solutions of methanol and KOH. The incorporation of a <b>conjugate</b> <b>pad</b> to store the KOH electrolyte in a solid form and a methanol-rich agar gel on top of the reaction membrane allows the fuel cell to function soaking a single sample pad with just water. The presented microfluidic fuel cell approach would enable a more straightforward integration with typical lateral flow test strips and a cost-effective manufacturing. This work represents the starting point {{in the development of a}} power source for capillary-based autonomous sensing systems capable of harvesting the energy needed for the measurement from the biological sample to be analyzed.
