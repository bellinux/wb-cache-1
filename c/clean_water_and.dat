5|$|Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{identified}} primary {{concerns for}} the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without <b>clean</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> {{the water from the}} treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time. Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems.

5|$|After {{independence}} in 1960, {{the pace of}} growth increased further. The city's population reached 1.4 million {{by the end of}} the 20th century; in 2013, it was estimated at nearly 2.1 million. Uncontrolled urban sprawl has challenged the city's infrastructure, producing shortages of <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> electricity, sanitation and public health problems, and heavy traffic congestion. There are more than 5,000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs, including an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral. Antananarivo is the see city of Madagascar's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The city has repeatedly been the site of large demonstrations and violent political clashes, including the 1972 rotaka that brought down president Philibert Tsiranana and the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which resulted in Andry Rajoelina replacing Marc Ravalomanana as head of state.|$|E

However, most were left without power and <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> required assistance from local agencies. Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented at least some of the floods by following through with a flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The Shire of Carnarvon stated that he did not want to place blame on any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future. More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the Pilbara coastline.|$|E
