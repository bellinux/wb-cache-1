40|$|International audienceThe modular {{multilevel}} converters (MMCs) {{have emerged}} as the most suitable converter technology for HVDC applications. Besides the recognized advantages over conventional voltage source converters, one of the remarkable features of the MMC {{is its ability to}} store energy in the distributed submodule capacitors. This important feature can be used to mitigate the fluctuations of the DC voltage, which is inherently volatile against power disturbances compared to the frequency of conventional AC systems. This paper proposes a novel control strategy, called virtual <b>capacitor</b> <b>control,</b> which enables the utilization of the energy storage capability of the MMC to attenuate voltage fluctuations of HVDC systems. With the proposed control, the MMC behaves as if there were a physical capacitor whose size is adjustable and can be even bigger than the physical capacitor embedded in the converter. This control allows the system operator to optionally adjust this virtual capacitor of each MMC station and, thus, it provides an additional degree of freedom to the HVDC system operation.

In DC systems, the capacitance is the dominant factor that determines the volatility of the DC voltage against sudden disturbances in analogy to inertia of the AC system characterizing the rate of change of the frequency.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a new control scheme for dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), {{which consists of}} a set of series and shunt converters connected back-to-back (BTB), three series transformers, and a dc capacitor installed on the common dc-link. The DVR is characterized by installing the shunt converter on the source side and the series converter on the load side. A decoupled multiple reference frame phase-locked-loop (DMRF-PLL) is proposed, which decouples signals of different frequencies and eliminates interactions between the fundamental-frequency positive-sequence components and harmonic and/or negative-sequence components in the grid voltages. The proposed DMRF-PLL scheme achieves a fast, precise, and robust positive-sequence voltage detection even under unbalanced and/or distorted grid voltages conditions. A detailed description and derivation of the detection method is presented. Besides, a separate proportional-integral (PI) controller is adopted to regulate the dc-link capacitor voltage. The load voltage waveform is restored to be sinusoidal with fundamental frequency by dynamically injecting compensating voltages to the series brunch of converters. The validity and effectiveness of the presented scheme has been confirmed by extensive simulation results obtained from a 380 V/ 50 kVA system using Matlab/Simulink.
