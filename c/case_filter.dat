50|$|In English, {{the object}} of a noun phrase is {{assigned}} Case by the closest c-commanding V (verb) or P (preposition) head which is usually the verb or preposition that selects it as a complement. Similarly the subject of a noun phrase is assigned Case from the finite tense head, T. The subject of a finite clause in English is nominative. As seen in English with sentences in passive form, the finite T is the head that assigns the nominative Case to the noun phrase (subject position); the closest noun phrase that T (tense head) c-commands is attracted to the empty specifier position of the tense phrase. This movement is a local specifier-to-specifier movement, satisfying Case requirements at the deep-structure level. Any sentence in English that surfaces with a noun phrase not containing Case, is a violation of the <b>Case</b> <b>Filter</b> and thus is said to crash (determined to be ungrammatical).|$|E

5000|$|Also, {{there are}} still {{questions}} regarding case morphology. One approach to defining case morphology {{is to say that}} it is the presence of some special morphology, the shape of which has a correlation with a specific syntactic position. Decades of past research supports that this is a particular cross-linguistic property specific to nominals. When discussing case features, it is commonly stated that they have no associated semantic interpretation, regardless of their syntactic position. An early perspective taken on case was the initial suggestion by a French linguist Jean-Roger Vergnaud that the grammar of case is a cross-linguistic feature, central to the syntax of all languages and that it does not just apply to languages with a rich case morphology for example, Latin. Vergnaud stipulated that any nominal that is morphologically able to show case morphology is required and must do so. This observation was explicitly stated above as being the definition of <b>Case</b> <b>Filter.</b> A second perspective on Case is Chomsky's Minimalist conjectures. There are many fundamental questions regarding case role, such as the reason for why case should even exist, that are not yet accompanied by substantive answers. This indicates that research on case role remains still as a ‘work in progress.’ ...|$|E
40|$|The basic goal of {{this work}} is to explore three interrelated issues in Icelandic syntax: the {{identification}} of structural case positions, the mechanisms for case checking {{and the role of}} case in NP licensing. As for the first issue, it is argued that nominative subjects in Icelandic are case-checked in Spec-IP or a lower position identified as Spec-TP (following Jonas 1992, 1993 and Jonas 2 ̆ 6 Bobaljik 1993), but accusative objects are case-checked in their base-generated complement position or in a VP-external position identified as Spec-AgrOP (following Deprez 1989 and others). There are certain semantic restrictions on arguments in Spec-IP, Spec-TP or Spec-AgrOP but they are shown to be independent of case and derivable from the Mapping Hypothesis of Diesing (1992), the Shortest Derivation Requirement and other principles of grammar. ^ In contrast to much recent work on Icelandic syntax, the traditional view that A-movement is always case-driven is defended in this thesis. Thus, it is argued that inherently case-marked NPs move to Spec-IP or Spec-TP to have covert nominative case checked as inherent case in Icelandic is irrelevant for satisfaction of the <b>Case</b> <b>Filter.</b> For the same reason, inherently case-marked objects in Icelandic need covert accusative case to satisfy the <b>Case</b> <b>Filter</b> whether they stay in situ or move to Spec-AgrOP. This approach to quirky arguments in Icelandic is used as a basis for a new analysis of nominative objects and agreement. ^ Case checking of an NP requires government by a lexical head or a spec-head relation with a functional head of the appropriate kind. An NP can also satisfy the <b>Case</b> <b>Filter</b> by chain-linking to a structural case position, i. e. case transmission as in expletive-argument chains. More specifically, case is transmitted from the expletive in Spec-IP to the argument in the expletive passive/unaccusative construction (Safir 1985, Burzio 1986), but from the argument in Spec-TP to the expletive in the expletive-TP construction. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{restrictions}} on the realization of sentential complements of nouns {{on the basis of}} the distribution očto-clauses in Russian. I propose an account for these restrictions in which sentential complements of nouns are introduced by a silent preposition necessitated by the structural Case requirement of sentential complements. The observed restrictions follow from the licensing conditions on predication imposed by the silent preposition, which, as I argue, is interpreted as a relation of possession (of propositional content). These licensing conditions are satisfied only in those environments where the complement-taking noun projects a (logophorically controlled) implicit argument, which can serve as the subject for predication. If the proposed account is correct, it provides evidence for the θ-theoretic (Visibility) approach to the <b>Case</b> <b>Filter,</b> which entails that sentential arguments require structural Case licensing...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis focusses on the {{structure}} of PP's in English and Polish, and the occurrence of PP's in subject and object positions. The main theoretical references are the X-bar Theory of syntactic categories and the Government Binding framework (GB). A consideration of English data corroborates Jackendoff's and Emonds' claim that apart from an NP, prepositions can take a PP and an S′ complement or no complement at all, though details of Jackendoff's analysis are revised. Polish prepositions allow the same range of complements, including no complement, although,with a greater variety of complex prepositions and with intransitive prepositions modified by relative and appositive clauses, the P-PP and the P-S′ structures are less common in Polish than in English. Subject and object PP's have so far received little attention. Like PP objects of prepositions, they are used if the intended meaning cannot be expressed by a suitable NP. The appearance of subject PP's in raising and passive sentences poses a problem for classical Transformational Grammar, though not for a slightly revised version of GB – another category-based framework. The analysis proposed here involves a particular view of the representation of Case, and a revised <b>Case</b> <b>Filter.</b> The <b>Case</b> <b>Filter</b> rules out not merely any lexical NP with no Case but any lexical XP which requires Case but has not been assigned Case. Thus, the properties of being an NP and requiring Case are independent of each other. It emerges from the investigation (i) that prepositions in English and Polish are more alike than one might expect, given the obvious differences between the two languages; (ii) that prepositions and PP's are like verbs and VP's – as Jackendoff emphasizes – but in some respects they show greater resemblance to other categories; and (iii) that syntactic categories are less important for the distribution of phrases than is commonly assumed, and that the meaning of phrases is of central importance for their distribution. </p...|$|E

The existing bug triage approaches are based on machine learning algorithms, which build classifiers from the training sets of bug reports.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general {{analysis}} of Case alternations and other phenomena associated with nominal hierarchies of the Silverstein type. The analysis {{is based on}} the mechanism of defective probes (in the sense of Chomsky 2001), such that a defective head may value a different Case from its nondefective counterpart (cf. Rezac 2004). The resultant 'defective Case forms' are characterized by a range of well-known interpretive restrictions on argument encoding (definiteness-, animacy- and Person-Case-Constraint effects) - examples include Icelandic nominative objects, English expletive-associates, the Russian genitive of negation, and the absolutive in Mohawk. These interpretive restrictions, and their relation to the EPP (optional vs. obligatory), are shown to follow from the variable crosslinguistic association of the syntactic Person feature of a nominal with, for probes, the EPP-feature of Chomsky 2000, and, for goals, different degrees of prominence as defined on a referential scale. In this way, differences in form (Case-marking) have semantic consequences, with the various interpretive restrictions at the interface reducing to a single, common source: namely, formal violations of the <b>Case</b> <b>Filter</b> in the context of defective Agree...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{propensity}} in many languages for elements that represent backgrounded and/or given information {{to show up}} in the middle field, a tendency that I term SHIFT.

SHIFT applies across the board, but language-specific principles, such as Constituent Order Rules, may block its application. An example of a reordering restriction is that an operation must not result in a constituent order for which the phonological module cannot supply a prosodic pattern, for example an OV pattern in a VO language. Another restriction is that a reordering operation must not result in a violation of the <b>Case</b> <b>filter.</b> Holmberg’s generalization (cf.
