50|$|Plaintiffs and {{prosecutors}} have long used mass media {{to get their}} side of the story out to the public, but the formal practice of litigation PR, a sub-specialty of crisis communication, first emerged in the early 1980s with Alan Hilburg, a pioneer in litigation communications representation of U.S. Tobacco in the Marsee case. Since then, the need for litigation PR has grown tremendously as media coverage of court cases and the law has increased. Most parties to a lawsuit have important interests that expand beyond legal concerns. Negative publicity about a litigant can cause damage to an individuals reputation that a courtroom win years later may not salvage.

There is no doubt that ENAC has benefited from the spectacular development of air transport in the postwar years. But it would not have taken such an advantage if its teachings were not performing. Finally, one <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>ignore</b> the presence of a significant contingent of students from either foreign countries or - in even larger numbers - which territories would gain independence in the near future. In the early 1960s, the university is beginning to welcome its first students and trainees from foreign civil aviation authorities. Along with enrollment growth, new courses are created regularly. This creation is often a direct result of an administrative decision, as it is the case when a new rating is introduced. Thus, in 1956 was created the navigation instructor rating, {{with the opening of the}} corresponding training. Sometimes a course is simply set to meet a need. The same year 1956, for example, is introduced a speaking techniques course for instructors.

There were several reasons for victims to get involved in it, such as weak financial condition, retirement settlement, surplus money and land, future planning for children, physical disability of self or dependency, unemployment, or business losses. Victims arranged the money through loan and borrowing, cash and bank savings, and provident funds. The victims of mass mobile tower fraud can be mapped to the security weakness of [...] "the human elements" [...] suggested by Stajano & Wilson (2009). The greed and needs of the victims made them more vulnerable to the fraud. The victims were totally focused on mobile tower installation and distract them from protecting themselves from the fraudster. The victims who are sufficiently distracted by the prospect of unexpected financial gain by mobile tower are easily persuaded by fraudsters to send money for expenses like government tax, service tax and other charges, not realizing that the entire enterprise is fraudulent. The people can not decipher the right or wrong as fraudsters alter the perception of victim using their tricks. Victims under the guise of limited time are exploited by fraudsters to make decisions they would not otherwise make, and as a result victims pass the bucks to fraudsters. The victims have suffered on account of financial loss, emotional impact including mental shock, loss of self-esteem and self-blame.|$|E
