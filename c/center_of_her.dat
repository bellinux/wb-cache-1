5|$|After Saladin conquered {{almost the}} whole Kingdom of Jerusalem {{in the second}} half of 1187, Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem, sought shelter in Tripoli, which became a <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> supporters. The noblemen who {{condemned}} her husband, Guy of Lusignan, for the fall of the kingdom, joined Conrad of Montferrat at Tyros. Saladin decided to invade the crusader states in Syria. He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town. After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala (present-day Tartus and Jableh in Syria) in July, only Tripoli, Krak des Chevaliers, and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian rule in the county.|$|E

A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened to the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending {{to her feet and}} neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E

25|$|Hera's {{importance}} in the early archaic period is attested by the large building projects undertaken in her honor. The temples of Hera in the two main <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cult, the Heraion of Samos and the Heraion of Argos in the Argolid, were the very earliest monumental Greek temples constructed, in the 8th century BCE.|$|R
25|$|She {{was also}} called Kypris or Cytherea after her birth-places in Cyprus and Cythera, respectively, both <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cult.

25|$|The {{original}} series {{begins with}} the introduction of Reed Brennan, a savvy and ambitious honors student who enters the prestigious Easton Academy private school. Coming from a shaken family and a mundane everyday life, she is eager to explore the brand new setting that awaits her in Connecticut. Unexpectedly, the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fascination soon becomes a famed dorm known as Billings House and the posh girls who reside there—Noelle, Ariana, Kiran, and Taylor. In time, Reed pines to become a Billings Girl herself, and is faced with many tests and compromises along the way. As the series progresses, several additional characters and their histories are introduced and focused upon.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the medical}} {{treatment}} {{she had received}} in San Francisco, Kahlo's health problems continued throughout the 1940s. Due to her spinal problems, she wore twenty-eight separate supportive corsets, varying from steel and leather to plaster, between 1940 and 1954. She also experienced pain in her legs, while the infection on her hand had become chronic, and she also underwent treatment for syphilis. In addition, {{the death of her}} father in April 1941 plunged her into a depression. Her ill health made her increasingly confined to La Casa Azul, which became the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> world. She enjoyed taking care of the house and its garden, and was kept company by friends, servants, and various pets, including spider monkeys, Xoloitzcuintlis, and parrots.|$|E

500|$|Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone {{commented that}} [...] "the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer [...] prov her dance moves are still razor-sharp {{as she turns}} 51." [...] James Montogomery from MTV complemented Madonna's dance moves in the video, and said: [...] "She is 51, twice divorced, a mother of four and she is (quite rightfully) unashamed by any of this. Sexual politics, anyone?" [...] Olivia Smith of the New York Daily News commented that [...] "Madge has her family– her {{daughter}} and her lover– at her latest party, in which she's still at the hotblooded <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life." [...] She {{also noted that the}} video exemplifies the fact that Madonna is an artist with a long musical past. However, the tone of the video explains that Madonna is ready to leave that past and move forward. According to Smith, although Madonna has toned down her appearance, [...] "the 51-year-old is still her pelvis-swirling overtly sexual self in her new video." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Beyoncé's work on [...] "1+1" [...] is like {{a journey}} to the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> craft, a {{stripping}} away of every distraction until all that's left is her voice. Without it, [...] "1+1" [...] would be a muted ballad: Its simple guitar line and stardust-sprinkled strings serve no purpose other than to evoke a sense of familiar romantic intimacy, and then to elegantly step aside while Beyoncé delivers {{one of her most}} wonderfully impassioned performances ever. [...] "1+1" [...] possesses that slightly scary intensity that has been R's worst-kept secret weapon since Whitney Houston's [...] "I Have Nothing", but it also demonstrates perfectly how Beyoncé stands apart from every other big-chested diva getting her Whitney on. She lets the song sing through her with a clarity that is never clinical, a strength that never sabotages, and an expressiveness that is precisely as sentimental as its subject matter requires. Beyoncé is R's field marshal, demanding of her listeners and herself an absolute fidelity to the music's emotional possibilities, with a perfectly modulated vehemence that is as captivating as it is tyrannical.|$|E
500|$|Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine {{noted that}} in the video, [...] "Gaga fully embraces the monstrous {{as a part of}} her." [...] Moralde further {{explained}} that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as [...] "Mother Monster", but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. [...] "The things that are monstrous, the things that are different—for Gaga, {{those are the things that}} are beautiful," [...] he concluded. Gina Serpe from E! Online criticized it for being a [...] "Madonna rip-off", while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted similarities to some of Madonna's work and the imagery from in the 1927 German expressionist film, Metropolis. Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism. According to her, with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass, by portraying images borrowed from fine art, cinema and cool subcultures. Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a conventional-looking male or female consort. Powers further added that [...] "Gaga has found a way to place female empowerment at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy's girl or a 'boy toy'." [...] Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found [...] "strange". The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.|$|E

2500|$|As the United States women's {{suffrage}} {{movement was}} developing {{in the early}} 1900s, Glasgow marched in the English suffrage parades {{in the spring of}} 1909. Later she spoke at the first suffrage meeting in Virginia. Glasgow felt that the movement came [...] "at the wrong moment" [...] for her, and her participation and interest waned. [...] Glasgow did not at first make women’s roles her major theme, and she was slow to place heroines rather than heroes at the <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stories. [...] Her later works, however, have heroines who display many of the attributes of women involved in the political movement.|$|R
2500|$|Berry's seventh novel {{presents}} a concise vision of Port William's [...] "membership." [...] The story encompasses Hannah's life, including the Great Depression, World War II, the postwar industrialization of agriculture, {{the flight of}} youth to urban employment, and the consequent remoteness of grandchildren. The tale is told {{in the voice of}} an old woman twice widowed, who has experienced much loss yet has never been defeated. Somehow, lying at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> strength is the [...] "membership"—the fact that people care for each other and, even in absence, hold each other in a kind of presence. All in all, Hannah Coulter embodies many of the themes of Berry's Port William saga.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{she added}} {{sociology}} and Christian education to her teaching load. President Wiley, who appreciated good talent and Olive Winchester, made her {{vice president of}} the College in 1922, and the following year she was appointed academic dean as well, holding both positions simultaneously until her resignation in 1935. ... A history of Northwest's first quarter-century summarized her administrative role in a sentence: [...] "She contributed very much {{to the development of the}} right attitude toward scholastic standards, as vice-president and dean of the college had much to do with the internal organization of the institution." ... At the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> legacy stood the undeniable fact that she was a pivotal figure in the transition of Northwest Nazarene College from a sagebrush academy to a sound academic institution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christina {{then became}} the belated <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother's attention. Having {{previously}} shown her daughter indifference, Maria Eleonora became attentive to her. Gustav Adolf {{had decided that}} {{in the event of}} his death, his daughter should be cared for by his half-sister, Catherine of Sweden [...] and half-brother Carl Gyllenhielm as regent. This solution did not suit Maria Eleonora, who had her sister-in-law banned from the castle. In 1636, Chancellor Oxenstierna saw no other solution than to exile the widow to Gripsholm castle, while the governing regency council would decide when she was allowed to meet her nine-year-old daughter. For the subsequent three years, Christina thrived in the company of her aunt Catherine and her family. In 1638, after the death of Catherine the (royal?) council appointed two foster mothers for the queen: countess Ebba Leijonhufvud and Christina Nilsdotter (Natt och Dag).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} {{sessions}} of Sojourner's speech, she utilized {{a story from}} the Bible to help strengthen her argument for equal rights for women. She ended her argument by accusing men of being self-centered, saying, [...] "man is so selfish that he has got women's rights and his own too, and yet he won't give women their rights. He keeps them all to himself." [...] For the final session of Sojourner's speech, the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> attention was mainly on women's right to vote. Sojourner told her audience that she owned her own house, as did other women, and must therefore pay taxes. Nevertheless, they were still unable to vote because they were women. Black women who were enslaved were made to do hard manual work, such as building roads. Sojourner argues that if these women were able to perform such tasks, then they {{should be allowed to}} vote because surely voting is easier than building roads.|$|E
2500|$|From 1871 to 1911, {{the site}} of the rose garden was part of the city's Agricultural Park. The rose garden area was then used for horse, camel, dog, and later {{automobile}} racing; it also reportedly housed the city's longest bar and [...] "one of its most stylish brothels." [...] In 1914, the city announced plans to construct a wildflower garden at the park, but the rose garden was not built until 1927 with the planting of 15,000 bushes of more than 100 varieties. When the garden was announced, the Los Angeles Times applauded the project: [...] "No more fitting tribute could be paid to the spirit of Southern California than to erect in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> largest city the greatest rose garden in the world." [...] During the Great Depression, the lack of funding threatened the closure of the rose garden, then described as [...] "the largest rose garden in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Ephesus in Ionia, Turkey, {{her temple}} {{became one of}} the Seven Wonders of the World. It was {{probably}} the best known <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> worship except for Delos. There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through interpretatio graeca was worshipped primarily as a mother goddess, akin to the Phrygian goddess Cybele, in an ancient sanctuary where her cult image depicted the [...] "Lady of Ephesus" [...] adorned with multiple rounded breast-like protuberances on her chest. They have been variously interpreted as multiple accessory breasts, as eggs, grapes, acorns, or even bull testes. Excavation {{at the site of the}} Artemision in 1987–88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped amber beads that had adorned the ancient wooden cult image or xoanon. In Acts of the Apostles, Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint Paul's preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” Of the 121 columns of her temple, only one composite, made up of fragments, still stands as a marker of the temple's location. The rest were used for making churches, roads, and forts.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, the total US ground forces in Vietnam were {{increased}} to 82,000 or by 150 percent. That same month, Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective, and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse. Gen. Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82,000 to 175,000. After consulting with his principals, Johnson, desirous of a low profile, chose to announce {{at a press conference}} an increase to 125,000 troops, with additional forces to be sent later upon request. Johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices—between sending Americans to die in Vietnam and giving in to the communists. If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached. He continued to insist that his decision [...] "did not imply any change in policy whatsoever". Of his desire to veil the decision, Johnson jested privately, [...] "If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye, and she has it in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> forehead, you don't keep her in the living room". By October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{women were}} thought to be able to {{eliminate}} the danger from destructive weather. This was the case with Stana Tomić, a healer from Jarmenovci in the municipality of Topola. Her fellow villagers held her in high esteem and claimed that she saved Jarmenovci from hail many times. At the sight of hail clouds, she would place the dining table at the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house, before putting on it a piece of bread, salt, and the lighted candle that had been used during the celebration of the slava. She would then go out into the yard and shout: [...] "ORadomir, hanged man, lead the kolo around. Turn those white cattle back there, do not let them come here. Here is a bigger prodigy: a girl of seven years old bore a child, wrapped it in silken diapers, bound it with a silken ribbon. Do not let harm come to our vineyards, do not let harm come to our fruitful fields." [...] In 1956, when this was recorded, Stana had been protecting Jarmenovci in this way for thirty years. In the regions of Takovo and Užice, people claimed that some villages had never been ravaged by hail, because in each of them there was a woman that prevented it.|$|E
