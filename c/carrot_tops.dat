50|$|Platysace linearifolia {{known as}} <b>Carrot</b> <b>Tops</b> is a slender shrub, found growing on poor sandy soils in eastern Australia, north of Jervis Bay. It may form large colonies and is easily {{noticed in the}} late summer and autumn when covered in small white flowers. It grows from 40 cm to 1.5 metres tall. A feature of this plant is the linear leaves, 10 to 25 mm long, and 0.5 to 1 mm wide. The fruit is 2 mm long and wide, with tubercles.|$|E
50|$|South of the Loire {{the weather}} was more {{favourable}} but, with the coming threat of invasion, the Germans were intent on stripping the land so the Allies would be left with nothing and be compelled to bring everything across from England. Hermann Göring proclaimed in a speech that under the Nazi New Order, the Herrenvolk were entitled to deprive the occupied peoples of their food, and that whoever starved {{it would not be}} the Germans. Rationing remained fierce. Even with coupons, it was impossible to acquire many items. Maximum prices were fixed for everything, but the black market pushed prices 5-15 times beyond the official tariff. Cheap restaurants in big towns served dishes comprising turnip or <b>carrot</b> <b>tops</b> made without any kind of fat, and although householders still received a fair ration of rough wine, all spirits were confiscated for industrial use.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Neryl pyrophosphate, {{rather than}} geranyl pyrophosphate, is {{believed}} to be the immediate biological precursor of the cyclohexanoid monoterpenes because the cis- 2, 3 -double bond readily permits cyclization. Biosynthesis of neryl pyrophosphate could occur by either of two principal mechanisms: direct cis condensation of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate with isopentenyl pyrophosphate or trans-cis isomerization of geranyl pyrophosphate, Flavin-dependent enzymes that catalyze the isomerization of geraniol and geranyl phosphate to nerol and neryl phosphate, respectively, have now been isolated from peppermint and pea leaves, and <b>carrot</b> <b>tops.</b> Isomerization also occurs non-enzymatically but is greatly accelerated in the presence of the enzyme extracts. Various factors are required in order to demonstrate enzymatic isomerization. These factors are: (1) a flavin (FAD or FMN); (2) a thiol or sulfide (glutathione, dithiothreitol, (i-rnercaptoethanol, or Na₂S); and (3) light (400 - 500 nm wavelength). If the flavin is partially reduced chemically, light is not required. Non-enzymatic isomerization also occurs if sulfite is the sulfur compound added. When a cell-free peppermint extract is utilized, enzymatic isomerization in the light is a function of: enzyme, substrate, FAD, and dithiothreitol concentrations; temperature (at 35 ° the rate is twice the rate at 25 °); and pH (7. 5 optimum). Isomerization is also increased by anaerobic conditions. Complete reduction of the flavin inhibits isomerization. Inhibition is also observed if N-ethylmaleimide is present during the reaction, but pretreatment of the enzyme with NEM or 2 -hydroxymercuribenzoate, which is removed prior to incubation with substrate, causes no inhibition. The various substrates are isomerized at different rates, Nerol appears to be isomerized twice as fast as geraniol, and the apparent equilibrium for the reaction is 67...|$|E
