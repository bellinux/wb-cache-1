40|$|Previously the Authors {{devised the}} concept of {{intermediate}} market (or inter-firms) trade contacts (ITC) as a resource flow of transactional capital to assess business-to-business (B 2 B) purchase or sale contacts in Hotels and Restaurants industry. In the resource-based view of the firm (R-BV), only valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources can become useful source to defend firm competitive advantage. The objective {{of this research is}} to verify whether the frequency in EU <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> B 2 B, reached by Recreational, Sporting and cultural industry, could be a 'valuable' and 'rare' resources able leapfrogging sustained competitive development as Flywheel to engender EU countries tourism. Using Eurostat input-output tables and applying supply-driven mirror or input-output model, a systematic relationship has been found between the sale multiplier and the valuable (above normal) sale ITC that involves rare (concentrated) intermediate sale contacts. It follows the testability of R-BV on large scale also in heterogeneous industries...|$|R

50|$|The MPEG-2 {{patent pool}} began with 100 patents in 1997 {{and since then}} {{additional}} patents have been added. As of 2013 the number of active/expired patents in the MPEG-2 patent pool is over 1,000. The MPEG-2 license agreement states that if possible the license fee will not increase when new patents are added. The MPEG-2 license agreement states that MPEG-2 royalties must be paid when there is one or more active patents in either the country of manufacture or the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> The original MPEG-2 license rate was $4 for a decoding license, $4 for an encoding license and $6.00 for encode-decode consumer product.|$|E

50|$|As {{with each}} new S-Class, the W220 was technologically {{advanced}} {{at the time of}} its launch, bringing in new innovations such as Airmatic air suspension, Active Ventilated Seats (which used miniature fans in the seats to move air through perforations), keyless entry and ignition, Distronic: the first worldwide radar-assisted Autonomous cruise control system, and a cylinder deactivation system called Active Cylinder Control for the S500 and S600 models, which improves fuel consumption and reduces emissions. All were pioneering innovations at the time of the W220's conception. There are standard features to all models, standard features to certain models, and finally optional features. Sometimes what is standard changes on a model year or <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b>|$|E
50|$|When the MPEG LA {{terms were}} announced, commenters {{noted that a}} number of {{prominent}} players were not part of the group. Among these were AT&T, Microsoft, Nokia, and Motorola. Speculation at the time was that these companies would form their own licensing pool to compete with or add to the MPEG LA pool. Such a group was formally announced on March 26, 2015 as HEVC Advance. The terms, covering 500 essential patents, were announced on July 22, 2015, with rates that depend on the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> type of device, HEVC profile, HEVC extensions, and HEVC optional features. Unlike the MPEG LA terms, HEVC Advance reintroduced license fees on content encoded with HEVC, through a revenue sharing fee.|$|E
50|$|While most TV tuners {{are limited}} to the radio {{frequencies}} and video formats used in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> many TV tuners used in computers use DSP, so a firmware upgrade is often all that's necessary to change the supported video format. Many newer TV tuners have flash memory {{big enough to hold}} the firmware sets for decoding several different video formats, making it possible to use the tuner in many countries without having to flash the firmware. However, while it is generally possible to flash a card from one analog format to another due to the similarities, it is generally not possible to flash a card from one digital format to another due to differences in decode logic necessary.|$|E

50|$|On July 22, 2015, HEVC Advance {{announced}} their initial HEVC patent license program, in which royalty rates {{depended on the}} <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> type of device, HEVC profile, HEVC extensions, and HEVC optional features. The HEVC Advance license had a maximum royalty rate of US$2.60 per device for Region 1 countries and a content royalty rate of 0.5% of the revenue generated from HEVC video services. Region 1 countries in the HEVC Advance license include the United States, Canada, European Union, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and others. Region 2 countries were countries not listed in the Region 1 country list. The first HEVC Advance license program had a maximum royalty rate of US$1.30 per device for Region 2 countries and a content royalty rate of 0.5% of the revenue generated from applicable HEVC video services. The HEVC Advance device license applied to a decoder, encoder, or combination decoder/encoder.|$|E
50|$|Several English {{versions}} (customized for the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale)</b> {{were published}} as The Silver Spoon by the United Kingdom's Phaidon Press in 2005, then later in German, French and Dutch. They {{are based on}} the 1997 Italian edition, with a special section of recipes from prominent Italian cooks around the world. While Phaidon's original edition had been criticized for awkward measurements (the US edition does not include metric conversions), the English editions have overall been well received and very popular. In the US the book became a New York Times Bestseller, catching some in the industry by surprise. Phaidon followed up in 2009 with The Silver Spoon: Pasta and The Silver Spoon Book for Children. A revised English edition was released in November 2011, with adjusted measurements, 400 new photographs, as well as a new cover, more similar to the red leather binding of the original Italian edition.|$|E
50|$|A {{criticism}} of the MPEG-2 patent pool {{is that even though}} the number of patents will decrease from 1,048 to 416 by June 2013 the license fee has not decreased with the expiration rate of MPEG-2 patents.For products from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2009 royalties were $2.50 for a decoding license, $2.50 for an encoding license and $2.50 for encode-decode consumer product license. Since January 1, 2010, MPEG-2 patent pool royalties are $2.00 for a decoding license, $2.00 for an encoding license and $2.00 for encode-decode consumer product. By 2015 more than 90% of the MPEG-2 patents will have expired but {{as long as there are}} one or more active patents in the MPEG-2 patent pool in either the country of manufacture or the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> the MPEG-2 license agreement requires that licensees pay a license fee that does not change based on the number of patents that have expired.|$|E
