5|$|A second {{collection}} of 23 modern maps: 16 of Italy (including Corsica), 3 of Styria {{and the other}} Balkan countries, 4 of Greece. (Once again Mercator did not term this {{collection of}} maps as an atlas but in the preface he introduces Atlas as a mythical King of Mauretania—a learned philosopher, mathematician and astronomer, credited with {{the making of the}} first globe.) This <b>collection</b> <b>has</b> a dedication to Prince Ferdinando de' Medici to whom Mercator attributes ancestry from King Atlas.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} the marshall of Jülich {{approached}} Mercator {{and asked him to}} prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the crown prince Johannes. This remarkable <b>collection</b> <b>has</b> been preserved and is now held in the British Library under the title Atlas of Europe (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum of Abraham Ortelius.|$|E

A single <b>collection</b> <b>has</b> also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences {{in the form of the}} fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} spends its life almost {{exclusively}} in the wetland where it hatched. In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 years or more, and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years old or more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's <b>collection</b> <b>has</b> successfully sustained itself for more than 35years. The age of a bog turtle is determined by {{counting the number of}} rings in a scute, minus the first one (which develops before birth).|$|E

5|$|The Palace Museum holds {{close to}} 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date {{from before the}} Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). This is the largest such {{collection}} in China. The collection {{is based on the}} palace collection in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as Qianlong meant that the palace held {{one of the most important}} collections of paintings in Chinese history. However, a significant portion of this collection was lost over the years. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, many of the works were moved to Taiwan. The <b>collection</b> <b>has</b> subsequently been replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} a {{collection}} of 13,000 artifacts, books, photographs, art objects, and memorabilia. The DuSable <b>collection</b> <b>has</b> come largely from private gifts. It has United States slavery-era relics, nineteenth- and twentieth-century artifacts, and archival materials, including the diaries of sea explorer Captain Harry Dean. The DuSable collection includes works from scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, sociologist St. Clair Drake, and poet Langston Hughes. The African American art collection contains selections from the South Side Community Art Center students Charles White, Archibald Motley, Jr., Gus Nall, Charles Sebree, and Marion Perkins, as well as numerous New Deal Works Progress Administration period and 1960s Black Arts Movement works. The museum also owns prints and drawings by Henry O. Tanner, Richmond Barthé, and Romare Bearden, and has an extensive collection of books and records pertaining to African and African American history and culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} <b>collection</b> <b>has</b> {{more than}} 7,500works from the 13thcentury to 1848 and is managed by 12curators who oversee the collection's display. Nearly two-thirds are by French artists, {{and more than}} 1,200are Northern European. The Italian paintings compose most of the remnants of FrancisI and LouisXIV's collections, others are unreturned artwork from the Napoleon era, and some were bought. The collection began with Francis, who acquired works from Italian masters such as Raphael and Michelangelo and brought Leonardo da Vinci to his court. After the French Revolution, the Royal Collection formed {{the nucleus of the}} Louvre. When the d'Orsay train station was converted into the Musée d'Orsay in 1986, the collection was split, and pieces completed after the 1848 Revolution were moved to the new museum. French and Northern European works are in the Richelieu wing and Cour Carrée; Spanish and Italian paintings are {{on the first floor of}} the Denon wing.|$|E
