50|$|Single-walled {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) {{were first}} seen in 1993 as <b>cylinders</b> <b>rolled</b> {{from a single}} graphene sheet. In 1998, the first peapod was observed by Brian Smith, Marc Monthioux and David Luzzi. The idea of peapods came from the structure that was produced inside a transmission electron microscope in 2000. They were first recognized in fragments obtained by a pulsed-laser vaporization synthesis followed by treatment with an acid and annealing.|$|R

2500|$|All Oldsmobiles {{featured}} the [...] "speed bar" [...] speedometer. [...] Introduced in 1959, the speedometer used a rolling black cylinder with sections painted brilliant green, yellow and bright red. [...] As the car {{went from a}} standing stop forward in speed, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rolled,</b> first exposing the green in a window that matched the numeric speed on stationary speed dial for low speeds, yellow at moderate speeds, and finally red at highway speeds. [...] Drivers who topped the car over 100mph moved the cylinder into an area where only the black base color was visible. [...] For 1963, Oldsmobile would revert to a standard speed needle sweeping over a calibrated set of speeds instead.|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} of the Large Gap Magnetic Suspension System (LGMSS) ground-based experiment is presented. The LGMSS provides five degrees of freedom control of a cylindrical suspended element which is levitated above a floor-mounted array of air core electromagnets. The uncontrolled degree of freedom is rotation about the long axis of the <b>cylinder</b> (<b>roll).</b> Levitation and control forces are produced on a permanent magnet core which {{is embedded in the}} cylinder. The cylinder also contains light emitting diodes (LEDs), assorted electrons, and a power supply. The LEDs provide active targets for an optical position measurement system which is being developed in-house at the Langley Research Center. The optical position measurement system will provide six degrees of freedom position information for the LGMSS control system...|$|R

40|$|The static polarizability of {{cylindrical}} {{systems is}} shown {{to have a strong}} dependence on a uniform magnetic field applied parallel to the tube axis. This dependence is demonstrated by performing exact numerical diagonalizations of simple <b>cylinders</b> (<b>rolled</b> square lattices), armchair and zig-zag carbon nanotubes (rolled honeycomb lattices) for different electron-fillings. At low temperature, the polarizability as function of the magnetic field has a discontinuous character where plateau-like region are separated by sudden jumps or peaks. A one to one correspondence is pointed out between each discontinuity of the polarizability and the magnetic-field induced cross-over between the ground state and the first excited state. Our results suggest the possibility to use measurements of the static polarizability under magnetic field to get important informations about excited states of cylindrical systems such as carbon nanotubes.

5000|$|In {{order to}} win, a Dasher {{had to reach}} the Win space {{at the end of}} the path by exact count.

(E.g. a roll of 3 with the Dasher one space from Win {{resulted}} in him/her two spaces away.) When a Dasher reached Win, that team kept all cash and prizes they had banked during the game.

40|$|Slithering, crawling, slipping, gliding {{are various}} modes of limbless {{locomotion}} {{that have been}} mimicked for micro-manipulation of soft, slender and sessile objects. A lesser known mode is rolling which involves periodic, asymmetric and lateral muscular deformations. Here we enable an elastomeric cylinder of poly(dimethylsiloxane) to roll on a substrate by releasing small quantity of a solvent like chloroform, toluene, hexane, heptane and so on, which swells differentially {{a portion of the}} cylinder, but evaporates from portion of it which remains exposed to the atmosphere. In a dynamic situation, this asymmetric swelling-shrinking cycle generates a torque which drives the <b>cylinder</b> to <b>roll.</b> The driving torque is strong enough that the <b>cylinder</b> can <b>roll</b> up an inclined plane, within a range of inclination, its velocity even increases. The cylinder can even drag a dead weight significantly larger, ~ 8 - 10 times its own weight. A scaling law is derived for optimizing the rolling velocity. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|Rocker-roller boards add {{a degree}} of {{instability}} to the rocker board that makes them much more challenging for the rider than a rocker board is. Rather than on a fixed pivot, a rocker-roller's board is placed on a cylindrical roller; this fulcrum is a wheel that moves {{in relation to the}} ground and in relation to the board. The board's pivot point shifts back and forth as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rolls</b> beneath it. In almost all models the two flat ends of the wheel/roller are about as far from each other as the width of the board. In most models the axis of the roller is perpendicular to the board's length. Thus, as the rider's weight moves over the roller, the board both tilts from side to side and also slides sideways. In models whose roller can be placed with its axis parallel to the board's length, the board slides and tilts toward the front and back (if the rider's feet are oriented accordingly).|$|R
50|$|Brains or Brawn - The Dasher {{must choose}} {{to answer a}} {{question}} or attempt a physical stunt, and the <b>Roller</b> <b>rolls</b> the die. Success allows the Dasher to move forward, but failure requires him/her to move back.|$|R
25|$|Roller die Drawing (also {{referred}} as <b>Roll</b> drawing): <b>roller</b> dies are {{used instead of}} fixed dies to convert shear friction to rolling friction with dramatic reduction in the drawing forces as reported by Lambiase. When roller dies are adopted, the drawing stages are composed by 2-4 idle rolls and the wire is pulled within the rolls clearance. This type of solution can be easily adopted also to produce flat or profiled drawn wires.|$|R

40|$|The brachistochrone curve for a non-dissipative {{particle}} {{tries to}} maximize inertia of the particle {{but for a}} fluid filled cylinder, increasing inertia would amount to increased dissipative losses. Hence the trade-off between inertia and dissipation plays {{a vital role in}} determining the brachistochrone curve of a fluid filled cylinder. This trade-off manifests itself {{in the form of an}} integro-differential equation governing the angular acceleration of the cylinder. Here, we compute the brachistochrone curve of a fluid filled cylinder using optimal control principles and investigate the effect of the aforementioned trade-off on the deviation of the brachistochrone curve from that of a non-dissipative particle. Also, we investigate the effects of the non-dimensional parameters of the problem on the shape of the brachistochrone curve. We then analyze the stability of the time varying fluid flow in the cylinder and find an admissible region for the terminal point which would ensure the stability of the fluid flow as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rolls</b> along the brachistochrone curve.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed investigation of Strouhal frequencies, forces and flow structures {{resulting from the}} interference between two tandem cylinders of different diameters. The upstream cylinder diameter (d) was varied from 25 mm to 6 mm, while the downstream cylinder diameter (D) of 25 mm was unchanged, the corresponding diameter ratio, d/D, being 1. 0 ∼ 0. 24. The spacing between the cylinders was 5. 5 d. At this spacing, the shear layers separated from the upstream <b>cylinder</b> <b>roll</b> up alternately, forming a vortex street in the gap between and behind the cylinders. Two dominant frequencies are detected behind the downstream cylinder at d/D = 1. 0 ∼ 0. 4. One {{is the same as}} detected between the cylinders, and the other is of relatively low frequency and is probably generated by the downstream cylinder. Whilst the former remains unchanged, the latter increases with decreasing d/D, due to an increase in the incident flow velocity of the downstream cylinder. The time-averaged drag on the downstream cylinder also increases with decreasing d/D, though the fluctuating forces drop because vortices impinging upon the downstream cylinder are impaired by decreasing d/D.
