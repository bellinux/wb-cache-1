He also fronted a video campaign to help the charity Save The Children in its mission to aid young Syrian refugees. He was one of the signatories of an open letter, published in The Guardian, criticising the government for its actions regarding the refugee problem. He also gave nightly speeches after his <b>curtain</b> <b>call</b> as Hamlet at the Barbican in London, asking for donations to help Syrian refugees. At the end of the run, the audience contributed more than £150,000 for Save the Children.|$|E

5|$|The West End {{production}} began previews at the Apollo Victoria Theatre from September 7, and officially {{opened on}} September 27, 2006. The production is currently booking until May 28, 2018 and celebrated its fifth anniversary in 2011 {{with a special}} <b>curtain</b> <b>call</b> featuring former West End cast members. The London production was tailored slightly for a British audience, including minor creative changes to dialogue, choreography and special effects. A majority of these changes were later incorporated into all productions of Wicked. The changes include Elphaba meeting Fiyero when he first arrives at Shiz University. In addition, the waltz between Elphaba and the Wizard during Wonderful was removed.|$|E

5|$|Patrice {{decides to}} perform the final scene of a {{vaudeville}} play he has written called La Pendule (The Clock). He explains the complex plot and characters: set in 1929 in a townhouse in Provence, the play involves the Duke of Ponfouy and his family, associates and household servants. He performs the scene, playing all the characters himself and exaggerating their voices and mannerisms. For Patrice's final act, he plays a recording of Rémi and himself from 1985, then sings a song he has written about Rémi and the accident. When the audience applauds the song, he criticises them as {{he does not want}} to be a famous comedian. After imitating a marionette, he performs his <b>curtain</b> <b>call</b> with a toy dragon; he dances with it and a sparkler, and flaps its wings to Johann Strauss I's Radetzky March.|$|E
5|$|Thaïs (1894), {{composed}} for Sanderson, was moderately received. Like Werther, it did {{not gain}} widespread popularity among French opera-goers until its first revival, which was {{four years after the}} premiere, by when the composer's association with Sanderson was over. In the same year he had a modest success in Paris with the one-act Le portrait de Manon at the Opéra-Comique, and a much greater one in London with La Navarraise at Covent Garden. The Times commented that in this piece Massenet had adopted the verismo style of such works as Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana to great effect. The audience clamoured for the composer to acknowledge the applause, but Massenet, always a shy man, declined to take even a single <b>curtain</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bassey was {{the subject}} of This Is Your Life on two occasions, in November 1972 when she was {{surprised}} by Eamonn Andrews at Heathrow Airport, and in January 1993, when Michael Aspel surprised her at the <b>curtain</b> <b>call</b> of a sell-out concert at the Royal Albert Hall.|$|E

25|$|The final episode (#1218) was {{significant}} {{in that it}} gave over considerable air time to a cast reunion <b>curtain</b> <b>call,</b> of popular actors past and present. A week after the airing of the final episode in Sydney, a televised public auction of props and costumes from the series {{was held in the}} grounds of Channel TEN-10.|$|E
25|$|A biographical musical, Laughter in the Rain, {{produced}} by Bill Kenwright and Laurie Mansfield and starring Wayne Smith as Sedaka, had its world premiere at the Churchill Theatre in the London borough of Bromley on March 4, 2010.

25|$|Holmes and Watson {{worked their}} usual magic on the audiences; {{but this time}} they were nearly overshadowed by the burly villain, Dr. Grimesby Rylott, who petted his snake in its wicker basket while the Hindu servant played eerie music on a pipe.

The usually stoic Zimmerman gleefully tossed his batting helmet in the air while {{rounding}} third and leaped onto home plate as his teammates crowded around him. He later took a <b>curtain</b> <b>call</b> and tossed his batting gloves into the stands.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, {{the press}} {{reported}} {{that the role of}} Éponine had officially been offered to Taylor Swift, but Swift later stated that those reports were not entirely accurate. At the end of the month, Mackintosh made a special appearance during the <b>curtain</b> <b>call</b> of the Oliver! UK tour at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, announcing that the tour's Nancy, Samantha Barks, who had played Éponine in the West End production and in the 25th Anniversary concert, would reprise the role in the film.

Despite his outing, he was awarded a no-decision, and the Jays lost 6–2 in extra innings.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{described}} the game's ambiance as cheery {{and full of}} charm. David Sanchez of GameZone thought the game's self-awareness added to its charm, where the player learned through the game's poking lighthearted fun. He added that the music was an [...] "absolute delight" [...] and complimented its range from space sounds to themes to [...] "bizarre" [...] battle tracks that varied with the enemy type. GamesTM wrote that the game's reputation comes from the [...] "consistent ... visual language" [...] in its Charles M. Schulz-esque character and world design. Kotaku Jason Schreier found the ending unsatisfying and unrelieving, despite finding the ending credits with its character <b>curtain</b> <b>call</b> and photo album of [...] "fuzzy pickles" [...] moments all [...] "wonderful".|$|E
500|$|... "Barbette," [...] writes Cocteau, [...] "transforms {{effortlessly}} {{back and}} forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so <b>curtain</b> <b>call,</b> he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E
50|$|After {{three months}} of rehearsal, the company debuted on January 3, 1962 at the George Washington University Lisner Auditorium, with New York City Ballet co-founder and {{choreographer}} George Balanchine in the audience. The company received 13 <b>curtain</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
