5|$|<b>Chamois</b> Niortais Football Club (often {{referred}} to as simply Les <b>Chamois)</b> is a French association football club based in the commune of Niort, in the Deux-Sèvres department of western France. It was founded in 1925 by Charles Boinot, {{the son of the}} owner of a local <b>chamois</b> leather factory. The club's badge shows a <b>chamois</b> goat standing on a football. The club's home stadium is the Stade René Gaillard in Niort, which has a capacity of 10,898 although in the last 20 years attendances have generally averaged below 5,000 per match due to the club's relatively small fan base. <b>Chamois</b> Niortais has traditionally played in an entirely blue home strip, although away strips regularly differ.|$|E
5|$|The {{badge of}} <b>Chamois</b> Niortais {{features}} a <b>chamois</b> goat {{standing on a}} football, and {{the background of the}} crest is royal blue, which has featured in the club's home colours since its founding. When the club was founded in 1925, <b>Chamois</b> Niortais adopted a white strip. Since then, however, the club has usually played in a home strip of royal blue jersey, shorts and socks. In the 2007–08 season the team played in a gold and black kit for the first time, to commemorate 20 years since the club competed in Division 1.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, local <b>chamois</b> leather factory owner, Theophile Boinot, {{established}} the first sports club in Niort, Amicale Club Niortais. Soon after, the football {{section of the}} club was founded and named Étoile Sportive Niortaise. In 1923, many players were conscripted into the French army. In 1925, {{a number of the}} players returned to the town and Boinot's son, Charles, set up the first proper association football team in the town, which he named <b>Chamois</b> Niortais Football Club.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chamois</b> Niortais were {{relegated to}} the Championnat National in 2008, and relegated again a season later, thereby losing their {{professional}} status. After finishing as runners-up in the Championnat National, the team were promoted back to Ligue 2 for the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{appointment}} of the first <b>Chamois</b> Niortais manager, the Swiss coach Franchina, there have been 31 different first-team managers. Three of the coaches, Kazimir Hnatow, Robert Charrier and Pascal Gastien, have {{had more than one}} spell in charge of the club. The current manager is Pascal Gastien, who was given the job in 2009 after Denis Troch was sacked following the side's relegation from the Championnat National. Gastien, a former <b>Chamois</b> Niortais player, is currently in his third spell as manager. To date, the only manager to have coached the club in the top division of French football is Patrick Parizon, during the 1987–88 season. The club's longest-serving manager was Ferdinand Faczinek, who had a five-year tenure between 1943 and 1948.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Chamois</b> Niortais were founded, {{the club}} had no fixed home ground and played {{friendly}} matches at various venues {{in and around}} Niort. In 1926, when the team joined the Ligue du Charentes, the club adopted the small Stade de Genève as their first home. They continued {{to play at the}} Stade de Genève {{for the majority of the}} following 50 years until, in the early 1970s, it was announced that the side would move into a new stadium. On 3 August 1974, the Stade Venise Verte was opened, with the inaugural game being an exhibition match between <b>Chamois</b> Niortais and Dynamo Kyiv. Some time later, the stadium was renamed the Stade René Gaillard in honour of René Gaillard, the former mayor of Niort.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} around Mont Blanc {{are home}} to many mammal species, including ibex, <b>chamois,</b> deer, mountain hare and alpine marmot (including a small population of albino marmots within Val Ferret). Eurasian lynx have been reintroduced into the French Alps and, although present around the Mont Blanc massif, are extremely unlikely to be encountered.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{structural}} steel frame {{was also a}} first for the city. It was covered in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carrières and Queenston. Due to the rapid construction, Saint-Marc-des-Carrières was unable to supply enough stone {{to keep up with}} demand on the building site, resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source. Saint-Marc-des-Carrières limestone is a pearly grey, and becomes a pale beige with age, while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a <b>chamois</b> tint as it ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the present state and regional policy is to carefully combine tourism development in the area with the preservation of its natural and cultural heritage. Ecotourism poses an ideal solution, since {{it has the potential}} of bringing about the desired balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection. Specific objectives of ecotourism development include reviving traditional activities such as small-scale farming and stock-raising, as well as establishing a network of communities of <b>chamois</b> biotopes.|$|E
5|$|Unusual for a {{television}} series, the sound team receives {{a rough cut}} of a full season and approaches it as a ten-hour feature film. Although seasons one and two had different sound teams, one team has {{been in charge of}} sound since then. For the show's blood-and-gore sounds, the team often uses a <b>chamois.</b> For dragon screams, mating tortoises and dolphin, seal, lion and bird sounds have been used.|$|E
5|$|While {{still under}} Dutton's command in late 2003, 3 Commando Brigade {{conducted}} the Royal Marines' {{first visit to}} Slovenia, prior to the country's ascension to the European Union and NATO, for alpine warfare training led by Slovenian troops and culminating in the five-day Exercise Royal <b>Chamois.</b> With the brigade, Dutton also undertook cold-weather training in Norway in 2004. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in October 2003.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the stadium}} has four stands: the Tribune d'Honneur, the Tribune Pasages, the Tribune Populaire Nord, and the Tribune Populaire Sud. The four stands {{currently}} have a combined capacity of 10,898, with 1,324 of these being standing places. The stadium {{is typical of}} many continental European grounds, with an athletics track between the pitch and the stands. Next to the stadium {{there is a small}} annexed ground where the club's reserve and youth teams play their matches. The first televised match at the ground took place on 18 August 1987, when Saint-Étienne were beaten 2–1. The record attendance at the stadium was set on 24 October 1987, when 16,715 people saw <b>Chamois</b> Niortais defeat Marseille by two goals to one in a Division 1 encounter.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, <b>chamois,</b> wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the promotion, <b>Chamois</b> Niortais {{became a}} {{professional}} club for the 1985–86 season. The season began {{well for the}} side, as they achieved a 1–0 win against USL Dunkerque on 16 July 1985. They went on to accomplish a respectable fifth-placed finish in their first season {{with a total of}} 37 points. The next campaign saw unprecedented success for the team, as they racked up a 17-match unbeaten run {{on the way to the}} league championship. Their title triumph was confirmed with a 2–0 victory over US Orléans at the Stade René Gaillard on 23 May 1987.|$|E
5|$|The side {{struggled}} {{in their first}} season back in the third tier, achieving a tenth-placed finish. After being runners-up in the division for two consecutive seasons in 1961–62 and 1962–63, the team secured a number of mid-table league finishes under Kazimir Hnatow. After Hnatow left <b>Chamois</b> Niortais in 1966, the club's fortunes on the pitch began to diminish and they were eventually relegated {{at the end of}} the 1968–69 campaign after ending the season with just 12 points from 26 matches. Upon the restructuring of the league system, the team joined the newly formed Division 3 in 1970. They played there for the following eight years, but never finished higher than fourth in the division. In 1978, the club finished last and were again relegated to the fourth level, but were immediately promoted back to Division 3 after finishing as runners-up in 1979. However, they again finished bottom of the division and in 1980 returned to Division 4, where they played for the next four seasons. In April 1984, Patrick Parizon was appointed as manager and the following month, the side secured a third-placed finish to gain promotion back to Division 3. In 1984–85, the team lost only three matches in the entire campaign as they finished comfortably top of the division. A 2–1 victory over Montauban on 18 May 1985 confirmed their promotion to Division 2 for the first time in the history of <b>Chamois</b> Niortais.|$|E
5|$|Vikos–Aoös National Park {{preserves}} one of {{the richest}} mountain and forest ecosystems in terms of wildlife diversity in Greece. Numerous species of large mammals such as wolves, foxes, wild horses, and roe deer are found in the area year-round. Otters and wild cats live around the area of Tymfi, with the latter being quite rare. The Pindus range, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, is home to the endangered brown bear and lynx, and is also the southernmost point of their European habitat. One of the park's special attractions is the existence of the <b>chamois</b> (Rupicapra rupicapra), a rare species that lives at higher altitudes far from human activity, especially at the rocky cliffs of the gorges, for example in Megas Lakos, a secondary ravine of the Vikos Gorge.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chamois</b> Niortais {{were soon}} relegated from the CFA and {{returned}} to the DH Centre-Ouest in 1945. Led by Faczinek, who had returned to the club as player-manager in 1943, the side won the DH Centre-Ouest for three consecutive seasons. Despite this success, Faczinek left the club in 1948 and was replaced by former France international Maurice Banide. The team re-joined the CFA for the 1948–49 season and played in the division for the following five campaigns, achieving a second-place finish in 1951, when they finished behind Stade Quimpérois by five points. In 1953, the side finished bottom of the division and were relegated back to the DH Centre-Ouest. Following the relegation, manager Nicolas Hibst was sacked and replaced by Georges Hatz, who had previously coached AJ Auxerre. The side remained in the DH Centre-Ouest until 1960 when, under the guidance of Nordine Ben Ali, they won the league title by a single point ahead of Poitiers FC to return to the CFA.|$|E
5|$|For the 1932–33 season, <b>Chamois</b> Niortais {{joined the}} DH Centre-Ouest, {{the highest level}} of {{regional}} football in France, and finished eighth in their first season. The side achieved consecutive sixth- and seventh-place finishes in the next two seasons, before being relegated to the Promotion d'Honneur in 1936. The team played in the division for three seasons, until they gained promotion back to the DH Centre-Ouest {{at the end of the}} 1938–39 campaign. In 1939, Joseph Boinot was appointed president of the club. The following year the club pulled off a major coup with the signing of Czechoslovakia international Ferdinand Faczinek, who played for the club for one season before transferring to FC Sète at the end of the 1940–41 campaign, after which the Second World War halted competitive football for two years in France. In 1943, the club were one of the founder members of the Championnat de France amateur (CFA), {{the highest level of}} amateur football in France.|$|E
5|$|Denis Troch {{was hired}} as the club's new manager in August 2008, and despite hopes of a swift return to Ligue 2, the team {{performed}} poorly throughout the 2008–09 campaign. The side failed to win a league match {{during the first three}} months of the season, and that form continued into 2009. They went into their final match of the season, away at Pacy Vallée-d'Eure, requiring three points to avoid successive relegations. However, the side could only procure a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championnat de France amateur for the first time since 1970. The relegation saw the end of <b>Chamois</b> Niortais's era as a professional club, as they were forced to become a semi-professional outfit due to the DNCG rules. In June 2009, Pascal Gastien was appointed as manager for his third spell in charge of the club, handed the task of achieving promotion back to the Championnat National at the first attempt. The club won the CFA Group C that season, and was subsequently promoted back to the National division for the following campaign. Niort secured their third-tier status with an 11th-place finish in the 2010–11 season. The following season, the team finished as runners-up in the Championnat National behind Nîmes Olympique to return to Ligue 2 for the 2012–13 campaign and regain their professional status.|$|E
25|$|During Oktoberfest, some locals wear Bavarian hats (Tirolerhüte), {{which contain}} a tuft of <b>chamois</b> hair (Gamsbart). Historically, in Bavaria <b>chamois</b> hair was highly valued and prized. The more tufts of <b>chamois</b> hair on one's hat, the wealthier one was {{considered}} to be. Due to modern technology, this tradition has declined {{with the appearance of}} <b>chamois</b> hair imitations on the market.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Pacific Redwood was {{transferred}} to the Ministry of Shipping, which became the Ministry of War Transport in 1941. Pacific Redwood was then renamed Empire <b>Chamois.</b> Her port of registry was changed to London. The United Kingdom Official Number 169200 and Code Letters GPJL were allocated. She was placed under the management of the Booth Steamship Co Ltd. Empire <b>Chamois</b> {{was a member of a}} number of convoys during the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} German gemshorn works {{nearly the}} same way as an ocarina. The only difference is the material it is made from: the horn of a <b>chamois,</b> goat, or other suitable animal.|$|E
25|$|Leander had as {{tender to}} her the depot ship Tyne, and the torpedo boat destroyers: Albatross, Ariel, Banshee, Bat, Bruizer, <b>Chamois,</b> Crane, Cynthia, Desperate, Fawn, Flying Fish, Griffon, Kangaroo, Mallard, Myrmidon, Orwell, Panther, Seal, Stag and Thrasher.|$|E
25|$|Mammals in {{the park}} include the endemic Tatra <b>chamois</b> (Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica), a unique goat—antelope that is an IUCN {{critically}} endangered species. Other mammals include the Eurasian brown bear, Eurasian lynx, marten, wolf, fox, and the Alpine marmot.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} animals are wolf, fox, the European hare (Lepus europaeus), squirrel, and <b>chamois</b> (Rupicapra rupicapra). Few {{specimens}} of the potentially endangered Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) {{still live in}} {{the central part of the}} Albanian Alps, while its hunting is prohibited by law.|$|E
25|$|The fur is coarse and sparse pelage, {{with the}} few skins sold by hunters often being marketed as poor quality dog or wolf fur. Hyena skins were however once used in {{preparing}} <b>chamois</b> leather. The selling price of hyena pelts in the Soviet Union ranged from 45 kopeks to 1 ruble, 80 kopeks.|$|E
25|$|The fauna of Abruzzo {{is highly}} varied, {{including}} the region's symbol, the Abruzzo <b>chamois</b> (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata), which has recovered after risking extinction. Another animal typical {{of this region}} is the marsican brown bear, along with Italian wolf, deer, lynx, roe deer, snow vole, fox, porcupine, wild cat, wild boar, badger, otter and viper.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1871, {{when the}} uniform was {{predominantly}} <b>chamois,</b> {{the club was}} known informally as the Butchers. After World War II, the club briefly considered changing its nickname to the Cockatoos, but this never formally eventuated; even so, the push was serious enough that newspaper cartoons depicting a Carlton cockatoo were printed around that time.|$|E
25|$|I kept {{my money}} in a 'grouch bag'. This was a small <b>chamois</b> bag that actors used to wear around their neck to keep other hungry actors from {{pinching}} their dough. Naturally, you're going to think that's where I got my name from. But that's not so. Grouch bags were worn on manly chests long {{before there was a}} Groucho.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand rescue {{helicopter}} services use several sets of 3rd-generation {{night vision}} goggles {{imported from the}} USA, {{and the country is}} required to restrict access to the equipment to comply with the strict regulations regarding their export. There are no prohibitions on the ownership or use of night vision equipment for shooting non-indigenous game animals, such as rabbits, hares, deer, pigs, tahr, <b>chamois,</b> goats, wallabies, etc.|$|E
25|$|Tymfi {{holds the}} largest {{recorded}} population of Balkan <b>chamois</b> deer (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica) in Greece, {{with a population}} between 120-130 individuals out of an estimated national population between 477-750. Although <b>chamois</b> is registered as least concern in IUCN's red list, the subspecies balcanica numbers some thousands of individuals and its populations {{are believed to be}} declining. According to the Hellenic Ornithological Society mount Tymfi along with the neighbouring mountain Smolikas are important regions for breeding birds of prey, alpine and forest dwelling bird species. The Egyptian vulture, short-toed snake eagle, rufous-tailed rock-thrush breed in the region, whereas species such as the golden eagle, red-billed chough, rock partridge, alpine chough, wallcreeper, white-winged snowfinch and the alpine accentor are sedentary. Alpine reptilian and amphibian species are also present. Vipera ursinii lives in the mountain's subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus Alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the mountain, mostly in and around Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area.|$|E
25|$|The {{biological}} {{diversity of the}} country is high, with 1% of the world's organisms on 0.004% of the Earth's surface area. There are 75 mammal species, among them marmots, Alpine ibex, and <b>chamois.</b> There are numerous deer, roe deer, boar, and hares. The edible dormouse is often found in the Slovenian beech forests. Trapping these animals is a long tradition and {{is a part of the}} Slovenian national identity.|$|E
25|$|The fauna of Catalonia {{comprises}} {{a minority}} of animals endemic to the region {{and a majority of}} non-native animals. Much of Catalonia enjoys a Mediterranean climate (except mountain areas), which makes many of the animals that live there adapted to Mediterranean ecosystems. Of mammals, there are plentiful wild boar, red foxes, as well as roe deer and in the Pyrenees, the Pyrenean <b>chamois.</b> Other large species such as the bear have been recently reintroduced.|$|E
