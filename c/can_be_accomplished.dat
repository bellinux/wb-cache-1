5|$|As {{a benefit}} from the system's design, most tasks in Plan 9 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by using ls, cat, grep, cp and rm {{utilities}} {{in combination with the}} rc shell (the default Plan 9 shell).|$|E

5|$|Not all {{cities have}} a {{distinct}} urban heat island. Mitigation {{of the urban}} heat island effect <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> {{through the use of}} green roofs and the use of lighter-colored surfaces in urban areas, which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{operating}} systems, Plan 9 {{does not provide}} special application programming interfaces (such as Berkeley sockets, X resources or ioctl system calls) to access devices. Instead, Plan 9 device drivers implement their control interface as a file system, so that the hardware can be accessed by the ordinary file input/output operations read and write. Consequently, sharing the device across the network <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by mounting the corresponding directory tree to the target machine.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E

5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} {{has proven}} to be the more complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic analysis with at least two generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods must be used instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E
5|$|Russell {{is careful}} to {{indicate}} that his support for nationalisation rests {{on the assumption that}} it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> under the auspices of a robust democracy, and that it may be safeguarded against statist tyranny. If either condition fail, then nationalisation is undesirable. In delivering this warning, Russell emphasises the distinction between ownership and control. He points out that nationalisation – which would allow the citizens to collectively own an industry – would not guarantee any of them control over the industry. In the same way, shareholders own parts of companies, but the control of the company ultimately rests with the CEO (Russell 1938:235).|$|E
5|$|The game's story follows {{bounty hunter}} Samus Aran, who is {{sent by the}} Galactic Federation to {{investigate}} the Biologic Space Laboratories space station, where it is swarming with organisms infected with virions known as the X Parasites. Like in previous Metroid games, Fusion is played from the side-scrolling perspective. It introduces mission-based gameplay that aids the player to explore areas. The game consists of objectives, which are flexible in how they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished.</b> Fusion was released simultaneously with the GameCube game Metroid Prime in North America. The bonus features in Prime can be unlocked by linking between the game and Fusion via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.|$|E

5|$|Winds are {{depicted}} as blowing {{from the direction}} the barb is facing. Therefore, a northeast wind will be depicted with a line extending from the cloud circle to the northeast, with flags indicating wind speed on the northeast end of this line. Once plotted on a map, an analysis of isotachs (lines of equal wind speeds) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished.</b> Isotachs are particularly useful in diagnosing {{the location of the}} jet stream on upper level constant pressure charts, and are usually located at or above the 300hPa level.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based so that it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E

5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
