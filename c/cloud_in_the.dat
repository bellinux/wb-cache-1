5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over {{a body of}} water. Some are connected to a cumulus congestus cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus <b>cloud.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E
5|$|Following its return, Sea Cloud {{received}} a reassembled rigging in 1947, {{and a new}} set of twenty-nine sails in 1949. The vessel was painted white, and a gold eagle painted on the bow. The ship's reconstruction took nearly four years. Marjorie Merriweather Post retained ownership of Sea <b>Cloud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of her divorce from Mr. Davies, since she had originally brought the ship into the marriage. After evaluating the cost of running a year-round crew of seventy-two, Marjorie Merriweather Post decided to sell the ship.|$|E

5|$|The Moon has an {{external}} magnetic field of about 1–100 nanoteslas, less than one-hundredth that of Earth. It does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization, probably acquired early in lunar history when a dynamo was still operating. Alternatively, some of the remnant magnetization may be from transient magnetic fields generated during large impact events through the expansion of an impact-generated plasma <b>cloud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of an ambient magnetic field. This {{is supported by the}} apparent location of the largest crustal magnetizations near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.|$|E
5|$|The {{cluster is}} {{dominated}} by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity around the brightest stars was thought at first to be {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now known to be an unrelated dust <b>cloud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing. Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled the Orion Nebula. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|The polywell {{attempts}} to confine the ions and electrons through two different means, borrowed from fusors and magnetic mirrors. The electrons {{are easier to}} confine magnetically because they have so much less mass than the ions. The machine confines ions using an electric field {{in the same way}} a fusor confines the ions: in the polywell, the ions are attracted to the negative electron <b>cloud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center. In the fusor, they are attracted to a negative wire cage in the center.|$|E

25|$|There were {{a number}} of Kelpies named Red Cloud. The first and most famous was John Quinn's Red <b>Cloud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century. In the 1960s, another Red Cloud became well known in Western Australia. This started the {{tradition}} in Western Australia of calling all red or red and tan Kelpies, especially those with white chests, Red Cloud Kelpies. Other notable specimens include Gunner and Red Dog (c. 1971 – 21 November 1979), a Kelpie mix which {{was the subject of a}} movie, Red Dog, released in 2011.|$|E
25|$|When Zeus had pity on Ixion {{and brought}} him to Olympus and {{introduced}} him to the gods, instead of being grateful, Ixion grew lustful for Hera. Zeus found out about his intentions and made a <b>cloud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of Hera, who was later named Nephele, and tricked Ixion into coupling with it and from their union came Centaurus. So Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered Hermes to bind Ixion to a winged fiery wheel that was always spinning. Therefore, Ixion was bound to a burning solar wheel for all eternity, at first spinning across the heavens, but in later myth transferred to Tartarus.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of X-rays by {{a bolt of}} lightning was theoretically predicted as early as 1925 but no evidence was found until 2001/2002, when researchers at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology detected X-ray emissions from an induced lightning strike along a grounded wire trailed behind a rocket shot into a storm <b>cloud.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same year University of Florida and Florida Tech researchers used an array of electric field and X-ray detectors at a lightning research facility in North Florida to confirm that natural lightning makes X-rays in large quantities during the propagation of stepped leaders. The cause of the X-ray emissions is still a matter for research, as the temperature of lightning is too low to account for the X-rays observed.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} for two or more {{separate}} open clusters to form {{out of the same}} molecular <b>cloud.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Large Magellanic Cloud, both Hodge 301 and R136 are forming from the gases of the Tarantula Nebula, while in our own galaxy, tracing back the motion through space of the Hyades and Praesepe, two prominent nearby open clusters, suggests that they formed in the same cloud about 600 million years ago. Sometimes, two clusters born at the same time will form a binary cluster. The best known example in the Milky Way is the Double Cluster of NGC 869 and NGC 884 (sometimes mistakenly called h and χ Persei; h refers to a neighboring star and χ to both clusters), but at least 10 more double clusters are known to exist. Many more are known in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds—they are easier to detect in external systems than in our own galaxy because projection effects can cause unrelated clusters within the Milky Way to appear close to each other.|$|E

Along {{with the rest of}} the Final Fantasy VII figures in Dissidia, Sephiroth appears in the prequel Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy. This game also includes a sightly altered Final Fantasy VII form for Sephiroth, as well as his Kingdom Hearts form. Sephiroth is set to return as a playable character opposite <b>Cloud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third entry, Dissidia Final Fantasy NT. He is featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as an unlockable character, representing Final Fantasy VII.

500|$|Cyclones are {{not unique}} to Earth. Cyclonic storms are common on Jovian planets, such as the Small Dark Spot on Neptune. It is about one third the {{diameter}} of the Great Dark Spot and received the nickname [...] "Wizard's Eye" [...] because it looks like an eye. This appearance is caused by a white <b>cloud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the Wizard's Eye. Mars has also exhibited cyclonic storms. Jovian storms like the Great Red Spot are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms. However, this is inaccurate, as the Great Red Spot is, in fact, the inverse phenomenon, an anticyclone.|$|E

In 2010, Famitsu readers voted Sephiroth as the 21st most popular video game character. Sephiroth was also featured alongside Cloud in ScrewAttack's list of top ten [...] "coolest" [...] characters, although they preferred <b>Cloud.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition from 2011, he was voted as the 32nd best video game character of all time.

500|$|Zack's {{character}} and backstory is expanded upon throughout the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. In the prequel game Before Crisis, Zack supports Shinra in their {{fight against the}} eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE. During the game, two of his SOLDIER acquaintances are captured and experimented upon, and though Zack is able {{to bring them back}} to their senses, he is unable to save them. Zack also makes an appearance during the chapter covering the Nibelheim incident, and later as a boss character when he and Cloud are fugitives from Shinra and are being pursued by the Turks. The OVA Last Order: Final Fantasy VII follows Zack and Cloud's journey to Midgar with flashbacks of the Nibelheim incident. Zack also has a small role in the film sequel Advent Children, where most of his appearances are flashbacks from Cloud's point of view. He also appears {{at the end of the}} film, where he and the now deceased Aerith speak to <b>Cloud.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> director's cut version, Advent Children Complete, his role is expanded, and he makes an appearance during Cloud's battle with Sephiroth.
