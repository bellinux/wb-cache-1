5|$|Scholar Andrew Spicer {{argues that}} British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism {{than to the}} expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir from the classic period include Brighton Rock (1947), {{directed}} by John Boulting; They Made Me a Fugitive (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; The Small Back Room (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; The October Man (1950), directed by Roy Ward Baker; and Cast a Dark Shadow (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including The Last Page (a.k.a. Man Bait; 1952), Stolen Face (1952), and Murder by Proxy (a.k.a. Blackout; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: Night and the City (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> noirs is director Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in Citizen Kane.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of a <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> Martello tower consisted of two storeys (sometimes with an additional basement). The ground floor served as the magazine and storerooms, where ammunition, water, stores and provisions were kept. The garrison of 24 men and one officer lived in a casemate on the first floor, which was divided into several rooms and had fireplaces built into the walls for cooking and heating. The officer and men lived in separate rooms of almost equal size.|$|E
25|$|Boarding schools {{generally}} have dormitories as resident halls {{at least for}} junior or younger children around age 4 to 9 years of age. In <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> boarding schools these typically have bunk beds that have traditionally come {{to be associated with}} boarding schools. The Department for Children, Schools and Families, in conjunction with the Department of Health of the United Kingdom, has prescribed guidelines for dormitories in boarding schools. These regulations come under what is called as the National Boarding Standards.|$|E
25|$|Vespa's largest {{market by}} all {{measures}} globally is still Italy, {{but as a}} result of the mod subculture that developed in the 1960s, the ]] is still Vespa's second largest global market—and at one point in the 1960s, its largest. The appeal of the Vespa to the style-conscious mods was the weather protection. Their counterparts, the rockers rode <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> motorcycles such as Triumph Bonneville and BSAs, and needed to wear leathers against the elements. Mods would modify their Vespas, adding lights, mascots, accessories, various racks and crash bars. A new lifestyle evolved in the UK, with thousands attending scooter rallies.|$|E

25|$|The {{band has}} been {{compared}} to many <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> rock bands, as their angle on rock is uniquely British. Their sound is often likened to that of The Jam and The Kinks' early records as well as The Clash's first album and early singles. They are perhaps most similar to pioneer rockers, Buzzcocks. Morrissey is another strong influence cited by the band members. Many of their lyrics refer to elements of British life, use English/cockney slang and are sung in a near-drunken sounding slur. In their attitude they are sometimes compared to the Sex Pistols due to their chaotic and energetic live performances.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Handley Page {{developed}} a new fast short-range regional airliner, intended to replace the venerable Douglas DC-3, particularly in third-world countries. The design, originally known as the HPR-3 Herald, emanated from the drawing office at Handley Page (Reading) Limited—the former Miles Aircraft factory site, which had developed an earlier airliner design, the Miles Marathon. The Herald was an extensive re-development of the original concept of the Marathon, notable for its high mounted wing. The HP Reading division succeeded in producing a modern design with excellent flight and performance characteristics. However, the company made a serious misjudgement which was, in the end, to cost the company dearly, and like some other <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> aircraft of the time, the Herald missed its chance.|$|E

500|$|Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, {{authors of}} The Guinness Book of <b>Classic</b> <b>British</b> TV, cite Brown's {{conversion}} into a living bomb {{as an example}} of the [...] "incredibly violent" [...] nature of some episodes of Captain Scarlet. Andrew Blair of Den of Geek concurs, describing the duplicate's end as [...] "quite an unnerving thing to watch"; the first episode in general, however, is stated to be [...] "tailor-made to appeal to small boys and men-children." [...] The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), in its assessment dated 11 September 2001, notes a single occurrence of [...] "very mild" [...] violence, passing the episode with a U certificate.|$|E

To Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, writers of The Guinness Book of <b>Classic</b> <b>British</b> TV, the effects are [...] "way beyond anything seen on TV previously".

Pemberton, too, called it a [...] "domestic" [...] story, describing it as playing upon the <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> plot device of a family party going wrong. Shearsmith suggested that the pleasant house did give the episode {{the feel of a}} sitcom, but {{said that the}} story went somewhere [...] "darker" [...] than a typical sitcom would. With [...] "Nana's Party", the writers wanted to produce something [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "suburban", with Pemberton citing the playwright Alan Ayckbourn as an influence.

500|$|In 1960 Terry-Thomas {{appeared}} as Raymond Delauney in School for Scoundrels, a film his biographer, Robert Ross, called [...] "the definitive screen presentation of his frightfully well-mannered, well-read and well-educated lounge lizard: T-T {{the man as}} T-T the film star". He again appeared opposite Ian Carmichael, and {{they were joined by}} Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. Michael Brooke, writing for the British Film Institute, thought Terry-Thomas was [...] "outstanding as a <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> bounder". Later the same year he appeared in Make Mine Mink as Major Albert Rayne, a veteran of the Second World War who forms a gang of mink coat thieves with his female co-lodgers. When he made an appearance at a screening of the film in Dalston, north-east London, he was presented with a white mink waistcoat by a local furrier.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Two Ronnies, the BBC let Barker decide {{what he wanted to}} do. The Two Ronnies took up one third of a year to produce, {{allowing}} time for Barker and Corbett to do a solo project each. [...] Barker opted to produce some sitcom pilots shown as part of 1973's Seven of One. Two of these pilots, Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) and Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became series. Prisoner and Escort became Porridge, airing from 1974–1977, with Barker starring as the cynical and cunning prisoner Norman Stanley Fletcher. Porridge was the first sitcom to take place in a prison; The Times said the show [...] "was about what it took to survive in prison, the little day-to-day triumphs over the system that kept the prisoners sane." [...] The opening sequence of the programme showed Fletcher being directed to his cell, as prison doors are locked behind him, all the while the judge can be heard pronouncing judgement and sentence. The judge's voice was performed by Barker. [...] The show became a huge success, attracting 15 million viewers and earning what the BBC described as [...] "a chorus of critical acclaim and public adoration for what {{remains one of the most}} <b>classic</b> <b>British</b> sitcoms ever produced." [...] The Times called Fletcher his [...] "finest creation". Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. He won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 for his performance.|$|E

In his home, the living room had a chess set containing classical Staunton chess pieces. While working, Morse subsists on quickly downed pints of ale in pubs, usually bought by Lewis, who struggles to keep up. Many of his cases touch on Morse's interests, and often his knowledge helps him solve them.|$|R
