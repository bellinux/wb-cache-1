50|$|Disadvantages of a four {{tube system}} were {{increased}} costs, {{a larger and}} heavier camera, and reduced light levels on the <b>colour</b> <b>tubes</b> (light was ‘stolen’ by the luminance tube), making such a camera less suitable for outside broadcasts in low ambient lighting.|$|R

30|$|Given the fact, {{that most}} of the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> in Krøyer’s {{painting}} cabinet were probably bought in the last decades of Krøyer’s life, it seemed reasonable to draw a line between the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> and the paintings from the latter part of Krøyer’s career. Especially the large portrait of Drachmann, finished only 2 years before Krøyer’s death in 1909, seemed to be closely linked to the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> found in the artist’s painting cabinet. Cadmium sulfide pigments, viridian, cobalt blue and zinc white were all examples of pigments found in both Krøyer’s portrait of Drachmann and in a number of his <b>tube</b> <b>colours.</b>|$|R
30|$|The vast {{majority}} of the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> were produced by the Danish colour merchant Vilhelm Pacht, whose colours, among others, were also used by Edvard Munch [16]. In {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth century the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> from Vilhelm Pacht were mainly retailed by the large paint shop A. Stelling, established in central Copenhagen in 1860 [7]. Besides from Pacht, Krøyer also bought <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> from the competing Danish colour merchant Hermann Averhoff at the shop Kultorvets Farvehandel, where he also bought canvases (Fig.  4). Only two of the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> found in Krøyer’s painting cabinet were from foreign companies, these being respectively the French Lefranc et Cie and the Italian Felice Alman.|$|R
50|$|The four-tube {{television}} camera, {{intended for}} color television studio use, was first developed by RCA {{in the early}} 1960s. In this camera, {{in addition to the}} usual complement of three tubes for the red, green and blue images, a fourth tube was included to provide luminance (black and white) detail of a scene. With such a camera, a sharp black and white picture was always assured, as it was not necessary to combine signals from the three <b>colour</b> <b>tubes</b> to provide the luminance detail.|$|R
40|$|One {{basic concept}} for {{understanding}} colour phenomena {{is the concept}} of vision. Although vision seems to be quite a natural and simple thing, students are often not familiar with the mechanism behind perceiving objects or even “the colour of objects”. This contribution introduces a simple hands-on experiment, the <b>Colour</b> Vision <b>Tube.</b> The <b>Colour</b> Vision <b>Tube</b> facilitates the experience of seeing “coloured” objects illuminated with other than white light sources. These experiences support students in understanding the relevance of the illuminating light and the conception of selective reﬂection for colour vision...|$|R
50|$|At {{that time}} ITV had {{recently}} switched to colour transmissions, requiring the individual companies to invest heavily in new equipment. Early colour television studio cameras consisted of four tubes to relay the picture: three were receptive to colour (red, {{green and blue}} - the chrominance signal) with the fourth providing a high-resolution monochrome image (the luminance signal) which was still required as many viewers still watched on monochrome receivers. The final colour picture was created by combining the chrominance and luminance signals, but the technicians simply switched off the <b>colour</b> <b>tubes</b> whilst this dispute took place.|$|R

30|$|The <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> {{found in}} Krøyer’s {{painting}} cabinet were primarily from Danish colour merchants, {{with the majority}} from the colour manufacturer Vilhelm Pacht. Krøyer’s <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> had trade names typical for artists’ paints used {{during that period of}} time. In most cases the pigment(s) found in the tubes matched what would be expected based on the trade name. However, notable exceptions were found, such as the rare cadmium chromate pigment present in the <b>tube</b> <b>colour</b> “Cadmium lemon yellow” [21], as well as the “Green lake light” and “Red oxides” described above. This illustrates that it was not always obvious to artists what they bought from their colour merchant. The fact that some pigments were found in the paintings, but not in any of the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> in the painting cabinet and vice versa, emphasises that conclusions about an artist’s painting materials cannot be drawn based on access to the materials alone without including analyses of the paintings themselves.|$|R

30|$|Zinc white {{appears to}} have been an {{important}} part of Krøyer’s palette {{in the latter part of}} his career [4, 32]. In the analysed samples from the Drachmann portrait, zinc white was present in all paint layers where it was applied in mixtures with a wide variety of other pigments. Moreover the colour “Snow white” containing zinc white pigment was the only white <b>tube</b> <b>colour</b> present in the painting cabinet. A part from the pure white <b>tube</b> <b>colour,</b> zinc white was only identified in one other <b>tube</b> <b>colour,</b> this being “Jaune brilliant” where it was mixed with cadmium sulfide. It thus looks as if Krøyer himself intentionally blended zinc white into his colours on the palette in order to lighten the variant shades, as zinc white was present in all areas of the portrait of Drachmann.|$|R
30|$|Six <b>tube</b> <b>colours,</b> {{one from}} Vilhelm Pacht and five from Hermann Averhoff, were all {{labelled}} “Red oxide”. Despite having identical trade names and almost identical colours, the analysis showed a considerably {{variation in the}} contents of the tubes. Only one of the five <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> from Averhoff was found to contain hematite as the main pigment as expected by the trade name (Fig.  9 c). The remaining four all contained cadmium sulfide, and hence showed a discrepancy between trade name and contents. In addition all five <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> contained red lakes based on the identification of typical mordants Al, P, and Sn [28, 30, 31]. The “Red oxide” from Pacht likewise contained a mixture of cadmium sulfide and a red lake identified by Raman as alizarin (Fig.  9 d) and by HPLC as purpurin and alizarin (not shown).|$|R
50|$|In {{their most}} basic form, these meshes form {{structures}} like blocks or bridges, which allow the player traverse water, or access area otherwise inaccessible. These meshes, being hollow depictions of their intended structure, require genergy to become solid structures. As the player collects genergy, {{it can be}} used for this purpose. However, each mesh requires varying amounts of genergy in the correct colour to complete it. If the player lacks the required amount, as signified by a bar on the genergy <b>colour's</b> <b>tube</b> on the display, or stands too close to the mesh, the genergy will be returned to the player, and they will receive a notification, in the form of subtitles, that they require more of the corresponding colour, or are stood too close.

30|$|The {{analyses}} {{carried out}} on the samples from the two paintings and the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> have given an insight in the painting materials used by Krøyer {{in the latter part}} of his career, e.g. the pigments applied on his palette, and his favourite brand in <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> and colour merchants. In general Krøyer used the commercially produced artists’ materials that became available from colourmen during the nineteenth century. The canvases were bought ready grounded, either on the stretcher or by the metre, and the composition of the ground consisted of lead white, calcite and silicate. Krøyer’s palette consisted of both traditional pigments and modern ones developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, among these, several pigments containing chromium, cadmium and cobalt. In general the pigments found in Krøyer’s paintings and <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> were expensive reflecting that Krøyer was a well-established and wealthy artist, who did not have to choose the cheaper alternatives. A noticeable change in Krøyer’s palette seems to have taken place somewhere in between 1886 and 1903, where lead white was replaced with zinc white.|$|R
30|$|Some {{pigments}} like chromium {{yellow and}} cadmium chromate [21] were only {{found in the}} <b>tube</b> <b>colours.</b> It is uncertain to what extent Krøyer has actually used these pigments in his paintings. Further analyses of other paintings by the artist could possibly provide information with regard to this question. In contrast the pigments vermilion, minium and chromium orange were all identified in the Drachmann portrait, whereas they were not present {{in any of the}} <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> in the painting cabinet. This emphasises that conclusions about an artist’s painting materials cannot be drawn based on access to the materials alone without including analyses of the paintings themselves.|$|R

30|$|In {{relation}} to the stability of chromate pigments {{the analysis of the}} two <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> labelled “Chrome green light” and “Chrome green medium” should be noticed. The name “Chrome green” has typically been used for the mixture of chrome yellow and Prussian blue [20, 25], but in this case the tubes contained a mixture of viridian, zinc yellow, cadmium sulfide and barium sulfate. It seems very likely, that the manufacturer changed the composition of the colour in order to create an alternative to the traditional “Chrome green” based on more durable pigments. Similar examples have been reported by Townsend et al. [26]. In general durability seems to have been an important matter to Danish colour merchants in {{the end of the nineteenth}} century. The <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> from Vilhelm Pacht were ranked in the price lists (Table  2) as being either completely durable (HH), durable (H) or uncertain (without a letter).|$|R
30|$|Among the 32 <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> in Krøyer’s {{painting}} cabinet, 6 tubes contained lake pigments {{indicated by}} their trade names.

30|$|An {{investigation}} of price lists from Danish nineteenth century paint shops {{was carried out}} in the archives of the Royal Library of Denmark. Based on the archival information found on trade names and brands, {{it seems likely that the}} majority of the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> in Krøyer’s painting cabinet were bought in the last decade of the nineteenth century or later. The trade names on the <b>tube</b> <b>colours</b> were in most cases written on the label in both Danish and French. While some were rather simple and well-known names like “Cadmium yellow”, “Chromium yellow” and “Cobalt blue”, others like “Jaune Brilliant”, “Ivory black” and “Snow white” were more fanciful, but still common, examples of trade names used for artists’ colours in the nineteenth century [17 – 19]. Finally there were examples of trade names like “Green lake light”, “Red oxide”, and “Cadmium lemon yellow”, where the results showed no clear correlation between trade name and contents.|$|R
