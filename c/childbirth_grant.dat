30|$|This is {{especially}} true for the programs with moderate generosity when the benefits represent {{less than a quarter of}} household income, as in Ukraine (World Bank [2010]). The <b>childbirth</b> <b>grant</b> is probably the only prominent exception in terms of generosity, which seems remarkably high when compared to spending on other beneficiaries. In rare cases, it might indeed prevent people from moving, especially when taking into account the higher purchasing power in lagging and rural areas, but it is not likely to be the main reason against migration.|$|E
30|$|The recent {{trend of}} marrying {{later in life}} and the low {{fertility}} rate in Korea have led the Korean government to provide <b>childbirth</b> <b>grants</b> and Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) {{as a means of}} helping to raise the fertility rate. Among the various childbirth encouragement policies by the Korean government, this study focuses on the ECEC subsidies. Through the ECEC subsidy system, the government tries to decrease the expectation of child-rearing costs and promote greater childbirth rates. Using the combined Panel Study of Korean Children (PSKC) and Korea Longitudinal Study of Women and Families (KLoWF) data, this study has analyzed the relationship between childbirth and expected child-rearing costs. The method of kernel matching was used to combine and analyze the information on the age of women and intend of childbirths from the KLoWF and child care environment and the child-rearing costs from the PSKC.|$|R
30|$|In Korea, recent upward {{trends in}} age of {{marriage}} and downward trends in fertility rates have motivated the Korean government to provide <b>childbirth</b> <b>grants</b> and Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) subsidies. Through such provisions, the government hopes to lower parents’ concerns regarding child-rearing expenses and to promote higher birth rates. Using combined data from the Panel Study of Korean Children (PSKC) and the Korea Longitudinal Study of Women and Families (KLoWF), this study analyzes the relationship between birth rates and anticipated child-rearing expenses. The method of kernel matching was used to combine and analyze information on children from the KLoWF and the child care environment {{as well as on}} child-rearing expenses from the PSKC. The study’s findings suggest a significant but weak relationship between birth rates and the anticipated financial costs for raising a child. This relationship is more prominent in the low-education and low-income group than in economically well-situated and highly educated families. Based on the results, we suggest the following policy recommendations: firstly, further research needs to be conducted {{to determine the effects of}} governmental support on child-rearing. Secondly, customized support that considers family income and education should be provided to improve birth rates.|$|R
