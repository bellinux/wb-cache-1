25|$|MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more {{commonly}} referred to as MP3 (or mp3), is an audio <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> for digital audio. It uses a form of lossy data compression to encode data using inexact approximations and the partial discarding of data. This allows a large reduction in file size when compared to uncompressed audio, which is important for both transmission and storage concerns, while still retaining a comparable level of sound quality. Also designed as a streamable format, segments of a transmission can be lost without affecting the ability to decode later segments.|$|E
2500|$|The Ogg Vorbis project {{started in}} 1993. It was {{originally}} named [...] "Squish" [...] but that name was already trademarked, so the project underwent a name change. The new name, [...] "OggSquish", was used until 2001 {{when it was}} changed again to [...] "Ogg". Ogg has since come {{to refer to the}} container format, which is now part of the larger Xiph.org multimedia project. Today, [...] "Squish" [...] (now known as [...] "Vorbis") refers to a particular audio <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> typically used with the Ogg container format.|$|E

50|$|Consumer {{video is}} {{generally}} compressed using lossy video codecs, since {{that results in}} significantly smaller files than lossless compression. While there are video <b>coding</b> <b>formats</b> designed explicitly for either lossy or lossless compression, some video <b>coding</b> <b>formats</b> such as Dirac and H.264 support both.|$|R
50|$|This {{distinction}} is not consistently reflected terminologically in the literature. The H.264 specification calls H.261, H.262, H.263, and H.264 video coding standards {{and does not}} contain the word codec. The Alliance for Open Media clearly distinguishes between the AV1 video <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> and the accompanying codec they are developing, but calls the video <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> itself a video codec specification. The VP9 specification calls the video <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> VP9 itself a codec.|$|E
50|$|A {{lossless}} audio <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> {{reduces the}} total data needed {{to represent a}} sound but can be de-coded to its original, uncompressed form. A lossy audio <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> additionally reduces the bit resolution of the sound on top of compression, which results in far less data {{at the cost of}} irretrievably lost information.|$|E
5000|$|An audio <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> (or {{sometimes}} {{audio compression}} format) is a content representation format for storage or transmission of digital audio (such as in digital television, digital radio and in {{audio and video}} files). Examples of audio coding formats include MP3, AAC, Vorbis, FLAC, and Opus. A specific software or hardware implementation capable of audio compression and decompression to/from a specific audio <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> is called an audio codec; {{an example of an}} audio codec is LAME, which is one of several different codecs which implements encoding and decoding audio in the MP3 audio <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> in software.|$|E
40|$|Static Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) {{analysis}} derives upper bounds for {{the execution}} times of programs. Such bounds are crucial when designing and verifying real-time systems. A key component in static WCET analysis is the flow analysis, which derives bounds {{on the number}} of times different code entities can be executed. Examples of flow information derived by a flow analysis are loop bounds and infeasible paths. Flow analysis can be performed on source code, intermediate code, or binary code: for the latter, there is a proliferation of instruction sets. Thus, flow analysis must deal with many <b>code</b> <b>formats.</b> However, the basic flow analysis techniques are {{more or less the same}} regardless of the <b>code</b> <b>format.</b> Thus, an interesting option is to define a common <b>code</b> <b>format</b> for flow analysis, which also allows for easy translation from the other formats. Flow analyses for this common format will then be portable, in principle supporting all types of <b>code</b> <b>formats</b> which can be translated to this format. Further, a common format simplifies the development of flow analyses, since only one specific <b>code</b> <b>format</b> needs to be targeted. This paper presents such a common <b>code</b> <b>format,</b> the ALF language (ARTIST 2 Language for WCET Flow Analysis) ...|$|R

50|$|A video <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> (or {{sometimes}} {{video compression}} format) is a content representation format for storage or transmission of digital video content (such as in a data file or bitstream). Examples of video coding formats include MPEG-2 Part 2, MPEG-4 Part 2, H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10), HEVC, Theora, RealVideo RV40, VP9, and AV1. A specific software or hardware implementation capable of video compression and/or decompression to/from a specific video <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> {{is called a}} video codec; {{an example of a}} video codec is Xvid, which is one of several different codecs which implements encoding and decoding videos in the MPEG-4 Part 2 video <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> in software.|$|E

50|$|An {{audio file}} format is a file format for storing digital audio {{data on a}} {{computer}} system. The bit layout of the audio data (excluding metadata) is called the audio <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> and can be uncompressed, or compressed to reduce the file size, often using lossy compression. The data can be a raw bitstream in an audio <b>coding</b> <b>format,</b> but it is usually embedded in a container format or an audio data format with defined storage layer.|$|E

50|$|In {{the near}} future, the main contenders {{for the next}} {{generation}} video <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> looks to be the heavily patented HEVC (H.265) and the aiming-to-be-freely-licensed AV1.|$|E
5000|$|Video content encoded using a {{particular}} video <b>coding</b> <b>format</b> is normally bundled with an audio stream (encoded using an audio <b>coding</b> <b>format)</b> inside a multimedia container format such as AVI, MP4, FLV, RealMedia, or Matroska. As such, the user normally doesn't have a H.264 file, but instead has a [...]mp4 video file, {{which is an}} MP4 container containing H.264-encoded video, normally alongside AAC-encoded audio. Multimedia container formats can contain any {{one of a number}} of different video coding formats; for example the MP4 container format can contain video in either the MPEG-2 Part 2 or the H.264 video <b>coding</b> <b>format,</b> among others. Another example is the initial specification for the file type WebM, which specified the container format (Matroska), but also exactly which video (VP8) and audio (Vorbis) compression format is used inside the Matroska container, even though the Matroska container format itself is capable of containing other video coding formats (VP9 video and Opus audio support was later added to the WebM specification).|$|E
