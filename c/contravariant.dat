25|$|In the {{language}} of differential geometry, the requirement that the components of a vector transform according to the same matrix of the coordinate transition is equivalent to defining a <b>contravariant</b> vector to be a tensor of <b>contravariant</b> rank one. Alternatively, a <b>contravariant</b> vector is defined to be a tangent vector, and the rules for transforming a <b>contravariant</b> vector follow from the chain rule.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{components}} of vectors are <b>contravariant</b> and those of covectors are covariant, the vectors themselves are {{often referred to as}} being <b>contravariant</b> and the covectors as covariant.|$|E
25|$|A presheaf on a {{topological space}} X is a <b>contravariant</b> functor from the {{category}} of open subsets to sets. By analogy we define an étale presheaf on a scheme X to be a <b>contravariant</b> functor from Et(X) to sets.|$|E
25|$|In {{category}} theory, {{there are}} covariant functors and <b>contravariant</b> functors. The assignment of the dual space to a vector space {{is a standard}} example of a <b>contravariant</b> functor. Some constructions of multilinear algebra are of 'mixed' variance, which prevents them from being functors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Contravariant</b> functors {{are also}} {{occasionally}} called cofunctors.|$|E
25|$|Note that <b>contravariant</b> functors {{reverse the}} {{direction}} of composition.|$|E
25|$|The <b>contravariant</b> functor Hom(-,Q) {{from the}} {{category}} of left R-modules to {{the category of}} abelian groups is exact.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the <b>contravariant</b> {{components}} of v {{can be obtained}} from the dot product of v with convariant basis vectors, viz.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{a system}} of n {{quantities}} v'i depending on the coordinates that transform in this way on passing from one coordinate system to another is called a <b>contravariant</b> vector.|$|E
25|$|The {{explanation}} in geometric {{terms is}} that a general tensor will have <b>contravariant</b> indices as well as covariant indices, because it has parts {{that live in the}} tangent bundle as well as the cotangent bundle.|$|E
25|$|The index-less {{transformation}} {{properties of}} a tensor are given by pullbacks for covariant indices, and pushforwards for <b>contravariant</b> indices. The article on covariant derivatives provides additional {{discussion of the}} correspondence between index-free notation and indexed notation.|$|E
25|$|Note that {{fixing the}} first {{argument}} of Hom naturally {{gives rise to}} a covariant functor and fixing the second argument naturally gives a <b>contravariant</b> functor. This is an artifact {{of the way in which}} one must compose the morphisms.|$|E
25|$|Einstein {{notation}} can {{be applied}} in slightly different ways. Typically, each index occurs once in an upper (superscript) {{and once in a}} lower (subscript) position in a term; however, the convention {{can be applied}} more generally to any repeated indices within a term. When dealing with covariant and <b>contravariant</b> vectors, where the position of an index also indicates the type of vector, the first case usually applies; a covariant vector can only be contracted with a <b>contravariant</b> vector, corresponding to summation of the products of coefficients. On the other hand, when there is a fixed coordinate basis (or when not considering coordinate vectors), one may choose to use only subscripts; see below.|$|E
25|$|Doing this constructions pointwise {{gives the}} tangent space, a {{covariant}} functor from {{the category of}} pointed differentiable manifolds to the category of real vector spaces. Likewise, cotangent space is a <b>contravariant</b> functor, essentially {{the composition of the}} tangent space with the dual space above.|$|E
25|$|In {{category}} theoretic terminology, J is a <b>contravariant</b> hom-functor J=Hom(—,2) {{that defines}} a duality of categories between, {{on the one}} hand, the category of finite partial orders and order-preserving maps, {{and on the other}} hand the category of finite distributive lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms.|$|E
25|$|Yoneda's lemma {{implies that}} every natural {{transformation}} between Hom functors is of this form. In other words, the Hom functors {{give rise to}} a full and faithful embedding of the category C into the functor category SetC'Op (covariant or <b>contravariant</b> depending on which Hom functor is used).|$|E
25|$|The {{idea behind}} the {{pullback}} is essentially the notion of precomposition of one function with another. However, by combining this idea in several different contexts, quite elaborate pullback operations can be constructed. This article begins with the simplest operations, then uses them to construct more sophisticated ones. Roughly speaking, the pullback mechanism (using precomposition) turns several constructions in differential geometry into <b>contravariant</b> functors.|$|E
25|$|The tensor bundle {{is not a}} {{differentiable}} manifold in {{the traditional}} sense, since it is infinite dimensional. It is however an algebra over the ring of scalar functions. Each tensor is characterized by its ranks, which indicate how many tangent and cotangent factors it has. Sometimes these ranks {{are referred to as}} covariant and <b>contravariant</b> ranks, signifying tangent and cotangent ranks, respectively.|$|E
25|$|When the map φ is a diffeomorphism, {{then the}} pullback, {{together}} with the pushforward, {{can be used to}} transform any tensor field from N to M or vice versa. In particular, if φ is a diffeomorphism between open subsets of Rn and Rn, viewed as a change of coordinates (perhaps between different charts on a manifold M), then the pullback and pushforward describe the transformation properties of covariant and <b>contravariant</b> tensors used in more traditional (coordinate dependent) approaches to the subject.|$|E
25|$|Any ring R can {{be viewed}} as a preadditive {{category}} with a single object. With this understanding, a left R-module is nothing but a (covariant) additive functor from R to the category Ab of abelian groups. Right R-modules are <b>contravariant</b> additive functors. This suggests that, if C is any preadditive category, a covariant additive functor from C to Ab should be considered a generalized left module over C; these functors form a functor category C-Mod which is the natural generalization of the module category R-Mod.|$|E
25|$|Objects in object {{oriented}} languages are usually accessed by a reference whose static target type (or manifest type) {{is equal to}} either the object's run-time type (its latent type) or a supertype thereof. This is conformant with the Liskov substitution principle, which states that all operations performed on an instance of a given type can also be performed on an instance of a subtype. This concept {{is also known as}} subsumption. In some languages subtypes may also possess covariant or <b>contravariant</b> return types and argument types respectively.|$|E
25|$|Every {{partially}} {{ordered set}} {{can be viewed as}} a category (with a single morphism from x to y if and only if x ≤ y). A pair of adjoint functors between two {{partially ordered set}}s is called a Galois connection (or, if it is <b>contravariant,</b> an antitone Galois connection). See that article for a number of examples: the case of Galois theory of course is a leading one. Any Galois connection gives rise to closure operators and to inverse order-preserving bijections between the corresponding closed elements.|$|E
25|$|<b>Contravariant</b> and {{covariant}} vectors are geometrically {{very different}} objects. The first {{can and should}} be thought of as arrows. A linear functional can be characterized by two objects: its kernel, which is a hyperplane passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus covariant vectors should viewed as a set of hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The mathematical term for a covariant vector is 1-covector or 1-form (though the latter is usually reserved for covector fields).|$|E
25|$|Some vectors {{transform}} like <b>contravariant</b> vectors, {{except that}} when they are reflected through a mirror, they flip and gain a minus sign. A transformation that switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does is said to change the orientation of space. A vector which gains a minus sign when the orientation of space changes is called a pseudovector or an axial vector. Ordinary vectors are sometimes called true vectors or polar vectors to distinguish them from pseudovectors. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as the cross product of two ordinary vectors.|$|E
25|$|This {{association}} is a duality {{in the sense}} that there is a natural isomorphism between the double dual Avv and A (defined via the Poincaré bundle) and that it is <b>contravariant</b> functorial, i.e. it associates to all morphisms f: A → B dual morphisms fv: Bv → Av in a compatible way. The n-torsion of an abelian variety and the n-torsion of its dual are dual to each other when n is coprime to the characteristic of the base. In general - for all n - the n-torsion group schemes of dual abelian varieties are Cartier duals of each other. This generalises the Weil pairing for elliptic curves.|$|E

2500|$|Ordinary functors {{are also}} called {{covariant}} functors {{in order to}} distinguish them from <b>contravariant</b> ones. Note that one can also define a <b>contravariant</b> functor as a covariant functor on the opposite category [...] Some authors prefer to write all expressions covariantly. That is, instead of saying [...] is a <b>contravariant</b> functor, they simply write [...] (or sometimes [...] ) {{and call it a}} functor.|$|E
2500|$|In tensor analysis, a {{covariant}} vector varies {{more or less}} reciprocally to {{a corresponding}} <b>contravariant</b> vector. [...] Expressions for lengths, areas and volumes of objects in the vector space can then be given in terms of tensors with covariant and <b>contravariant</b> indices. Under simple expansions and contractions of the coordinates, the reciprocity is exact; under affine transformations the components of a vector intermingle on going between covariant and <b>contravariant</b> expression.|$|E
2500|$|The terms {{covariant}} and <b>contravariant</b> {{were introduced}} by James Joseph Sylvester in 1853 {{in the context}} of algebraic invariant theory, where, for instance, a system of simultaneous equations is <b>contravariant</b> in the variables. [...] In the lexicon of category theory, covariance and contravariance are properties of functors; unfortunately, it is the lower-index objects (covectors) that generically have pullbacks, which are <b>contravariant,</b> while the upper-index objects (vectors) instead have pushforwards, which are covariant. [...] This terminological conflict may be avoided by calling <b>contravariant</b> functors [...] "cofunctors"—in accord with the [...] "covector" [...] terminology, and continuing the tradition of treating vectors as the concept and covectors as the coconcept.|$|E
2500|$|The {{indices of}} {{covariant}} coordinates, vectors, and tensors are subscripts. [...] If the <b>contravariant</b> basis vectors are orthonormal {{then they are}} equivalent to the covariant basis vectors, {{so there is no}} need to distinguish between the covariant and <b>contravariant</b> coordinates.|$|E
