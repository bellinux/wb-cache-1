5|$|St. Leger's {{artillery}} {{was held}} up by a tactic that was also used to slow down Burgoyne's army {{after the fall of}} Ticonderoga: Gansevoort and his men had systematically felled trees across the wooded track the expedition <b>came</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> St. Leger needed to clear the track to make way for his artillery. This work occupied all but 250 of St. Leger's white men, with the actual encirclement of the fort dominated by Indians.|$|E
5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode. De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder. Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met. In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged outside into the streets and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed {{during the course of the}} afternoon by the crowd. The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match was}} between The Giant and Lex Luger. The match began with Luger {{delivering}} punches, and The Giant pushing off Luger. The Giant dominated Luger after performing a clothesline. Luger fought back with kicks after The Giant missed a body avalanche. The Giant continued to attack, but missed a dropkick. Luger performed clotheslines, a hangman's neckbreaker and a scoop slam. Luger then applied the Torture Rack, but Syxx <b>came</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> performed a spin kick to Luger. Sting <b>came</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> left {{a baseball bat}} in the ring. Luger performed a low blow to The Giant, and pinned him after several attacks with the bat to win the match.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the mainstream views, the Hindu revivalist movements denied an external origin to Aryans. Dayananda Saraswati, {{the founder of the}} Arya Samaj (Society of Aryans), held that Vedas were the source of all knowledge that were revealed to the Aryans. The first man (an Aryan) was created in Tibet and, after living there for some time, the Aryans <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> inhabited India, which was devoid of any people earlier.|$|E

25|$|Trade {{from the}} Allegheny Mountains region began with Jamestown, Virginia.

After the match, Skipper and Storm beat down Duggan until The Cat fought them off.|$|E

25|$|On 10 July, Sir William Waller took post on Roundway Down, {{overlooking}} Devizes, {{and captured}} a Royalist ammunition column from Oxford.

But although {{the siege of}} Devizes was pressed with such vigour that an assault was fixed for the evening of 13 July, the Cornishmen, Hopton directing the defence from his bed, held out stubbornly. On the afternoon of 13 July, Prince Maurice's horsemen appeared on Roundway Down, having ridden to Oxford, picked up reinforcements there, and returned at full speed to save their comrades.|$|E

25|$|In {{the main}} event, Goldberg defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Kane and Triple H in a Triple Threat match. The match was evenly {{divided between the}} three, as every man was able to gain the advantage. Kane {{performed}} a Chokeslam onto the broadcast table on Goldberg and Triple H put Goldberg through the broadcast table with an elbow drop off the barricade. In the end, Goldberg performed a spear on Triple H and attempted to get the pinfall, but Kane broke up the attempt and chokeslammed Goldberg after Triple H low blowed the latter. Batista <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pulled Kane out of the ring, which allowed Triple H to pin Goldberg to win the title.|$|E

25|$|In Maryland, the Maryland Transit Administration ran special snow trains on {{its heavy}} rail and light rail lines to keep tracks clear. Delaware Gov. Jack Markell {{declared}} a state of emergency Friday night and ordered all vehicles off the roads by 10p.m. EST (this was in addition to an earlier state of emergency declared by Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and snow emergencies declared in the District of Columbia and some Maryland counties). Maryland was under a state of emergency as of mid-day on February 6, as state and county road crews said they were struggling to keep even one lane open on major roads and 151,000 customers were without power in Maryland, including 34,000 Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. customers in the region. Cars were left abandoned on highways, trees <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> Humvees were used to ferry patients to local hospitals. The United States Postal Service decided to cancel mail delivery and collection in the affected areas for Saturday, February 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of inexpensive {{digital signal processing}} electronics in the late 1970s and 1980s {{led to the development}} of the first digital delay effects. Initially, they were only available in expensive rack-mounted units but eventually as costs <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the electronics grew smaller, they became available in the form of foot pedals. The first digital delay offered in a pedal was the Boss DD-2 in 1984. Rack-mounted delay units evolved into digital reverb units and on to digital multi-effects units capable of more sophisticated effects than pure delay, such as reverb and Audio timescale-pitch modification effects. Digital delay systems function by sampling the input signal through an analog-to-digital converter, after which the signal is passed through a series of digital signal processors that record it into a storage buffer, and then play back the stored audio based on parameters set by the user. The delayed ("wet") output may be mixed with the unmodified ("dry") signal after, or before, it is sent to a digital-to-analog converter for output.|$|E
25|$|Western Europe {{launched}} {{a process of}} political and economic integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the European Coal and Steel Community, which grew and evolved into the European Union, and the Council of Europe. The Solidarność movement in the 1980s weakened the Communist government in Poland. At the time the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev initiated perestroika and glasnost, which weakened Soviet influence in Europe, particularly in the USSR. In 1989 the Berlin Wall <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany, after making large cash payments to the USSR. In 1991 the Communist Party in Moscow collapsed, ending the USSR, which split into fifteen independent states. The largest, Russia, took the Soviet Union's seat on the United Nations Security Council. The most violent dissolution happened in Yugoslavia, in the Balkans. Four (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia) out of six Yugoslav republics declared independence and for most of them a violent war ensued, in some parts lasting until 1995. In 2006 Montenegro seceded and became an independent state. In the post–Cold War era, NATO and the EU have been gradually admitting most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
