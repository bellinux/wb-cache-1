5|$|A {{day after}} {{the arrival of the}} paras, Director Special Forces (DSF), Brigadier John Holmes, arrived in Freetown with a {{headquarters}} staff which included the commanding officer of 22 SAS and the officer commanding D Squadron, as well as three personnel from the Royal Air Force's Tactical Communications Wing. Holmes based himself at Seaview House, the British military headquarters in Freetown, near the British High Commission. From there, his staff established contact with the SAS observation teams on either side of Rokel Creek and with COBRA, the British government's emergency committee in London. The DSF, who usually attends COBRA meetings during crises which may require the use of special forces, was represented by his <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> by Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins, operations officer at Headquarters Special Forces.|$|E
5|$|At 2045 hrs, {{another person}} on {{duty in the}} control tower {{received}} a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when it suddenly vanished, {{as though it had}} landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages were sent to the National Military Command Center, the Air Force <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff,</b> <b>and</b> Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kikunori Kijima—Gotō's <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> {{commander}} of the bombardment force during the return trip to the Shortland Islands after Gotō's death in battle—claimed that his force had sunk two American cruisers and one destroyer. Furutakas captain—who survived the sinking of his ship—blamed {{the loss of his}} cruiser on bad air reconnaissance and poor leadership from the 8th fleet staff under Admiral Mikawa. Although Gotō's bombardment mission failed, Jojima's reinforcement convoy was successful in delivering the crucial men and equipment to Guadalcanal. Aoba journeyed to Kure, Japan, for repairs that were completed on February 15, 1943. Kinugasa was sunk one month later during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the general}} {{capitulation}} of TSAM, {{the remnants of}} the 19th Mechanized Division surrendered to the Germans at Serres in the afternoon of 10 April, while {{the remnants of the}} Krousia Detachment did so near Thessaloniki. The division's commander, <b>chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> <b>and</b> a few other officers chose instead to withdraw to the area of Chalkidiki. Apart from sending detachments, 191st Regiment did not participate en masse in battle. As soon as news came of the fall of Thessaloniki, the regiment moved to Stavros, where it disintegrated, with its men dispersing across Chalkidiki. This signalled the end of the division and its major sub-units as coherent fighting forces.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, the War Cabinet {{decided to}} form a second AIF division, the 7th Division, and group the 6th and 7th Divisions {{together}} as I Corps, with Blamey as its commander.

5|$|Schwarzkopf {{returned}} to the United States after the Gulf War as a national hero, {{and his ability to}} effectively deal with the press left him a positive image. Schwarzkopf indicated a desire to retire from the military in mid-1991. He was initially considered for promotion alternatively to General of the Army or to Army <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff,</b> <b>and</b> was ultimately asked to assume the latter post, but he declined. He was later questioned about running for political office, but, considering himself an independent, expressed little interest in doing so. Schwarzkopf was not vocal about his political opinions during his military career. He retired from the military in August 1991, moving to Tampa, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Vespasian moved {{rapidly to}} Egypt, leaving the Jewish war {{under the command}} of Titus.

By April 70, Jerusalem was under siege by four legions, and even after the city walls were overcome, the defenders held out in the Temple. Alexander, the offspring of a pious Jewish family, whose own father had donated the gold and silver for the Temple gates, now found himself in a position of command against his former brothers in that very sanctuary.|$|E

During this time, in which New Zealand's military affairs were dominated by the country's involvement in the Korean War, Thornton began to demonstrate the diplomatic skills that would prove useful during his later career.|$|E
