If making a larger quantity always have {{five times as much}} plain flour as rice flour to keep the batter together. Pour a quarter cup of batter and pour into a pan with oil. Several pancakes may be cooked at any given time, but each piece must be submerged under the oil in order to cook properly. <b>Cook</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> ten minutes and then let it cool for two minutes for an ideal flavor.|$|E

Once it comes to a boil, one egg per serving is cracked into the pot without {{breaking}} the yolk, and allowed to <b>cook</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> a minute while covered. The soup is served in a bowl, garnished with scallions, which may be fried beforehand but usually are not, curly cilantro, and a piece of stale bread called [...] "calado" [...] which softens in the changua.

25|$|The {{process begins}} by {{harvesting}} the plants, which can weigh 40kg each, extracting the piña, or heart, by {{cutting off the}} plant's leaves and roots. The piñas are then <b>cooked</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> three days, often in pit ovens, which are earthen mounds over pits of hot rocks. This underground roasting gives mezcal its intense and distinctive smoky flavor. They are then crushed and mashed (traditionally by a stone wheel turned by a horse) and then left to ferment in large vats or barrels with water added.|$|R
50|$|Deep-frying {{requires}} a cooking oil {{with a high}} smoke point such as canola oil, peanut oil, safflower oil or a blend. Cooking time is about four minutes per pound (or about 7 minutes per kilo) of turkey, so a 15-pound turkey needs to be <b>cooked</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> one hour in 350 °F (175 °C) oil. Oil can be recovered, stored, and reused several times before it becomes rancid or contaminated. Storage life can be extended by filtering used oil and keeping it cool. A generous rub of salt and pepper {{may be used to}} increase flavor. The turkey can also be seasoned with an injectable marinade. Fried turkeys cannot be stuffed, nor do they provide drippings or broth for gravy.|$|R
50|$|The {{preparation}} of kuzhambu vary greatly {{with the type}} of kuzhambu to be made, but its basic preparation methods include first frying curry leaves, mustard seeds, and dry chili pepper over vegetable oil on a heated stove.

50|$|Soak the ham in four cups {{of water}} for about three hours to {{dissolve}} some of the salt. Discard the water. Par-boil both the smoked ham and the fresh ham shank in a stockpot with five {{cups of water}} on medium heat. Skim off any scum forming {{on top of the}} liquid. <b>Cook</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 20 minutes. Remove the meat and put in a large Chinese clay pot. Strain the liquid from par-boiling through a fine sieve and pour into the clay pot. Or you can discard the liquid and use fresh water instead.Peel off the tough outer leaves from the bamboo shoots. The simplest way to accomplish this is to cut the shoot lengthwise into halves and then remove the leaves. Par-boil the bamboo shoots in a stockpot with about four cups of water over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Drain the shoots and let cool. Slice the shoots very thinly crosswise when cool. Put the bamboo shoot slices into the clay pot.|$|E
5|$|The {{stock is}} {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually <b>cooked</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.|$|R

50|$|Once {{an ideal}} cooking heat is reached on the disk (usually medium to low heat works best) the first meat to be {{introduced}} is the bacon. This is placed {{at the center of}} the concave disk where the heat is concentrated. The natural fat from the bacon will prevent the meats from sticking. Beer or dark cola is added to create a broth for simmering the meats which also acts as a non stick agent. The bacon is placed away from direct heat onto the side of the disk once its cooked, and the sausage links are introduced to the remaining broth. As each piece of meat is removed from the direct heat, the meat's natural juices and the beer or cola create a broth for the next meat piece {{to be introduced}} to. Once cooked, the sausage is also set aside and the ham is added. The ham is set aside, and the chorizo is added next. The beef as well as the cook's choice of seasoning is finally added to the collective broth. Each meat is <b>cooked</b> <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 10 to 15 minutes. The beef is covered with a lid during the cooking process to contain its natural flavor and juices. The lid is then removed to allow the broth to reduce, and the meats can now be combined with the beef and the collective broth from the different meats. The onions, peppers, and tomatoes are chopped and added to the mix providing the dish with color and the meats with flavor.|$|R
