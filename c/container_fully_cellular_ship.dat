25|$|In 1958, {{the company}} began {{investigating}} the possibility of containerization, and sent research teams into 28 major ports. Following their reports, Davies began integrating containers into the company's business. By 1961, the company had begun launching ships capable of container transport, the first two of these being the combination break-bulk - container vessels SS President Tyler and SS President Lincoln. Ports also began adapting to the new container-based system, although many potential customers were still wary. By {{the end of the}} decade, the company was still launching combination <b>ships</b> rather than <b>fully</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> as already employed by several U.S., British, European and Japanese lines, yet by 1969, 23% of the company's business moved via container.|$|R
50|$|In 1964-1965 Mooremack placed its Constellation Class freight liners in service, the Mormacargo, Mormaclynx, Mormacvega, Mormacdraco, Mormacaltair and Mormacrigel. The fast, {{state of}} the art vessels {{completed}} Mooremack's modernization program begun in 1956. On 11 February 1966 the Mormacaltair set sail from New York for Europe, establishing the first regularly scheduled transatlantic container service. Within weeks Mooremack was joined by United States Lines and Sea-Land Service, but Mooremack failed to exploit its first-off-the-mark lead and make the investment in <b>fully</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> necessary to realize the maximum efficiencies and cost savings that containerization promised. Left behind by U.S., British and European ship lines and container line consortia, Mooremack abandoned the North Atlantic trade in 1970 to concentrate on its cargo routes to South America and Africa, and sold four brand new combination break-bulk, container, roll-on/roll-off ships to American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines to offset losses. The idled 1958 liners Argentina and Brasil were sold to Holland America Line in 1972.|$|R
50|$|J. Peter Grace, Jr. {{took over}} {{management}} of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into <b>fully</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships.</b> However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964. In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous {{systems are}} used to secure {{containers}} aboard ships, depending on {{factors such as the}} type of ship, the type of container, and the location of the container. [...] Stowage inside the holds of <b>fully</b> <b>cellular</b> (FC) <b>ships</b> is simplest, typically using simple metal forms called container guides, locating cones, and anti-rack spacers to lock the containers together. [...] Above-decks, without the extra support of the cell guides, more complicated equipment is used. [...] Three types of systems are currently in wide use: lashing systems, locking systems, and buttress systems. [...] Lashing systems secure containers to the ship using devices made from wire rope, rigid rods, or chains and devices to tension the lashings, such as turnbuckles. [...] The effectiveness of lashings is increased by securing containers to each other, either by simple metal forms (such as stacking cones) or more complicated devices such as twist-lock stackers. [...] A typical twist-lock is inserted into the casting hole of one container and rotated to hold it in place, then another container is lowered on top of it. [...] The two containers are locked together by twisting the device's handle. [...] A typical twist-lock is constructed of forged steel and ductile iron and has a shear strength of 48 metric tons.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{containerization}} revolution in 1950 's, not only the TEU capacity of the vessels has been increasing constantly, but also the number of <b>fully</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> <b>ships</b> has expanded substantially. Because of the tense competition among ports in recent years, improving the operational efficiency of ports has become an important issue in containership operations. Arrangement of containers both within the container terminal and on the containership {{play an important role in}} determining the berthing time. The berthing time of a containership is mainly composed of the unloading and loading time of containers. Containers in a containership are stored in stacks, making a container directly accessible only if it is on the top of one stack. The task of determining a good container arrangement to minimize the number of re-handlings while maintaining the ship's stability over several ports is called stowage planning, which is an everyday problem solved by ship planners. The horizontal distribution of the containers over the bays affects crane utilization and overall ship berthing time. In order to increase the terminal productivity and reduce the turnaround time, the stowage planning must conform to the berth design. Given the configuration of berths and cranes at each visiting port, the stowage planning must take into account the utilization of quay cranes as well as the reduction of unnecessary shifts to minimize the total time at all ports over the voyage. This dissertation introduces an optimization model to solve the stowage planning problem with crane utilization considerations. The optimization model covers a wide range of operational and structural constraints for containership load planning. In order to solve real-size problems, a meta-heuristic approach based on genetic algorithms is designed and implemented which embeds a crane split approximation routine. The genetic encoding is ultra-compact and represents grouping, sorting and assignment strategies that might be applied to form the stowage pattern. The evaluation procedure accounts for technical specification of the cranes as well as the crane split. Numerical results show that timely solution for ultra large size containerships can be obtained under different scenarios...|$|R
