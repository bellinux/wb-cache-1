50|$|Estrobin, {{also known}} as α,α-di(p-ethoxyphenyl)-β-phenylbromoethylene and {{commonly}} abbreviated as DBE, is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen of the triphenylethylene group that was never marketed. <b>Chlorotrianisene,</b> and subsequently clomifene and tamoxifen, were derived from it. Estrobin, similarly to other triphenylethylenes, is very lipophilic and hence very long-lasting in its duration of action. Similarly to <b>chlorotrianisene,</b> estrobin behaves a prodrug to a much more potent estrogen in the body.|$|E

Other stilbestrol estrogens that have been used clinically include benzestrol, dienestrol, dienestrol acetate, diethylstilbestrol dipropionate, fosfestrol, hexestrol, and methestrol dipropionate. <b>Chlorotrianisene,</b> methallenestril, and doisynoestrol are nonsteroidal estrogens structurally distinct from the stilbestrols that have also been used clinically.|$|E
50|$|Estrogens {{closely related}} to the stilbestrols include {{paroxypropione}} (a metabolite of diethylstilbestrol) and the anise and fennel-derived compounds anol, dianol, anethole, dianethole, and photoanethole (from which the stilbestrol estrogens were actually originally derived). The triphenylethylene group of estrogenic drugs that includes triphenylethylene itself, estrobin, <b>chlorotrianisene,</b> broparestrol, ethamoxytriphetol, clomifene, tamoxifen, and more recently developed derivatives is also very closely related structurally to the stilbestrols.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorotrianisene</b> (INN, USAN, BAN; {{brand names}} Tace, Estregur, Anisene, Clorotrisin, Merbentyl, Triagen, many others; {{also known as}} CTA; tri-p-anisylchloroethylene, TACE, or tris(p-methoxyphenyl)chloroethylene) is a synthetic, nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} of the triphenylethylene group that was formerly used {{for the treatment of}} menopausal symptoms, estrogen deficiency, and prostate cancer before being discontinued. It was approved in the United States as TACE in 1952, and was introduced throughout Europe subsequently. CTA was the first estrogenic compound of the triphenylethylene series to be introduced.|$|E
5000|$|Estrogen {{is known}} to lower {{cholesterol}} levels, but produces side effects like gynecomastia and decreased libido in men. It was hoped that a drug could be developed that lacked overt estrogenic effects but still lowered cholesterol levels. Triparanol is a triphenylethanol and was derived from <b>chlorotrianisene</b> (TACE), a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene estrogen, and the nonsteroidal triphenylethanol antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is a derivative of triparanol. The selective estrogen receptor modulator clomifene is also structurally related to triparanol. The developers of triparanol jokingly {{referred to it as}} a [...] "non-estrogenic estrogen".|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorotrianisene,</b> or tri-p-anisylchloroethylene (TACE), is {{a potent}} marketed {{estrogen}} and a derivative of triphenylchloroethylene in which {{each of the three}} phenyl rings has been substituted with a 4-methoxy group. Estrobin, or DBE, is a related, never-marketed estrogen {{in which there is a}} bromine in place of the chlorine and two of the three phenyl rings have ethoxy groups. Broparestrol, or BDPE is a marketed selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has a bromine in place of the chlorine of triphenylchloroethylene and an 4-ethyl group on one of the phenyl rings. The SERM clomifene is also a derivative of triphenylchloroethylene.|$|E
50|$|TPE is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of nonsteroidal estrogen receptor ligands. It includes the estrogens <b>chlorotrianisene,</b> estrobin (DBE), triphenylbromoethylene, triphenylchloroethylene, triphenyliodoethylene, triphenylmethylethylene; the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) afimoxifene, brilanestrant, broparestrol, clomifene, clomifenoxide, droloxifene, endoxifen, etacstil, fispemifene, idoxifene, miproxifene, miproxifene phosphate, nafoxidine, ospemifene, panomifene, and toremifene. The antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is also closely related, but is technically not a derivative of TPE and is instead a triphenylethanol derivative. The tamoxifen metabolite and aromatase inhibitor norendoxifen is also a TPE derivative. In addition to their estrogenic activity, various TPE derivatives like tamoxifen and clomifene have been found to act as protein kinase C inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|Although it is {{referred}} to as a weak estrogen and was used solely as an estrogen in clinical practice, CTA is a partial agonist of the estrogen receptor. As such, it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), with predominantly estrogenic but also antiestrogenic effects, and was arguably the first SERM to ever be introduced. CTA can antagonize estradiol {{at the level of the}} hypothalamus, resulting in disinhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and an increase in estrogen levels. Clomifene and tamoxifen were both derived from CTA via structural modification, and are much weaker partial agonists than CTA and hence much more antiestrogenic in comparison. As an example, <b>chlorotrianisene</b> produces gynecomastia in men, albeit reportedly to a lesser extent than other estrogens, while clomifene and tamoxifen do not and can be used to treat gynecomastia.|$|E
50|$|SERMs are {{competitive}} partial agonists of the ER. Different tissues {{have different}} degrees of sensitivity to and activity of endogenous estrogens, so SERMs produce estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects depending on the specific tissue in question {{as well as the}} percentage of intrinsic activity (IA) of the SERM. An example of a SERM with high IA and thus mostly estrogenic effects is <b>chlorotrianisene,</b> while an example of a SERM with low IA and thus mostly antiestrogenic effects is ethamoxytriphetol. SERMs like clomifene and tamoxifen are more in the middle in their IA and their balance of estrogenic and antiestrogenic actions in comparison. Raloxifene is a SERM that is more antiestrogenic than tamoxifen; both are estrogenic in bone, but raloxifene is antiestrogenic in the uterus while tamoxifen is estrogenic in this location.|$|E
50|$|MER-25, {{a simple}} triphenylethanol derivative, {{is closely related}} {{structurally}} to the triphenylethylene (TPE) group of SERMs, which includes clomifene and tamoxifen. The drug, a derivative of the cholesterol-lowering agent triparanol (MER-29) (which itself {{was derived from the}} estrogen <b>chlorotrianisene</b> (also known as TACE)), was originally being studied in animals at Merrell Dow as a treatment for coronary artery disease. Its antiestrogen properties were discovered serendipitously when a young research endocrinologist at the company named Leonard Lerner, who was employed to study nonsteroidal estrogen pharmacology, noted the structural similarity of MER-25 to estrogenic TPE derivatives and decided to test it for estrogenicity, only to find that it blocked the effects of estrogen instead. Lerner subsequently went on {{to be involved in the}} discovery of clomifene, the first considerably antiestrogenic TPE derivative to be characterized. The structure of clomifene is similar to that of its predecessor, MER-25.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 154 {{patients}} with {{carcinoma of the}} prostate received estrogen therapy with diethylstillbestrol (DES), <b>chlorotrianisene</b> or ethinyl estradiol. During a mean follow-up period of 26 months the incidence of complications [...] thromboembolic episodes, fluid retention and gynecomastia [...] was recorded. Although the incidence of cardiovascular complications was significantly higher in the DES group, the differences in mortality between the groups were not significant. The differences in incidence of fluid retention and gynecomastia also lacked significance.

40|$|<b>Chlorotrianisene</b> is a {{therapeutic}} estrogen and contaminant of the pesticide methoxychior. Incubation of (3 H]chlorotrianisene with rat liver microsomes, supplemented with NADPH, yielded covalent bind-ing of radiolabeled metabolite(s) to microsomal components. This binding was dramatically stimulated when microsomes from meth-ylcholanthrene-treated rats were used. However, microsomes from phenobarbital-treated animals did not enhance binding. Analysis of solubilized microsomes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed radiolabeled bands in the 45 - to 66 -kDa range. Furthermore, these bands were sensitive to protease degra-dation, {{indicating that the}} recipient macromolecules were proteins and possibly cytochrome P- 450 (s). Selective inhibition of binding to microsomes prepared from control, phenobarbital-, and methyichol-anthrene-treated rats by inhibitors of monooxygenase activity [8 -diethylaminoethyl dlphenylpropylacetate (SKF- 525 A) and metyra...|$|E
40|$|Coagulation {{changes and}} {{increased}} risk of thromboembolic disease may occur in association with estrogen administration. The puerperium is also a high-risk period for thromboembolism, and estrogen administration at this time may increase this risk. Patients with congenital deficiency of antithrombin III have recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, suggesting that low levels of this factor {{may be associated with}} 2 ̆ 2 hypercoagulability 2 ̆ 2 states. We studied 50 postpartum patients who received <b>chlorotrianisene</b> (Tace) or placebo for lactation suppression in a prospective, double-blind, randomized fashion. Antithrombin III values were significantly lower on the third day post partum in the treated group compared to the placebo group (p less than 0. 05). In addition, our clinical data from a total of 99 patients support the previous evidence that estrogens delay rather than prevent breast engorgement. Thus, with questionable benefit and a possible increased thromboembolic risk, it would appear prudent to discontinue the practice of estrogen administration for lactation suppression...|$|E
