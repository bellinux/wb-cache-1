It covered {{questions}} such as satisfaction with water reliability, water pressure, water quality, timely and accurate water bills, responsiveness in resolving complaints, responsiveness in effecting new connections, customer care, and the convenience of the bill payment process. Out of 5,319 customers contacted in a stratisfied sample, 2,731 responded. Customer care received the highest rating, while water quality and pressure received lower, but overall good, ratings. A customer satisfaction index was calculated across all questions, showing that 85 percent of customers were satisfied, up from 83 percent during the last survey. Satisfaction was highest in Hoima, Iganda, and Masindi at 95 percent and lowest in the central Ugandan town of Mubende, where no customer care officer or desk existed, at 62 percent. In Kampala, satisfaction was 83 percent. Customers appreciated the ambiance in local offices, that phone calls are made to remind customers of payment, that customers can settle their arrears through payment plans in exceptional cases, and that water cuts are announced through the radio. Customers complained about low water pressure, muddy water during the wet season, supply interruptions during the dry season, low water pressure, slow implementation of new connections, erratic bills, disconnection despite having paid their water bills, and the rudeness of field staff.|$|E

50|$|One {{may also}} suggest that using <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>surveys</b> {{as a means of}} {{determining}} reliability is flawed.

2500|$|Drinking {{water quality}} in Jordan {{is governed by}} Jordanian Standard 286 of 2008, {{which is based on}} the World Health Organization {{drinking}} water guidelines. Jordan's standards were modified in 2008 and previously in 2001, after a major drinking water pollution outbreak occurred in Amman in the summer of 1998 due to a malfunction of the capital’s major drinking water treatment plant. In 2001, specific measures to be undertaken in case of the occurrence of pollution in drinking water samples were included in the procedures {{that are part of the}} standard. A 2005 study of different potable water sources in four governorates showed that drinking water quality was in compliance with national physiochemical standards. For the purpose of monitoring groundwater quality, a network of observation wells is installed in each of the “groundwater basins”. At the household level water is stored in water tanks (usually on top of the buildings) to be used until the next turn of water supply. In a 2011 study by the Jordanian Government, more than 90% of samples taken at house water storage tanks in three Amman distribution zones (Rasheed, Kharabsheh and Khalda) had chlorine residual levels between 0.2mg/l and 0.5mg/l. These values are in compliance with the recommendations of the WHO Drinking Water Guidelines. According to the WHO, the water can thus be classified as [...] "safe to drink". Despite these results, a 2012 Jordan Times article reported that “ <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>survey</b> carried out by the Jordan Water Company (Miyahuna) showed that customers avoid drinking tap water, fearing it is contaminated”.|$|E

Many researchers consider the customer's point of view as the most relevant for evaluating transit service quality, being the customers the real users of the service. For this reason, service quality has been generally evaluated based on customer perceptions and expectations about the service, collected through the well-known <b>Customer</b> <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>Surveys.</b> In this work, just the issue of measuring service quality by analysing users’ opinions is approached. Specifically, data from <b>Customer</b> <b>Satisfaction</b> <b>Surveys</b> conducted by the Transport Consortium of Granada (Spain) over the years (from 2006 to 2012) are analysed, and the main changes produced in transit service over time are monitored by different ways, identifying deteriorating conditions and highlighting improvements in service in response to service intervention aspects...|$|R
