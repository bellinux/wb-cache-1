25|$|In the US, {{the long}} <b>curing</b> <b>time</b> {{of at least}} a month for Rosendale cement made it unpopular after World War One in the {{construction}} of highways and bridges and many states and construction firms turned to the use of Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement, {{by the end of the}} 1920s of the 15 Rosendale cement companies, only one had survived. But in the early 1930s it was discovered that, while Portland cement had a faster setting time it was not as durable, especially for highways, to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had worked on the construction of the New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements which had the good attributes of both: it was highly durable and had a much faster setting time. Mr. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near New Paltz, New York, using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement. It was proved a success and for decades the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend became common use in highway and bridge construction.|$|E

50|$|Adhesive bonding, which {{involves}} a chemical process where a substance {{is used to}} create a bond between two materials, is problematic because of extensive surface preparation, long <b>curing</b> <b>time,</b> the difficulty of bonding adhesive materials to plastics, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{substrates}} {{with the}} intermediate layer are pressed together with subsequent curing {{results in a}} bond. The post-bake process is applied at 180 to 320 °C for 30 to 240 min usually in a specific atmosphere or vacuum in the bond chamber. This is necessary to hard-cure the BCB. The vacuum prevents air trapped in the bond interface and pumps out the gases of the out-gassing residual solvents during annealing. The temperature and the <b>curing</b> <b>time</b> are variable, so with a higher temperature <b>curing</b> <b>time</b> can be reduced based on a quicker cross-linking. The final bonding layer thickness depends on {{the thickness of the}} cured BCB, the spinning speed and the shrink rate.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to elucidate the influence of curing on different physical properties of Eudragit® NE and RS coating systems. Increased <b>curing</b> <b>times</b> resulted in decreased drug release rates from Eudragit® NE-coated beads. However, an increase in drug release rates was noticed at longer <b>curing</b> <b>times</b> and higher temperatures for the Eudragit® RS coating system. The surface morphological changes of the film-coated beads revealed that there were no visible macroscopic changes as a result of curing. The absence of any ibuprofen melting peak in the DSC thermograms of cured NE and RS coated beads confirmed that there was no surface crystallization of ibuprofen. These results indicated that the increase in drug release rates from RS coated pellets, when subjected to long <b>curing</b> <b>times,</b> resulted from loss of plasticizer. Free films of Eudragit® NE exhibited an increase in tensile strength with increased <b>curing</b> <b>times,</b> whereas Eudragit® RS free films showed a decrease in tensile strength beyond 4  h of curing at 70 and 90  °C. The film thicknesses and weights of free films of Eudragit® RS prepared with triethyl citrate plasticizer were found to change more dramatically with curing than did free films of Eudragit® RS prepared with ibuprofen as the plasticizer. An increase in pore volume was also observed with increased <b>curing</b> <b>times</b> for Eudragit® RS free films. Such changes with curing were shown to be due to the loss of plasticizer molecules, leading to the formation of molecular-scale voids and channels...|$|R

A standardized method for preparing carpet backed with SBR latex and analyzing its 4 -PCH content was developed. The cure parameters investigated included three cure temperatures (225, 250 and 275 °F), six <b>cure</b> <b>times</b> (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes), and three air circulation rates (zero, three air exchanges per minute, and ten air exchanges per minute with 1500 linear feet per minute airflow).

40|$|The use of {{adhesives}} {{for aircraft}} structural bonding and repairs is increasing {{due to the}} many benefits, including, reducing the overall weight of the aircraft and increasing the fatigue life of joints. However, many commercial adhesives used in the industry, such as Hysol® EA 934 NA, typically require five to seven days to cure at room temperature, affecting aircraft down time. SATTO® is a product that is currently used as a filler for repairing aircraft cabin plastic, such as seats, trays, cabin paneling, etc., and cures within 30 minutes (SATTO® Filler). The chemical composition of SATTO® Filler was modified to improve its adhesive properties, while maintaining short <b>curing</b> <b>times</b> (SATTO® Adhesive). The use of this product in structural applications would be attractive as repairs could be conducted more rapidly, even at the gate, with minimum down time. This paper {{presents the results of}} a series of bolt pull-out tensile tests conducted with both SATTO® products as a potting adhesive for honeycomb inserts. The tests were conducted at various <b>cure</b> <b>times</b> {{in order to determine the}} <b>cure</b> <b>time</b> for optimum strength. The results were compared with the results of similar tests conducted with Hysol® EA 934 NA at the recommended 5 - 7 days <b>cure</b> <b>time.</b> The results show that in this application the SATTO® products do not cure in 30 minutes and have a lower bonding strength than Hysol® EA 934 NA.

40|$|This {{research}} is {{concentrated on the}} effect of concentration of silane- 69 used for surface modification on precipitated silica (PSi), on cure characteristic and mechanical properties of PSi filled NR. The PSi content in this study was fixed at 20 phr in order to reveal the effect of silane used to modify PSi, on NR compound and vulcanizate. Moving Die Rheometer (MDR) was used to characterize cure characteristic of rubber compounds. Generally, scorch and <b>cure</b> <b>time</b> of NR would increase with the addition of PSi due to the absorption of accelerator on its surface whereas the addition of Si- 69 modified PSi would reduce both scorch and <b>cure</b> <b>time.</b> It was found in this research that the excess amount of Si- 69 used increased scorch and <b>cure</b> <b>time</b> of rubber compounds. This was thought to be that the excess of Si- 69 {{led to the formation of}} polysiloxane clusters which could absorb accelerator in rubber compound and resulted in a prolonged scorch and <b>cure</b> <b>time.</b> In term of vulcanized rubber, it was found that maximum torque increased with the concentration of Si- 69 up to 6 %. The polysiloxane formed during the cure characterization test was responsible for the slightly decreased torque after 6 % of Si- 69 treatment. Nonetheless, even with high concentration of Si- 69 used, torque was still higher than that of untreated PSi filled NR. This i...|$|R
