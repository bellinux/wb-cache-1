5|$|For {{personal}} protection, most Roman troops wore metal {{body armour}} (usually {{in the form}} a chain mail <b>cuirass)</b> and helmets, in addition to shields. In contrast, among the Alamanni, metal armour and helmets were probably owned {{by members of the}} social elite only. Most Alamanni foot soldiers had only shields and no metal armour or helmets.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{equipment}} of a 4th-century foot soldier was {{essentially the same}} as in the 2nd century: metal armour <b>cuirass,</b> metal helmet, shield and sword. Some evolution took place during the 3rd century. Trends included the adoption of warmer clothing; the disappearance of distinctive legionary armour and weapons; the adoption by the infantry of equipment used by the cavalry in the earlier period; and the greater use of heavily armoured cavalry called cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types of hastati, principes and triarii began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment to all but the first class of troops, who alone were able to afford their own equipment. By the time of Polybius, the triarii or their successors still represented a distinct heavy infantry type armed with a unique style of <b>cuirass,</b> but the hastati and principes had become indistinguishable.|$|E
50|$|Napoleonic French <b>cuirasses</b> were {{originally}} intended to be proof against three musket shots at close range; however, this was never achieved in practice. The regulations eventually recognised this, and <b>cuirasses</b> were subsequently only expected to be proof against one shot at long range.|$|R
50|$|Some {{years after}} Waterloo, certain {{historical}} <b>cuirasses</b> {{were taken from}} their repose in the Tower of London and adapted for service by the Life Guards and the Horse Guards. For parade purposes, the Prussian Gardes du Corps and other corps wore <b>cuirasses</b> of richly decorated leather.|$|R

5|$|Three {{distinct}} {{types of}} archers are shown on Trajan's Column: (a) with scalar <b>cuirass,</b> conical steel helmet and cloak; (b) without armour, with cloth conical cap and long tunic; or (c) equipped {{in the same}} way as general auxiliary foot-soldiers (apart from carrying bows instead of javelins). The first type were probably Syrian or Anatolian units; the third type probably Thracian. The standard bow used by Roman auxilia was the recurved composite bow, a sophisticated, compact and powerful weapon.|$|E
5|$|A {{representative}} {{piece of}} Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) {{which consisted of}} a <b>cuirass</b> of a complete set made up of several elements of bronze. It was flexible and comfortable enough {{to be used for}} fighting on foot, while the total weight of the armor is around 18kg (about 40lb). Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards.|$|E
5|$|Maitland's 1st Foot Guards, who had {{defeated}} the Chasseurs of the Guard, {{were thought to}} have {{defeated the}} Grenadiers, although they had only faced Chasseurs of the newly raised Middle Guard. They were nevertheless awarded the title of Grenadier Guards in recognition of their feat and adopted bearskins {{in the style of}} the Grenadiers. Britain's Household Cavalry likewise adopted the <b>cuirass</b> in 1821 in recognition of their success against their armoured French counterparts. The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816, their uniforms, of Polish origin, were based on those of the Imperial Guard lancers.|$|E

5|$|The Roman army {{awarded a}} variety of {{individual}} decorations (dona) for valour to its legionaries. Hasta pura was a miniature spear; phalerae were large medal-like bronze or silver discs worn on the cuirass; armillae were bracelets worn on the wrist; and torques were worn round the neck, or on the <b>cuirass.</b> The highest awards were the coronae ("crowns"), of which the most prestigious was the corona civica, a crown made of oak-leaves awarded for saving {{the life of a}} Roman citizen in battle. The most valuable award was the corona muralis, a crown made of gold awarded to the first man to scale an enemy rampart. This was awarded rarely, as such a man hardly ever survived.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{years as}} a political hostage in Thebes, PhilipII sought to imitate the Greek example of martial exercises and the issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, and succeeded in transforming the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained, professional army. PhilipII adopted some of the military tactics of his enemies, such as the embolon (flying wedge) cavalry formation of the Scythians. His infantry wielded peltai shields that replaced the earlier hoplon-style shield, were equipped with protective helmets, greaves, and either <b>cuirass</b> breastplates or kotthybos stomach bands, and armed with sarissa pikes and a dagger as a secondary weapon. The elite hypaspistai infantry, composed of handpicked men {{from the ranks of}} the pezhetairoi, were formed during the reign of PhilipII and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. PhilipII was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes).|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate <b>cuirass</b> (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E

5|$|When the two {{opposing}} forces reached {{the place of}} the ambush, Bardas ordered the trumpets blown and the two concealed Byzantine divisions attacked the Pechenegs from the flanks and the rear. Cut off from aid and surrounded, the Pechenegs began to panic and flee. One of their leaders tried to rally his men, but he was attacked by Bardas Skleros himself, who killed him with a single sword-blow that reportedly cut him in two from his head down to the waist, through the Pecheneg's helmet and <b>cuirass.</b> The loss of the Pecheneg commander turned the battle into a complete rout, and panic spread to the Bulgarian contingent following behind the Pechenegs, which also suffered heavy casualties in the general chaos. The Byzantine casualties in the battle were low (Skylitzes speaks of 25 dead and Leo of 55) although they lost many horses to the Pecheneg arrows, while the losses of the Rus' force, although certainly lower than Leo's claimed 20,000, were still significant, probably running into several thousands.|$|E
5|$|The two armies met on {{the large}} plain of al-Mudiq (cf. Qalaat al-Madiq), {{surrounded}} by mountains and located near the Lake of Apamea, on 19 July 998. According to Ibn al-Qalanisi, the Fatimid army's left wing was commanded by Maysur the Slav, governor of Tripoli; the centre, where the Daylamite infantry and the army baggage train were located, was {{under the command of}} Badr al-Attar; the right was commanded by Jaysh ibn Samsama and Wahid al-Hilali. According to all accounts, the Byzantines charged the Fatimid army and drove it to flight, killing some 2,000 and capturing the baggage train. Only 500 ghilman under Bishara the Ikhshidid remained steadfast and held firm against the assault, while the Banu Kilab simply abandoned the fight and began looting the battlefield. At that point, a Kurdish rider, named Abu'l-Hajar Ahmad ibn al-Dahhak al-Salil by Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Qalanisi and Bar Kefa by the Byzantine sources and Abu'l-Faraj, rode towards Dalassenos, who was near his battle standard on top of a height and was accompanied only by two of his sons and ten men of his retinue. Believing the battle won and that the Kurd wanted to surrender, Dalassenos took no precautions. As he approached the Byzantine general, Ibn al-Dahhak suddenly charged. Dalassenos lifted his arm to shield himself, but the Kurd launched his spear at him. The general wore no <b>cuirass,</b> and the blow killed him.|$|E
25|$|Each shoulder-clasp {{consists}} of two matching curved halves, hinged upon a long removable chained pin. The surfaces display panels of interlocking stepped garnets and chequer millefiori insets, surrounded by interlaced ornament of Germanic Style II ribbon animals. The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking wild boars with filigree surrounds. On {{the underside of the}} mounts are lugs for attachment to a stiff leather <b>cuirass.</b> The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The <b>cuirass</b> itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon <b>cuirass</b> clasps are known.|$|E

25|$|Biphasic <b>cuirass</b> {{ventilation}} (BCV) is {{a modern}} development of the iron lung, consisting of a wearable rigid upper-body shell (a <b>cuirass)</b> which functions as a negative pressure ventilator. The ventilation is biphasic because the <b>cuirass</b> {{is attached to a}} pump which actively controls both the inspiratory and expiratory phases of the respiratory cycle. This method {{is a modern}} improvement of 'negative pressure ventilation' (NPV), which could only control inspiratory breathing, relying on passive recoil for exhalation. BCV was developed by Dr Zamir Hayek, a pioneer in the field of assisted ventilation. Some of Dr Hayek's previous inventions include the Hayek Oscillator, an early form of the technology.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{negative}} pressure mechanical ventilators {{are still in}} use, notably with the polio wing hospitals in England such as St Thomas' Hospital in London and the John Radcliffe in Oxford. The prominent device used is a smaller device known as the <b>cuirass.</b> The <b>cuirass</b> is a shell-like unit, creating {{negative pressure}} only to the chest {{using a combination of}} a fitting shell and a soft bladder. Its main use is in patients with neuromuscular disorders that have some residual muscular function. However, it was prone to falling off and caused severe chafing and skin damage and was not used as a long-term device. In recent years this device has re-surfaced as a modern polycarbonate shell with multiple seals and a high-pressure oscillation pump in order to carry out biphasic <b>cuirass</b> ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Less common, {{due to its}} expense, was {{the muscle}} <b>cuirass.</b> This was a defence made entirely of plate bronze {{consisting}} of a breast and backplate, usually with shoulder pieces, modelled in relief on the form a muscular male torso. This was often given pteruges to extend {{the area of the}} body covered.|$|E
50|$|Corslets {{provided}} with both breast and back pieces were worn by foot-soldiers in the 17th century, while their mounted comrades were equipped in heavier and stronger <b>cuirasses.</b> These defenses continued in use {{longer than any}} other single piece of armour. Their use never altogether ceased and in modern armies mounted cuirassiers, armed as in earlier days with breast and back plates, have in some degree emulated the martial splendour of the body armour of the era of medieval chivalry. Both the French and German heavy cavalry wore <b>cuirasses</b> in parade leading up to World War I. In the early part of that conflict, they painted their <b>cuirasses</b> black and wore canvas protection covers over the neo-Roman style helmets.|$|R

25|$|However, when 1877 approached, dresses moulded {{to fit the}} figure, as {{increasing}} slimmer silhouettes were favoured. This was allowed by {{the invention of the}} <b>cuirass</b> bodice which functions like a corset, but extends downwards to the hips and upper thighs. Although dress styles took on a more natural form, the narrowness of the skirt limited the wearer in regards to walking.|$|E
25|$|Lances: the lance was the {{principal}} assault weapon of the tilting heavy cavalry. They were up to four metres long, ranging from the classical lance type with a lengthened spearhead (often decorated with animal tails, flags or other ornaments) to the short conical spearheaded, one designed for piercing heavy armour. A buckler-like vamplate protected the hand and arm. Its stability was increased with a fastening hook (lance-arret) {{on the side of}} the horseman's <b>cuirass.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} <b>cuirass</b> of plate iron, {{decorated with}} gold and modelled {{on the form}} of the linothorax, was discovered in the Macedonian royal burial at Vergina. This, alongside the evidence of the depiction of Alexander the Great in the Alexander Mosaic, shows that the technology to make plate armour in iron existed at this time. It is to be doubted that this type of armour was worn by persons other than of royal or very exalted rank.|$|E
50|$|Protective gear like shields, <b>cuirasses,</b> greaves and helmets are {{extremely}} rare and almost never found in burials. The best-known {{example of a}} bronze shield comes from Plzeň in Bohemia and has a riveted handhold. Comparable pieces {{have been found in}} Germany, Western Poland, Denmark, Great Britain and Ireland. They are supposed to have been made in upper Italy or the Eastern Alps and imitate wooden shields. Irish bogs have yielded examples of leather shields (Clonbrinn, Co. Wexford). Bronze <b>cuirasses</b> are known since Bronze D (Čaka, grave II, Slovakia). Complete bronze <b>cuirasses</b> have been found in Saint Germain du Plain, nine examples, one inside the other, in Marmesse, Haute Marne (France), fragments in Albstadt-Pfeffingen (Germany). Bronze dishes (phalerae) may have been sewn on a leather armour. Greaves of richly decorated sheet-bronze are known from Kloštar Ivanić (Croatia) and the Paulus cave near Beuron (Germany).|$|R
