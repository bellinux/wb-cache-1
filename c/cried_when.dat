Later that year, Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty and {{established}} the state of Cao Wei with him as its first emperor. Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi in 221 and sent Yu Jin back to Wei in autumn. By then, Yu Jin was a pallid-looking {{old man with a}} head full of grey hair. He knelt down, kowtowed and <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> he met Cao Pi. Cao Pi comforted him, told him about Xun Linfu and Mengmingshi, and then commissioned him as General Who Pacifies the Borders (安遠將軍).|$|E
25|$|On April 22, Powell {{repeatedly}} banged {{his head}} into the iron walls of his cell aboard the Saugus. Whether this was a suicide attempt (as his jailers believed) or not, it deeply alarmed military officials. A canvas padded hood, with only a slit for the mouth and nostrils, was fashioned. Powell and all the other prisoners aboard the monitors were forced to wear them 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to prevent any further suicide attempts. Only Mary Surratt and Dr. Mudd were not required to wear the hoods. Powell <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> the hood was placed on him. The hoods were hot, claustrophobic, and uncomfortable, and in the humid confines of the monitors in the steaming Washington summer the prisoners suffered immensely. On June 6, Hartranft ordered them removed—except for Powell's.|$|E

500|$|The seated jury for White's trial {{consisted}} of white middle-class San Franciscans who were mostly Catholic; gays and ethnic minorities were excused {{from the jury}} pool. Some {{of the members of}} the jury <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> they heard White's tearful recorded confession, at the end of which the interrogator thanked White for his honesty. White's defense attorney, Doug Schmidt, argued that he was not responsible for his actions, using the legal defense known as diminished capacity: [...] "Good people, fine people, with fine backgrounds, simply don't kill people in cold blood." [...] Schmidt tried to prove that White's anguished mental state was a result of manipulation by the politicos in City Hall who had consistently disappointed and confounded him, finally promising to give his job back only to refuse him again. Schmidt said that White's [...] mental deterioration was demonstrated and exacerbated by his junk food binge the night before the murders, since he was usually known to have been health-food conscious. Area newspapers quickly dubbed it the Twinkie defense. White was acquitted of the first degree murder charge on May 21, 1979, but found guilty of voluntary manslaughter of both victims, and he was sentenced to serve seven and two-thirds years. With the sentence reduced for time served and good behavior, he would be released in five. He <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> he heard the verdict.|$|E

According to music personnel, several among them <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> they first heard her performance. Multiple versions were used throughout the soundtrack. Azura's normal voice work is performed by Japanese voice actress Lynn. In the English version, Azura's speaking and singing voice were provided by Rena Strober.

Jacques <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> her ex-husband won the award, and divulged to her son that she [...] "wasn't crying out of professional resentment or even envy about Joan Le Mesurier... but from an unhappiness that, through her own actions, she lost John or there was now no-one with whom to spend her life".|$|E
500|$|In October 1952, Pedersen {{received}} {{permission from}} Colonel Eustace P. Smoak {{to purchase a}} horse for his platoon. Based in mountainous terrain, Pederson needed a pack animal capable of carrying up to nine of the heavy 24-pound shells needed to supply the recoilless rifles used by his unit, the Recoilless Rifle Platoon of the 5th Marine Regiment. The day after he received permission, on [...] October 26, 1952, Pedersen, Sergeant Willard Berry, and Corporal Philip Carter drove a jeep with a trailer to the Seoul racetrack. Pedersen paid for the horse with his own money. Moon was reluctant to sell the horse, though he needed to, and <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> [...] "Flame" [...] departed.

Rollason was awarded an MBE in the 1999 Birthday Honours for her services to broadcasting and charities, and in July 1999 attended a ceremony at Buckingham Palace to be presented with the honour by the Queen. Speaking about the occasion, Rollason said, [...] "I <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> I received the news. I don't feel I deserve it but I'm very thrilled that so many women are coming through in sport broadcasting now." [...] Also in July, she received an honorary degree from the University of Brighton, which was presented to her at her home after she became too ill to attend the ceremony. Shortly before that she was honoured with an award for courage at the 1999 Pride of Britain Awards.|$|E

500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days {{where you want to}} kill yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time to have a life outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits".

500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} Dugard's return, Carl Probyn, her stepfather, confirmed that Dugard and her daughters were in good health and intelligent; their reunion was going well; and they were proceeding slowly. He said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Garrido, and the two daughters <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> they learned of their father's arrest. Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, said Dugard's daughters are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Dugard's reappearance is an important event for families of other long-term missing children, because it shows that there is hope even in long-term cases. Notable abduction survivor Elizabeth Smart has {{stressed the importance of}} focusing on the future with a positive attitude as an effective approach to accepting what has happened. Shawn Hornbeck, another abduction survivor, also commented on the case, noting: [...] "Coming out of what she's had to endure is like entering a new world. It's like a door has opened for her and she's emerged from a world that's black and white into one that's full of color." [...] He opined that she was brainwashed, would feel angry and now needs to move on with her life.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, she had expected to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she felt that way about Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew cried, and that one of the toughest things about it was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to the fact there were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make and she felt [...] "very fortunate to be given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E

500|$|In Entertainment Weekly, Alejandro Garay wrote, [...] "One of my {{favorite}} episodes of 2008 was Lost’s 'The Constant.' [...] It was a beautiful episode that made us fans {{fall in love with}} the show even more. [...] The creators managed to build momentum with smart narrative, by using the romance card to develop such a complicated topic as time traveling. [...] It was exquisite, mind-blowing, impeccably done, and unforgettable." [...] Bill Keveney of USA Today wrote that it is [...] "arguably the most highly praised episode of [...] well-received fourth season", while his colleague Robert Bianco deemed Henry Ian Cusick worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times called the episode a [...] "mind-blowing tour de force". [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "for-the-ages episode" [...] with [...] "a classic Lost moment" [...] in Desmond and Penny's phone call and [...] "an especially spine-tingling performance" [...] by Cusick. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday wrote, [...] "last night's forty-four minutes of Lost were among the most satisfying forty-four minutes in front of the tube in my life." [...] He added that [...] "it wasn't merely a brilliant episode, which pushed the mythology forward more rapidly and richly than any episode in my memory, but it was an emotional release … I actually <b>cried</b> <b>when</b> Penny and Desmond finally…connected" [...] and [...] "there wasn't one, single, solitary false note". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "it was brilliantly executed, as both a brain-twister and as a love story" [...] with an [...] "outstanding" [...] performance by Jeremy Davies. [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "the best single outing since season 1's 'Walkabout'" [...] and named the phone call between Desmond and Penny the best moment of the season excluding any moments from the then yet-to-air season finale. [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard described [...] "The Constant" [...] as [...] "mindblowing" [...] and cited it as [...] "the reason the hardcore fans love Lost." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that [...] "the time-tripping went into overdrive with this week's brilliant episode … [...] worked beautifully as a showcase for Henry Ian Cusick as the tormented Desmond. [...] It was almost a stand-alone episode, a Twilight Zone/X-Files-style adventure with a start, middle and killer finish." ...|$|E

He asked Shabazz to visit Ali (who was in the hospital due to his failing health) and get him to sign the letter and then give Ali the $50,000. Ali signed.
