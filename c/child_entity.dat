50|$|Entity (noun)An entity {{is defined}} as {{something}} that is uniquely identifiable and can exist by itself. There are only 12 parent entities in LML: Action, Artifact, Asset, Characteristic, Connection, Cost, Decision, Input/Output, Location, Risk, Statement and Time. Several <b>child</b> <b>entities</b> have been defined to capture information that stakeholders need. The <b>child</b> <b>entities</b> have the attributes and relationships of the parents plus additional attributes and relationships that make them unique. <b>Child</b> <b>entities</b> include: Conduit (<b>child</b> of Connection), Logical (child of Connection), Measure (child of Characteristic), Orbital (child of Location), Physical (child of Location), Requirement (child of Statement), Resource (child of Asset), and Virtual (child of Location). Every entity has a name or number or description attribute or combination of the three to identify it uniquely. The name is a word or small collection of words providing an overview {{of information about the}} entity. The number provides a numerical way to identify the entity. The description provides more detail about that entity. Attribute (adjective)The attributes work in the same way an adjective. Entities (the nouns) can have names, numbers, and description attributes. The inherent characteristic or quality of an entity is an attribute. Every attribute has a name that identifies it uniquely within an entity. Attributes names are unique within an entity, but may be used in other entities. The name provides an overview of information about the attribute. The attribute data type specifies the data associated with the attribute.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} {{structure}} is relatively flat, the ULAN is constructed as a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the ULAN hierarchies (Subject_ID: 500000001); it currently has two published facets: Person and Corporate Body. Entities in the Person facet typically have no <b>children.</b> <b>Entities</b> in the Corporate Body facet may branch into trees. There may be multiple broader contexts, making the ULAN structure polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships, the ULAN also has equivalent and associative relationships.|$|R

30|$|This {{significant}} and consistent difference {{can be attributed}} to the effective use of the proposed model in general and appropriate adaptation of relationship style such as referencing and embedding when modeling NoSQL document-model databases. An example of using this relationship styles can be explained as follow: consider having entity Ex which is related to entity Ey and <b>entity</b> Ez as <b>child</b> <b>entities,</b> in this case, embedding is highly discouraged since both Ey and Ez can function simultaneously which also means one can function in the absence of the other. Such scenario is controlled by Cm formula as defined in Eq.  3. Instead, referencing type of relationship modeling is strongly encouraged in such scenario. This is because, documents can be separately created and relate them using their identifiers (ID).|$|R
50|$|In this {{particular}} example, {{there are also}} emergent properties—functions that are not seen at the lower level (e.g., cognition is not a property of neurons but is of the brain)—and a scalar quality (molecules are bigger than atoms, cells are bigger than molecules, etc.). Both of these concepts commonly exist in compositional hierarchies, {{but they are not}} a required general property. These level hierarchies are characterized by bi-directional causation. Upward causation involves lower-level entities causing some property of a higher level entity; <b>children</b> <b>entities</b> may interact to yield parent entities, and parents are composed at least partly by their children. Downward causation refers to the effect that the incorporation of entity x into a higher-level entity can have on xs properties and interactions. Furthermore, the entities found at each level are autonomous.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This report {{describes}} {{physical and}} imaging findings {{in a case}} of anterior lingual mandibular bone depression in a <b>child.</b> This <b>entity</b> is very rarely diagnosed and even more extremely rarely seen in children. We present some characteristic findings depicted on images provided by different sources and briefly address current hypotheses on its pathogenesis. The anterior lingual mandibular bone depression (ALMBD) is a rare finding, firstly reported by Richard and Ziskind (1). The pathogenesis of ALMBD is still unknown. ALMBD is categorized as the anterior counterpart to a similar posterior mandibular lingual bone depression (or defect) (PLMBD), preferentially known as Stafne’s cavity (2, 3). ALMBD is much rarer than PLMBD. Based on a recent literature survey, the ratio is about 1 : 6. 8 in favour of posterior lesions (4). Both defects frequently contain salivary gland tissue in a...|$|R

50|$|Essentialism {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} concept in psychology, particularly developmental psychology. Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied {{the extent to which}} children from 4-7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects {{as a result of an}} adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking (Rangel and Keller, 2011).Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in cognitive development. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that <b>children</b> represent <b>entities,</b> from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding (Demoulin, Leyens & Yzerbyt, 2006).|$|R
30|$|Providing {{education}} for Syrian <b>children</b> as non-citizen <b>entities</b> {{is a very}} complex process including a variety of state and non-state actors in Turkey. The power relations among these actors and socio-political context of the country as well as the particular needs of the diaspora has turned education provision for refugees into a problem that has generated its own paradigm. In that context, education as a humanitarian response is beyond being only philanthropic action. Beneath the surface of philanthropy, there are political and ideological motivations that encourage humanitarian organizations to spend energy and resources on education provision for refugees.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{equality}} heuristic (sometimes called 1/N rule) people divide and invest their resources equally {{in a number}} of N different options. These options can be both social (e.g., time spent with <b>children)</b> and nonsocial <b>entities</b> (e.g., financial investments or natural resources). For example, many parents invest their limited resources, such as affection, time, and money (e.g., for education) equally into their offspring. In highly uncertain environments with large numbers of assets and only few possibilities to learn, {{the equality}} heuristic can outperform optimizing strategies and yield better performance on various measures of success than optimal asset allocation strategies.|$|R

40|$|Primary {{cutaneous}} lymphomas (CL) {{in children}} is rare. Only {{a few studies}} focused specifically on paediatric CL and therefore little is known whether primary CL in children are similar to or different from their adult counterparts {{with respect to the}} clinicopathological presentation, behaviour and prognosis. An extensive literature search using PubMed/MEDLINE from January 1995 through July 2014 was undertaken for articles reporting cases of paediatric CL. In addition, we identified 31 children with CL in our institutions. Mycosis fungoides and lymphomatoid papulosis are the two most prevalent lymphoma forms in <b>children.</b> A few <b>entities</b> of cutaneous lymphomas such as cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma leg type, and Sézary syndrome have not been reported so far in <b>children.</b> Other lymphoma <b>entities</b> such as hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma are mostly seen in certain geographic areas (Asia, Central and South America). In the paediatric population, low-malignant indolent forms such as primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma and primary cutaneous follicle centre lymphoma are very rare, whereas the more aggressive forms of B-cell lymphomas, precursor lymphoblastic lymphomas, and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm are the most common forms in children, mostly involving the skin secondarily. Most paediatric lymphomas have similar clinicopathological features and course as their adults counterparts, particularly in the group of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. The spectrum of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas in children significantly differs from the one in adults. Diagnostic work-up and treatment of paediatric patients with lymphomas are best achieved in close collaboration with paediatric haematopathologists and oncologists...|$|R
