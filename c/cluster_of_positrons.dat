The basic argument goes as follows: if the coupling constant were negative, this would be equivalent to the Coulomb force constant being negative.

This would render the vacuum unstable against decay into a cluster of electrons {{on one side of}} the universe and a <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>positrons</b> on the other side of the universe.

40|$|Extract] Transport <b>of</b> <b>positrons</b> {{in various}} environments is {{interesting}} from many {{points of view}} [1]. They are standing behind the origin of astrophysical sources of annihilation radiation; they {{play a crucial role}} in production and detection of cold anti-hydrogen and also in the production of positronium (Ps). Recent investigations <b>of</b> <b>positrons</b> have triggered a whole new interesting research area – ionized gases with positrons that may be analyzed using similar techniques albeit for their short lifetime and even the antimatter plasmas. In addition, positrons have been already used for characterization of materials. However, perhaps the most important applications <b>of</b> <b>positrons</b> from the viewpoint of transport studies are the positron buffer-gas traps, such as the Surko trap, and also the use <b>of</b> <b>positrons</b> in the medical diagnostics <b>of</b> <b>positron</b> emission tomography (PET) and possible cancer treatments. Thanks to the recent advances in experimental measurements of high-resolution, low-energy inelastic positron scattering cross sections [2], the determination <b>of</b> <b>positron</b> transport coefficients over a wide range of energies has become possible. These measurements confirm that Ps formation, a non-conservative process unique to positrons, has a much larger cross section than annihilation and the analogous loss process for electrons- the dissociative attachment. This fact, coupled with a very strong energy dependence for Ps formation, is expected to lead to kinetic effects [3]...|$|R

Here, positron cooling and annihilation in noble gases is simulated using accurate scattering and annihilation cross sections calculated ab initio with many-body theory. It is shown that a strikingly small fraction <b>of</b> <b>positrons</b> survive to thermalisation: ∼ 0. 1 in He, ∼ 0 in Ne (due to cooling effectively stalling in the relatively deep momentum-transfer cross-section minimum), ∼ 0. 15 in Ar, ∼ 0. 05 in Kr and ∼ 0. 01 in Xe. For Xe, the time-varying annihilation rate Z̅_ eff(τ) is shown to be highly sensitive to the depletion of the distribution due to annihilation, conclusively explaining the long-standing discrepancy between gas-cell and trap-based measurements in Xe.
