5|$|Although {{details of}} the siege were not recorded, it {{appeared}} to be bloodless. The Byzantine garrison could not expect any help from the humbled regime of Heraclius. After a siege of four months, Sophronius offered to surrender the city and pay a jizya (tribute), on condition that the caliph came to Jerusalem to sign the pact and accept the surrender. It is said that when Sophronius's terms became known to the Muslims, Shurahbil ibn Hassana, one of the Muslim commanders, suggested that instead of waiting for the caliph to <b>come</b> <b>all</b> the way from Madinah, Khalid ibn Walid should be sent forward as the caliph, as he was very similar in appearance to Umar. The subterfuge did not work. Possibly, Khalid was too famous in Syria, or there may have been Christian Arabs in the city who had visited Madinah and had seen both Umar and Khalid, remembering the differences. Consequently, the Patriarch of Jerusalem refused to negotiate. When Khalid reported the failure of this mission, Abu Ubaidah wrote to caliph Umar about the situation, and invited him to come to Jerusalem to accept the surrender of the city.|$|E

5000|$|Quintaglios {{are a very}} {{religious}} people. Their original creation myth tells of a goddess who laid the [...] "Eight Eggs of Creation". From the first egg <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the water, and from the second came the land. From the third <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the air, and from the fourth came the sun. From the fifth came the stars, planets and moons, and from the sixth <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the plants. Finally, from the seventh <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the herbivores (Ceratopsians, Ankylosaurs, Sauropods and Hadrosaurs, among others), and from the eighth and final egg came the carnivores which preyed upon them, (Tyrannosaurs, Ornithomimids and Dromaeosaurids, among others.) God created the five original female hunters by biting off her left arm, each of her fingers becoming a Quintaglio. They wished to create as God did, so she bit off her right arm and these became the first males, the mates of the original hunters.|$|R

I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and <b>come</b> <b>all</b> the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

25|$|The raid was {{ultimately}} a failure as {{none of the}} objectives were achieved by the British. No casualties were inflicted upon the Germans, no prisoners were taken and the only damage inflicted was a cut telephone line. Additionally, {{the quality of the}} planning and conduct of the operation has been called into question. Much of the equipment used was either not servicable—faulty compasses, and motor launches that broke down—or inadequate for the job and launches that were unable to <b>come</b> <b>all</b> the way into the beach due to their draught. Also some of the tasks that had been assigned were impractical or had not been rehearsed—the wire intended for use as a road block was too heavy to carry from the beach—and intelligence relating to German dispositions upon the island was at best outdated or completely wrong. The commandos also found they were burdened with equipment that was not of use, including steel helmets, gaiters and an excess of ammunition. Largely this {{was the result of the}} haste with which the operation had been conceived and then put together, but it was also indicative of the embryonic status of the raiding and commandos concept.|$|E
25|$|Street {{performers}} {{existed in}} Japan {{for a long}} time. However, the connection with advertising forming a chindon'ya first appeared in Osaka during the 19th century (Late Edo period and early Meiji period) {{at the beginning of}} industrialization. The first known chindon'ya is generally considered to be a candy seller in Osaka named Amekatsu, who around 1845 used singing and a noise making toy to attract attention to his own portable candy stall, as many other salespeople, especially candy sellers. Due to his strong voice he was well known in Osaka, and hence tried to sell not candy but rather advertise for other stores and a theater, wearing a large hat and straw sandals, and small bells at his belt, and used a wooden hyogoshi noisemaker. He was succeeded by a former bath attendant Isamikame, who also used to shout tozai (Literally East-West, equivalent to Listen up or welcome (come one <b>come</b> <b>all)).</b> Subsequently, such advertising street performers were called tozaiya in Osaka up to World War II. He soon received competition from another advertiser called Matemoto, and they split their business, with one covering the Uemachi region and the other covering the Shinmachi region of Osaka. After Maemoto died in 1891, his brother, also called Maemoto took over the business, and he was soon joined by his son and daughter, probably the first female chindon'ya. Maemoto is also famous as being the first person in Osaka to die from electric shock in 1893. Other well-known performers from this time are Tanbataya Kurimaru, a former Sweet Chestnut seller, and Satsumaya Imosuke, a former bean seller. These two also occasionally added a second performer to their band.|$|E

500|$|... "One Child" [...] {{garnered}} a mixed {{to negative}} response from critics. Andy Gill for The Independent {{thought that the}} children's choir gave the song a [...] "Jackson 5-esque glutinous" [...] feel. A reviewer for Sputnikmusic described the song as a rewrite of [...] "Jesus Born on This Day", written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff for the singer's first Christmas album, Merry Christmas (1994). Mike Diver for BBC wrote that although the song is [...] "bogged down in sentiment", [...] "any unpleasantness in the mouth is soon washed clean {{by the arrival of}} that hit", while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone simply described the orchestration as [...] "gooey". Jack Foley of IndieLondon echoed Diver's observation about its sentiment, writing that the [...] "more serious songs" [...] on the album such as [...] "One Child", [...] "Oh <b>Come</b> <b>All</b> Ye Faithful" [...] and [...] "Auld Lang Syne" [...] are [...] "stifling" [...] and makes the album an [...] "endurance test". He continued with [...] "Hence, Auld Lang Syne, One Child and Oh <b>Come</b> <b>All</b> Ye Faithful literally make your skin crawl and howling for the nearest slice of Linkin Park to add some musical grit to your life." [...] The Village Voice writer Rich Juzwiak was critical of the song, describing it as a [...] "needless retelling" [...] of the birth of Jesus that does not add anything new or original to the story of his birth. He continued to write that he was not surprised at the outcome of the song as Carey is not a historian.|$|E

500|$|The Scroll of Ahimaaz, a {{historical}} document written in 1050 CE, distinctly describes the Western Wall {{as a place}} of prayer for the Jews. In around 1167 CE during the late Crusader Period, Benjamin of Tudela wrote that [...] "In front of this place is the western wall, {{which is one of the}} walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither <b>come</b> <b>all</b> the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court". In 1625 [...] "arranged prayers" [...] at the Wall are mentioned for the first time by a scholar whose name has not been preserved.

500|$|As an educator, Boult {{influenced}} {{several generations}} of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult [...] "created its curriculum from {{out of his own}} experience.... From that first small class has <b>come</b> <b>all</b> the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain." [...] In the 1930s Boult ran a series of [...] "conferences for conductors" [...] at his country house near Guildford, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel. [...] Among those who studied with or were influenced by Boult were Colin Davis, James Loughran, Richard Hickox and Vernon Handley. The last was not only a pupil of Boult, but acted as his musical assistant on many occasions.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{track on}} the album {{comes in the form}} of another medley, this time called [...] "Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)" [...] / [...] "Housetop Celebration".

[...] "Charlie Brown Christmas" [...] is a variation of the A Charlie Brown Christmas animated musical television special. A piece of nostalgia, as described by Guerra, it also makes use of traditional religious carols. A fourth medley titled [...] "O <b>Come</b> <b>All</b> Ye Faithful" [...] / [...] "HallelujahChorus" [...] features Carey's mother, Patricia, who performs opera during the [...] "Hallelujah Chorus" [...] section.
