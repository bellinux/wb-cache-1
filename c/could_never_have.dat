5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{have been}} useful for retrospective studies. Bird collections offer {{the potential for}} current and future researchers to make in-depth morphological and molecular study of past avian diversity. One of the earliest and most famous examples of this {{was the use of}} egg collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries in determining that the pesticide DDT was producing eggshell-thinning in raptors. The ornithologists who collected the eggs <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> known that their work would one day help establish causes for declines and help in making conservation strategies to save bird such as peregrine falcons from possible extinction.|$|E
5|$|Conquest in Africa and the East {{provided}} both {{wonder and}} terror to European intellectuals, as {{it led to}} the conclusion that Eden <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Rotblat {{in charge}} in Liverpool, Chadwick began {{a tour of}} the Manhattan Project {{facilities}} in November 1943, except for the Hanford Site where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man apart from Groves and his second in command to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the K-25 gaseous diffusion facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.|$|E
5|$|Marie Stopes and David Watson {{analysed}} coal ball {{samples and}} decided that coal balls formed in situ. They {{stressed the importance of}} interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ, stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been able to be transported in the first place.|$|E

5|$|After {{eight months}} {{extended}} leave in 1936, and a posting to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps, Wilton briefly returned to Australia to marry Helen Marshall on 9July 1938 at St. Andrew's Church in Summer Hill, New South Wales. John had met Helen, then a nurse, on a double date in Sydney {{while he was}} in his last year at Duntroon; the couple had two sons and a daughter. On the same trip home he was invited to transfer to the Australian military, and accepted. Promoted to captain in December 1938, Wilton saw out his British service with a coastal battery in Karachi, and was commissioned into the Royal Australian Artillery on 26May 1939. His service with the British Army in India and Burma had afforded him regimental experience that he <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> gained in Australia, as well as an understanding of mountainous and tropical conditions that would benefit him in years to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E

25|$|In {{alliance}} with the Bulgarians and Vlachs, the Cumans {{are believed to have}} {{played a significant role in}} the Vlach-Bulgar Rebellion led by brothers Asen and Peter of Tarnovo, resulting in victory over Byzantium and the restoration of Bulgaria's independence in 1185. Istvan Vassary states that without the active participation of the Cumans, the Vlakho-Bulgarian rebels <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> gained the upper hand over the Byzantines, and ultimately without the military support of the Cumans, the process of Bulgarian restoration <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been realised. The Cuman participation in the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1185 and thereafter brought about basic changes in the political and ethnic sphere of Bulgaria and the Balkans. The Cumans were allies in the Bulgarian-Latin Wars with emperor Kaloyan of Bulgaria, who was descended from the Cumans. In 1205, at the Battle of Adrianople (1205), 14,000 Cuman light cavalry contributed to Kaloyan's crushing victory over the Latin Crusaders. Cuman troops continued to be hired throughout the 13th and 14th century by both the Bulgarians and Byzantines.|$|E
25|$|Noting that Jewish {{tradition}} has not preserved a tradition about Mount Sinai's location, Plaut observed {{that had the}} Israelites known the location in later centuries, Jerusalem and its Temple <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> become the center of Jewish life, for Jerusalem and the Temple would have been inferior in holiness to the God's mountain. Plaut concluded that Sinai thus became in Judaism, either by design or happenstance, a concept rather than a place.|$|E
