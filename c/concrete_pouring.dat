5|$|The Pine Street {{segment of}} the tunnel was planned to be dug cut-and-cover from the surface. In {{preparation}} for utility relocation work on Pine Street, Metro moved 36 bus routes serving the corridor to other east–west streets in February 1987. On April 27, excavation of the tunnel began with the closure of Pine Street, and its offramp to Interstate 5, to automobile traffic between 3rd Avenue and Boren Avenue. Workers finished digging in late August, allowing the project to progress to <b>concrete</b> <b>pouring</b> for the roadway. Pine Street was briefly re-opened for the Christmas shopping season beginning November 1 {{at the request of}} downtown merchants, with a temporary surface laid over backfill for automobiles and pedestrians. On January 4, the street was closed to automobile traffic once again, along with the intersection of 5th Avenue and Pine Street and the Pike Street offramp of I-5, to install utility lines and a permanent roadway. Pine Street was fully reopened to traffic on November 1, 1988, coinciding with the completion of Westlake Park and the Westlake Center shopping mall, a year ahead of schedule.|$|E

The tunnel boring machines were launched in June and July towards Capitol Hill station, arriving in spring 2012. Station box excavation was completed in June 2012, and contractors Hoffman Construction Company moved on to steel erection and pouring {{of the station}}'s upper levels.|$|E

To save time soil compaction was used instead. Layers were laid down and compacted with sheepsfoot rollers in the areas {{that had to be}} filled in, and the footings were laid over compacted soil in the low-lying areas and the undisturbed soil in the areas that had been excavated.

500|$|Although {{the initial}} {{implementation}} of worker camps and site preparation {{had begun in}} 1925, the main effort of construction began in 1926 with the diversion of the Agua Fria River. In that same year, the dam was renamed to Pleasant Dam. By February 1927, <b>concrete</b> <b>pouring</b> for the 20 buttresses was nearing completion. The dam was complete in October 1927. Its construction employed a maximum of 600 workers and cost over $3.3 million. Prior to its inauguration, cracks were discovered in the dam's buttresses. This led to much controversy over the new design of the dam and whether it was safe in the long-term which delayed its inauguration until February 1928. The situation was exacerbated on 12 March 1928 after the St. Francis Dam in California had a catastrophic failure. In 1929, {{after a series of}} hearings and debates, which eventually reached the state legislature, the State Water Commissioner ordered the spillway for the dam to be lowered [...] to prevent excess water levels and stress on the dam. It was also required that specific water levels in the reservoir be maintained. The dam was rehabilitated until 1935, and a steel roadbed was installed atop it that same year. In the early 1960s, it was renamed the Waddell Dam.|$|E
2500|$|Actual {{construction}} {{started in}} December 1926, with Albert E. Paddock as project superintendent and Ralph Lowry as construction engineer. Preliminary excavations and site clearing {{were followed by}} the placement of a wooden flume to divert the river before <b>concrete</b> <b>pouring</b> in the foundation work could begin. When the foundations were complete, the flume was closed and water allowed to pass through outlet holes {{in the base of}} the dam. Concrete for the dam was mixed at a site roughly [...] downstream and transported to the construction site via a light railway. The concrete was then placed via buckets transported by a cableway system, supported by two [...] high towers.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Concrete</b> <b>pouring</b> and {{placement}} occurred for 18 months, {{of which the}} maximum poured in a day was [...] and in a month, [...] The aggregate for the concrete [...] was obtained from a quarry near the construction site. The high-quality and strength gneiss-rock was ground in a rotary crusher and prepared in the concrete mixture. To facilitate the contraction and settling of the concrete in the dam, it was cooled {{with a series of}} steel pipes that ran throughout the mass of concrete, {{with the exception of the}} top [...] of the dam. A grout curtain was placed around and below the dam as well to prevent leakage, which consumed a large amount of cement. In August 1964, the reservoir began to fill and in September 1965, the reservoir was full and the dam completed.|$|E
