40|$|There lies an {{opportunity}} for significant cost savings in the installation of subsea cables in offshore wind farms {{which is why the}} current work proposes a state-of-the-art method for monitoring the cable during installation. The proposed method enables offshore crew to look through the water with the use of augmented reality. To this end a real-time numerical model of the subsea cable dynamics is developed. The model is created in programming language C# and visualization in augmented reality is done using the game-engine Unity. This development environment is uncommon for engineering and scientific purposes and has been selected based on its ability to visualize model results in augmented reality, its extensive graphics library, its capability to process real-time in- and outputs and its free availability. Relevant physics are analyzed on contribution to global cable geometry and tension for the case of shallow water cable laying, resulting in an equation of motion which is sufficiently accurate for representing the physical phenomena occurring during <b>cable</b> <b>lay.</b> An assessment of the measurements required by the model during operation is made. The main challenge of modeling in real-time is that the average model time step is limited by available computational power, in turn limiting the axial stiffness range which can be modeled without the occurrence of numerical instability. Discretization is done using a lumped mass method. It is shown that cable dynamics can be modeled in real-time using an explicit method and that overcoming the associated limitation on axial stiffness does not lead to inaccurate results. The developed numerical solution is verified using OrcaFlex, which is typical software for dynamic analysis of offshore marine systems. An augmented reality interface is developed, including color codes indicating the structural state of the cable. The current work enables the visualization of the real-time model in augmented reality. Potential legal issues related to the implementation of augmented reality during offshore <b>cable</b> <b>lay</b> are outlined during a collaboration with Tilburg University.

To address this issue, AT&T had to improve its <b>cable</b> <b>laying</b> abilities. It invested $100 million in producing two specialized fiber-optic <b>cable</b> <b>laying</b> vessels. These included laboratories in the ships for splicing cable and testing its electrical properties. Such field monitoring is important because the glass of fiber-optic cable is less malleable than the copper cable that had been formerly used. The ships are equipped with thrusters that increase maneuverability. This capability is important because fiber-optic cable must be laid straight from the stern (another factor copper <b>cable</b> <b>laying</b> ships {{did not have to}} contend with).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Offshore Oil & Gas industry, {{shipping}} {{and the ocean}} resource development industries {{play a vital role}} in the development of a country. The harsh marine environment and the need to explore for hydrocarbons in deep and ultra-deep waters has put in place technology and specialized marine support vessels to explore and produce hydrocarbons from below the ocean bed. The specialized vessels engaged in such operations have to maintain a fixed position in relation to a fixed point at the ocean bed despite the harsh vessel position deviating forces of sea currents, waves and wind acting on the floating vessel as little change in the position may lead to accident in the sea. So by the method of “Dynamic Positioning” the vessel is kept stationary in the sea and then oil and gas is extracted by using drilling vessels or drill ships. This method also allows other vessels like crane vessels, shuttle tanker, dredging and rock dumping vessels, pipelay, <b>cable</b> <b>lay</b> and cable repair vessels to remain stationary in sea so that extraction process takes place efficiently...|$|E
40|$|The cable in conduit {{conductor}} for the ITER coils {{is required}} to function under pulse conditions and fields up to 13 T. A parametric study, restricted to a limited variation of the reference <b>cable</b> <b>lay</b> out, is necessary to identify the quantitative impact of manufacturing parameters on the coupling loss {{and to find out}} more precisely the value of the coupling loss time constant {{to be used in the}} AC loss computation. Here we present the first results of the AC coupling loss measurements on jacketed sub size conductors with variations in type of cabling, cabling stage, twist pitch and void fraction. The AC loss is determined mainly by the calorimetric way but partly also using a magnetometer. A sinusoidal AC field amplitude of 15 - 400 mT, superposed on a DC background field of B/sub dc/= 0, 1 or 1. 5 T, is applied to determine the coupling loss time constants for different specimens. The results up to now show large coupling current time constants especially for braided cables, for which n. /spl tau/ can reach more than 1000 ms. For twisted cables with 81 strands n. /spl tau/ values up to 300 ms are attained...|$|E

For the <b>cable</b> <b>lay</b> underground, breakpoint is covered by the protect and shield stuff, simple tools can not find breakpoint, it must adopt special way to measure the breakpoint location. So finding the breakpoint is the precondition to eliminate problem, finding the distance of breakpoint can shorten the measure time, benefit for eliminating problem and reducing loss. 1 Status for measure cable breakpoint location range technology The way to locate the cable breakpoint(cable breakpoint range) can be classify two kind: calculate the breakpoint range by using the information of voltage and current, the second by using exterior signal.

40|$|The Hawaii Deep Water Cable Program {{has been}} {{established}} to evaluate and resolve the technical problems associated with laying a power cable from the island of Hawaii to the island of Oahu in the State of Hawaii. This cable, 250 km (150 m) long, is to be laid at a maximum depth of 2135 m (7000 ft) under design seas of 2. 5 m (8 ft) and surface currents up to 1. 5 m/s (3 kts). One of the many problems associated with this task is the integrated control system for the deployment vessel, {{the subject of this}} study. The intent {{of this study is to}} provide a conceptual design for an integrated control system that identifies its basic method of operation, equipment required, and to determine potential problem areas. The main objective of the control system is to promptly lay the cable on the bottom, properly tensioned and properly located. In general, this is achieved by accurately measuring a variety of cable and vessel parameters, monitoring the vessel location and controlling the cable payout rate and the vessel position. In conclusion, a control system that can properly position and tension the cable for the Hawaii program is possible. Most of the components for the system are commercially available with the exception of the surface cable angle measurement. The <b>cable</b> <b>lay</b> and control will involve added complexities because of the depth, cable dynamics, path width and bottom slopes; these should be tested in the HDWC demonstration program...|$|E
