Defence date: 3 June 2013 This {{research}} aims {{to analyse}} {{the prohibition of}} State aid and compatibility assessments in the EU {{from the perspective of}} the 'more economic approach’ (MEA). The hypothesis enunciated in the thesis is that the MEA in State aid is applied in an instrumental manner, which goes beyond the paradigm of control justified by the coordination of national policies and the reduction of distortions of competition. Hence, the shift takes place with regard to: (i) the definition of the aims of public intervention and (ii) the methods of aid assessment. Firstly, by means of the MEA the Commission pursues a horizontal industrial policy, which presupposes a more pro-active approach and verification of the positive effects of aid, to the detriment of its negative effects. Secondly, the use of the MEA is policy driven - the Commission chooses the MEA to better regulate positive criteria for <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> while avoiding applying refined economic analysis: (i) to the definition of aid and (ii) to assess the magnitude of the negative effects of aid. The research conducted here is oriented around four horizontal lines: (i) conflict and complementarities between competition and industrial policy, based on the analysis of State aid rules (ii) shift from negative to positive integration, which implies a transformation of State aid control and coordination into a State aid policy and has consequences for the aims and substantive criteria of the legal framework (iii) a 'better regulation’ of State aid by means of the MEA (iv) the competence of the Member States versus the competence of the Commission in the State aid legal framework...|$|E

After the short introduction, which sketches relationships between state aid policy and other policies, including broadband public policy, and after he illustrates the state of play of Slovenian broadband networks, he discusses main challenges in application <b>of</b> State <b>aid</b> rules to public fi nancing of broadband networks. In this regard, special emphasis is dedicated to legal analysis of conditions for the presence <b>of</b> State <b>aids,</b> and to conditions for the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> State <b>aids</b> for broadband network with the Internal market. Furthermore, he emphasizes the importance of coherent public actions and policies in various fi elds; public policies shall, as far as possible, supplement each other and shall avoid their mutual collisions. Unfortunately, this is not always the case as the author points out regarding the reckless spatial policy, which has negative effects, inter alia, on the Slovenian broadband networks...|$|R

By applying the norms concerning the state aids, the European Commission ensured a limitation at the minimum of competition degradation in the internal markets, despite the important sums <b>of</b> state <b>aid,</b> and restructuration <b>of</b> beneficiary banks, after case...|$|R

Even TFEU provides the general prohibition <b>of</b> State <b>aid,</b> there are some exceptions to the general prohibition that are either automatically compatible with the internal market (Article 107 (2) TFEU) or enables the European commission to consider the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>aid</b> with the internal market on the bases {{of a number of}} objectives to be attained (Article 107 (3) TFEU). The application of these exceptions is only within the power of European Commission. State aid measures can be effective tools for achieving objectives of common interest. State aid should only be used when it is an appropriate instrument for meeting a well defined objective, when it creates the right incentives, is proportionate and when it distorts competition to the least possible extent...|$|R

In practice, however, it is possible to notice expressions like "state support" or "state aid", which are equivalents for the Czech term "public support". I explore the given concept in the international law, European and Czech legislations. Subsequently, I compare it with the laws of Poland and the Slovak Republic. The crucial part of the doctoral thesis focuses on investment aids aimed at the tool of discounts on income taxes, which is evaluated both from the perspective of legal theory and practice. Finally, I scrutinize the case law of the European and Czech courts, which represent the basis, and there is also a comparison with the historical development of the evaluation criteria for <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aids.</b> Keywords: state aids, regional aids, investment incentives, tax allowance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} state aid law as a {{specific}} part of EU competition law. State aid is therefore primarily set {{in the context of}} protection of competition in the EU internal market. Furthermore, the thesis provides an interpretation of Article 107, paragraph 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which contains four attributes of state aid: state resources, favoring certain undertaking or the production of certain goods, distortion of competition and effect on trade between EU Member States. Analysis of the attribute "effect on trade between Member States" is made in a separate part of the work. In this section, the work seeks to explore how European Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union approach and interpret this attribute. Attention is paid especially to decision-making activities of the European Commission in recent years. Decisions of the Commission, as a body authoritatively determining whether a measure constitutes state aid, as well as the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> with the internal market, could also indicate the direction in which the state aid law will develop in the future. The analysis of the Commission's decisions found that not even potentially affects trade between Member States a measure with purely local impact. Such measure will [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The EU State aid reform The {{implementation}} <b>of</b> the State <b>aid</b> {{action plan}} This work {{is divided into}} three sections. The first section defines State aid under the Article 107 (1) of the Treaty of Functioning of the EU. In this regard, {{on the basis of the}} EU Courts case law, it is explained what the "State resources" are, under which conditions the State intervention is "imputable to the State", what can be considered as "an undertaking" and "an advantage" as well as under which conditions an aid can have "an effect on trade and distort (or threaten to distort) the competition on the internal market". Consequently, Article 107 (2) and (3) of the TFEU is examined and the difference is highlighted between the State aid that is compatible per se on the basis of the TFEU and the State aid that may be declared compatible with the TFEU by the Commission. The second section is first dedicated to the principles on which the Action plan of was based. The role of the "refined economic approach" in general and the importance of "incentive effect of aid", "market failure" and "proportionality" for the <b>compatibility</b> assessment <b>of</b> State <b>aid</b> in particular is discussed. In this context, the role of the "balancing test" is stressed out. Moreover, it is explained how it is incorporated by the Commission in the soft law [...] ...|$|R

This {{concept was}} introduced by Huang and Zhang [3] and it {{is known to be}} the most general among all commutativity concepts in fixed point theory. For example every pair of weakly commuting self-maps and each pair of compatible self-maps are weakly compatible, but the converse is not always true.
