5|$|In November 2016, a {{few days}} before the United States presidential {{elections}} where Donald Trump was the Republican nominee for president, news <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> McDougal had received a payment of $150,000 from The National Enquirer for exclusive rights to her story of an affair she had with Trump in 2006 and 2007. However, the story has never been published, with The National Enquirer being on record for having endorsed Trump for president.|$|E
5|$|In early 1989, Schottenheimer {{was fired}} as Browns head coach, {{and took the}} head {{coaching}} job with the Kansas City Chiefs. He still had faith in Junkin, unlike the Browns, and traded a fifth-round pick {{to bring him to}} Kansas City. Two weeks after the trade, a report <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Junkin had taken steroids provided by a doctor to treat an injured ankle, and had failed a drug test at the scouting combine as a result. Entering the 1989 Kansas City Chiefs season, Junkin competed with Walker Lee Ashley for the second inside linebacker spot alongside Dino Hackett. Ashley won the job, and Junkin played five games before a shoulder injury sidelined him {{for the rest of the}} season. He was released from the Chiefs after season's end, and retired after not being signed by any team through the 1990 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Ruth hit 54 {{home runs}} {{for a new}} record; his total was {{higher than that of}} all other MLB teams but the Philadelphia Phillies. New York had 95 wins, the most in team history to that point, but fell three wins short of the AL {{championship}} and finished third. In an August 16 game against the Indians, a pitch from Mays hit Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head, leading to his death; the Yankees slumped after the incident as Cleveland captured the pennant. After the season, the Yankees hired general manager Ed Barrow from the Red Sox. Barrow made numerous trades with his former club, including one immediately after his departure that brought catcher Wally Schang and pitcher Waite Hoyt to New York. The Yankees also became involved in another dispute with Ban Johnson, this time over the replacement of baseball's existing governing body, the National Commission, after reports <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the 1919 World Series had been fixed. The Yankees and 10 other franchises—including the entire NL—supported the idea of a three-man committee drawn from outside baseball running MLB, and for a time a move by the Yankees to the NL was rumored; ultimately, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was named MLB's first commissioner.|$|E

25|$|To my {{knowledge}} {{there is only}} one top-flight professional gay footballer who came out – Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide. I have been advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> he had gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, but if you go on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to the dark ages.|$|E
25|$|As {{the season}} progressed, Gullit would clash {{with just about}} every player, notably Landon Donovan and Abel Xavier, the latter who criticized the Dutchman's {{managerial}} style claiming {{he did not have}} respect for most of the players. Eventually, it also <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Gullit's very appointment came in controversial fashion as Galaxy general manager at the time, Alexi Lalas, got bypassed in the process, with the decision coming straight from David Beckham's personal handlers: his management company 19 Entertainment and his personal manager Terry Byrne.|$|E

25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} time for a new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 1973, Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray {{testified before}} the Senate Judiciary Committee during his {{nomination}} to replace J. Edgar Hoover as Director of the FBI. Armed with newspaper articles indicating the White House had possession of FBI Watergate files, the committee chairman, Sam Ervin, questioned Gray as to what {{he knew about the}} White House obtaining the files. Gray stated he had given FBI reports to Dean, and had discussed the FBI investigation with Dean on many occasions. It also <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Gray had destroyed important evidence entrusted to him by Dean. Gray's nomination failed and now Dean was directly linked to the Watergate cover-up.|$|E
25|$|Weeks later, Rachel was mortified to {{find out}} that she was {{pregnant}} with Mitch's child, but she still remarried Mac. When Mitch was supposedly murdered by Rachel, she was put on trial.

Shortly after, she gave birth to a son named Matthew (Matthew Maienczyk). It turned out Mitch was still alive and was suffering from amnesia. Rachel was set free and the future seemed bright for the Cory family, but then Mitch and Rachel began an affair. Rachel decided {{to start a new life}} with Mitch and divorced Mac.|$|E

25|$|In September2011, the OPERA {{collaboration}} released calculations showing velocities of 17GeV and 28GeV neutrinos {{exceeding the}} speed of light in their experiments (see Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly). In November2011, OPERA repeated its experiment with changes so that the speed could be determined individually for each detected neutrino. The results showed the same faster-than-light speed. However, in February2012, reports <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the results may have been caused by a loose fiber optic cable attached to one of the atomic clocks which measured the departure and arrival times of the neutrinos. An independent recreation of the experiment in the same laboratory by ICARUS found no discernible difference between {{the speed of}} a neutrino and {{the speed of light}}.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have pointed out}} similarities to the 1996 shelling of Qana, in which over 100 civilians were killed by Israeli anti-personnel shells on a UN compound. In the first case, Israel alleged that it fired without knowing the compound harbored civilians. The allegation was put into question after evidence <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that,</b> {{at the time of}} the strike, Israel was spying on the compound with two helipcoters and a drone. Both incidents resulted in increased pressure on Israel to declare a cease-fire. Qana's strategic location at the confluence of five major roadways and on the northern edge of Hezbollah-controlled southern Lebanon may have contributed as to its repeatedly being caught in the crossfire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the arrest, it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the manager of the {{newspaper}} delivery agency in Higashisumiyoshi Ward had made a report to the police that a newspaper subscription fee of 230,000 yen had been stolen. Afterwards, the manager discovered that the thief was Kobayashi, now working in Kawai. On November 17, 2004, the day of the kidnapping, a judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kobayashi for the embezzlement reported by the manager. However, the manager did not inform the police of this, because he was promised that the suspect would repay him for the stolen money with monthly payments. Therefore, the police were not able to arrest Kobayashi, and he was free to commit his attack.|$|E

25|$|The Jets {{opened their}} 2011 season against the Dallas Cowboys on September 11, 2011. The {{game was played}} at MetLife Stadium on Sunday Night Football on the ten-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The Jets were tied with the Cowboys 24-24 in the final minutes when Revis intercepted a Tony Romo pass {{intended}} for Dez Bryant to put the Jets in field goal range. Nick Folk converted the game-winning field goal to give the Jets the win 27-24. In Week 6, the Jets were playing the Dolphins with a 2-3 record in what some considered a must win game. Revis intercepted a pass intended for Brandon Marshall and ran it back 100 {{yards for a touchdown}} on October 17, 2011, tying the longest interception return in Jets history, first set by Aaron Glenn in 1996. Later in the same game against the Miami Dolphins, he intercepted another Matt Moore pass in the fourth quarter to preserve the Jets' victory with a score of 24-6. On Sunday, October 23, 2011, the Jets were playing the San Diego Chargers. In the fourth quarter, the Jets were down 21-17 and the Chargers had the ball in Jets territory when Darrelle Revis intercepted a pass intended for Vincent Jackson which was deflected right into the hands of Revis. Later on in the drive Mark Sanchez would complete a touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress, his 3rd of the game. The Jets would win 27-21. After 13 games, the Jets were 8-5 going on a 3-game winning streak and looking to make the playoffs for 3 straight years. But the Jets would lose their next 3 games and miss the playoffs by 1 game with a record of 8-8. After the season it <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the Jets locker room was having problems. Revis ended the year with 52 tackles and 4 interceptions and was elected to his fourth Pro Bowl and third All-Pro team.|$|E
500|$|Tunis' sixth Dodgers novel, Highpockets, {{came out}} in 1948.

The novel won the Boy Scouts of America's junior book award for 1949. Son of the Valley, which also <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> year, is one of Tunis' few non-sports related novels, dramatizing the struggle for acceptance of the Tennessee Valley Authority among rural families displaced by a new dam. A portion of it was excerpted as [...] "Johnny's Experiment" [...] in Told Under Spacious Skies. 1949 saw the publication of his next-to-last book about the Dodgers. Young Razzle is the story of veteran pitcher Razzle Nugent and his estranged rookie son, who reconcile during Razzle's final season of baseball. Ball Tales calls it [...] "Tunis' most entertaining, if not profound, story." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1992 word {{leaked to}} the press on a {{possible}} merger between WordStar International Inc., and soon after both firms made public {{the fact that they}} had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over [...] "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that [...] "we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. I still believe that it's possible for us to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, {{looked him in the eye}} and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E
500|$|After {{recruiting}} drummer Ernie Kim, {{the band}} recorded their eponymous debut album over {{a weekend in}} the DeGeorge family living room. Released in June 2003 under the Eskimo Laboratories record label, the album contains six of the seven songs composed on June 22, 2002 and another twelve written spontaneously and immediately thereafter recorded. [...] In [...] "the summer of" [...] 2003, Harry and the Potters set out on an American tour, performing at libraries. The fifth Harry Potter book [...] Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix [...] <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> summer and on June 21, 2003, the highly anticipated day of release, the band played five sets in a span of 24 hours. The library gigs drew crowds of mostly children and their parents. The brothers played a show at the library in Dorchester, Massachusetts that August where they noticed {{the children in the}} audience singing along. Joe said, [...] "Paul forgot the words to one of the songs. [...] were like, 'You sang it wrong!'" [...] Paul said, [...] "They'd be like, 'Hey, why'd you skip that song?' because they knew the exact sequence of the album." [...] The DeGeorge brothers quickly developed an on-stage persona of dressing in the fashion of wizard-school Hogwarts: white shirts under gray crew-neck sweaters, red-and-yellow striped ties, wire-rim glasses. In a show of quirky egalitarianism, both brothers play the role of Harry Potter and dress almost identically; Paul is older and to conform to the character’s persona, he is Harry of Year 7; while Joe is the Harry of Year 4.|$|E
500|$|The Production Code {{was officially}} {{scrapped}} in 1968, {{to be replaced}} by the first version of the modern rating system. That year, two horror films <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade, with major consequences for the B movie. One was a high-budget Paramount production, directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski. Produced by B horror veteran William Castle, Rosemary's Baby was the first upscale Hollywood picture in the genre in three decades. It was a critical success and the year's seventh-biggest hit. The other was George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like Invasion of the Body Snatchers in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues, it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and domestic racial conflicts. Its greatest influence, though, derived from its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery, low-cost, truly independent means of production, and high profitability. With the Code gone and the X rating established, major studio A films like Midnight Cowboy could now show [...] "adult" [...] imagery, while the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded. In this transformed commercial context, work like Russ Meyer's gained a new legitimacy. In 1969, {{for the first time a}} Meyer film, Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!, was reviewed in The New York Times. Soon, Corman would be putting out nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as Private Duty Nurses (1971) and Women in Cages (1971).|$|E
