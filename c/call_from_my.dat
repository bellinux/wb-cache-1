[...] Lott described her reaction upon learning the song reached number one: [...] "I was in bed at my mum and dad's, where I still live, in Brentwood, Essex. I was on the laptop, and I got a phone <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> A man. He really dragged it out. I said, 'Please put me out of my misery.'

2500|$|The {{album is}} named after track four, [...] "Talk a Good Game" [...] which {{features}} Kevin Cossom. Over a [...] "snaky but sweet" [...] production from T-Minus Rowland sings [...] "I don’t think I can take another broken promise / Why do things the hard way when you can just be honest". Hampp said that Cossom's rap gave the song a [...] "street edge". It takes the listener on an emotional journey according to The Honesty Hour. The next song, [...] "Down on Love", is a midtempo production featuring another classic sample, this time the 1987 song [...] "Rock Steady" [...] by American R group The Whispers. Using her mezzo-soprano vocals, Rowland takes on a downtrodden romantic situation, [...] "We want two different things at two different times / You know how the story go / Easy come easy go". [...] "Dirty Laundry" [...] was co-written by Rowland, Carlos McKinney and The Dream, and is R [...] "confessional" [...] ballad, containing [...] "R jam spools" [...] and a piano-led melody. It details a [...] "frank and often poignant commentary" [...] on Rowland's life. The song is a [...] "brutal" [...] chronicle of {{the last ten years}} of Rowland's life, covering her envy of Beyoncé's solo success and the end of an abusive relationship. Amongst the lyrics, Rowland sings [...] "Kinda lucky I was in her shadow / Phone <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> sister what’s the matter / She said, 'Oh no / You gotta leave' / I’m on the kitchen floor / He took the keys." ...|$|E

60|$|My mammoth {{enemy was}} so close by this time that I knew I must feel the weight {{of one of his}} terrible paws before I could rise, but to my {{surprise}} the blow did not fall upon me. The howling and snapping and barking of the new element which had been infused into the melee now seemed centered quite close behind me, and as I raised myself upon my hands and glanced around I saw what it was that had distracted the DYRYTH, as I afterward learned the thing is <b>called,</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> trail.|$|R

60|$|I was {{interrupted}} {{in that place}} by a <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> old secretary in the States, Mr. Putnam. It was quite affecting to see his delight in meeting his old master again. And when I told him that Anne was married, and that I had (unacknowledged) grandchildren, he laughed and cried together. I suppose you don't remember Longfellow, though he remembers you in a black velvet frock very well. He is now white-haired and white-bearded, but remarkably handsome. He still lives in his old house, where his beautiful wife was burnt to death. I dined with him the other day, and could not get the terrific scene out of my imagination. She was in a blaze in an instant, rushed into his arms with a wild cry, and never spoke afterwards.|$|E
60|$|July 6.--I laboured all {{the morning}} without {{anything}} unusual, save a <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> cousin, Mary Scott of Jedburgh, whom I persuaded {{to take part}} of my chaise to Abbotsford on Saturday. At two o'clock I walked to Cadell's, and afterwards to a committee of the Bannatyne Club. Thereafter I went to Leith, where we had fixed a meeting of The Club, now of forty-one years' standing.[353] I was in the chair, and Sir Adam croupier. We had the Justice-Clerk, Lord Abercromby, Lord Pitmilly, Lord Advocate, James Ferguson, John Irving, and William Clerk, and passed a merry day for old fellows. It is a curious thing that only three have died of this club since its formation. These were the Earl of Selkirk; James Clerk, Lieutenant in the Navy; and Archibald Miller, W.S. Sir Patrick Murray was an unwilling absentee. There were absent--Professor Davidson of Glasgow, besides Glassford, who has cut our society, and poor James Edmonstoune, whose state of health precludes his ever joining society again. We took a fair but moderate allowance of wine, sung our old songs, and were much refreshed with a hundred old stories, which would have seemed insignificant to any stranger. The {{most important of these}} were old college adventures of love and battle.|$|E

50|$|At {{a certain}} point my {{performances}} no longer had anything artistic about them. I received a phone <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> wife five minutes before I {{had to go on}} stage: 'Two busses of Germans, one bus of Danes and three busses of Spaniards'. And then I adapted my show to suit them. There was no room for sentiment in Bobbejaanland. It was work, work, and more work {{in order to keep the}} business profitable. Sixteen hours a day, seven days a week. We employed four-hundred people who had to be paid every month.|$|E

He is quoted as saying: [...] "It was {{inevitable}} I would write a song that dealt with all of that, but it was almost too big a subject for me to handle. Then I got a phone <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> mum saying everyone was depressed so I wrote the song through Dad's eyes, {{what he would say}} to help everyone through. We recorded it in one take, but it was emotional, very heavy. We couldn't be happier with this album." ...|$|E

My agent later spoke to Phil again and he was asking what I was up to, so she told him about the roles that I was up for and how I was quite close to getting them.

50|$|In a {{break from}} her typical style of story-telling, Christina Stead wrote Letty Fox from the first person perspective. The novel’s protagonist narrator, Letty Fox, reveals herself as a bundle of contradictions. While Letty is a shrewd {{observer}} of human behavior, her perceptions and reactions are in various instances romantic, conservative, and feminist. Stead introduces the reader to Letty at the restless age of 24 with the following mise en scène: One hot night last spring, after waiting fruitlessly for a <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> then lover, with whom I had quarreled the same afternoon, and finding one of my black moods on me, I flung out of my lonely room on the ninth floor (unlucky number) in a hotel in lower Fifth Avenue and rushed into {{the streets of the}} Village, feeling bad. My first thought was, at any cost, to get company for the evening.|$|E

I'd been living in LA for about a month and my credit card was stolen and all my money was taken - spent at Home Depot, which was great - and I was ready to pack my bags and go back to Australia because I didn't know how I was going to survive in LA any longer and then I got a <b>call</b> <b>from</b> <b>my</b> manager to say that an audition I'd done months ago for a film had been looked at by the producers of this TV show called The 100 and they wanted me to go in for a reading the next day. So I read the script that night and loved it and went in for the meeting the next day and got the role. Before I knew it I was on a plane to Vancouver to shoot the pilot and my whole life changed."

As I understand it, Hanna-Barbera cast the show and sent some kind of screen test/pilot to the NBC executives in New York. NBC didn't like the choices that had been made.
