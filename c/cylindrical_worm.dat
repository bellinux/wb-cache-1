5000|$|P. equorum is sexually dimorphic, {{the females}} are {{significantly}} larger than males. While males only {{grow up to}} 15-28 cm in length, the females can grow up to 50 cm in length. They are a white colored, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>worm</b> and have three very large lips. Mating occurs in the small intestine of the equid. The female is able to lay over 170,000 eggs in a day, and 60,000,000 eggs in a year. [...] Eggs have a thick, multilayered shell for protection {{and the ability to}} adhere to any surface they touch once expelled. Eggs are expelled in feces, which are then consumed by a horse while eating contaminated grass or drinking contaminated water. In a three-month life cycle, the swallowed eggs become larva and migrate from the small intestines into blood vessels and from there travel to the liver, where they molt into another larval stage. From there, they migrate to the lungs, where they emerge from blood vessels into the alveoli. They spend between 14 and 17 days migrating through the liver and lungs. At this point, they are coughed up and re-swallowed, where the larvae mature into adult roundworms that produce eggs. The worms take from 79 to 110 days to reach adulthood. P. equorum lives by sucking up the liquid contents of the intestine and may occasionally also suck blood from the intestinal wall.|$|E

40|$|Heterogeneous RAFT {{polymerization}} is {{an attractive}} ‘living’ radical polymerization technique to control not only the molecular weight distribution but also the particles size distribution. Here, we demonstrate {{the use of a}} thermoresponsive RAFT macro chain transfer agent (MacroCTA) to form seed particles for the chain extension of styrene to form block copolymer latex particles. By incorporating a few styrene units into the MacroCTA, the polymerizations become faster, producing both narrow particle size and molecular weight distributions. This is due to the ‘superswelling effect’, in which all the seed particles swell with monomer and nucleated at the same time.

40|$|This {{study will}} {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of}} application of computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines in generation of gear tooth surfaces with new topology. This topology decreases gear vibration and will extend the gear capacity and service life. A preliminary investigation by a tooth contact analysis (TCA) program has shown that gear tooth surfaces in line contact (for instance, involute helical gears with parallel axes, worm gear drives with <b>cylindrical</b> <b>worms,</b> etc.) {{are very sensitive to}} angular errors of misalignment that cause edge contact and an unfavorable shape of transmission errors and vibration. The new topology of gear tooth surfaces is based on the localization of bearing contact, and the synthesis of a predesigned parabolic function of transmission errors that is able to absorb a piecewise linear function of transmission errors caused by gear misalignment. The report will describe the following topics: description of kinematics of CNC machines with six degrees of freedom that can be applied for generation of gear tooth surfaces with new topology. A new method for grinding of gear tooth surfaces by a cone surface or surface of revolution based on application of CNC machines is described. This method provides an optimal approximation of the ground surface to the given one. This method is especially beneficial when undeveloped ruled surfaces are to be ground. Execution of motions of the CNC machine is also described. The solution to this problem can be applied as well for the transfer of machine tool settings from a conventional generator to the CNC machine.

40|$|Shapes {{different}} from the traditional ones have been proposed for face worm gears and for conical and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>worms</b> that mesh with them. The proposed shapes {{are based on the}} concept of generating a face worm gear surface by use of a tilted head cutter instead of by the traditional use of a hob. (As used here, head cutter is also meant to signify, alternatively, a head grinding tool.) The gear-surface-generation equipment would be similar to that used for generation of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. In comparison with the corresponding traditional hob, a tilted head cutter according to the proposal would be larger, could be fabricated with greater precision, and would enable the generation of gear surfaces with greater precision and greater productivity. A face worm gear would be generated (see figure) by use of a tilted head cutter, the blades or grinding surfaces of which would have straight-line profiles. The tilt of the head cutter would prevent interference with teeth adjacent to the groove being cut or ground. A worm to mesh with the face worm gear would be generated by use of a tilted head cutter mounted on the cradle of a generating machine. The blades or grinding surfaces of the head cutter would have a parabolic profile and would deviate from the straight-line profiles of the head cutter for the face worm gear. The shortest distance between the worm and the cradle would follow a parabolic function during the cycle of meshing in the generating process to provide a parabolic function of transmission errors to the gear drive. The small mismatch between the profiles of the face-worm-gear and worm head cutters would make it possible to localize the bearing contact in the worm gear drive. The parabolic function of transmission errors could absorb discontinuous linear functions of transmission errors caused by errors of alignment; this could afford a significant benefit, in that such errors are main sources of noise and vibration in gear drives. The main advantage of using tilted head cutters is that cutting speeds are independent of the shape-generation processes, making it possible to choose cutting speeds that are optimum with respect to requirements to minimize temperatures and deformations during fabrication and improve the quality of finished parts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Grinding is a {{final step}} in the {{production}} chain of gears and therefore determines {{the quality of the}} product. In the industrial practice gears are cut- generally by means of a hobbing process- and their surface is hardened through a heat treatment, which has the target of increasing the wear resistance of the tooth flanks. Grinding is therefore necessary to remove the material distortions originating during the heat treatment and to fulfill dimensional and quality requirements. Usually only gears with high quality requirements are ground. Otherwise grinding is not carried out to reduce the production costs. In the recent years however the percentage of ground gears has been growing continuously due to the rising demands on load capacity, quiet running and life time as well as the increasing performance offered by the grinding processes. Generating grinding by means of <b>cylindrical</b> grinding <b>worms</b> shows the highest potential among the existing processes for gear grinding due to the high material removal performance that can be achieved. In order to use dressable worms efficiently the dressing technology has to be optimized. The present contribution describes the technology for dressing vitreous bonded grinding worms. This process is based on the use of form dressing rollers by means of which the grinding worm geometry and topography are generated. The investigations are aimed at analyzing the influence of the dressing parameters, in particular the speed ratio between dressing and grinding tool, and the attainable gear quality and surface properties. The results show significant dependencies between the dressing strategy and the grinding results...|$|R
