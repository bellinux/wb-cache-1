5|$|More {{than twenty}} species of hawk, owl and falcon {{are known to}} {{occasionally}} predate feral starlings in North America, though the most regular predators of adults {{are likely to be}} urban-living peregrine falcons or merlins (Falco columbarius).

Starlings are more commonly the culprits rather than victims of nest eviction however, especially towards other starlings and woodpeckers. Nests can be raided by animals capable of <b>climbing</b> <b>to</b> them, such as stoats (Mustela erminea), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and squirrels (Sciurus spp.), and cats may catch the unwary.|$|E
