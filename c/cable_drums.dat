At 23:47 hours on 8 November, the convoy was attacked by [...] U-161 fired four torpedoes, one of which hit and damaged the merchant ship Benalder and another of which struck West Humhaw. Once it became clear the vessel could not be saved, West Humhaws crew abandoned ship, which sank by the bows in about thirty minutes.

50|$|A {{torsion spring}} {{counterbalance}} system consists {{of one or}} two tightly wound up springs on a steel shaft with <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> at both ends. The entire apparatus mounts on the header wall above the garage door and has three supports: a center bearing plate with a steel or nylon bearing and two end bearing plates at both ends. The springs themselves consist of the steel wire with a stationary cone at one end and a winding cone at the other end. The stationary cone is attached to the center bearing plate. The winding cone consists of holes every 90 degrees for winding the springs and two set screws to secure the springs to the shaft. Steel counterbalance cables run from the roller brackets at the bottom corners of the door to a notch in the <b>cable</b> <b>drums.</b> When the door is raised, the springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the <b>cable</b> <b>drums,</b> wrapping the cables around the grooves on the <b>cable</b> <b>drums.</b> When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension.|$|E

The M32F utilized the standard M4 VVSS suspension while the M40F used the HVSS system. The earlier M4 tank drill used the M4 High Speed Tractor as a carrier. Traxxon also produced a similar machine using the HVSS suspension. Also built and used in British Columbia was the Madill 071 minitower yarder.

25|$|The {{net sounder}} is an echo sounder with a {{transducer}} {{mounted on the}} headline of the net {{rather than on the}} bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there has to be the provision of a <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable less net-sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no <b>cable</b> <b>drum</b> is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.|$|R

50|$|High lead logging is {{a method}} of cable logging using a spar, yarder and loader. It was {{developed}} by Oscar Wirkkala. It is accomplished with two lines (cables) and two winches (or <b>cable</b> <b>drums).</b> The mainline or yarding line extends out from one winch, while a second usually lighter line called the haulback line extends out from the other winch to a 'tail block' or pulley at the tail (back) end of the logging site, and passes through the tail block and connects to the main line. Butt rigging is installed where the two lines join and the logs are hooked to the butt rigging with chokers. The procedure is to wind up the main line and the logs are pulled in, wind up the haulback and the butt rigging is pulled out for more logs or another 'turn'.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the high}} {{take-off}} weight of the B13, the group decided in 1984 to design and construct a new more powerful winch to launch their gliders. Daimler-Benz donated a 320 HP 10-cylinder diesel engine including an axle and <b>cable</b> <b>drums.</b> In addition to achieving a higher performance, the project's aim was to make winch launching safer for modern gliders which have higher minimum speeds during a winch launch, especially on days {{when there is no}} wind or even a light tail-wind. By using big azimuth rollers and inclined inlet guides, the winch is designed to minimize the bending of the cable under load. The groups also designed automatic process controls for the pneumatically driven gearbox actuators;mounted on an all-wheel drive Tatra 148 chassis, the winch was finished in 1994 and has operated with DYNEEMA-plastics cables since 2004.|$|E
50|$|Great {{improvements}} {{were also}} {{made in the}} hoisting apparatus and cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work. As {{the depth of the}} diggings increased, the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical, as their self-weight became a significant fraction of their tensile strength (breaking weight). After hemp rope, iron chains began to become more common. However, fracture was quick, at around half a millisecond. In 1829 Wilhelm Albert had studied and reported on the failure of the iron chains and began creating a twisted metal cabling known as Albert Rope. In 1864 Andrew Smith Hallidie manufactured wire rope and was heavily involved in building early cable bridges and ropeway conveyors; his wire rope went on to be used in San Francisco's famous cable cars, and was also added to the <b>cable</b> <b>drums</b> in the hoist houses on the Comstock Lode. Another innovation, were spring loaded cages. The only way {{in and out of a}} shaft mine, was in the cage, cabled to the hoist.|$|E
