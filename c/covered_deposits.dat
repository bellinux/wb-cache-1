40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the protection of}} taxpayers and depositors in the resolution of banks in the Banking Union. The research question concerns how the protection of taxpayers and depositors has been organized in the Banking Union. The thesis focuses on the Single Resolution Mechanism and Deposit Guarantee Schemes and will not discuss the {{other elements of the}} Banking Union. The protection of taxpayers is discussed vis-à-vis the allocation of the costs of banks under resolution and the protection of depositors in terms of bail-in and Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The thesis answers the research question by employing the doctrinal and practical research methods and thus aims to systematize, interpret and assess the provisions critically. The thesis first {{discusses the}} relevant legal theory on the topic. After that, the thesis provides an outline of the Banking Union and analyses first the allocation of costs of banks in resolution and then the protection of depositors in bail-in and in the Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The primary method used in the burden-sharing arrangement is bail-in, in which the shareholders and creditors of a bank are the first ones to bear losses. The deposits of natural persons and SMEs bear losses after other creditors, and the last ones to bear losses are the Deposit Guarantee Schemes, which cover losses in lieu of <b>covered</b> <b>deposits.</b> A central element of the Single Resolution Mechanism is the Single Resolution Fund, which will be used to cover losses after a bail-in of 8 % of the total liabilities of the bank. In addition to the Single Resolution Fund, the burden-sharing arrangement is supported by the direct recapitalization instrument of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Legal scholars have presented conflicting views on the effectiveness of bail-in, and the new regime may entail risks to taxpayers. However, the negative effects of bail-in seem smaller than the effects of bailouts, so the introduction of bail-in in the burden-sharing system can be deemed an improvement compared to the current situation. The Single Resolution Fund can also improve the position of taxpayers, since the Fund can prevent or at least reduce the need for taxpayers’ funds in the resolution of a bank. However, the target size of the Fund and the long transition period may impair the effectiveness of the Fund. Legal scholars have questioned the effectiveness of bail-in and the Single Resolution Fund especially in a systemic crisis. Because of the uncertainty associated with these instruments as well as the problems concerning the ESM direct recapitalization instrument the position of taxpayers remains risky, and the possibility of bailing out banks with taxpayers’ money cannot be fully excluded. On the other hand, the Banking Union is still work in progress, so the robustness of these instruments remains to be tested. The protection of depositors in bail-in has been ensured in several ways: the deposits of natural persons and SMEs have been granted preference in the order of loss absorption over shareholders and other creditors. The deposits can also be excluded from bail-in under exceptional circumstances. Additionally, deposits not exceeding EUR 100 000 are fully protected from bail-in. The new Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive will improve the protection of depositors in multiple ways. The Directive will provide more consistent level of protection in the Member States and confirms EUR 100 000 as the level of guarantee coverage. The Directive will gradually reduce the payout period of <b>covered</b> <b>deposits</b> from the current 20 working days to 7 working days by 2024. The Directive will establish consistent rules on the funding of Deposit Guarantee Schemes, which will be threefold and the target level of which will be 0. 8 % of <b>covered</b> <b>deposits</b> by 3 rd July 2024. The Directive will also improve the conveyance of information to depositors on Deposit Guarantee Schemes and facilitate the payout process. The Directive will also promote the equal treatment of depositors. The Directive will therefore improve the protection of depositors remarkably and may increase depositors’ confidence in Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The provisions also entail some risks, such as the option of deferral concerning the payout of certain deposits, which, if interpreted broadly, may impair the protection of those depositors to whom the provision applies and place them in a weaker position than other depositors. A major downside of the new Directive {{is the fact that it}} maintains national Deposit Guarantee Schemes and will not introduce an EU wide or at least a euro zone wide common Deposit Guarantee Scheme, which would be much more effective in terms of depositor protection than multiple national ones. The introduction of a common Deposit Guarantee Schemes should be considered in the future, although its introduction does not seem very likely at the moment...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey {{initiated}} {{a project in}} 2015 aimed at evaluating geochemical exploration methods for <b>covered</b> <b>deposits</b> in the northern Midcontintent Rift, employing both site-scale studies and regional geochemical databases. A first group of groundwater samples was collected from unconsolidated material overlying the Spruce Road, Wyman Creek, and Skibo deposits in the Duluth Complex to determine effective sampling methods, characterize the groundwater chemical signature of these deposits, and determine chemical evolution along flow paths. Twenty-seven samples were collected from mini-piezometers at depths < 5 m and analyzed for major and trace element chemistry and stable isotopes of water. Ten samples were also analyzed for groundwater age tracers, including noble gases, 3 H, He isotopes, and chlorofluorocarbons. Site conditions presented challenges for deriving well-constrained specific ages. However, samples could be sorted into the following age categories by employing multiple tracers: < 0. 5 yr; 0. 5 to 2 yr; 2 to 10 yr; and 15 to 30 yr. Cu and Ni concentrations over the deposits range from < 0. 5 to 150 μg/L and from < 1 to 348 μg/L, respectively, and are commonly elevated above background. Cu and Ni are negatively correlated with pH (range of 5. 7 to 8. 6), probably due to progressively more adsorption on negatively charged mineral surfaces at higher pH. The pH also increases with groundwater age, likely due to weathering of abundant mafic minerals. As a result, Cu and Ni concentrations generally decrease with increasing age. These results suggest that pH provides an important limit on Cu and Ni mobility in the groundwater system, which {{must be taken into}} account in designing geochemical exploration approaches. In addition to site-scale work, a regional groundwater chemical database was compiled from available USGS (NWIS) and state databases. Initial examination reveals both geogenic and anthropogenic metal anomalies, and spatial analyses are ongoing...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} consequences {{to be drawn from}} the course of the financial crisis up to now is the insight that more attention must be paid in the future to the factors of liquidity, liquidity management and liquidity protection. That holds true {{for the protection of the}} stability of an individual bank as it does for that of a whole national or even international financial system. The liquidity problems of a bank can certainly have a variety of causes. However, as an examination of the history of bank insolvencies and financial crises shows, an accelerated withdrawal of bank deposits by unsecured customers nearly always leads in the end to the collapse of an institution and, as an ultimate consequence, to a national or even international banking crisis. This insight has also brought the deposit insurance institutions in many countries around the world to the attention of political, regulatory and banking management discussions. The rapid, politically necessary, factually often not well founded, guarantee promises made by many governments have shown those responsible that in Europe the need for a fundamental revision of the present deposit insurance schemes must be urgently addressed. In most industrialized countries of the OECD, as well as in a range of other states, working groups are studying the necessary revisions and adjustments of the relevant institutions to meet the new economic and political conditions. Even if solutions of this sort continue to be arranged differently from one country to another on the basis of differing regulatory, historical and structural circumstances, a consensus is emerging over {{the important}} basic questions of deposit insurance system design and architecture. As a result of the worldwide financial crisis most European countries massively increased their coverage limits for their national deposit insurance schemes in the fall of 2008. Where no deposit insurance existed, it was introduced. Existing systems were critically scrutinized. In most countries the maximum insurance coverage was raised and the eligible deposit base was extended. Some individual states have even promised an unlimited deposit protection (in some cases with a time restriction). Under the pressure of an increasing number of bank failures these promises were made without revising the existing deposit insurance schemes themselves. In the course of 2009, both the individual European states and the EU itself then set about scrutinizing their existing protection schemes and mechanisms and revising the existing national deposit insurance schemes. It is accepted throughout the world that well designed deposit insurance is an important element in a national safety net for maintaining and extending the stability of the financial system. The design and structure, but also the implementation, of a deposit insurance scheme (DIS) of this sort throws up numerous institutional, procedural and instrumental questions. Such operative and strategic issues must be answered against the background of the overall national circumstances and in line with the country specific realities of the respective financial intermediate system. However, there is a series of topics that can be assessed and solved independently of such individual circumstances. This is even more the case since the worldwide revision of the deposit insurance schemes offers the opportunity to create the conditions for a future harmonization of national deposit insurance schemes at least within Europe. An assimilation of this sort is, in turn, the basis for future EU-wide or perhaps even European depositor protection, which, like any broadly based guarantee, would certainly be more efficient than a multitude of national solutions. This publication intends to make a contribution to the ongoing discussion of the complex questions connected with the further development of European deposit insurance schemes. Both complementing and extending the broad range of theoretical literature available, it focuses on some key design questions of modern deposit insurance schemes, on the discussion of their basic structural elements and on the appropriate consequences for the stakeholders in deposit insurance. We focus on: - the derivation of the most important requirements of a modern European deposit insurance, and the - discussion of specific organizational aspects and fundamental institutional requirements as well as of solutions for selected system building blocks. The first chapter analyzes the institutional framework of deposit insurance schemes and its various aspects of cost/benefit considerations. The second chapter discusses the fundamentals of modern deposit insurance. The third chapter examines selected strategic and instrumental questions concerning the organization and implementation of deposit insurance schemes. The fourth chapter focuses on some questions related to the international harmonization and coordination of the design of deposit insurance schemes. In all sections we address some lessons learned from the recent financial turmoil. The fifth chapter finally addresses some conclusions and sketches some policy implications for designing and implementing a modern deposit insurance scheme.

50|$|Climate {{directly}} {{affects the}} rate of weathering and leaching. Wind moves sand and smaller particles (dust), especially in arid regions where there is little plant <b>cover,</b> <b>depositing</b> it close or far from the entrainment source. The type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil, and aid {{in the development of}} different soil profiles. Soil profiles are more distinct in wet and cool climates, where organic materials may accumulate, than in wet and warm climates, where organic materials are rapidly consumed. The effectiveness of water in weathering parent rock material depends on seasonal and daily temperature fluctuations, which favour tensile stresses in rock minerals, and thus their mechanical disaggregation, a process called thermal fatigue. By the same process freeze-thaw cycles are an effective mechanism which breaks up rocks and other consolidated materials.|$|R
