In 1979, West was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983. In March 2008, ESPN voted West the third greatest shooting guard of all time. As a coach, West led the Lakers into three consecutive playoff campaigns, and then went on to win seven NBA championships as a general manager, building the 1980s Lakers dynasty under coach Pat Riley and players Magic Johnson, Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy and the 2000s under <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> and players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Lakers are a {{professional}} basketball team based in Los Angeles, California that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA), which was formerly called the Basketball Association of America (BAA). Since 1999, the Lakers have played their home games at Staples Center. The Lakers' franchise {{was founded in}} 1947 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The first owners purchased the disbanded Gems from Detroit, Michigan, then renamed and moved the team. It was in Minneapolis where the Lakers received their official title from Minnesota's nickname, Land of 10,000 Lakes. The Lakers won five championships before relocating to Los Angeles for the 1960–61 NBA season. The Lakers went on to lose all of their eight appearances in the NBA Finals in the 1960s, {{despite the presence of}} Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. In , the Lakers compiled a 33-game winning streak, the longest streak in U.S. professional team sports, and won their sixth title, under coach Bill Sharman. The Lakers' popularity soared in the 1980s when they won five additional championships during a nine-year span with the help of Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy and coach Pat Riley, the franchise's all-time leader in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins. Two of those championships during that span were against their arch-rivals, the Boston Celtics. With the help of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and Hall of Fame <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson,</b> the Lakers played in seven NBA Finals between 2000 and 2010, winning three of them consecutively from 2000 to 2002, losing the next two in 2004 and 2008, and winning in 2009 and 2010; the last three appearances were without O'Neal.|$|E
5|$|Challenged by Lakers' <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> {{to be more}} {{assertive}} while Bryant recovered from offseason knee surgery, Gasol started the season's first week averaging 25.3 points on 52.5 percent shooting, 10.3 rebounds, and five assists per game as the Lakers started 3–0. He was named Western Conference Player of the Week. He earned his third straight All-Star selection and his season averages of 19 points and 10 rebounds were nearly identical {{to what he had}} put up as a Laker the previous three seasons. Pau's play also merited him All-NBA second team honors {{for the first time in}} his career. In the playoffs, Gasol only averaged 13 points on 42% shooting over 10 games, and the Lakers were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Gasol had the worst post season performance of his career. Lakers Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst Magic Johnson cited Gasol as a possible trade option for the Lakers to acquire Magic center Dwight Howard. Gasol ignored the false reports about his relationship status with his girlfriend as the cause of his poor performance and has accepted the criticism of his play as valid. During the 2011–12 NBA season, Gasol and teammate Lamar Odom were subjected to trade rumors involving former New Orleans Hornets guard Chris Paul. After the trade fell through, Gasol vowed that it would not affect the way he played. Odom, on the other hand, was angry at the Laker organization and was traded to the 2010–11 NBA champion Dallas Mavericks for a future first round pick. After Lakers co-captain Derek Fisher was traded in March 2012, Gasol joined Bryant as co-captains of the team. He won the 2011–12 seasonlong NBA Community Assist Award.|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} year with the Los Angeles Lakers, Odom {{incurred}} a left shoulder injury which forced him to miss {{the end of the}} 2004–05 season.

25|$|The Bulls {{saw their}} {{greatest}} success during the 1990s, {{when they were}} responsible for popularizing the NBA worldwide.

All six championship teams were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson.</b> The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships and never lose an NBA Finals series in their history.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the 1990s was marked by the supremacy of the Chicago Bulls, which saw them appear in six Finals. <b>Coached</b> by <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> and led by NBA superstar Michael Jordan, the Bulls won a title in every single appearance to the Finals from 1991 to 1998.

25|$|Coming {{off their}} franchise's first NBA Finals game victory, the Magic quickly {{took the lead}} in the first quarter. However, Kobe Bryant kept the Lakers in the game, scoring 13 of the team's 20 first-quarter points. Dwight Howard played a great first quarter, with 11 rebounds and 4 blocks in the opening frame. In addition, he drew many fouls, putting Andrew Bynum, Pau Gasol, and Lamar Odom in foul trouble and forcing Lakers <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> to use Josh Powell and D. J. Mbenga early in the game. The Magic were able to {{increase}} the lead to 12 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|On May 13, 1994, {{at the end}} of Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls and the New York Knicks {{were tied}} at 102 with 1.8 seconds left. Bulls <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> {{designed}} the last play for Kukoč, with Scottie Pippen charged with inbounding the basketball. Pippen was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Kukoč did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, though the Bulls eventually lost the series in seven games.|$|E
25|$|The {{balance of}} power shifted to the Western Conference, and the NBA was {{dominated}} by the Los Angeles Lakers, who won titles in 2000, '01, '02, '09, and '10, and the San Antonio Spurs, who won in '99, '03, '05, '07 and '14. The Lakers hired former Bulls <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson,</b> and Shaquille O'Neal thrived in Jackson's triangle offense. The San Antonio Spurs were initially led by the 'Twin Towers' tandem of center David Robinson and power forward Tim Duncan. With the arrival of Duncan, the veteran Robinson modified his game by playing primarily in the high post to accommodate Duncan's strengths as a low-post scorer and defender.|$|E
50|$|Cleamons {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} coach for the Chicago Bulls from 1989 to 1996. He was the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks for slightly over one year, from 1996 to 1997. He was then the head coach of the Chicago Condors of the American Basketball league, a short-lived women's professional basketball league in the mid Nineties. He also served {{as an assistant coach}} for the Los Angeles Lakers and New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. For a few games during his tenure with the Lakers, he served as acting head <b>coach</b> while <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> was absent.|$|R
50|$|The {{first meeting}} {{occurred}} {{in the first round}} of the 1992 NBA Playoffs. The Bulls, led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, and <b>coached</b> by <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson,</b> were the defending champions and had accumulated a 67-15 record, the Central Division title, and the top seed in the East. The Heat, with Glen Rice, Steve Smith, and Rony Seikaly, reached the NBA Playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a 38-44 record, which made them the 8th seed. The Bulls swept Miami in three games en route to their second straight NBA title.|$|R
50|$|In 1995-96, Harper's 10th NBA season, {{he played}} in and started 80 games, with his playing time {{increasing}} to 23.6 minutes per game and his scoring average to 7.4 ppg. It was a record-setting season for the Bulls as the team, <b>coached</b> by <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> and led by Jordan and Scottie Pippen and with Harper playing a key role, had a then NBA all-time best record of 72-10, then defeated the Miami Heat, New York Knicks, and Orlando Magic {{in the first three}} rounds of the playoffs en route to winning their fourth NBA championship four games to two over the Seattle SuperSonics.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} commemorate the 20th anniversary of their first NBA Championship in 1991, the Chicago Bulls {{organization}} honored the 1991 Chicago Bulls Championship team in a ceremony during halftime of a game versus the Utah Jazz on March 12, 2011. Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan both attended and participated in the celebration, where they were reunited with their former teammates John Paxson, Horace Grant, Stacey King, Craig Hodges, Will Perdue, Scott Williams, Cliff Levingston, Dennis Hopson and Assistant Coach Johnny Bach. Former head <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> did not participate but gave a speech via a video message. Former Bulls' broadcaster Jim Durham emceed the halftime ceremony.|$|E
25|$|They {{managed to}} put it all {{together}} that season, winning a then-franchise record 61 games. Jordan won the scoring title for a fifth consecutive season, but the team was no longer a one-man show of years past. Instead, Jordan distributed the ball with regularity, {{thanks in large part to}} the triangle offense instituted by head <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> and assistant Tex Winter. This gave the Bulls additional offensive weapons to choose from, ranging from wingman Scottie Pippen and post players Horace Grant and Bill Cartwright to shooters such as John Paxson and B. J. Armstrong. Jordan's improved all-around play earned him his second MVP award.|$|E
25|$|In 1989–90, Jordan led {{the league}} in scoring for the fourth {{straight}} season, and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Pippen. There was also a major change during the off-season, where head coach Doug Collins was replaced by assistant <b>coach</b> <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson.</b> The Bulls also picked up rookie center Stacey King and rookie point guard B.J. Armstrong in the 1989 draft. With these additional players and the previous year's starting five, the Bulls again made it to the Conference Finals, and pushed the Pistons to seven games before being eliminated for the third straight year, the Pistons going on to repeat as NBA champions.|$|E
50|$|The 1999-2000 season brought upon four huge changes: a {{new home}} floor at Staples Center (which they share with the city rival Los Angeles Clippers), newer, more modern jerseys {{replacing}} the ones worn by the Lakers since the late 70's, a new <b>coach</b> in <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson,</b> and a new system: the triangle offense. The new philosophy proved to be potent, as the Lakers started off strong, winning 31 of their first 36 games. They also were able to string together winning streaks of 16, 19, and 11 games, becoming only the third team in NBA history to have three double-digit streaks in one season.|$|R
5000|$|With their co-tenants at Chicago Stadium, the Bulls, <b>coached</b> by <b>Phil</b> <b>Jackson</b> {{and led by}} Michael Jordan, {{playing in}} (and winning) the NBA Finals, it was an {{opportunity}} for both the Blackhawks and the Bulls to help the city of Chicago become the first city to have both NHL and NBA championships in the same year. (New York also had this opportunity in 1994, when the Knicks and Rangers made the finals in their respective sport; however, the result was the same, albeit a reversal of Chicago's ending, as the Rangers won their first Stanley Cup since 1940, and the Knicks lost, with both of those series going the full seven games.) ...|$|R
500|$|The Chicago Bulls are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Chicago, Illinois. They are {{a member of}} the Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
