Field surveys were conducted to monitor the cycle times associated with the harvesting and transport operations. After optimisation, these parameters were fed into a computer simulation model to generate the number of transport units required to haul the mechanically harvested cane, when the harvester idle time is either zero or 10 % of a normal ten-hour working day. A cost analysis was used to establish a boundary, defined in kilometres, either side of which represents the economic feasibility of the respective methods.

40|$|Introduction: The {{performance}} of agricultural machines {{depends on the}} reliability of the equipment used, the maintenance efficiency, the operation process, the technical expertise of workers, etc. As the size and complexity of agricultural equipment continue to increase, the implications of equipment failure become even more critical. Machine failure probability is (1 -R) and R is machine reliability (Vafaei et al., 2010). Moreover, system reliability is the probability that an item will perform a required function without failure under stated conditions for a stated period of time (Billinton and Allan, 1992). Therefore, we must be able to create an appropriate compromise between maintenance methods and acceptable reliability levels. Precision failure data gathering in a farm is a worthwhile work, because these can represent a good estimate of machine reliability combining the effects of machine loading, surrounding effects and incorrect repair and maintenance. Each machine based on its work conditions, parts combinationand manufacturing process follows a failures distribution function depending on the environment where the machine work and the machine’s specifications (Meeker and Escobar, 1998). General failures distributions for contiguous data are normal, log-normal, exponential and Weibull (Shirmohamadi, 2002). Each machine can represent proportionate behavior with these functions in short or long time. Materials and methods: The study area was the Hakim Farabi agro-industry Company located 35 kilometers south of Ahvaz in Iran. Arable lands of this company are located in 31 to 31 ° 10 N latitude and 45 to 48 ° 36 E longitudes. The region has dry and warm climate. A total of 24 Austoft 7000 sugarcane <b>chopper</b> <b>harvester</b> are being used in the company. Cane harvesters were divided into 3 group consisting of old, middle aged and new. From each group, one machine was chosen. Data from maintenance reports of harvesters which have been recorded within 400 hours were used. Usually, two methods are usedfor machine reliability modeling. The first is Pareto analysis and the second is statistical modeling of failure distributions (Barabadi and Kumar, 2007). For failures distribution modeling data need to be found, that are independent and identically (iid) distributed or not. For this, trend test and serial correlation tests are used. If the data has a trend, those are not iid and its parameters are computed from the power law process. For the data that does not havea trend, serial correlation testare performed. If the correlation coefficient is less than 0. 05 the data is not iid. Therefore, its parameters reach via branching poison process or other similar methods; if the correlation coefficient is more than 0. 05, the data are iid. Therefore, the classical statistical methods will be used for reliability modeling. Trend test results are compared with statistical parameter. A test for serial correlation was also done by plotting the ith TBF against the (i- 1) th TBF, i ¼ 1; 2;...; n: If the plotted points are randomly scattered without any pattern, it can be interpreted that there is no correlation in general among the TBFs data and the data is independent. To continue, one must choose as the best fit distribution for TBF data. Few tests can be used for best fit distribution that include chi squared test and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test. Chi squared test is not valid when the data are less than 50. Therefore, when the TBF data are less than 50, K-S test must be used. Hence, the K-S test can be used for each TBF data numbers. When the failure distribution has been determined, the reliability model may be computed by equation (2). Results and discussion: Results of trend analysis for TBF data of sugarcane harvester machines showed that the calculated statistics U for all machines was more than chi squared value that was extracted fromthe chi square table with 2 (n- 1) degrees of freedom and 5 percent level of significance. Hence, it is possible that all of the machines’ TBF data will have identically and independent distributions. For validating this hypothesis, correlation testwas performed on TBF data that verified prior results. Then, Kolmogorov- Simonov test was done on TBF data. Results showed that all three machines followed Weibull 3 parameters function, but the shape parameter was different for them. The analysis showed the shape parameter for old, middle aged and new cane harvesters was 1. 5, 1. 42 and 1. 35, respectively. Conclusions: In order to control and reduce failures and to plan and schedule the harvester operations in optimum time, machine reliability must be known. In this paper, three sugarcane harvesters were studied individually. From the trend analysis and serial correlation, it is seen thatthe assumption of identically and being independently distributed was valid for all machines’ TBF data of sugarcane <b>chopper</b> <b>harvesters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Resumo: No Brasil, a agroindústria canavieira processa 318 milhões de toneladas de cana-de-açúcar por ano (UNICA, 2003). Atualmente, de 5 a 15 % desta matéria-prima é perdida no campo, quando o corte é feito manual ou mecanizado respectivamente, representando um prejuízo da ordem de US$ 450 milhões por ano. Devido a lei governamental n° 11. 241 de 19 / 09 / 2002, o corte tende a tornar-se apenas de cana crua, sem queimar, inviabilizando o corte manual. Desta forma, as perdas devem permanecer próximas do último valor. Este trabalho parte da hipótese de que é possível desenvolver alternativas tecnológicas, como o aprimoramento dos componentes e sistemas das colhedoras de cana-de-açúcar picada, para minimizar este desperdício. Pretendeu-se, inicialmente, quantificar as perdas impossíveis de serem levantadas diretamente no campo (perdas invisíveis), já que as perdas visíveis são conhecidas, e a incidência de matéria estranha na cana processada pelas colhedoras de cana picada. Mantendo-se as colhedoras sob condições controladas, os ensaios foram realizados em um galpão de manutenção de máquinas da Usina São João/Araras-SP e na oficina de protótipos agrícolas do Centro de Tecnologia da Copersucar-CTC, de janeiro/ 1997 a março/ 2000. As colhedoras, que permaneceram estacionárias, foram alimentadas por uma esteira rolante acionada pelo motor hidráulico. Nos ensaios de perdas invisíveis foram utilizadas, inicialmente, canas limpas, desfolhadas e despontadas e depois canas com folhas e pontas. Para a determinação das impurezas vegetais na carga, foram processados colmos integrais, com folhas e ponteiros, simulando a condição adversa de canavial tombado. Por meio da análise dos dados quantificados nos ensaios de cana com palha, concluiu-se que as perdas invisíveis nos sistemas das colhedoras variaram de 2 a 11 %, e são maiores na cana com maior teor de fibra e mais torta e na cana com palha em relação à cana sem palha. A eficiência de limpeza da matéria-prima ficou entre 74 % na base matéria seca, para a velocidade angular de rotação das pás do extrator primário de 1000 rpm e 89 % para a velocidade de 1200 rpm. Os resultados apontaram que o fluxo de massa de cana que alimenta a colhedora não tem influência nas {{magnitudes}} das perdas invisíveis totais de cana e na eficiência de limpeza na matéria-prima. Baseado nos resultados obtidos na primeira fase, na segunda etapa apresentou-se 4 propostas para a regulagem, ajustes e o aperfeiçoamento dos componentes das colhedoras. A primeira proposta foi verificar a possibilidade de utilização de uma mini-câmera para ser instalada junto ao disco de corte de base para auxiliar o operador da colhedora no controle da altura de corte. A segunda proposta avaliada foi a eficiência de um novo mecanismo de controle de altura do corte de base flutuante, capaz de acompanhar as ondulações do terreno. Observou-se, durante as safras 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 e 2001 / 2002, que o mecanismo avaliado é eficiente, robusto e que oferece uma rápida resposta na altura requerida. Os resultados obtidos nos testes de campo, indicam que o corte de base flutuante tem um desempenho melhor que o convencional. Demonstram que o índice de impureza mineral na carga, a quantidade de soqueiras arrancadas e de perdas visíveis no campo são menores quando a colhedora trabalha em cana comercial equipada com o conjunto corte basal flutuante. O trabalho, também, avaliou a possibilidade de se utilizar um material alternativo (ferro fundido branco) para as facas dos rolos picadores em substituição ao padrão aço mola, visando, sem sucesso, aumentar a resistência ao desgaste e ao impacto destas peças. A quarta proposta foi o uso de um monitor de perdas instalado no extrator primário da colhedora. Avaliou-se o desempenho deste monitor trabalhando no campo e quantificando as perdas visíveis de cana e a eficiência de limpeza do extrator primário em relação a variação da rotação do ventilador. Utilizou-se para monitorar as perdas um sensor piezoelétrico que apresentou boa sensibilidade aos impactos contra o capuz do extrator primário. Observou-se também uma boa correlação entre os dados de eficiência de limpeza e perdas com os valores registrados pelo monitor. Assim, o presente trabalho visa reduzir os custos do processamento de cana minimizando as perdas e melhorando o desempenho das colhedoras de cana picada, aumentando a competitividade do setor. Abstract: The Brazilian {{sugar cane}} industry crashes 318 millions tones of sugarcane a year. Nowadays, from 5 to 15 % this raw material {{is lost in}} the field, when the harvesting is done by hand or mecanized respectively, given a damage about US$ 450 millions a year, since only 15 % is mechanical harvested. Due to a environmental government law green cane harvesting will be compulsory, in few years, so the losses must be keeping nearly the last number. The hipotesis for this work {{is that it is}} possible to make use of technologicals alternatives, to improve the components and internals systems to process raw material inside the sugar cane chopped harvesters, to minimize this waste. The purpose of this research was to determine the invisible losses (which are impossible to be located in the field) because the visible losses are already known, and the incidence of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the sugarcane processed by <b>chopper</b> <b>harvesters.</b> Trials carried out under controlled conditions at the maintenance workshop of São João Sugar mill (Araras-SP) and at the agricultural prototypes workshop of Centro de Tecnologia Copersucar (Piracicaba-SP), from January / 1997 till march/ 2000. The harvesters, which stayed stationary, were fed by a conveyor driven by a hydraulic motor. For the tests of invisible losses clean cane whithout leaves, straw and tops was used first, afther that, the wholestalks were processed with leaves and tops, also to determine vegetable impurities in the load, simulating adverse condition of lodged cane crop. The pneumatic cleaning systems velocity, extractors in the harvesters, affected the magnitude of invisible losses and the amount of vegetable impurities in the load. The largest invisible losses in the cane processed by the harvesters occured due to choppers and base cutter waste knives and they were higher at the primary extrator followed by the base cutter in all over the components and internals systems of the harvesters. The harvester had higher invisible losses in cane with leaves than in cane whithout leaves, and they were highest in the hard cane (higher fibre) and lodged and tangled cane. The values of invisible losses and incidence of amount of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the load, due to the different adjustments of pneumatic cleaning systems of the harvesters, are analysed and discussed in this work. Based on the first step data, it intends on the second step to show four proposals to set up, to adjust and to improve the harvester’s components. First of all, this work want to verify to use of a mini camera helping the harvesters’ operators control the base cutter’s height. At the beginning of this research a novel system for controlling base cutter cutting height was designed and manufactured in an attempt to improve the performance of commercial sugarcane <b>chopper</b> <b>harvesters.</b> The system differed from previous attempts to control base cutter height by suspending the base cutter gearbox and associated components as a discrete module incorporating a passive height control system. The advantages offered by this system include the potential for rapid response to cutting height requirements, the elimination of the secondary effects of base cutter height adjustments on topper height setting and, being fully mechanical, the system does not require additional hydraulic or mechanical control. This paper reviews the results of a testing programme undertaken on the floating base cutter system during the 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002 harvesting seasons with machines working in commercial cane fields. The results of the trial programme indicated that the mineral trash levels in loads transported from field to mill were consistently lower from machines fitted with the floating base cutter system relative to standard machines. The amounts of butts left in the field, of roots and stools removed from the field were also lower with the floating base cutter, however, under the conditions of the tests, statistical significance was not achieved. At the end, this research want to assess the chopper knives made of alternative material (white cast iron) to minimize the wearing and breaking by impacts, and it checks the Cane Loss Monitor working on primary extractor aimed to reduce raw material losses and improve the cleanliness of the cane load to the mill The proposed work aims to reduce the sugar cane processed costs minimizing the losses and improves to the chopped harvesters performance...|$|R

This method consisted of a torque transmitting shaft equipped with laser-based encoders to monitor twist in a real time mode. The unit output could be exported to a computer via a microcontroller installed into the interface device. For calibration of the torque meter output with material feed rate in lab conditions, a conveyor was used to feed homogenous amount of material at a specific rate to the chopper. The experiment was conducted at 3 feed rates of silage corn and at 3 feed roll speeds of the chopper with 3 replications. Correlation between the feed rate and recorded power at different gears of the chopper was established.

HarringtonHayscapes, or haying landscapes, are {{distinctive}} cultural landscapes that evolve {{through time}} {{as a result of}} technological changes in response to economic realities. Since settlement began in the western United States, hay-making has gone through a number of mechanical revolutions that have given rise to an assortment of different methods employed in the process of gathering and storing hay. For this research, the changes in haying technology and resulting cultural landscapes are divided into four eras based on the haying methods of the time in western Montana and eastern Idaho.

40|$|A global push towards {{renewable}} energy {{has seen the}} birth of cogeneration in Australian sugar mills. To maximise {{the amount of energy}} extracted from the material, whole crop harvesting has been introduced, where a higher proportion of total biomass is sent to the mill. The adverse affect of this is a significant reduction in bulk density of the harvested material. Transport costs to harvester owners and millers significantly increase as bin weights are reduced, and therefore there is a case for developing a <b>harvester</b> <b>chopper</b> system which maintains bin weight as the amount of trash sent to the mill increases. A single drum chopper system was developed in this study and a prototype was constructed for experimental assessment of the performance of the system. Cane and juice losses and billet quality were measured for a range of operational conditions which included varying the chopper drum speed and material pour rate. The cutting process was captured by high speed photography for analysis into the causes of damage and losses. Speeding up the chopper drum and therefore shortening the billet length proved to have the most detrimental effect on system performance, with reducing the target billet length from 200 mm to 100 mm resulting in over three times the overall losses. An increase in pour rate did not {{have a significant effect on}} losses or billet quality. For the set of trial conditions most closely representing those previously done with differential choppers, the single drum system produced similar efficiency results. However, the advantages of this system are most prominent in whole crop harvesting where shorter billets are required to maintain bin weights. A number of modifications to the concept are suggested which are expected to significantly enhance the performance of the concept in future trials...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in ground-based mechanized harvesting systems in the western United States as harvest of second growth increased. A major reason for that interest is that labor productivity using conventional methods decreases with smaller tree size. In Turkey, the application of mechanization is currently low due to low labor costs and high fuel costs. However, changing economic conditions might increase interest in mechanized harvesting systems in Turkey. To select the most profitable harvesting equipment under given operating conditions, the harvesting manager must know how to determine logging costs to evaluate alternative systems effectively. Analytical methods were used in this project to estimate machine cost and productivity for different harvesting system combinations. Animal logging was also considered because highly mechanized timber harvest systems are expensive, and energy consuming. Animals and farm tractors are the major energy sources for agricultural and forestry work and transportation in Turkey. A small amount of animal skidding also takes a place in forestry operations in the western United States to reduce environmental impact. Forty-two machines were selected from six categories of ground-based forest harvesting machines, including skidder, forwarder, <b>harvester,</b> feller-buncher, <b>loader,</b> and crawler tractor. Machine rates were estimated for selected forest harvesting machines under representative conditions in both western United States and in Turkey. Cable harvesting systems are described but not analyzed. A microcomputer spreadsheet program was developed to calculate machine rates. Harvesting operations from stump to truck were investigated {{to have a clear}} picture of harvesting operations including fellling and bucking, skidding, forwarding, yarding, and loading. Harvesting production and harvesting costs were determined depending on the types of equipment being operated. To estimate production rates for specific logging equipment, cycle time was obtained from the production equations as a dependent variable, and converted to production using log size, volume, or weight. Production equations are based on studies that have provided useful data to investigate productivity of the logging equipment under various harvesting conditions. Finally, the most economical machine combination, which minimizes the unit cost of logging, was investigated for three different regions of Turkey. The data including topographic data, road data, tree and log data, soil data, and cost data was collected from selected sample plots of each region as representative conditions. In the sample plots selected from Black Sea and Aegean regions, the cut-to-length system using four sawyers and a forwarder produced wood on the truck at the lowest cost, 11. 18 /rn 3, and 13. 88 /m 3, respectively. In the sarnple plots selected from Mediterranean region, the whole-tree systern using four sawyers, a grapple skidder, and a loader produced wood at the lowest cost (9. 20 /m 3). This compared to an estirnated logging cost of about 7. 00 /m 3 to 10. 00 /rn 3 in Turkey using chain saw felling, oxen skidding and rnanual loadin...|$|R
