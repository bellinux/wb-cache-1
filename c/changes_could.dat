5|$|On 26 April 1990, GM's New Zealand {{subsidiary}} Holden New Zealand {{announced that}} {{production at the}} assembly plant based in Trentham would be phased out and vehicles would be imported duty-free—this came after the 1984 closure of the Petone assembly line due to low output volumes. During the 1990s, Holden, other Australian automakers and trade unions pressured the Australian Government to halt the lowering of car import tariffs. By 1997, {{the federal government had}} already cut tariffs to 22.5percent, from 57.5percent ten years earlier; by 2000, a plan was formulated to reduce the tariffs to 15percent. Holden was critical, saying that Australia's population was not large enough, and that the <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> tarnish the local industry.|$|E
5|$|The German naval staff hoped {{all these}} <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> be {{accomplished}} by April 1943, with the carrier's first sea trials taking place in August that year. Towards that end, Chief Engineer Wilhelm Hadeler was reassigned to oversee Graf Zeppelins completion. Hadeler planned on getting the two inner shafts and their respective propulsion systems operational first, giving the ship an initial speed of 2526 knots, fast enough for sea trials to commence and for conducting air training exercises. By the winter of 19431944 she {{was expected to be}} combat-ready.|$|E
5|$|A {{bigger problem}} was the {{resistance}} of the Shipbuilding Commissariat which said {{it would be impossible to}} lay down any ships of new design until about 1950 and that only incremental <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> be made to the designs currently in production. The Navy saw no reason why new ships, reflecting wartime experience, could not be laid down beginning in 1948. To resolve the dispute a special commission was appointed, led by Lavrentiy Beria, which mostly sided with the Shipbuilding Commissariat in that most ships of the program would be improved versions of current designs. Four of the large cruisers were to begin construction, two each at Shipyard 402 in Molotovsk and Shipyard 444 at Nikolayev with another three planned to be laid down in 1953 and 1955. This compromise was approved on 27 November 1945 and detailed design work began in 1946 for designs equipped with both the 220mm and 305mm guns.|$|E

5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|Following Charan Singh's resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to {{look into}} the {{possibility}} of forming an alternate government. Reddy, convinced {{that they would not be}} able to form one, accepted Singh's advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn in after the election. Reddy's decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed as many as seven ordinances on a broad range of matters from effecting changes in company law, providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the ordinances arguing that such momentous <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> not be made by a caretaker government.|$|E
5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya {{proved to}} be very bow-heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates. The {{ammunition}} for the forward 12-inch guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each while the 130mm ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun {{in an attempt to}} compensate for her trim. This did not fully cure the problem, but Imperatritsa Mariya was lost before any other <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> be implemented. This did not fully cure the problem so Volias, as she was known by then, forward pair of 130mm guns were removed while she was fitting out. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not suffer from the same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns.|$|E

5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{administration}} could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand. Thus, a king might increase {{the income of}} the temples of a god he favored, and mortuary temples of recent rulers tended to siphon off resources from temples to pharaohs long dead. The most drastic means of controlling the temple estates was to completely revise the distribution of their property nationwide, which might extend to closing down certain temples. Such <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> significantly alter Egypt's economic landscape. The temples were thus important instruments with which the king managed the nation's resources and its people. As the direct overseers of their own economic sphere, the administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed {{a challenge to the}} authority of a weak pharaoh, although it is unclear how independent they were.|$|E

Battisti and Naylor (2009) concluded that such <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> have very serious effects on agriculture, particularly in the tropics.

25|$|Although {{acquisition}} planning can {{be useful}} to governments, there are several problems that must be considered. Even with a solid evaluation and assessment system, the effects of planning methods can never be certain; governments must consider the effects on other aspects of state planning, such as economic and political planning. Some proposed acquisition <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> also be too drastic or instituted too suddenly without proper planning and organization. Acquisition planning can also be financially draining, so adequate planning and awareness of financial resources is essential. It is important therefore that government goals, such as those described above, be organized and planned carefully.|$|E
25|$|Creator and showrunner J.

Harlan Ellison, a creative consultant on the show, received story credits for two episodes. Each writer was informed of the overarching storyline, enabling the show to be produced consistently under-budget. The rules of production were strict; scripts were written six episodes in advance, and <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> not be made once production had started.|$|E
25|$|Migrating {{butterflies}} {{often have}} smaller and lighter body sizes {{that allow them}} to fly longer distances. Additionally, these butterflies tend to have larger wing-to-body ratios. Temperatures and day length have been found to influence development. When larvae were exposed to short days and cool temperatures (20 °C), similar to conditions found in the spring, larval development was accelerated. This produced small adults with low body weights, ideal for migration. A similar phenomenon occurred when the larvae were exposed to longer days at warm temperatures (30 °C), conditions similar to those in the late summer. Seasonal <b>changes</b> <b>could</b> trigger the development of spring and fall body forms that are ideal for the migration patterns described above.|$|E
