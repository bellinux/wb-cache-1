40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Canister</b> is {{used for}} carrying, storing and {{launching}} of missile. During storage and launching, the <b>canister</b> is subjected to internal pressure of 45 kgf/cm 2 and external pressure of 9 kgf/cm 2. The <b>canister</b> is generally placed inside the testing chamber. <b>Canister</b> testing chamber {{is one of the}} most critical components in Defence Organization. The Primary objective of this paper is to design a <b>canister</b> testing chamber and predicting the failure performance of <b>canister</b> testing chamber using ANSYS a finite element analysis package. The structure of the <b>canister</b> testing chamber is determined on the basis of empirical of gun design and experimental data of Ballistic Research Laboratories (BRL). First a three- Dimensional model of a <b>canister</b> chamber is made in Uni Graphics and then stress analysis is carried out using ANSYS. Contact analysis on <b>canister</b> testing chamber is also carried out using ANSYS to estimate the gap between contact surfaces of bolt region of <b>canister</b> testing chamber...|$|R

40|$|The Genesis science <b>canister</b> is an {{aluminum}} cylinder (75 cm diameter and 35 cm tall) hinged at the mid-line for opening. This <b>canister</b> was cleaned and assembled in an ISO level 4 (Class 10) clean room at Johnson Space Center (JSC) prior to launch. The clean solar collectors were installed and the <b>canister</b> {{closed in the}} cleanroom to preserve collector cleanliness. The <b>canister</b> remained closed until opened on station at Earth-Sun L 1 for solar wind collection. At the conclusion of collection, the <b>canister</b> was again closed to preserve collector cleanliness during Earth return and re-entry. Upon impacting the dry Utah lakebed at 300 kph the science <b>canister</b> integrity was breached. The <b>canister</b> was returned to JSC. The <b>canister</b> shell was briefly examined, imaged, gently cleaned of dust and packaged for storage in anticipation of future detailed examination.

5|$|Owing to the {{original}} 1938 design of the battleships, the Tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to the Iowa-class unless the battleships were physically rebuilt {{in such a way}} as to accommodate the missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch the Tomahawks. This realization prompted the removal of the anti-aircraft guns previously installed on the Iowas and the removal of four of each of the battleships' ten 5"/38DP mounts. The mid and aft end of the battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile magazines. This resulted in the construction of two separate platforms, one located between the first and second funnel and one located behind the second funnel, to which MK-143 Armored Box Launcher (ABL) <b>canisters</b> could be attached. Each Armored Box Launcher carried four missiles, and each of the battleships was outfitted with eight <b>canisters,</b> enabling the Iowa-class to carry and fire a total of 32 Tomahawk missiles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Canister</b> testing Chamber {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} components in Defence Organization. Unavailability of data and literature regarding Missile <b>Canister,</b> are considered to be one of the main contributors for the failure of manufacturing <b>Canister</b> Chambers in a local industry. <b>Canister</b> is used for carrying, storing and launching of missile. During storage and launching, the <b>canister</b> is subjected to an internal pressure of 45 kg/cm 2 and external pressure of 9 kg/cm 2. So it is very important to test the <b>canister</b> for these pressures. A <b>Canister</b> testing chamber is used to test the <b>canister</b> for both internal and external pressures. For testing the <b>canister</b> itâ€™s both ends shall be closed by dummy dished ends. The test chamber will be used for testing of the integrated <b>canister</b> assembly for an external pressure of 9 kg/cm 2 and internal pressure of 45 kg/cm 2. As the testing chamber is subjected to these high pressures it shall be tested for any leakages through the hinged dished end. So the analysis of contact gap between this dished end and the shell of the chamber is to be done. To estimate the contact gap analysis a three-dimensional model of a <b>canister</b> testing chamber was made by finite element method using Uni Graphics...|$|R

5|$|The RLM had {{acquired}} {{an interest in}} rocket boosters fitted {{for the sake of}} simplicity below the wings of a heavily loaded bomber to cut down the length of runway needed for takeoff.

5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film <b>canisters</b> wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E

Jetman has to first assemble his rocket, which spawns in separate parts that are scattered around a map, and then fills it with six fuel <b>canisters</b> before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is repeated.

5|$|After encountering {{the three}} servile groups, the player begins {{to learn of}} a group of foreigners known as Sholai, explorers who have been shipwrecked on the island. It was the Sholai, led by a man named Trajkov, who {{attacked}} the player with their last remaining ship. Trajkov controls a device called the Geneforge, created by the Shapers, which can rewrite the user's DNA and make them incredibly powerful. This is the cause of the island's Barred status, the device was deemed too dangerous in the wrong hands. Trajkov and his followers have allied themselves with the Takers, absorbing the contents of <b>canisters</b> and trying to claim Shaper powers as their own. The group have been unable to activate the Geneforge itself due to a Shaper being needed to activate the device. A Shaper named Goettsch was kidnapped for this purpose, {{in the same manner as}} the player-character. Goettsch fled and stole the shaping gloves needed to safely use the Geneforge, causing Trajkov to attempt to kidnap the player as a replacement. During these events, some Sholai have escaped from their increasingly violent and unpredictable leader.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the feasibility of}} emplacing DOE-owned defense nuclear waste from weapons production into a permanent borehole repository drilled ~ 4 km into granite basement rock. Two <b>canister</b> options were analyzed throughout the thesis: the <b>canister</b> currently used by the DOE for vitrified defense waste and a reference <b>canister</b> with a smaller diameter.
