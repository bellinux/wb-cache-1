40|$|Changes in Romanian {{accounting}} system have been articulated with priority to financial accounting, without leaving aside management accounting. Changes in management accounting covered a few general indicative directions giving to managers enhanced skills regarding the organisation {{and function of}} this branch of the {{accounting system}}. Roumanian regulations offered solutions[16] regarding the accounts and records in managerial accounting, but all these elements are recommendations. In the Roumanian chart of accounts there is a specific <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts,</b> class number 9 -accounts for management accounting, but this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> is an optional one. In fact {{there are a lot}} of models applied by companies, but all are based on the accounts that are mentioned in class 9. After an analysis of Romanian accounting literature, we realized that an important part of studies focuses on management accounting models applied to manufacturing companies. As a result, we conceived a model for management accounting specific for marchendises companies. In our model there are two groups of accounts: one from chart of accounts (class 9) and another group composed by accounts proposed by authors. We think that our model could provide more information about each cost object, regarding sales, acquisition cost of sales, distribution cost, administration cost, total cost of sales, contribution margin and profitability. Our model was exemplified by a case study applied to a wholesales company...|$|E
40|$|Adults with focal {{damage to}} the right {{hemisphere}} (RHD) frequently have difficulty processing language units that support or induce multiple, alternative interpretations, such as nonliteral phrases and narratives with demanding inference revisions (e. g. Tompkins et al., 2002). However, RHD adults ’ difficulty with alternative meanings is evident even at the lexical level. One primary <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> for RHD discourse comprehension deficits focuses on impairments of lexical-semantic activation/deactivation processes for alternative word meanings. Various investigators of intact brain function propose that RHD discourse comprehension impairments should reflect problems in maintaining activation for subordinate or contextalternative meanings and distant associates of words (e. g., Beeman, 1998; Brownell & Martino, 1998). This view reflects evidence that activation {{for these kinds of}} meanings is sustained over time in the intact right hemisphere (RH) but not in the left hemisphere (LH). A contrasting view is that RHD creates difficulty in suppressing activation of the contextually-unintended meanings and remote associates of words (e. g., Tompkins et al., 2000). General discourse comprehension performance of individuals with RHD was predicted by {{the extent to which they}} succeeded in suppressing such meanings, even after controlling for factors like vocabulary knowledge an...|$|E

The hypothesis {{in this study is}} that Role Playing Technique is effective to improve students’ self concept <b>of</b> <b>class</b> X <b>Accounting</b> <b>of</b> SMK Negeri 4 Klaten. This study is a Quasi-Experimental Design using Non-equivalent Control Group Design. The subjects are students <b>of</b> <b>class</b> X <b>Accounting</b> <b>of</b> SMK Negeri 4 Klaten, in total of 33 people. Source of data comes from the students.

The results of hypothesis testing in this research show that tcount 11, 754 > ttable 1, 998 and the significance value 0, 000 < 0, 05, thus role playing technique is proven to be effective to improve students’ self-concept <b>of</b> <b>class</b> X <b>Accounting</b> <b>of</b> SMK Negeri 4 Klaten.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how rats represent relationships in their environment. There are currently two broad <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> how animals learn about such relationships: The associative account offers {{a relatively simple}} mechanistic <b>account</b> <b>of</b> behaviour; while the second account proposes that animal behaviour, like human behaviour, is underpinned by the processes of causal and deductive reasoning, that are beyond associative analyses. Chapter 1 identifies three domains in which these two <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> provide quite different analyses of animal behaviour, which are experimentally investigated in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. Chapter 2 reports three experiments that investigated the accuracy of predictions derived from the claim that rats are capable of forming and using causal models involving their own interactions with their environment (interventions) and external events (Blaisdell, Sawa, Leising, & Waldmann, 2006). The results failed to confirm these predictions and were instead more consistent with the operation of simpler processes. The results from Chapter 2 left open two interpretations: either rats can represent causality but do not use such representations to reason, or they do not represent cause per se. Chapter 3 investigated these alternatives in three experiments using a timing task, which should be sensitive to whether rats {{are more likely to}} represent their actions as causal than external events (Buehner & Humphreys, 2009). The results provided no support for the view that causal binding occurs in rats. Chapter 3 examined the possibility that sensory preconditioning might reflect a form of deductive reasoning (Hall, 1990). However, taken together, the results from four experiments provided no support for such an analysis; but instead helped to inform the nature of the associative processes that underlie sensory preconditioning. In summary, while the results reported in this thesis provide no support for analyses of animal behaviour that rely on the processes of causal or deductive reasoning, they do help to inform the nature of the associative processes involved...|$|R

40|$|Evidence from {{research}} in psychology and auditor judgment {{has shown that}} perceptions that form early in a sequential judgment process can influence subsequent judgments. Auditing Standard 12 requires auditors to identify fraud risk factors and assess the risk of fraud {{as part of the}} process of assessing overall misstatement risk. While it is expected that fraud risk assessments should have a bearing on overall risk assessments, it is possible that perceptions formed from assessments of fraud risk can negatively affect the evaluation of any evidence reviewed thereafter. Because different <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> transactions may be affected by fraud risk factors in different ways, fraud risk assessments may differ across <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> transactions. These differences may make subsequent auditor judgments susceptible to the contrast effects bias, where subjects overreact to the differences such that the fraud risk assessments influence auditor judgment more than they should. This study examines whether auditors who learn that fraud risk is low for one <b>class</b> <b>of</b> transactions immediately after examining a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> transactions that has high fraud risk, can overreact to the contrast such that they reduce their sensitivity to evidence that suggests increased misstatement risk. The study also examines whether these contrast effects can be mitigated by acquiring information about fraud risk assessments later in the sequence of evidence, after auditors have reviewed and assimilated evidence related to other risks. The study finds that, as predicted, auditor judgments are influenced by contrast effects. Auditors who examined <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> for which fraud risk assessments were different were less sensitive to evidence suggesting increased risk in accounts that had been identified as having low fraud risk.
