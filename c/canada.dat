5|$|After the {{successful}} American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized {{the independence of}} the newly formed United State and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes to the new country.

Many moved to <b>Canada,</b> particularly Atlantic <b>Canada,</b> where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes. To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central <b>Canada,</b> the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of <b>Canada</b> into French-speaking Lower <b>Canada</b> (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper <b>Canada</b> (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.|$|E

5|$|<b>Canada</b> is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western <b>Canada,</b> Central <b>Canada,</b> Atlantic <b>Canada,</b> and Northern <b>Canada</b> (Eastern <b>Canada</b> refers to Central <b>Canada</b> and Atlantic <b>Canada</b> together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, {{the federal government can}} initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the <b>Canada</b> Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E

Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal and lead. Many towns in northern <b>Canada,</b> where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. <b>Canada</b> also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries.|$|E
