'The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springer-link. com'Purpose: <b>Curcumin,</b> a major constituent of the spice turmeric, suppresses expression of the enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox- 2) and has cancer chemopreventive properties in rodents. It possesses poor systemic availability. We explored whether formulation with phosphatidylcholine increases the oral bioavailability or affects the metabolite profile of <b>curcumin.</b> Methods: Male Wistar rats received 340 mg/Kg of either unformulated <b>curcumin</b> or <b>curcumin</b> formulated with phosphatidylcholine by oral gavage.

Over the last two decades, multiple natural dietary compounds with diverse chemical structures such flavonoids, tannins, <b>curcumins</b> and polyphenols have been proposed as chemopreventive agents. These agents have proven excellent anticancer potential in the laboratory setting, however, the observed effects in vitro do not translate in clinic where they fail to live up to their expectations.

To overcome this barrier, researchers have focused towards coupling these agents with nano based encapsulation technology that in principle will enhance bioavailability and ultimately benefit clinical outcome. The last decade has witnessed rapid advancement in the development of nanochemopreventive technology with emergence of many nano encapsulated formulations of different dietary anticancer agents. This review summarizes the most up-to-date knowledge on the studies performed in nanochemoprevention, their proposed use in the clinic and future directions in which this field is heading.

Many active phytochemicals, including flavonoids, terpenoids, lignans, sulfides, polyphenolics, carotenoids, coumarins, saponins, plant sterols, <b>curcumins,</b> and phthalides, have been identified (Craig [1999]). Some of these phytochemicals have been found to be potent antioxidants, metal chelators, or free radical scavengers, which may account for their health promoting properties (Cotell et al. [1996]). Today, medicinal plants are important to the global economy as approximately 85 % of traditional medicine preparations involve the use of plants or plant extracts (Vieira and Skorupa [1993]). In the past few decades, there has been a resurging interest in the study and use of medicinal plants in health care and in recognition of the importance of medicinal plants to the health system (Hoareau and DaSilva [1999]). This has led to an exponential rise in demand for herbal medicines, and also a considerable international awareness about the dwindling supply of the world’s medicinal plants. Therefore, all possible modes of plant propagation and large scale cultivation have been explored. In our laboratory, tissue culture techniques have been used successfully for propagation of several medicinally important plant species (Tsay [1999]; Nalawade et al.

40|$|Typhoidal and non-typhoidal {{infection}} by Salmonella is {{a serious}} threat to human health. Ciprofloxacin is the last drug of choice to clear the infection. Ciprofloxacin, a gyrase inhibitor, kills bacteria by inducing chromosome fragmentation, SOS response and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the bacterial cell. Curcumin, an active ingredient from turmeric, is a major dietary molecule among Asians and possesses medicinal properties. Our research aimed at investigating whether curcumin modulates the action of ciprofloxacin. We investigated the role of curcumin in interfering with the antibacterial action of ciprofloxacin in vitro and in vivo. RTPCR, DNA fragmentation and confocal microscopy were used to investigate the modulation of ciprofloxacin-induced SOS response, DNA damage and subsequent filamentation by curcumin. Chemiluminescence and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assays were performed to assess the interference of curcumin with ciprofloxacin-induced ROS. DNA binding and cleavage assays were done to understand the rescue of ciprofloxacin-mediated gyrase inhibition by curcumin. Curcumin interferes with the action of ciprofloxacin thereby increasing the proliferation of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Typhimurium in macrophages. In a murine model of typhoid fever, mice fed with curcumin had an increased bacterial burden in the reticuloendothelial system and succumbed to death faster. This was brought about by the inhibition of ciprofloxacin-mediated downstream signalling by curcumin. The antioxidant property of curcumin is crucial in protecting Salmonella against the oxidative burst induced by ciprofloxacin or interferon (IFN), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. However, curcumin is unable to rescue ciprofloxacin-induced gyrase inhibition. <b>Curcumins</b> ability to hinder the bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin and IFN might significantly augment Salmonella pathogenesis...|$|E

However, <b>curcumin</b> suffers from poor bioavailability, which limits its clinical use. We hypothesized that using novel microparticle and SMEDDS formulations {{will improve the}} pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of <b>curcumin.</b> Initial studies examined the anticancer efficacy of <b>curcumin</b> loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles in a transgenic mouse model of human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER- 2) cancer, Balb-neuT. HER- 2 is overexpressed in 30 % of breast cancer cases and is associated with poor prognosis and high incidence of metastasis. <b>Curcumin</b> microparticles delayed tumor appearance by 2 - 3 weeks and were associated with a decrease in VEGF protein levels and CD- 31 + microvasculature compared to empty microparticles. However, when compared to saline controls, blank microparticles appeared to accelerate tumorigenesis. Blank PLGA microparticles were shown to activate NF-kB signaling, indicating systemic inflammation after injection. The delay in tumorigenesis with curcumin-loaded microparticles was likely attributed to the anti-inflammatory effects of <b>curcumin.</b> Future studies will examine the systemic effects of blank PLGA microparticles as well as explore other polymers for <b>curcumin</b> microparticle delivery.

Anti-anxiety potentials of the <b>curcumin</b> were compared with diazepam. Lead poisoning induced severe behavioral abnormalities in experimental animals. Rats of either sex were divided into 12 groups of 6 animals in each group. Group were DMSO, Distilled Water, Saline water, Lead acetate 25 mg/kg, Diazepam 2 mg/kg, <b>Curcumin</b> 25 mg/kg, <b>Curcumin</b> 50 mg/kg, Diazepam 2 mg/kg + lead acetate, <b>Curcumin</b> 25 mg + lead acetate, <b>Curcumin</b> 50 mg + lead acetate, Diazepam 2 mg/kg + <b>Curcumin</b> 50 mg and Diazepam 2 mg/kg + <b>Curcumin</b> 50 mg + lead acetate. All the test solutions were freshly prepared daily and administered to animals for 5 days by interaperitonial (i. p.) route. On first day, third day and fifth day, each animal was checked to anxiety by using elevated zero maze. Our result showed that Lead acetate induced more anxiety and fear-related behavior in rat. <b>Curcumin</b> 50 mg/kg reduced and prevent the anxiety behavior, which induced by lead. <b>Curcumin</b> 50 mg/kg is sufficient dose to give anxiolytic and neuroprotective activity against lead induced anxiety in rats. <b>Curcumin</b> is less potent than diazepam and <b>Curcumin</b> 50 mg/kg with diazepam give synergetic anxiolytic activity against lead induced anxiety in rat...|$|R
40|$|<b>Curcumin</b> is a polyphenolic {{substance}} with attractive pharmacological activities (e. g. antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer). Incorporation of <b>curcumin</b> in polymeric micelles could {{overcome the}} problems associated with its instability and low aqueous solubility. The aim {{of this study was to}} load <b>curcumin</b> in polymeric micelles based on Pluronic® P 123 or Pluronic® F 127 triblock copolymers and evaluate the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects after micellization. The micelles were prepared and loaded with <b>curcumin</b> by applying the dissolution method. Higher encapsulation efficiency was observed in the micelles formulated with Pluronic® P 123. These micelles were characterized with small size and narrow size distribution. The effects of micellar <b>curcumin</b> were investigated in two in vitro models. First, the capacity of micellar <b>curcumin</b> to inhibit iron/ascorbic acid-induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes was evaluated. Micellar <b>curcumin</b> and free drug showed similar inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Second, micellar <b>curcumin</b> and free <b>curcumin</b> showed protective potential in a model of 6 -hydroxydopamine induced neurotoxicity in rat brain synaptosomes. The results from both methods indicated preservation of antioxidant and neuroprotective activity of <b>curcumin</b> in micelles. The small micellar size, high loading capacity and preservation of antioxidant activity of <b>curcumin</b> into Pluronic micelles, suggested their further evaluation as a <b>curcumin</b> delivery system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Curcumin,</b> a {{naturally}} occurring dietary polyphenol, {{has been investigated}} for several years for its role in chemoprevention of cancer. There are emerging evidences that <b>curcumin</b> may have a potential role in prevention and treatment of lung cancer. <b>Curcumin</b> in its natural form is poorly absorbed, extensively metabolised and rapidly excreted. Meriva, a phospholipid formulation of <b>curcumin,</b> promises to enhance its bioavaibility. The work described in this thesis investigates whether Meriva offers pharmacokinetic advantage over unformulated <b>curcumin,</b> elucidate a possible mechanism of action for <b>curcumin</b> and determine efficacy of Meriva in vivo using xenograft model of lung cancer. Meriva offered superior <b>curcumin</b> and <b>curcumin</b> metabolites levels in mice plasma and lungs at two different dose levels (high and low).

40|$|<b>Curcumin,</b> {{a natural}} polyphenolic {{flavonoid}} {{extracted from the}} rhizome of Curcuma longa L., was shown to possess superior potency to resensitize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to antibiotics. Previous studies have shown the synergistic activity of <b>curcumin</b> with β-lactam and quinolone antibiotics. Further, to understand the anti-MRSA mechanism of <b>curcumin,</b> we investigated the potentiated effect of <b>curcumin</b> by its interaction in diverse conditions. The mechanism of anti-MRSA action of <b>curcumin</b> was analyzed by the viability assay {{in the presence of}} detergents, ATPase inhibitors and peptidoglycan (PGN) from S. aureus, and the PBP 2 a protein level was analyzed by western blotting. The morphological changes in the curcumin-treated MRSA strains were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We analyzed increased susceptibility to MRSA isolates in the presence of <b>curcumin.</b> The optical densities at 600 nm (OD 600) of the suspensions treated with the combinations of <b>curcumin</b> with triton X- 100 and Tris were reduced to 63 % and 59 %, respectively, compared to <b>curcumin</b> without treatment. N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and sodium azide (NaN 3) were reduced to 94 % and 55 %, respectively. When peptidoglycan (PGN) from S. aureus was combined with <b>curcumin,</b> PGN (0 – 125 μg/mL) gradually blocked the antibacterial activity of <b>curcumin</b> (125 μg/mL); however, at a concentration of 125 µg/mL PGN, it did not completely block <b>curcumin.</b> <b>Curcumin</b> has a significant effect on the protein level of PBP 2 a. The TEM images of MRSA showed damage of the cell wall, disruption of the cytoplasmic contents, broken cell membrane and cell lysis after the treatment of <b>curcumin.</b> These data indicate a remarkable antibacterial effect of <b>curcumin,</b> with membrane permeability enhancers and ATPase inhibitors, and <b>curcumin</b> did not directly bind to PGN on the cell wall.

40|$|<b>Curcumin</b> is a {{multifunctional}} {{and natural}} agent {{considered to be}} pharmacologically safe. However, its application in the food and medical industry is greatly limited by its poor water solubility, physicochemical instability and inadequate bioavailability. Nanoliposome encapsulation could significantly enhance the solubility and stability of <b>curcumin.</b> <b>Curcumin</b> nanoliposomes exhibited good physicochemical properties (entrapment efficiency = 57. 1, particle size = 68. 1 nm, polydispersity index = 0. 246, and zeta potential = − 3. 16 mV). Compared with free <b>curcumin,</b> <b>curcumin</b> nanoliposomes exhibited good stability against alkaline pH and metal ions as well as good storage stability at 4 °C. <b>Curcumin</b> nanoliposomes also showed good sustained release properties. Compared with free <b>curcumin,</b> <b>curcumin</b> nanoliposomes presented an equal cellular antioxidant activity, which is mainly attributed to its lower cellular uptake as detected by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.

40|$|<b>Curcumin</b> is the {{bioactive}} molecule in the pigments {{found in}} turmeric, a spice and traditional medicine in Asia for centuries. Research {{has shown that}} <b>curcumin</b> exhibits a number of medicinal benefits, in particular, anti-Alzheimer’s and anti-cancer properties. It {{has been shown that}} there is an elevated level of Cu(II) in amyloid plaques and tumours. In addition, <b>curcumin</b> has the ability to damage the DNA of cancer cells in the presence of Cu(II), which leads to apoptosis. Furthermore, the tautomerisation of <b>curcumin</b> is essential for the binding of amyloid aggregates, which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease. This thesis provides insight into the interaction between <b>curcumin</b> and copper ion and tautomerisation of <b>curcumin,</b> which are related to the proposed modes of action for <b>curcumin.</b> In addition, a method for stabilising of <b>curcumin</b> in an aqueous environment using biocompatible polyester nanoparticles is described in this thesis. These nanoparticles show potential applications as <b>curcumin</b> delivery systems in biological environment. As a part of the PhD thesis, the interaction between <b>curcumin</b> and Cu(II) has been investigated in methanol and the sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micellar solution. The fluorescence quenching results show that <b>curcumin</b> forms both 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 Cu(II) −curcumin complexes and the binding constants are on the order of 10 ⁵ – 10 ⁸ M⁻¹, which indicate a strong binding between <b>curcumin</b> and Cu(II). The transient absorption spectroscopic results reveal that the strong interaction between <b>curcumin</b> and Cu(II) changes the electronic excited states of <b>curcumin</b> substantially. In addition, the decomposition of Cu(II) −curcumin complexes in a reducing environment has been studied. The UV-visible absorption values of the Cu(II) −curcumin complex in acetonitrile and in SDS micellar solution with ascorbic acid show a monotonic decrease as a function of time, indicating decomposition of <b>curcumin</b> in a reducing environment. In contrast, a lack of decomposition of Cu(II) −curcumin complex in methanol and <b>curcumin</b> in the presence of Cu(I) in acetonitrile was observed. The fluorescence results reveal that <b>curcumin</b> has a weaker interaction with Cu(I) than Cu(II). Therefore, the decomposition of <b>curcumin</b> is associated with the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I). The tautomerisation of <b>curcumin</b> in methanol, acetone and acetonitrile has been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. As tautomerisation of <b>curcumin</b> is the rate limiting step of the deuteration at the α-carbon position (Cα), the rate of tautomerisation is inferred from the rate of deuteration at the Cα of <b>curcumin.</b> The proton resonance peak corresponding to the hydrogen of Cα decays as a function of time, signifying a successful hydrogen-deuterium exchange. The rate constants of tautomerisation of <b>curcumin</b> have been measured at several temperatures and analysis using the Arrhenius equation has revealed that the activation energy of tautomerisation of <b>curcumin</b> is between 60 and 80 kJ mol⁻¹. The high activation energy values are attributable to the high energy barrier for disrupting the intramolecular hydrogen bonding and extended π-conjugation in the keto-enol tautomer of <b>curcumin.</b> Although <b>curcumin</b> has shown many medicinal effects, there are two major challenges regarding the utilisation of <b>curcumin</b> for disease treatments. These challenges are the poor solubility of <b>curcumin</b> in an aqueous environment and its lack of stability under physiological conditions. A one-step nanoprecipitation method to prepare curcumin-encapsulated polyester nanoparticles using polylactic acid, poly(lactide-coglycolide) and poly(ε-caprolactone) has been developed. The resulting nanoparticles have an average diameter less than 100 nm and a negative surface charge, which enables these nanoparticles to remain suspended in water. Furthermore, the UV-visible absorption values of the curcumin-polyester nanoparticles show only a minor decrease as a function of time, indicating that the polyester nanoparticles are able to prevent <b>curcumin</b> degradation. The results from studies using fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy reveal a lack of deuterium isotope effect of <b>curcumin</b> encapsulated in the polyester nanoparticles in the presence of D₂O. As a result of limited interaction between <b>curcumin</b> and water, the degradation of <b>curcumin</b> is suppressed. Overall, the polyester nanoparticles show significant potential as <b>curcumin</b> delivery agents. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Physical Sciences, 201...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of <b>curcumin</b> on adriamycin (ADR) nephrosis in rats. The results indicate that ADR-induced kidney injury was remarkably prevented by treatment with <b>curcumin.</b> Treatment with <b>curcumin</b> markedly protected against ADR-induced proteinuria, albuminuria, hypoalbuminaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Similarly, <b>curcumin</b> inhibited ADR-induced increase in urinary excretion of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (a marker of renal tubular injury), fibronectin and glycosaminoglycan and plasma cholesterol. <b>Curcumin</b> restored renal function in ADR rats, as judged by the increase in GFR.

The mechanism by which <b>curcumin</b> inhibit cell proliferation remains poorly understood. In the present report, we investigated the effect of <b>curcumin</b> on the activation of apoptotic pathway in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) malignant cells. Our data demonstrate that <b>curcumin</b> causes dose dependent suppression of proliferation in several T cell lines. <b>Curcumin</b> treatment causes the de-phosphorylation/inactivation of constitutively active AKT, FOXO transcription factor and GSK 3. <b>Curcumin</b> also induces release of cytochrome c accompanied by activation of caspase- 3 and PARP cleavage. In addition, zVAD-fmk, a universal inhibitor of caspases, prevents caspase- 3 activation and abrogates cell death induced by <b>curcumin</b> treatment. Finally, treatment of T-ALL cells with <b>curcumin</b> down-regulated the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAPs). Taken together, our finding suggest that <b>curcumin</b> suppresses constitutively activated targets of PI 3 ′-kinase (AKT, FOXO and GSK 3) in T cells leading to the inhibition of proliferation and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis...|$|R
