5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Buffon {{was once}} again sidelined by several injuries. From September through January, reserve goalkeeper Alexander Manninger held his {{position}} between the sticks, gaining praise for his deputising. Due to recurring injuries, Manninger's performances and Juventus's poor form {{towards the end of}} the season (as Buffon was seen despondent whilst the team drew with both Lecce and Atalanta), there were further rumours that Buffon was displeased and wanted to part ways with the club. He admitted he was disappointed with the <b>current</b> <b>results,</b> but assured that he had no intention of leaving. After a discussion with management, he said he was reassured about the club's future and signed a contract extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a high note, with two victories, finishing in second place behind Internazionale. They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the Champions League in the round of 16 by Chelsea. Buffon was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 for the sixth consecutive season since first being nominated in 2004. Buffon made his 300th appearance for Juventus in a 3–3 home draw against Chievo in 2009.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{an admirable}} piece of lucid exposition. Slowly {{the picture of}} a better, happier, more disciplined England grew upon the minds of the meeting. First she showed the new sort of {{employer}} her movement would evoke, an employer paternal, philanthropic, vaguely responsible for the social order of all his dependants. (Lady Petchworth was seen to nod her head slowly at this.) Only in the last resort, and when he was satisfied that his worker and his worker's family were properly housed, hygienically clothed and fed, attending suitable courses of instruction and free from any vicious inclinations, would he pay wages in cash. In the discharge of the duties of payment he would have the assistance of expert advice, and the stimulus of voluntary inspectors of his own class. He would be the natural clan-master, the captain and leader, adviser and caretaker of his banded employees. Responsibility would stimulate him, and if responsibility did not stimulate him, inspectors (both men and women inspectors) would. The worker, on the other hand, would be enormously more healthy and efficient under the new régime. His home, designed by qualified and officially recognized architects, would be prettier as well as more convenient and elevating to his taste, his children admirably trained and dressed in the new and more beautiful clothing with which Lady Petchworth (applause) had done so much to make them familiar, his vital statistics compared with <b>current</b> <b>results</b> would be astonishingly good, his mind free from any anxiety but the proper anxiety of a man in his position, to get his work done properly and earn recognition from those competent and duly authorized to judge it. Of all this she spoke with the inspiring note of absolute conviction. All this would follow Payment in Kind and Continuous Occupation as days follow sunrise. And there would always,--and here Aunt Plessington's voice seemed to brighten--be something for the worker to get on with, something for him to do; lectures, classes, reading-rooms, improving entertainments. His time would be filled. The proper authorities would see that it was filled--and filled in the right way. Never for a moment need he be bored. He would never have an excuse for being bored. That was the second great idea, the complementary idea to the first. [...] "And here it is," [...] she said, turning a large encouraging smile on Lady Petchworth, [...] "that the work of a National Theatre, instructive, stimulating, well regulated, and morally sustaining, would come in." [...] He wouldn't, of course, be compelled to go, but there would be his seat, part of his payment in kind, and the public-house would be shut, most other temptations would be removed....|$|E

Bedform types were observed using a 500 kHZ side-scan sonar also mounted on the CRAB. Corollary waves and currents were measured. Three cases were examined in detail: mild waves and weak longshore <b>currents</b> <b>resulting</b> in wave ripples everywhere; storm waves with strong longshore <b>currents</b> <b>resulting</b> in lunate and straight crested megaripples in the trough of the barred beach; and narrow banded, normally incident waves with a strong rip <b>current</b> <b>resulting</b> in a relatively planar bed everywhere except in the throat of the rip where magaripples were measured. The predictive wave ripple height and length equations of Nielsen (1981) worked reasonably well for mild wave conditions, but did not predict ripples during moderate wave conditions.
