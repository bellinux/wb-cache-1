25|$|A contact {{microphone}} picks up vibrations {{directly from a}} solid surface or object, as opposed to sound vibrations carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> and contact pin. The <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones {{have been used to}} pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A throat microphone is a variant of the {{contact microphone}} that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.|$|E
5000|$|Freeline skates, a {{class of}} unattached skates that wearers place under their normal street or skate shoes. They {{typically}} have 2 closely set inline wheels set with a short base under a small squarish plate (usually surfaced with grip tape about the same width as the rider's shoe). This arrangement allows {{for a range of}} motion similar to single-wheeled skates like Heelys. Due to the lack of straps on the <b>contact</b> <b>plate,</b> freeline skates require constant motion to stay on, and are a particular challenge for novices.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, a California {{medical device}} manufacturer, 3Gen, {{introduced}} the first polarized dermatoscope, the DermLite. Polarised illumination, {{coupled with a}} cross-polarised viewer, reduces (polarised) skin surface reflection, thus allowing visualisation of skin structures (the light from which is depolarised) without using an immersion fluid. Examination of several lesions is thus more convenient because physicians {{no longer have to}} stop and apply immersion oil, alcohol, or water to the skin before examining each lesion. With the marketing of polarised dermatoscopes, dermatoscopy increased in popularity among physicians worldwide. Although images produced by polarised light dermatoscopes are slightly different from those produced by a traditional skin contact glass dermatoscope, they have certain advantages, such as vascular patterns not being potentially missed through compression of the skin by a glass <b>contact</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of the A. aurita medusa main mesoglea polypeptides, mesoglein, {{has been}} {{described}} previously. Mesoglein belongs to ZP-domain protein family and therefore we focused on A. aurita oogenesis. Antibodies against mesoglein (AB RA 47) stain the plate {{in the place where}} germinal epithelium contacts oocyte on the paraffin sections. According to its position, we named the structure found the "contact plate". Our main instrument was AB against mesoglein. ZP-domain occupies about half of the whole amino acid sequence of the mesoglein. Immunoblot after SDS-PAGE and AU-PAGE reveals two charged and high M(r) bands among the female gonad germinal epithelium polypeptides. One of the gonads' polypeptides M(r) corresponds to that of mesogleal cells, the other ones' M(r) is higher.

30|$|In {{creating}} the wiping device, {{there are several}} factors to consider. The frictional force expressing the slipperiness varies depending on {{the magnitude of the}} load on the floor surface. This load varies depending on the attachment position of the sensor and the weight of the device. Also, the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> is better to have a smooth and hard surface. If the surface of <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> is rough, the contact area between the target surface and the device will decrease. And, if the hardness of the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> cover is too soft, it will be assumed that wear is caused by the wiping motion, and repeat measurement becomes difficult. Besides wear, self-excited vibration tends to occur because the system becomes unstable if the plate cover is soft. If we want {{to pay attention to the}} resistance force, this vibration is undesirable as it can hinder stable contact with the ground. For these reasons, it is desired that the plate cover is hard and smooth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Mycoflora {{of eight}} {{different}} fabrics (natural, synthetic, and blended), collected from warehouses in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were isolated by different methods; <b>contact</b> <b>plate,</b> dilution, Stomacher, and moisturization that followed by <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> method.

40|$|Special test {{applications}} {{for the evaluation of}} the reduction of fungal and bacterial spore load on indoor surfaces were developed. The procedure for testing the efficiency of a photocatalytic active surface material {{to reduce the number of}} viable microbial spores involves control and monitoring of environmental and technical parameters such as irradiation (intensity and duration), temperature, humidity and original spore load. Following a certain period of UVA-light-irradiation the extent of viable spore reduction was investigated. The evaluation of the effect on fungal and bacterial spores was performed using a <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> method. For fungal spores a test cycle with several hours duration before <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> sampling was employed, for bacterial spores the duration of the test cycle could be shortened and supplemented by a sensitive fluorescence detection method to evaluate the viable spore reduction.

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{design for}} an electromagnetic brake {{would increase the}} reliability while {{reducing the number of}} parts and the weight, relative to a prior commercially available electromagnetic brake. The reductions of weight and the number of parts could also lead to a reduction of cost. A description of the commercial brake is prerequisite to a description of the proposed electromagnetic brake. The commercial brake (see upper part of figure) includes (1) a permanent magnet and an electromagnet coil on a stator and (2) a rotor that includes a steel <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> mounted, with tension spring loading, on an aluminum hub. The stator is mounted securely on a stationary object, which would ordinarily be the housing of a gear drive or a motor. The rotor is mounted on the shaft of the gear drive or motor. The commercial brake nominally operates in a fail-safe (in the sense of normally braking) mode: In the absence of current in the electromagnet coil, the permanent magnet pulls the <b>contact</b> <b>plate,</b> against the spring tension, into contact with the stator. To release the brake, one excites the electromagnet with a current of the magnitude and polarity chosen to cancel the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet, thereby enabling the spring tension to pull the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> out of contact with the stator. The fail-safe operation of the commercial brake depends on careful mounting of the rotor in relation to the stator. The rotor/stator gap must be set with a tolerance between 10 and 15 mils (between about 0. 25 and about 0. 38 mm). If the gap or the contact pad is thicker than the maximum allowable value, then the permanent magnetic field will not be strong enough to pull the steel plate across the gap. (For this reason, any contact pad between the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> and the stator must also be correspondingly thin.) If the gap exceeds the maximum allowable value because of shaft end play, it becomes impossible to set the brake by turning off the electromagnet current. Although it may still be possible to set the brake by applying an electromagnet current to aid the permanent magnetic field instead of canceling it, this action can mask an out-of-tolerance condition in the brake and it does not restore the fail-safe function of setting the brake when current is lost...|$|E
40|$|Detecting {{microorganisms}} on textiles {{is useful}} for many purposes, for example to determine the bioburden before laundering, assess the reduction in bacterial counts in connection with various laundry processes, or trace transfer routes in infection control investigations. Therefore a validated, reproducible and rational method is needed. For sampling microorganisms on textile surfaces {{the most commonly used}} method is the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> method using RODAC plates, first described by Hall and Hartnett followed by the swab sampling technique. Both methods can only capture microorganisms {{on the surface of the}} textiles while microorganisms that have penetrated into the deeper structure of the material will not be detected. In our research the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> method and the swabbing technique were compared with two wash-off methods. For the first wash-off method the destructive elution methodwas used, where microorganisms were eluted from the fabrics by shaking the fabrics for a certain time in an elution medium. For the fourth sampling method a nondestructive method that included a compact test device called MorapexŽ was used, which is based on forced desorption by pressing the microorganisms through the fabric without destroying the fabric. In our research, two types of microorganisms were included (Klebsiella pneumoniae andStaphylococcus aureus) that cause common nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of the four sampling methods for detecting microorganisms on textiles and to determine the lowest concentration, which can still be detected. The percentage of microorganisms that were detected by both elution methods was substantially higher than by sampling of fabrics with the <b>contact</b> <b>plate</b> method or swabbing. It can be concluded that a nondestructive method using a modified MorapexŽ device can beapplied for quick determination of the hygienic condition of textiles...|$|E
