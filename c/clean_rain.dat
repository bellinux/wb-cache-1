5000|$|Owing to {{the lack}} of water sources on the island, roofs were and are still used for {{rainwater}} collection.

50|$|Another related {{issue for}} {{avoiding}} costly repairs (or disasters) {{is the proper}} operation of a home, including systems and appliances, {{in a way that}} prevents damage or prolongs their usefulness. For example, at higher latitudes, even a <b>clean</b> <b>rain</b> gutter can suddenly build up an ice dam in winter, forcing melt water into unprotected roofing, resulting in leaks or even flooding inside walls or rooms. This can be prevented by installing moisture barrier beneath the roofing tiles. A wary home-owner should be alert to the conditions that can result in larger problems and take remedial action before damage or injury occurs. It may be easier to tack down a bit of worn carpet than repair a large patch damaged by prolonged misuse. Another example is to seek out the source of unusual noises or smells when mechanical, electrical or plumbing systems are operating—sometimes they indicate incipient problems. One should avoid overloading or otherwise misusing systems, and a recurring overload may indicate time for an upgrade.|$|E
5000|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that downstream flood events may become more regular and have higher peak flows due to such land management. However, the trust recognises that agricultural change has been driven by national and international economic drivers which have encouraged intensification, and that farmers are not at fault when it comes to river degradation. The trust works directly with the farming community to try to identify win-win situations that can both improve the condition of river ecology whilst reducing farming costs or saving time. A simple example of this is rerouting <b>clean</b> <b>rain</b> water from slurry stores. This can save irrigation and spreading costs, allowing farmers to utilise animal fertilisers more efficiently and so improve crop yields and reduce runoff to rivers and diffuse pollution.

40|$|The RAIN and CLIMEX {{experiments}} at Risdalsheia, southernmost Norway, together cover 17 years (1984 - 2000) of whole-catchment {{manipulation of}} acid deposition and climate. A 1200 m 2 roof {{placed over the}} forest canopy at KIM catchment excluded about 80 % of ambient acid deposition; <b>clean</b> <b>rain</b> was sprinkled under the roof. A climate change treatment (3. 7 &# 176;C increase in air temperature and increase in air carbon dioxide concentrations to 560 ppmv) was superimposed on the <b>clean</b> <b>rain</b> treatment for four years (1995 - 1998). Sea-salt inputs and temperature are climate-related factors that influence water chemistry and can confound long-term trends caused by changes in deposition of sulphur and nitrogen. The RAIN and CLIMEX experiments at Risdalsheia provided direct experimental data that allow quantitative assessment of these factors. Run-off chemistry responded rapidly to the decreased acid deposition. Sulphate concentrations decreased by 50 % within three years; nitrate and ammonium concentrations decreased to new steady-state levels within the first year. Acid neutralising capacity increased and hydrogen ion and inorganic aluminium decreased. Similar recovery from acidification was also observed at the reference catchment, ROLF, {{in response to the}} general 50 % reduction in sulphate deposition over southern Norway in the late 1980 s and 1990 s. Variations in sea-salt deposition caused large variations in run-off chemistry at the reference catchment ROLF and the year-to-year noise in acid neutralising capacity was as large as the overall trend over the period. These variations were absent at KIM catchment because the sea-salt inputs were held constant over the entire 17 years of the <b>clean</b> <b>rain</b> treatment. The climate change experiment at KIM catchment resulted in increased leaching of inorganic nitrogen, probably due to increased mineralisation and nitrification rates in the soils.

40|$|Following {{recent studies}} evidencing the {{influence}} of deep convection on the chemical composition and thermal structure of the tropical lower stratosphere, we explore {{its impact on the}} temperature diurnal variation in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere using the high-resolution COSMIC GPS radio-occultation temperature measurements spanning from 2006 through 2011. The temperature in the lowermost stratosphere over land during summer displays a marked diurnal cycle characterized by an afternoon cooling. This diurnal cycle is shown collocated with most intense land convective areas observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar and in phase with the maximum overshooting occurrence frequency in late afternoon. Two processes potentially responsible for that are identified: (i) non-migrating tides, whose physical nature is internal gravity waves, and (ii) local cross-tropopause mass transport of adiabatically cooled air by overshooting turrets. Although both processes can contribute, only the lofting of adiabatically cooled air is well captured by models, making it difficult to characterize the contribution of non-migrating tides. The impact of deep convection on the temperature diurnal cycle is found larger in the southern tropics, suggesting more vigorous convection over <b>clean</b> <b>rain</b> forest continents than desert areas and polluted continents in the northern tropics...|$|E

However, the altitude reached by those events differs dramatically between the hemispheres. Convective overshootings are observed to reach 20 - 21 km over the southern tropical continents, whereas in the Northern they are limited to altitude below the tropopause. Convection appears much more intense in the South.

Due to vagaries of monsoon and scarcity of surface water in Indian SAT, dependence on groundwater has increased tremendously and water resource has transformed from community resource to a private resource. Farmers have dug open wells to draw groundwater from shallow aquifers. With advent of bore well technology and subsidized power, there has been shift in groundwater extraction from shallow aquifers to deeper aquifers creating mining effect. Intensity of rainfall in Indian SAT is grossly adequate to adequately charge the aquifers.

40|$|Aerosols and {{especially}} {{their effect on}} clouds {{are one of the}} key components of the climate system and the hydrological cycle [Ramanathan et al., 2001]. Yet, the aerosol effect on clouds remains largely unknown and the processes involved not well understood. A recent report published by the National Academy of Science states "The greatest uncertainty about the aerosol climate forcing - indeed, the largest of all the uncertainties about global climate forcing - is probably the indirect effect of aerosols on clouds NRC [2001]. " The aerosol effect on Clouds is often categorized into the traditional "first indirect (i. e., Twomey) " effect on the cloud droplet sizes for a constant liquid water path and the "semi-direct" effect on cloud coverage. The aerosol effect on precipitation processes, also known as the second type of aerosol indirect effect, is even more complex, especially for mixed-phase convective clouds. In this paper, a cloud-resolving model (CRM) with detailed spectral-bin microphysics was used to examine the effect of aerosols on three different deep convective cloud systems that developed in different geographic locations: South Florida, Oklahoma and the Central Pacific, In all three cases, rain reaches the ground earlier for the low CCN (<b>clean)</b> case. <b>Rain</b> suppression is also evident in all three cases with high CCN (dirty) case. However, this suppression only occurs during the first hour of the simulations. During the mature stages of the simulations, the effects of increasing aerosol concentration range from rain suppression in the Oklahoma case, to almost no effect in the Florida case, to rain enhancement in the Pacific case. These results show the complexity of aerosol interactions with convection. The model results suggest that evaporative cooling is a key process in determining whether high CCN reduces or enhances precipitation. Stronger evaporative cooling can produce a stronger cold pool and thus stronger low-level convergence through interactions with the low-level wind shear. Consequently, precipitation processes can be more vigorous. For example,, the evaporative cooling is more than two times stronger in the lower troposphere with high CCN for the Pacific case. Sensitivity tests also suggest that ice processes are crucial for suppressing precipitation in the Oklahoma case with high CCN...|$|R
