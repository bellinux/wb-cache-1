50|$|During <b>continuous</b> <b>contact</b> <b>printing,</b> the {{raw stock}} and the {{negative}} are placed next to one another around the sprocket wheel of the printer. The negative, which is the closer of the two to the sprocket wheel (thus creating a slightly shorter path), must have a marginally shorter pitch between perforations (0.1866 in pitch); the raw stock has a long pitch (0.1870 in). While cellulose nitrate and cellulose diacetate stocks used to shrink during processing slightly enough to have this difference naturally occur, modern safety stocks do not shrink at the same rate, and therefore negative (and some intermediate) stocks are perforated at a pitch of 0.2% shorter than print stock.|$|E
40|$|Previously {{fabricated}} {{electronic devices}} {{were used for}} vacuum manufacturing processes such as conventional semiconductor manufacturing. However, they are difficult to apply to continuous processes such as roll-to-roll printing, which results in very high device manufacturing and processing costs. Therefore, many developers {{have been interested in}} applying <b>continuous</b> processes to <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> or noncontact printing technologies and they proposed various continuous printing techniques instead of conventional batch coating. In this paper, we proposed improved gravure offset printing process as one of the <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> technique. We used etching pattern geometry with soft core blanket roll for printing of ultra fine line below the 10 um. Using this technique we obtained flexible metal grid mesh film as transparent conductive film...|$|R

Experimental details regarding the <b>contact</b> <b>printing</b> process are outlined, and the key advantages of this QD deposition method over other commonly encountered techniques are discussed. The use of tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) to effectively characterize QD film morphology both on an elastomeric stamp (before <b>contact</b> <b>printing)</b> and as-transferred to the organic semiconductor receiving film (after <b>contact</b> <b>printing)</b> is also described. Finally, we offer suggestions for future efforts directed toward the goal of rapid, continuous QD deposition over larger substrates for the advancement of hybrid optoelectronic thin film devices...|$|R
50|$|Since {{this process}} {{produces}} neither enlargements nor reductions, {{the image on}} the print is exactly the same size as {{the image on the}} negative. <b>Contact</b> <b>prints</b> are used to produce proof sheets from entire rolls of 35 mm negative (from 135 film cassettes) and 120 (2 film rolls) in order to aid in the selection of images for further enlargement, and for cataloging and identification purposes. For 120 roll film (once a common negative size for popular cameras) and larger film, <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> are often used to determine the final print size. In medium and large format photography, <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> are prized for their extreme fidelity to the negative, with exquisite detail that can be seen with the use of a magnifying glass. A disadvantage to using <b>contact</b> <b>prints</b> in the fine-arts is the laboriousness of modifying exposure selectively, when the use of an enlarger can achieve the same purpose.|$|R

40|$|Rigid body {{systems may}} undergo {{numerous}} types of dynamic interactions including collisions and <b>continuous</b> <b>contact</b> which considerably complicate systematic modelling and simulation of such problems. This thesis introduces a new modelling approach {{based on a}} hybrid system formulation to describe the dynamics of interacting rigid body systems. Interaction among physical objects occurs in two different forms: impulsive <b>contact</b> and <b>continuous</b> <b>contact.</b> Characteristics of impulsive and <b>continuous</b> <b>contacts</b> are different. Hence the modelling of each contact type {{requires the use of}} different approaches. While the impulse-modelling approach better simulates the impulsive contacts, our findings indicate that continues contact is much more accurately modeled using the sliding manifold method. The proposed hybrid system approach combines the impulse modelling method for collision interactions and the sliding manifold method to model the differential-algebraic equations associated with <b>continuous</b> <b>contact</b> interactions. Appropriate discrete states, events, reset maps, and threshold parameters that yield a hybrid automaton framework to describe interacting rigid body systems are developed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method a rolling ball simulation for a virtual reality system is presented...|$|R
