5|$|In {{addition}} to the major deployments, Australian military units and service men and women served in other theatres of the war, typically as part of British-led Commonwealth forces. About 14,000Australians also served in the Merchant Navy and <b>crewed</b> ships {{in many areas of}} the world.|$|E
5|$|Onshore, civilians woke on {{the morning}} of 23 November to find that the most {{powerful}} ships in their navy, <b>crewed</b> by the lowest of the underclass, were firing on the city. Thousands quickly fled, although nearly all were unable to. The press initially stoked these peoples' fears, although they later flipped to lionizing the rebels, portraying them as heroes.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed Constellation L-049, {{like many}} airliners of its era, was {{normally}} <b>crewed</b> by three individuals: a captain (or pilot in command) {{in the left}} seat, a first officer (also known as copilot) in the right seat, and a flight engineer in the rear seat. The accident flight crewing was unusual in several respects.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the main deployments, Southern Rhodesian servicemen served in other theatres of the war. Rhodesian sailors in the Royal, South African and Merchant Navies <b>crewed</b> ships {{in many parts of}} the world, including the Indian Ocean, the Arctic and the Pacific. No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron operated in Iran and Iraq in 1942–43, guarding oil wells and pipelines and supporting the British Tenth Army.|$|E
5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. <b>Crewed</b> submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|In the serial, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Peter Davison) and {{his companions}} Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) and Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) encounter a group of god-like immortals who are racing historical Earth sailing vessels through space, <b>crewed</b> by humans they had plucked out of time, {{in an attempt to}} win the prize of the titular enlightenment. Turlough is {{under the control of the}} Black Guardian (Valentine Dyall), but struggles with the Guardian's orders to kill the Doctor.|$|E
50|$|Ocean <b>Crew</b> Link connects sailing <b>crew</b> {{looking for}} boats with boat owners looking for sailing <b>crew.</b> Unlike other sites, Ocean <b>Crew</b> Link specialises in {{opportunities}} for ocean sailing <b>crew,</b> and is World Cruising Club’s preferred sailing <b>crew</b> match service {{with a special}} focus on voyaging rallies like the ARC, Caribbean 1500 and World ARC. Boat owners and charter companies use Ocean <b>Crew</b> Link to find <b>crew</b> for rallies and independent cruising. Each month there are around 150 opportunities to sail as <b>crew</b> available on the site.|$|R
25|$|The <b>crew</b> swap also {{affected}} {{who would be}} the first <b>crew</b> to land on the Moon; when the <b>crews</b> for Apollo 8 and 9 were swapped, their backup <b>crews</b> were also swapped. Since the rule of thumb was for backup <b>crews</b> to fly as prime <b>crew</b> three missions later, this put Neil Armstrong's <b>crew</b> (Borman's backup) in position for the first landing mission Apollo 11 instead of Pete Conrad's <b>crew,</b> who made the second landing on Apollo 12.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Crew</b> Management System {{software}} has {{a unique}} feature of booking the <b>crew</b> through SMS. It {{is sent to the}} <b>crew</b> through the central database to serve it a call.If the <b>crew</b> acknowledges the call by sending back an acknowledgment through SMS, the <b>crew</b> is booked. This is done for those <b>crews</b> who reside farther than 7-8 km from the <b>crew</b> booking location, else a call boy is sent for the same.Thus the software facilitates faster <b>crew</b> booking.|$|R
5|$|Q-ships were {{merchant}} ships <b>crewed</b> by Navy {{personnel and}} bearing hidden weaponry. When attacked by U-boats, {{a portion of}} the ship's crew (referred to as a panic party) would appear to evacuate the vessel, sometimes setting smoke fires to simulate damage. This would encourage its attacker to approach and when the U-boat was close enough, the Q-ship's guns would become operational and open fire, hopefully destroying the submarine.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw costs further reduced on {{the rail}} network. Guards were removed from {{passenger}} trains in 1989, and driver only suburban trains commenced running in 1993, with the last suburban train <b>crewed</b> by a guard running in November 1995. In 1994 the National Rail Corporation was established, taking profitable steel, and intermodal trafficks from V/Line; and the Melbourne to Adelaide standard gauge line was opened in 1995 moving the break of gauge.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) {{program was}} {{initiated}} in 2010 {{with the purpose}} of creating American commercially operated <b>crewed</b> spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth. It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace. Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crew</b> Battle. These races {{revolve around}} the <b>crew</b> {{associated}} with the current tier the player is contending in. With each race, the player is permitted to challenge a <b>crew</b> member, or the <b>crew</b> leader itself. If the player defeats all four <b>crew</b> members, the player {{will have access to}} challenge the <b>crew</b> leader personally. If the player defeats the <b>crew</b> leader three times, the player is declared as having officially beaten the <b>crew,</b> and can progress to the next tier, if available, in conjunction with an exceptionally large payout. As well, an interaction between <b>crew</b> leaders is showcased, with the former <b>crew</b> leader challenging the player to a High Stakes Challenge.|$|R
50|$|Sandoval {{was a part}} of a dance <b>crew</b> {{known as}} Quest <b>Crew,</b> who won America's Best Dance <b>Crew</b> Season 3. Sandoval later {{announced}} that he would join America's Best Dance <b>Crew's</b> judging panel for its sixth season. Dominic rejoined Quest in 2014 and participated {{along with the rest of}} the <b>crew</b> in America's Best Dance <b>Crew</b> Season 8: Road to the VMA's (All Star Season) Featuring: Super Cr3w, Quest <b>Crew,</b> We Are Heroes, I.aM.mE, Elektrolytes, and Kinjaz (which is made up of people from Jabbawokeez, Kaba Modern, Poreotics, and Mos Wanted <b>Crew).</b> Quest <b>Crew</b> was voted America's Best Dance <b>Crew</b> for the second time.|$|R
50|$|HERU {{operates}} a 4 person Primary <b>Crew</b> throughout {{the academic year}} composed of a <b>Crew</b> Member, Driver, <b>Crew</b> Chief and Reserve <b>Crew</b> Chief. The <b>Crew</b> Member and Driver are expected to provide the direct hands on patient care {{under the supervision of}} the <b>Crew</b> Chief. The <b>Crew</b> Chief is expected to supervise the <b>Crew</b> Members, ensure the scene functions smoothly and make all transport decisions. The Reserve <b>Crew</b> Chief is the on duty shift commander and is expected to oversee the operations of the shift, including responding to calls as necessary. HERU operates 3 shifts per day: the A shift from 0000 to 0800, B shift from 0800 to 1600 and C shift from 1600 to 0000. <b>Crew</b> Members are expected to take 1 shift weekly while <b>Crew</b> Chiefs and Reserve <b>Crew</b> Chiefs take 3 shifts per week.|$|R
5|$|The {{squadron}} operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, {{the first}} of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are <b>crewed</b> by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability to refuel in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Whitby fire station, run by North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, is <b>crewed</b> between 8am and 6pm. The town's {{two police}} {{stations}} {{are provided by}} the North Yorkshire Police Authority. The lifeboat station built in 2007, on the east bank, is operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The crew members are unpaid volunteers and the station has two lifeboats, an inshore D class lifeboat the OEM Stone III and an all-weather Trent class lifeboat, the George and Mary Webb.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, <b>crewed</b> spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crew</b> {{committee}} {{is a group}} of adults, led by the <b>crew</b> committee chair, who guide the <b>crew</b> program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment, and registration. The <b>crew</b> must have at least five adults registered with the <b>crew</b> to become a legitimate <b>crew.</b> The <b>crew</b> is led by youths who are elected to the positions of president, one or more vice-presidents, secretary, treasurer, quartermaster, guide, and historian. Other positions in the Venturing <b>crew</b> may exist, such as activity chair. The adult adviser and associate advisers provide guidance while allowing the youth to lead the <b>crew.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>crew</b> {{dispatcher}} is also {{employed by}} the railroad {{to keep track of}} train <b>crews</b> and their assignments. The <b>crew</b> dispatcher is responsible for assigning train <b>crew</b> to trains, based on a <b>crew</b> book that shows scheduled rosters but also making real-time adjustments as necessary based on rail traffic conditions and delays. The <b>crew</b> dispatcher is normally assisted by a <b>crew</b> caller whose responsibility is to telephone the train and engine <b>crews</b> to advise them of time to report for duty. The <b>crew</b> dispatcher is also responsible for checking that each train and engine <b>crew</b> are properly qualified for their assignments and have had proper rest pursuant to relevant hours-of-service regulations. :3 ...|$|R
50|$|The {{promotion}} of Stafford and Cernan from backup to prime <b>crew</b> meant {{that a new}} backup <b>crew</b> was required. Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin were originally the backup <b>crew</b> for Gemini 10. This is significant as the standard <b>crew</b> rotation meant that {{a spot on the}} backup <b>crew</b> of Gemini 10 would have placed Buzz Aldrin on the prime <b>crew</b> of the non-existent mission after Gemini 12 (the <b>crew</b> rotation usually meant that after serving on a backup <b>crew,</b> an astronaut could expect to skip two missions and then be on a prime <b>crew).</b> Being moved up to the backup <b>crew</b> of Gemini 9 meant that Aldrin flew as part of the prime <b>crew</b> on Gemini 12, which played a major part in his selection for the Apollo 8 backup and Apollo 11 prime <b>crews,</b> ultimately making him the second man on the Moon.|$|R
5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} despatched garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan {{troops on}} Corfu alone. This effectively turned the Adriatic into a sheltered French sea {{from which they}} could be free to despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier. To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and <b>crewed</b> vessels.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} Hichens had {{continued}} to sail; he joined the Royal Cornish Yacht Club and started to race in International Fourteen events in his own dinghies called Venture and Venture II. He competed in the Fowey Regatta and the Prince of Wales Cup, coming fifth on the River Clyde in 1936. He also entered the competition at Lowestoft in 1937 and at Falmouth in 1938. Hichens had also taken up offshore yacht racing {{and was a member}} of the Royal Ocean Racing Club, competed three times in the Fastnet race, and <b>crewed</b> in the Channel race in June 1939.|$|E
5|$|Four of the {{officers}} were {{of the line and}} responsible for the handling of the vessel and operation of guns during battle, while the engineering officers were considered a class unto themselves. In Monitors turret, Greene and Stodder supervised loading and firing of the two 11-inch Dahlgrens. Each gun was <b>crewed</b> by eight men. Thus, during battle, at least 18 men were present in the turret. In Worden's report of 27 January 1862 to Welles, he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in the turret that allowed the crew to work without getting in each other's way.|$|E
50|$|Imperial Airways {{stationed}} its all-male {{flight deck}} <b>crew,</b> cabin <b>crew</b> and ground <b>crew</b> {{along the length}} of its routes. Specialist engineers and inspectors - and ground <b>crew</b> on rotation or leave - travelled on the airline without generating any seat revenue. Several air <b>crew</b> lost their lives in accidents. At the end of the 1930s <b>crew</b> numbers approximated 3,000. All <b>crew</b> were expected to be ambassadors for Britain and the British Empire.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent to the {{decision}} to assign Schmitt to Apollo 17, there remained the question of which <b>crew</b> (the full backup <b>crew</b> of Apollo 15, Dick Gordon, Vance Brand, and Schmitt, or the backup <b>crew</b> of Apollo 14) would become prime <b>crew</b> of the mission. NASA Director of Flight <b>Crew</b> Operations Deke Slayton ultimately assigned the backup <b>crew</b> of Apollo 14 (Cernan and Evans), along with Schmitt, to the prime <b>crew</b> of Apollo 17.|$|R
50|$|The Rock City <b>Crew</b> battled against breakdancing <b>crews</b> {{from across}} the country {{including}} <b>crews</b> with then to be legends such as drum and bass producer Goldie (West Side <b>Crew</b> and Bboys) and Take That member Jason Orange (Street Machine and Broken Glass Street <b>Crew).</b>|$|R
