Twelve earthen ponds were stocked at 40 juveniles. m - 2, according to the treatment. After 3. 5 months prawns were completely harvested. Lower size-graded prawns showed smaller average weight (3. 37 ± 0. 25 g) than upper size-graded (4. 03 ± 0. 40 g) and ungraded ones (3. 80 ± 0. 16 g).

These parameters did not differ among the farming strategies. The best strategy for short term grow-out M. amazonicum in earthen ponds is stocking ungraded juveniles and performing total harvesting by draining ponds at the end of rearing cycle.

40|$|Harvesting {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural operations because it captures the value from the entire cropping season. In modern agriculture, grain harvesting has been mechanized through the combine harvester. A combine harvester enables highly productive crop harvesting. <b>Combine</b> <b>harvesting</b> performance depends on the highly variable skill of combine operators and associated operator error. An approach was developed to analyze the risk of the <b>combine</b> <b>harvesting</b> operation as it relates to operator error. Specifically, a risk analysis model was built based on a task analysis from operator interviews and estimates of the probability of operator error. This paper employs a Bayesian approach to assess risks in combine operation.

Sensitivity analysis of different errors and operator skill levels was also performed. The preliminary results indicate that a reduction of human operator action errors can substantially improve the outcomes of the human-machine interaction...|$|E

Four control systems have been developed that optimise these speeds on the basis of harvest costs minimisation, which includes variable and fixed costs of the machine and those of machine- and timeliness losses. The evaluated systems make use of a varying number of input process variables and control the machine speed exclusively, or both machine speed and threshing speed. The financial benefits from these control systems were calculated by means of a computer simulation. The research required in developing the models and control systems is discussed in detail. The simulation results demonstrate that control of low-frequency variations in crop properties brings some slight benefit and indicate that timeliness losses are of great importance to optimisation. ...|$|E

The number of twine tied bales obtained per h was 181 and 87 with bale density of 200 and 102 kg/m 3 and bale mass of 22 and 10 kg respectively for rice and wheat crop. The collection and gathering losses were 18. 40 % for rice and 41. 12 % for wheat. The cost of producing one twine tied bale was Rs. 2. 75 and Rs. 5. 00 for rice and wheat respectively.
