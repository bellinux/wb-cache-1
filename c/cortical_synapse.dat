40|$|Membrane-associated {{guanylate}} kinases (MAGUKs), including SAP 102, PSD- 95, PSD- 93, and SAP 97, are scaffolding proteins for ionotropic glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses. MAGUKs play critical {{roles in}} synaptic plasticity; however, details of signaling roles for each MAGUK remain largely unknown. Here {{we report that}} SAP 102 regulates <b>cortical</b> <b>synapse</b> development through the EphB and PAK signaling pathways. Using lentivirus-delivered shRNAs, we found that SAP 102 and PSD- 95, but not PSD- 93, are necessary for excitatory synapse formation and synaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) localization in developing mouse cortical neurons. SAP 102 knockdown (KD) increased numbers of elongated dendritic filopodia, which is often observed in mouse models and human patients with mental retardation. Further analysis revealed that SAP 102 coimmunoprecipitated the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB 2 and RacGEF Kalirin- 7 in neonatal cortex, and SAP 102 KD reduced surface expression and dendritic localization of EphB. Moreover, SAP 102 KD prevented reorganization of actin filaments, synapse formation, and synaptic AMPAR trafficking in response to EphB activation triggered by its ligand ephrinB. Last, p 21 -activated kinases (PAKs) were downregulated in SAP 102 KD neurons. These results demonstrate that SAP 102 has unique roles in <b>cortical</b> <b>synapse</b> development by mediating EphB and its downstream PAK signaling pathway. Both SAP 102 and PAKs are associated with X-linked mental retardation in humans; thus, synapse formation mediated by EphB/SAP 102 /PAK signaling in the early postnatal brain may be crucial for cognitive development.

40|$|Deeper {{exploration}} of the brain's vast synaptic networks will require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose those networks. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM remains {{the gold standard for}} reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM (muxFM) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of <b>cortical</b> <b>synapse</b> distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of <b>cortical</b> <b>synapse</b> distributions.

It is characterized by the deficiency of the phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, causing plasmatic hyperphenylalaninemia and variable neurological and cognitive impairments. Among the potential pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in autism spectrum disorders is the excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance which might result from alterations in excitatory/inhibitory synapse development, synaptic transmission and plasticity, downstream signalling pathways, and intrinsic neuronal excitability. Here, we investigated functional and molecular alterations in the prefrontal cortex (pFC) of BTBR-Pah(enu 2) (ENU 2) mice, the animal model of PKU.

40|$|The {{temporal}} precision {{with which}} neurons respond to synaptic inputs {{has a direct}} bearing {{on the nature of}} the neural code. A characterization of the neuronal noise sources associated with different sub-cellular components (synapse, dendrite, soma, axon, and so on) is needed to understand the relationship between noise and information transfer. Here we study the effect of the unreliable, probabilistic nature of synaptic transmission on information transfer in the absence of interaction among presynaptic inputs. We derive theoretical lower bounds on the capacity of a simple model of a <b>cortical</b> <b>synapse</b> under two different paradigms. In signal estimation, the signal is assumed to be encoded in the mean firing rate of the presynaptic neuron, and the objective is to estimate the continuous input signal from the postsynaptic voltage. In signal detection, the input is binary, and the presence or absence of a presynaptic action potential is to be detected from the postsynaptic voltage. The efficacy of information transfer in synaptic transmission is characterized by deriving optimal strategies under these two paradigms. On the basis of parameter values derived from neocortex, we find that single cortical synapses cannot transmit information reliably, but redundancy obtained using a small number of multiple synapses leads to a significant improvement in the information capacity of synaptic transmission...|$|E

40|$|The orderly {{assembly}} of neuronal circuits is specified by developmental programs of gene expression, however, {{the final stage}} in circuit development, maturation and refinement of specific synaptic connections, is strongly influenced by neuronal activity. It is thus {{not surprising that the}} products of many activity-regulated genes have been implicated in synapse development and plasticity. The extracellular signaling protein CPG 15 is one such activity-regulated gene product that promotes the maturation and growth of synapses, dendrites, and axonal arbors during development. Expression of cpg 15 mRNA is spatiotemporally correlated with periods of synapse maturation and refinement, posing it to {{play a central role in}} the wiring of developing brain circuits. Here we utilize a mouse mutant, which is null for the cpg 15 gene (cpg 15 KO), to elucidate the mechanism of CPG 15 function in the developing brain. Analysis of the cpg 15 KO mouse suggests that CPG 15 signaling leads to the selection and stabilization of synapses in the developing brain, as well as in the adult. Loss of CPG 15 results in reduced synapse numbers and synapse maturation with a corresponding reduction in the complexity and growth of neuronal arbors. This is most pronounced during early periods of promiscuous synapse formation and arbor growth that provide a physical substrate upon which subsequent experience-dependent processes act to sculpt mature patterns of neuronal connectivity. Consequently, cpg] 5 KO mice do not appear to undergo the same extensive refinement as their wild type (WT) counterparts. cpg 15 KO mice are also slow learners, requiring repeated training in learning tasks to perform at WT levels. These results led us to propose that the selection and stabilization of synapses by CPG 15 mediates optimal wiring of developing neuronal circuits important for brain function throughout life. To test this possibility we investigated the function of CPG 15 in the developing thalamocortical circuit in the visual system. The thalamus is the major hub for sensory information flow (minus olfaction) en route from the periphery to the cortex. As CPG 15 is expressed in both input and target structures in this circuit we compared <b>cortical</b> <b>synapse</b> development in the global cpg 15 KO mouse which lacks CPG 15 expression in both the cortex and thalamus to a cortex-specific cpg 15 KO mouse which retains thalamic expression of CPG 15.

The simple rule of taking the ratios of affinities for the candidate drug at the different receptors is flawed since the affinity of the endogenous ligand for that off-target receptor or drug exposure is not taken into account. We have developed a mathematical receptor competition model {{that takes into account}} the competition between active drug moiety and the endogenous neurotransmitter to better assess the off-target effects on postsynaptic receptor activation under the correct target exposure conditions. As an example, we investigate the possible functional effects of the weak off-target effects for dopamine- 1 receptor (D 1 R) in a computer simulation of a dopaminergic <b>cortical</b> <b>synapse</b> that is calibrated using published fast-cyclic rodent voltammetry and human imaging data in subjects with different catechol-O-methyltransferase genotypes. We identify the conditions under which off-target effects at the D 1 R can lead to clinically detectable consequences on cognitive tests, such as the N-back working memory test. We also demonstrate that certain concentrations of dimebolin (Dimebon), a recently tested Alzheimer drug, can affect D 1 R activation resulting in clinically detectable cognitive decrease. This approach can be extended to other receptor systems and can improve the selection of clinical candidate compounds by potentially dialing-out harmful off-target effects or dialing-in beneficial off-target effects in a quantitative and controlled way.

40|$|Synapses are {{the contact}} sites between neurons {{in the central}} nervous system and {{represent}} the key elements for synaptic transmission and plasticity within a given connection. In the present study input synapses terminating on morphologically and physiologically identified spiny neurons in layer 4 of the “barrel field” of the adult rat somatosensory cortex were investigated. These neurons {{play a key role in}} cortical information processing since they are the main recipients of sensory signals from the rat whisker pad. The knowledge about structural and functional properties of intra- and translaminar synaptic connections of layer 4 neurons of the somatosensory cortex has steadily increased. In contrast, relatively little is known about the structure of cortical synapses terminating on layer 4 excitatory neurons, in particular their quantitative geometry. Synaptic connections between L 4 excitatory neurons, namely between spiny stellate neurons, are one of the most powerful connections in the neocortex as indicated by a low coefficient of variation and a very low failure rate. To understand these functional characteristics a detailed morphological description of those parameters underlying synaptic transmission and plasticity is an essential pre-requisite. Therefore, structural key elements of synapses such as the size of synaptic boutons, the number and size of active zones, the structural correlate of transmitter release sites, and the size and organization of the pool of synaptic vesicles were obtained from 3 D reconstructions based on serial ultrathin sections and digital electron microscopic images through the dendritic domain of layer 4 excitatory neurons. Furthermore, using Freeze Fracture Replica preparations combined with postimmunogold-labelling the abundance, density, and co-localization of AMPA- and NMDA-receptor subunits at these synapses were analyzed and quantified. Input synapses terminating on dendrites of excitatory layer 4 spiny neurons are relatively small <b>cortical</b> <b>synapse</b> that varied substantially in size and shape. The majority of synapses contained a large, but a single active zone with a perforated and/or nonperforated appearance. Most synaptic vesicles were found within a 150 nm perimeter of the active zone suggesting a relatively large readily releasable and recycling pool. Layer 4 input synapses were ensheathed by a network of astrocytes. Astrocytic processes were seen to reach the active zones as far as the synaptic cleft. The presence of fine glial processes at active zones is therefore likely to prevent glutamate spillover and as a consequence synaptic cross-talk. Glutamatergic receptors from the AMPA- and NMDA-type are present at shaft and spine post-synaptic densities. However, on shaft postsynaptic densities the NMDA-receptors outnumber the AMPA-receptors significantly, resulting in a dominance of the NMDA-receptor component at these synapses. Spine postsynaptic densities are significantly more occupied by AMPA- than NMDA-receptors suggesting that the fast excitatory synaptic transmission at spine postsynaptic densities is mainly mediated by AMPA-receptors rather than by the NMDA-receptor. The results of the present study clearly demonstrated that the structural geometry and the composition of subelements together with the density and distribution of glutamate receptors of the AMPA- and NMDA-type underlie the unique functional characteristics of layer 4 synapses. Clinical and experimental evidence suggest a dysregulation of NMDA-receptor function and glutamatergic pathways in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

At those locations, synapses (spines) are created with a constant probability and removed with a probability depending on the number of existing synapses and the stimulation of the neurons. From these two probabil-ities, the stationary distribution of the number o...|$|R
40|$|Motor {{learning}} and habit formation {{are thought to}} depend on corticostriatal synaptic plasticity. Moreover, basolateral amygdala (BLA) activity facilitates consolidation of striatal-dependent memories. Accordingly, BLA stimulation in vitro facilitates long-term potentiation (LTP) induction at corticostriatal synapses onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Although these effects were found to depend on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation at BLA synapses and consequent Ca 2 + influx, {{it is unclear how}} this event can facilitate LTP at <b>cortical</b> <b>synapses,</b> even when the two inputs are not coactivated. Here, we aimed to shed light on this question, using whole cell recordings of MSNs in vitro. We first tested whether BLA inputs end at more proximal dendritic sites than cortical inputs. In this scenario, BLA synapses would experience stronger spike-related depolarizations and be in a strategic position to control the spread of second messengers. However, comparison of compound excitatory postsynaptic potentials and single-axon excitatory postsynaptic currents revealed that BLA and <b>cortical</b> <b>synapses</b> are intermingled. Next, we examined the sensitivity of cortical and BLA NMDA responses to ifenprodil because NR 2 A-containing NMDA receptors have faster kinetics than those containing NR 2 B subunits. However, the two inputs did not differ in this respect. Last, reasoning that propagating waves of Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR) could bridge temporal gaps between the two inputs, we tested the effects of CICR inhibitors on the BLA facilitation of corticostriatal LTP induction. Pharmacological interference with CICR blocked corticostriatal LTP induction. Thus our results are consistent with the notion that NMDA-dependent Ca 2 + influx at BLA synapses initiates propagating waves of CICR, thereby biasing active corticostriatal inputs toward synaptic potentiation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{suggests}} that this decrease in synaptic efficacy in <b>cortical</b> <b>synapses</b> was not observed at steady-state, but rather during a transition period preceding it whose duration is frequencydependent. It is shown that the time taken to reach steady-state may be frequency-dependent, and may take considerably longer to occur at high than low frequencies. As a result, the pairinginduced decrease in synaptic efficacy at high presynaptic firing rates helps to localize the firing of the postsynaptic neuron to a short time interval following the onset of high frequency presynaptic spike trains. This effect may "speed up the time scale" in response to high frequency bursts of spikes, and may contribute to rapid synchronization of spike firing across cortical cells that are bound together by associatively learned connections...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: In humans sleep {{slow wave}} {{activity}} (SWA) declines during adolescence. It {{has been suggested}} that this decline reflects the elimination of <b>cortical</b> <b>synapses,</b> but this hypothesis has never been tested directly. DESIGN: We focused on mouse frontal cortex and collected data from early adolescence (∼postnatal day 20, P 20) to adulthood (P 60) of (1) SWA; (2) expression of synapsin I, a presynaptic marker; and (3) number of dendritic spines in layers I-II. SETTING: Basic sleep research laboratory. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: YFP-line H mice (n = 70; P 15 - 87, all males) and GFP-line S mice (n = 14; P 17 - 60, 8 females) were used for EEG recording. Forty-five YFP mice (P 19 - 119, 12 females) and 42 GFP-S mice (P 20 - 60, 14 females) were used for in vivo 2 -photon imaging and ex vivo confocal microscopy, respectively. Other YGP mice (n = 57, P 10 - 77) were used for western blot analysis of synapsin I. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: As in humans, SWA in mice declined from early adolescence to adulthood. Synapsin I levels increased from P 10 to P 24, with little change afterwards. Mean spine density in apical dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons (YFP-H) showed no change from P 20 to P 60. Spine number in layers I-II apical dendrites, belonging to layer III and V pyramidal neurons (GFP-S), increased slightly from P 20 to P 30 and decreased from P 30 to P 60; smaller spines decreased in number from P 20 to P 60, while bigger spines increased. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, {{it is unlikely that the}} developmental decrease in SWA can be accounted for by a net pruning of <b>cortical</b> <b>synapses...</b>|$|R
