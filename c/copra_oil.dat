50|$|South Tarawa is the {{economic}} hub of Kiribati, {{the location of}} the main port and airport and of most of the State Owned Enterprises and private businesses. Copra produced on the outer islands is processed on Betio, producing <b>copra</b> <b>oil</b> for the international market and other products which are sold locally. There is also a fish processing plant producing tuna for export. However imports far outweigh exports, and most households on South Tarawa rely on Government employment and remittances from relatives working overseas for their income. Unemployment and under-employment are a serious problem; in 2010 only 34% of urban adults (over 15) were engaged in cash work; the remaining two-thirds are either out of the labour force, unemployed or engaged in subsistence activities. Young people are especially likely to be unemployed.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{the status}} of the Chagos Islands’ native flora depends very much on past {{exploitation}} of particular islands. About 280 species of flowering plants and ferns have now been recorded on the islands, but this increase reflects the introduction of non-native plants by humans, either accidentally or deliberately. Because some of these non-native species have become invasive and pose a threat to the native ecosystems, plans are being developed to control them. On some islands, native forests were felled to plant coconut palms for the production of <b>copra</b> <b>oil.</b> Other islands remain unspoiled and support a wide range of habitats, including unique Pisonia forests and large clumps of the gigantic fish poison tree (Barringtonia asiatica). Unspoiled islands provide us with the biological information that we need to re-establish the native plant communities on heavily altered islands. These efforts will ultimately help to improve the biodiversity of the Chagos Islands.|$|E

40|$|Using {{biofuels}} {{based on}} coconuts, soybeans or sugarcane for energy generation {{has been around}} for some time. In the late 1990 s, several applications of coconut oil caught on in the Pacific. Major problems with using <b>copra</b> <b>oil</b> in engines are clogging filters and the oil turning solid at 24 ºC. A heat exchanger and using filtered clean <b>copra</b> <b>oil</b> can solve these problems. The motor has to be equipped with a diesel fuel system to start the engine and a coconut oil fuel system to run it. A controlled device heats the coconut oil and, once liquid, automatically switches from diesel to coconut oil. The Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the international centre for cooperation on development-oriented agricultural research (CIRAD) have established electricity generators on Vanuabalavu and Taveuni islands, Fiji, supplying electricity to 198 and 60 households, respectively, and a small oil extracting plant that supplies half of its oil yield for electricity generation. In Vanuatu s capital, Port Vila, a car company runs its vehicles on a blend of coconut oil and diesel in an attempt to convince motorists to fit their engines with a 75 heat exchanger and use a coconut/ diesel blend. This blend, named island fuel, contains 60 % clean <b>copra</b> <b>oil</b> and sells in Port Vila at 12 Vatu or 0. 09 /litre less than diesel. In 2002, more than 100 local buses were driving on this island fuel. A group of coconut producers from Lorevulko and Port Olry on the east coast of Espiritu Santo Island have formed Lory Coop to take up the challenge and are using <b>copra</b> <b>oil</b> for rural electrification, including for running a <b>copra</b> <b>oil</b> mill, cooling facilities and cassava and taro milling. POPACA, a rural development project funded by the European Commission and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will supply the generator. In Vanuatu s agricultural economy coconut is the most important commodity, and low and fluctuating world market prices make it attractive to sell it locally with an added value for the production of affordable electricity. In Port Olry, the cost of diesel is 1 /litre, whereas <b>copra</b> <b>oil</b> processed locally costs only 0. 43 /litre.

The oil is believed by Acehnese can cure some diseases and often use as a medicinal oil. The aim {{of this research is}} to study effects of using variety of vegetable oils (pliek u oil, hot extracted <b>copra</b> <b>oil,</b> and palm oil), and scented herbal concentration on the quality of minyak kemenyan. A randomized block design arranged factorially with three replicates was used. Product analysis were acid value, peroxide value, ester value, and sensory evaluation on smell and color of minyak kemenyan. Traditional purifying process of pliek u oil, and <b>copra</b> <b>oil</b> decreased the acid, peroxide, and iodine values of the oils. Whereas scented herbal concentration caused no significant effect on any quality values of minyak kemenyan. Processing the vegetable oils into minyak kemenyan caused slightly increased in the acid and iodine values, but significantly decreased the peroxide value of that made from pliek u oil.
