40|$|Abstract Background True {{ossification}} <b>of</b> the <b>auricle</b> with cartilage replacement by bone, is a {{very rare}} clinical entity and can result in an entirely rigid auricle. Case presentation We present a rare case of bilateral ossification <b>of</b> the <b>auricles</b> in a 75 -years old man with profound progressive rigidity <b>of</b> both <b>auricles.</b> His main complaint was a mild discomfort during resting making sleeping unpleasant without any other serious symptoms. His medical history was significant for predisposing factors for this condition such as, Addison's disease and diabetes mellitus. Excisional biopsy was performed confirming the ossified nature <b>of</b> the <b>auricles.</b> Further treatment deemed unnecessary in our case due to his mild clinical picture. Conclusion True auricular ossification is a quite rare clinical entity with unclear pathogenesis and one should have in mind that {{there is always the}} possibility of a serious co-existed disease like endocrinopathy. </p...|$|R

The recovery of the motility of planarians pretreated with DMF was found to be time- and dose dependent, all planarians had complete recovery in their motility after 48 h. The appearance <b>of</b> <b>auricles</b> in regenerating animals was easily affected by DMF exposure in comparison with the appearance of eyespot.

40|$|Introduction There {{are several}} studies with {{contradictory}} findings {{about the role}} <b>of</b> <b>concha</b> bullosa with predisposition to rhinosinusitis. This {{study was conducted to}} assess the relationship of osteomeatal unit blockage with concha bullosa. Materials and method A cross-sectional observational study by radiological assessment of prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis and blockage of ipsilateral osteomeatal unit was done on 100 cases <b>of</b> <b>concha</b> bullosa detected on computed tomography to determine the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis in subjects with concha bullosa and to examine the latter’s relationship to osteomeatal unit blockage, which is a precursor for rhinosinusitis. Result One hundred cases <b>of</b> <b>concha</b> bullosa were studied in a total of 87 CT scan films depicting concha bullosa. Some CT scans showed unilateral concha bullosa while few scans showed bilateral concha bullosa. Ipsilateral rhinosinusitis was found in only 31 % of the sides in scans <b>of</b> subjects with <b>concha</b> bullosa. <b>Of</b> the total 100 concha bullosae studied, extensive type was the commonest followed by bulbous and lamellar variety. Discussion Although rhinosinusitis was more predominant in the extensive type <b>of</b> <b>concha</b> bullosa compared to other types, it was statistically not significant and there was no statistically significant association between any type <b>of</b> <b>concha</b> bullosa with ipsilateral rhinosinusitis either in right side or left side. Conclusion This study has found no statistically significant association between any type <b>of</b> <b>concha</b> bullosa with rhinosinusitis. A bigger study with larger sample size is required to better assess the strength <b>of</b> association between <b>concha</b> bullosa and rhinosinusitis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In {{case of an}} {{acquired}} or congenital defect <b>of</b> an <b>auricle</b> a prosthesis can be customized and fixed securely using osseo-integrated implants. The assessment of the Quality of life of patients wearing prosthesis becomes increasingly important {{in the evaluation of}} the quality of care. Therefor, we examined {{the quality of life of}} patients with prosthesis after loss <b>of</b> an <b>auricle</b> using two questionnaires. Patients and methods: 18 patients (14 male, 4 female) were analysed. 10 patients had lost an auricle due to a neoplasm and 2 traumatically. 6 patients showed a congenital lack <b>of</b> an <b>auricle.</b> In order to registrate the subjective quality of life we used a questionaire developed by the WHO (WHOQOL-BREF); for questions about the prostheses we used a self-designed questionnaire. Results: Analysis of the data of all patients with prostheses in comparison with the age-based general population showed a lower value of the quality of life, which means a poorer quality of life but none of the differences was statistically significant. Patients with neoplasms achieved higher values compared with the age-based standard value, the other patients in contrast showed lower values in every respect. The gender-related contemplation of the results showed a poorer quality of life for the females than for the males. Conclusion: The reason for a defect <b>of</b> the <b>auricle</b> as well as the gender of the patients influenced the subjective quality of life after prosthetic surgery. The overall acceptance of the prosthesis <b>of</b> the <b>auricle</b> can be considered as good, especially with patients suffering from neoplasms. In order to be able to evaluate the results and compare the different works groups more sufficiently it would be desirable to use standardized test procedures and a bigger collective of patients...|$|R
