5|$|HDMI 1.0 was {{released}} on December 9, 2002 and is a single-cable digital audio/video <b>connector</b> <b>interface.</b> The link architecture is based on DVI, using exactly the same video transmission format but sending audio and other auxiliary data during the blanking intervals of the video stream. HDMI 1.0 allows a maximum TMDS clock of 165MHz (4.95 Gbit/s), the same as DVI. It defined two connectors called Type A and Type B, with pinouts based on the Single-Link DVI-D and Dual-Link DVI-D connectors respectively, though the Type B connector was never used in any commercial products. HDMI 1.0 uses 8b/10b encoding for video transmission, giving it 3.96Gbit/s of video bandwidth (1920×1080 or 1920×1200 at 60Hz) and 8channel LPCM/192kHz/24-bit audio. HDMI 1.0 supported only 24bit/px color depth and required support for RGB video, with optional support for YCBCR 4:4:4 and 4:2:2 (mandatory if the device had support for YCBCR on other interfaces). Only the Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces were supported. HDMI 1.0 allowed only specific pre-defined video formats to be transmitted, including all the formats defined in EIA/CEA-861-B {{as well as some}} additional formats listed in the HDMI Specification itself. All HDMI sources are also required to be capable of sending or receiving native Single-Link DVI video and be fully compliant with the DVI Specification.|$|E

5000|$|The Sharma {{speaker was}} a rotary speaker, similar in design to the Leslie speaker, that was {{manufactured}} in the UK by Keith Hitchcock during the 1960s and 1970s. The name [...] "Sharma" [...] came from Hitchcock's two children, Sharon and Mark.Hitchcock designed the speaker to directly compete with the Leslie, and consequently it contains similar features, such as a rotating horn for treble frequencies, a drum for bass frequencies, and the same nine-pin amphenol <b>connector</b> <b>interface</b> as contemporary Leslies then in production.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} for the intermateability between standard multimode fiber (MMF) and bend-insensitive multimode fiber (BI-MMF). Due to differences in fiber numerical aperture (NA) and waveguide structure, the mixing of these fiber types within an optical channel link can result {{in an increase in}} insertion loss at <b>connector</b> <b>interfaces.</b> One contribution to this added loss is referred to as NA loss. To characterize the NA loss, we obtained fiber samples from three major fiber manufacturers to determine the nominal variability in NA. Based on far field measurement data, NA probability density functions were obtained for both MMF and BI-MMF fiber types which enabled us to select test fibers representative of typical NA variability. The NA loss was measured for key differences in NA mismatch as well as different launch conditions in order to quantify the potential impact on optical loss budgets in high-speed networks. A brief overview of fiber NA is given and our experimental results are tabulated and compared with theory. In addition to NA loss the bend performance for BI-MMF is presented and other loss contributions are discussed...|$|R
