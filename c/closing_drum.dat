It has a [...] "Dolorosa" [...] sculpture by Francisco Salzillo and an articulated statue of Jesus that gives the blessing on Good Friday on a local hilltop designated Mount Calvary, before a congregation normally numbering some 30,000. After the trumpet sounds, the drums are silenced and the [...] "Mektub" [...] theme is sounded, while the Christ statue makes a gesture of blessing towards the four cardinal points.

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states [...] "Kenny Wheeler's string of ECM {{recordings}} are all quite rewarding, generally avoiding the ECM stereotype of introspective long tones and silence... A generally memorable outing". In {{the view of}} Los Angeles Times reviewer Leonard Feather, writing shortly after the album's release, Wheeler's LP was just one extraneous drum solo away from a perfect 5-star rating.With Michael Brecker on tenor sax and a rhythm section that is powerful both individually and collectively, he has produced a provocative and often stimulating set of six original works. The horns' interplay on [...] "Three for D'reen," [...] Holland's phenomenal solo on [...] "Blue for Lou" [...] and all five men on the 14-minute [...] "Foxy Trot" [...] share the credit. This {{could have been a}} five-star set, but [...] "" [...] lapses into one of those inevitable <b>closing</b> <b>drum</b> solos. Why? Why? 4 stars.|$|E
40|$|Chipper {{design is}} a main driver of {{production}} efficiency within forest fuel supply chains, but little scientific knowledge is available about {{the performance of}} different types. Two alternative drum chipper designs were tested on different feedstock types and under different knife wear conditions. The <b>closed</b> <b>drum</b> full-length knife design was more efficient than the open drum staggered-knife design, when negotiating branches, especially when knives were dull. Under these conditions, productivity was higher, fuel use lower and product quality better for the <b>closed</b> <b>drum</b> design. These differences were statistically significant. Therefore, a <b>closed</b> <b>drum</b> design is preferable when branches are the main feedstock, especially if product quality specifications are demanding. In general, the performance of both designs was significantly affected by feedstock type and knife wear...|$|R
50|$|As the 1990s {{drew to a}} <b>close,</b> <b>drum</b> {{and bass}} withdrew from {{mainstream}} popularity and concentrated on the new more ominous sounds which were popular in clubs, rather than on mainstream radio. Techstep came to dominate the drum and bass genre, with artists like Konflict and Bad Company amongst the most visible. As time went on, techstep became more minimal, and increasingly dark in tone, and the funky, commercial appeal represented by Roni Size back in 1997 waned. A characteristic of this was the increasing disproportion of male to female club goers and a generally more aggressive and dark atmosphere at clubs.|$|R

40|$|Chip size {{distribution}} {{is an important}} quality variable not only for buyers of forest fuels, but also for chipping contractors as it influences both fuel consumption and productivity of chippers. Studies of disc chippers and of <b>drum</b> chippers with <b>closed</b> <b>drums</b> have shown that increased chip target length increases chipper productivity and decreases fuel consumption per ton of chips produced. For open drum chippers, chip length is partly controlled by the mesh size in the sieve. In order to evaluate how this sieve affects productivity and fuel consumption of chippers, two open drum machines for professional chipping of forest fuels were studied. Small chippers were represented by a Kesla 645, and larger ones by an Eschlböck Biber 92. The Kesla 645 was studied with 25, 50, and 100 mm sieves and the Biber 92 with 35, 50, and 100 mm sieves. With the 100 mm sieve the Kesla chipper produced 14. 5 oven dry ton (odt) of chips per effective hour and the Biber 30. 0 odt per effective hour. Fuel consumption per odt was 3. 0 l for the Kesla and 2. 1 l for the Biber. A reduction of sieve mesh size decreased productivity and increased fuel consumption for both machines. Reducing the mesh size decreased the size of produced chips for the Kesla, {{but not for the}} Biber. The sieve on the Biber seems to be a safety measure against oversized pieces whereas chip size is, as on a <b>closed</b> <b>drum</b> chipper, mainly controlled by the cut length of the knives...|$|R

50|$|As {{the brake}} linings wear, the shoes must travel a greater {{distance}} {{to reach the}} drum. When the distance reaches a certain point, a self-adjusting mechanism automatically reacts by adjusting the rest position of the shoes {{so that they are}} <b>closer</b> to the <b>drum.</b> Here, the adjusting lever rocks enough to advance the adjuster gear by one tooth. The adjuster has threads on it, like a bolt, so that it unscrews a little bit when it turns, lengthening to fill in the gap. When the brake shoes wear a little more, the adjuster can advance again, so it always keeps the shoes <b>close</b> to the <b>drum.</b> Typically the adjusters only operate when the vehicle is going in reverse and the brakes are engaged.|$|R
50|$|Sherardizing is {{a process}} of {{galvanization}} of ferrous metal surfaces, also called vapour galvanising and dry galvanizing. The process is named after the British metallurgist Sherard Osborn Cowper-Coles (son of naval inventor Cowper Phipps Coles) who invented and patented the method ca. 1900. This process involves heating the steel parts up to ca. 500°C in a <b>closed</b> rotating <b>drum</b> that also contains metallic zinc dust and possibly an inert filler, such as sand. At temperatures above 300°C, zinc evaporates and diffuses into the steel substrate forming diffusion bonded Zn-Fe-phases.|$|R

40|$|X- and gamma-ray imaging {{techniques}} in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and assay (NDA) have been increasing use in {{an array of}} industrial, environmental, military, and medical applications. Much of this growth in recent years is attributed to the rapid development of computed tomography (CT) and the use of NDE throughout the life-cycle of a product. Two diverse examples of CT are discussed. (1) The computational approach to normal joint kinematics and prosthetic joint analysis offers an opportunity to evaluate and improve prosthetic human joint replacements before they are manufactured or surgically implanted. Computed tomography data from scanned joints are segmented, resulting in the identification of bone and other tissues of interest, with emphasis on the articular surfaces. (2) They are developing NDE and NDE techniques to analyze <b>closed</b> waste <b>drums</b> accurately and quantitatively.

50|$|Glascock's health {{problems}} became apparent {{when he was}} unable to complete the U.S. leg of the Heavy Horses tour, missing a transatlantic simulcast from Madison Square Garden. He played his last gig on 1 May 1979, in San Antonio, Texas, three years to the day of his first gig with Jethro Tull. Despite the diagnosis of heart valve damage caused by an infection, he continued his previous lifestyle, which involved heavy drinking, marijuana usage, and wild parties. His health continued to deteriorate. Ian Anderson gave him several warnings before finally laying him off with pay during the production of Stormwatch (1979), completing most of the bass guitar parts himself. During the subsequent promotional tour with replacement bass player Dave Pegg, Anderson learned of Glascock's death and had to break the news {{to the rest of the}} band.
