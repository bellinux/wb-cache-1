40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} modeling, design, and {{fabrication}} of millimeter-wave quasi-integrated horn antennas {{consisting of a}} micromachined horn with an embedded detector and a small flare angle machined horn. The micromachined portion of the quasi-integrated millimeter-wave horns can be fabricated using low-cost, well-established techniques. To facilitate lower-cost fabrication of the machined section, this thesis explores the use of cir-cular machined <b>sections.</b> <b>Circular</b> <b>sections</b> are much cheaper to fabricate than the previously used rectangular machined sections. In order to predict the performance of <b>circular</b> <b>sections,</b> the mode matching method along with the generalized scattering matrix technique is used to model the quasi-integrated horn. The far-field pattern is predicted and designs of <b>circular</b> <b>sections</b> are created.

25|$|Avro first {{proposed}} {{to build the}} Avro 687 (Avro XX), which was a Lincoln bomber with a new <b>circular</b> <b>section</b> pressurized fuselage and a large single fin and rudder {{in place of the}} predecessor's double ones. During the design stage, the idea of a simple conversion was abandoned and the Avro 688 was designed, which retained the four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines. It was designed by Roy Chadwick who, due to wartime restrictions, could not design a completely new aircraft, but had to use existing parts, tools and jigs. Using the Lincoln's wing, Chadwick, who had worked on the Lancaster, designed the Tudor to incorporate a new pressurized fuselage of circular cross-section, with a useful load of 3,765lb (1,705kg) and a range of 3,975mi (6,400km).|$|E

25|$|The third {{prototype}} to fly, {{serial number}} B9965, had modified wings, {{with a wider}} centre-section and a smaller cutout for the pilot, while the fuselage had a fully <b>circular</b> <b>section,</b> rather than the slab-sided {{one of the first}} two aircraft, and the tail was smaller. It was officially tested in December 1917, reaching a speed of 119mph (192km/h), and was then rebuilt with longer-span (30ft (9.14 m)) two-bay wings (compared with the 25ft 9in (7.85 m) single bay wings). This allowed the Snipe to compete for Air Board Specification A.1(a) for a high-altitude single-seat fighter. This specification required a speed of at least 135mph (225km/h) at 15,000ft (4,573 m) and a ceiling of at least 25,000ft (7,620 m) while carrying an armament of two fixed and one swivelling machine gun. An oxygen supply and heated clothing were to be provided for the pilot to aid operation at high altitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} was to mount the guns, still on their carriages, on rail cars to increase their strategic mobility. The gun's firing platform (Bettungslafette) {{was used as a}} model for the mount on the rail car. A metal ring was fixed to the surface of the car on which the wheels rested. At the center of this ring was a large pivot pin from which tension rods extended to the carriage's trail which rested against a <b>circular</b> <b>section</b> of rail. The gun was traversed by means of a gear that engaged pins on the outside of the rail. The trail rested on two spring-supported rollers, which would compress during firing and allow the shock of recoil to be transmitted to the floor of the car. To prevent damage to the trucks during firing cast-steel wedges were placed on the railroad ties under matching wedges on the car and the car was moved up on them. Some sources quote its maximum elevation as 47.5°, but Miller says that the sight on the gun itself was only calibrated to 45°. If more traverse was needed the gun's original firing platform was carried on a separate car and the gun could be dismounted to use it.|$|E
25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is very hard and scratch resistant. However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated glass mirrors are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead. Glass mirrors backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth piece of glass with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small, <b>circular</b> <b>section,</b> producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient glass mirrors were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient glass mirrors, solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|E
