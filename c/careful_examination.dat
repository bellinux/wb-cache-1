5|$|In {{certain areas}} in North America, where the {{diversity}} of snakes is not too large, easy keys based on simple identification of scales have been devised for the lay public to distinguish venomous snakes from non-venomous snakes. In other places with large biodiversity, such as Myanmar, publications caution that venomous and non-venomous snakes cannot be easily distinguished apart without <b>careful</b> <b>examination.</b>|$|E
5|$|By <b>careful</b> <b>examination,</b> the {{luminosity}} {{was found}} to proceed from the gills and not the stipe, nor from any fragment of rotten wood attached to the specimen. This phosphoresence was not observed in all specimens brought in for examination, and seemed to depend on some peculiar condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} {{the exact location of}} the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A <b>careful</b> <b>examination</b> through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E

5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to <b>careful</b> <b>examination</b> for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the plants depicted in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers, however, classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature: German scholar Ernst Langlotz (1895–1978) thought that the women were holding a type of rose; Picard recognizes the symbolism of Demeter and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy, possibly the opium poppy, the Oriental poppy, or the Iranian poppy. <b>Careful</b> <b>examination</b> of the thick 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837–1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (talus bones from goats or sheep used {{to play the game}} of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.|$|E
5|$|A <b>careful</b> <b>examination</b> of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that}} there is a {{difference}} between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

After <b>careful</b> <b>examination</b> of videos of an underwater hull inspect:ion, {{it was determined that}} the ship's hull would have to be repainted. Klakring was dry-docked from 7–21 November at the Charleston Naval Shipyard to undergo the necessary repairs. The ship successfully received full aviation certification on 27 November, and began final preparations for a Harpoon Missile Tactical Qualification.|$|E
25|$|Prior to his convictions, Hovind was a {{prolific}} debater. While Hovind campaigns against evolution, {{the level of}} support for evolution is essentially universal within the scientific community and academia, while support for creationism is minimal among scientists in general, and virtually nonexistent among those in the relevant fields: biology, paleontology, geology, etc. C. A. Chinn and L. A. Buckland classify his debate style, common among Young Earth Creationists, as eristic: focused on winning by rhetoric rather than illuminating by <b>careful</b> <b>examination</b> of evidence.|$|E
25|$|This taxon {{was first}} {{collected}} from near Perth in the 1840s, and published as Calymperes latifolium in 1846 by Georg Ernst Ludwig Hampe, in Volume II of Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's Plantae Preissianae. In the 1980s, a <b>careful</b> <b>examination</b> {{showed it to}} be only superficially similar to Calymperes (Calymperaceae). It was held {{to belong to a}} different family, the Pottiaceae, but did not fit into any of that family's published genera. In 1985, therefore, Ilma Grace Stone published Calymperastrum and transferred C.latifolium into it.|$|E
60|$|Feeling his way {{carefully}} {{round the}} walls of his prison, the Indian ascertained that it was not much more than about twelve feet long by three or four broad. On one side was the comparatively smooth wall of the berg, but for the hollow in which he would have been crushed; in front was the rugged heap of confused masses which had thoroughly closed him in. There was no outlet anywhere; he felt assured of that after three <b>careful</b> <b>examinations</b> of the chamber, and how many thousand tons of ice lay between him and liberty of course he could not guess.|$|R

40|$|The Snoek {{relaxation}} due to interstitial solutes in bcc metals {{is often}} affected markedly {{by the presence}} of a small amount of substitutional solute atoms. This effect is believed to originate from the interaction between the substitutional and interstitial solute atoms, or the s-i interaction. This review summarizes first the experimental observations on the Snoek relaxation in various dilute alloys such as Fe-M-C/N and V/Nb/Ta-M-O/N, and describes next the theoretical studies on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the relaxation. It is suggested from recent studies that <b>careful</b> <b>examinations</b> of the variation of the spectrum with solute concentrations are useful for quantitative characterization of the s-i interaction...|$|R
25|$|Physicians rely on {{a variety}} of {{procedures}} and laboratory tests to confirm a diagnosis. The cardinal requirement for the diagnosis of IBS is abdominal pain. The Rome II criteria are used to diagnose IBS after a <b>careful</b> <b>examination</b> of the patient's medical history and physical abdominal examination which looks for any 'red flag' symptoms. More recently, the Rome III criteria, incorporating some changes over the previous set of criteria, have been issued. The Rome II and III efforts have integrated pediatric components in their set of criteria.|$|E
25|$|Hulda Stumpf lay {{across the}} bed with a {{mattress}} doubled over her face. I was the second person to enter the room after the tragedy, and I made a <b>careful</b> <b>examination</b> of her poor body. She had been brutally treated but was not, as the story was circulated, {{the victim of a}} bungling attempt at circumcision. That finally she had been strangled was evident by the large black and blue patches on her throat and neck. She was safe on the other side, but had had a rough passage.|$|E
25|$|George Gaylord Simpson was {{responsible}} for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with paleontology in his 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution. Simpson's work was crucial because so many paleontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, {{with the idea that}} natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of linear progression (in for example the evolution of the horse) that earlier paleontologists had used as support for neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not hold up under <b>careful</b> <b>examination.</b> Instead the fossil record was consistent with the irregular, branching, and non-directional pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|A more {{thorough}} understanding of the Metzgeriales was not achieved until the morphological and developmental work of Leitgeb {{in the late nineteenth}} century. [...] Leitgeb {{was among the first to}} recognize and appreciate the significance of development and reproductive morphology as a guide to distinguishing liverwort groups. His <b>careful</b> <b>examinations</b> guided revisions made in the classification published from 1893 to 1895 by Schiffner in Engler and Prantl. [...] Schiffner thus divided his [...] "Jungermanniales" [...] into two broad groups according to whether the archegonia were terminal on reproductive branches (Jungermanniales akrogynae) or sub-terminal (Jungermanniales anakrogynae). This latter group included what are now recognized as the Metzgeriales, Sphaerocarpales, and Haplomitriales.|$|R
60|$|There is one {{well-known}} case {{which may}} represent all. It {{is an excellent}} illustration of Cuvier's sagacity, and he evidently takes some pride in telling his story about it. A split slab of stone arrived from the quarries of Montmartre, {{the two halves of}} which contained the greater part of the skeleton of a small animal. On <b>careful</b> <b>examinations</b> of the characters of the teeth and of the lower jaw, which happened to be exposed, Cuvier assured himself that they presented such a very close resemblance to the corresponding parts in the living opossums that he at once assigned the fossil to that genus.|$|R
