40|$|In Europe {{the use of}} zeolite-rich tuffs as {{additives}} {{in animal}} feeding is well established and ratified by legislation. Quality checks on batches are mandatory to determine the undesirable elements such as lead that, among the heavy metals, plays a primary role for its devastating effects on the life quality of living beings. The present study aimed at determining the total and leached Pb for different samples of Campanian zeolite-rich tuffs related to the most relevant volcanic eruptions (Campanian Ignimbrite and Neapolitan Yellow Tuff). Other samples deriving from other Italian and extra-european exploitation sites were used for comparative tests. The research demonstrated that lead occurrence {{is linked to the}} specific paragenesis of the investigated rocks whereas the leached Pb largely depends on the type of zeolite and its amount. It was also established that the use of Campanian zeolite-rich tuffs as additives in animal feeding can be tolerated as these materials are well comparable to analogous products from the minerogenetic point of view such as the <b>clinoptilolite</b> <b>of</b> <b>volcanic</b> <b>origin.</b> ...|$|E
