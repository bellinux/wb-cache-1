External fiducials, around the exterior frame of the image, must be precisely measured to establish the overall physical geometry. Internal fiducials are provided within the image by placement of cloth panels {{on the ground at}} locations whose position is precisely known. Both types of fiducials must be known within the pixel space of a digitized image in order for the feature extraction process to be accurate with respect to delineated features. Precise mensuration of these fiducials requires that a cartographer view the image on a display and use pointing devices, such as a mouse, to pick the exact point. For accurate fiducial location, the required manual operations can be an added time-consuming task in the feature extraction process. Interactive tools which eliminate the precise pointing action for the operator are described in this thesis. The operator is required only to "box-in" the fiducial, using a simple drawing tool, select the fiducial function, and the software of the tool returns the precise location of the fiducial...|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} completed Mars mosaicked digital image model (MDIM) and the soon-to-be-completed Mars {{digital terrain model}} (DTM) are being transcribed to optical disks to simplify distribution to planetary investigators. These models, completed in FY 1991, provide a cartographic base to which all existing Mars data can be registered. The digital image map of Mars is a cartographic extension {{of a set of}} compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM) volumes containing individual Viking Orbiter images now being released. The data in these volumes are pristine {{in the sense that they}} were processed only to the extent required to view them as images. They contain the artifacts and the radiometric, geometric, and photometric characteristics of the raw data transmitted by the spacecraft. This new set of volumes, on the other hand, contains <b>cartographic</b> <b>compilations</b> made by processing the raw images to reduce radiometric and geometric distortions and to form geodetically controlled MDIM's. It also contains digitized versions of an airbrushed map of Mars as well as a listing of all feature names approved by the International Astronomical Union. In addition, special geodetic and photogrammetric processing has been performed to derive rasters of topographic data, or DTM's. The latter have a format similar to that of MDIM, except that elevation values are used in the array instead of image brightness values. The set consists of seven volumes: (1) Vastitas Borealis Region of Mars; (2) Xanthe Terra of Mars; (3) Amazonis Planitia Region of Mars; (4) Elysium Planitia Region of Mars; (5) Arabia Terra of Mars; (6) Planum Australe Region of Mars; and (7) a digital topographic map of Mars...|$|R
