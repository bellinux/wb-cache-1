More {{than half of the}} schools in the study followed a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>approach</b> that included information about both abstinence and contraception, while approximately one third of schools provided students with abstinence-only sex education. In 2002, most Americans favored the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>approach.</b> A 2000 {{study found that}} almost all schools included information about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in their curricula. There have been efforts among social conservatives in the US government to limit sex education in public schools to abstinence-only sex education curricula. The effectiveness of abstinence-only programs has been an issue of controversy.|$|E

25|$|Opened in 1951 as {{a school}} for {{visually}} impaired pupils, Exhall Grange was the first school to cater exclusively for partially sighted children. It later widened its remit to include pupils with other disabilities, and became a grammar school in 1960. Under the stewardship {{of one of its}} best known headmasters, George Marshall OBE, the school gained an international reputation for the quality of its education, while Marshall himself became a leading expert on the education and welfare of visually impaired people. Marshall's successor, Richard Bignell, steered the school towards a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>approach</b> to education, and as a visually impaired person himself championed the use of computers as an aid to learning.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no {{complete}} cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often elicited {{as a result of}} stuttering, and consequently exacerbates stuttering symptoms. This method of treatment is referred to as a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>approach,</b> in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life. Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{research}} {{done in the}} Great Western Woodlands has estimated that currently there are ~950 million tonnes of carbon stored in the vegetation and soils of the region. Carbon that is stored in natural ecosystems such as woodlands {{is referred to as}} ‘Green Carbon’. Green Carbon is stored in both living and dead plant matter and in soils. Managing natural ecosystems, and the carbon they store, is believed to be crucial in a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>approach</b> to addressing climate change. Large and intense fires are identified as the most significant threat to green carbon stocks in the region. With better management, it is estimated that an additional 600 million tonnes of carbon could be stored in the region. This is equivalent to four times Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions for 2008. To maximise the potential carbon stored in the Great Western Woodlands requires that further degradation of the land be avoided, as well as restoring currently degraded ecosystems back to full maturity.|$|E
25|$|The Blackout Reduction Program (PRA) was {{established}} {{by the government in}} 2001. Initially designed to last two years, it has been subsequently extended {{in the absence of an}} alternative way to deal with the issues it addresses. This program has the objective of targeting subsidies to the poor on a geographical basis and implementing rolling blackouts in a more organized fashion. The poorest neighborhoods in the cities were to have a provision of about 20 hours of electricity per day at a price highly subsidized by the government and the utility. The PRA was initially considered a success. However, the country's macroeconomic crisis, the perverse incentives built into the PRA, and the deficiently targeted subsidy scheme have jeopardized the medium-term sustainability of the program. The absence of demand management, the lack of metering systems, sustained losses, a culture of non-payment and the absence of incentives for the distribution companies to fix the technical problems make it urgent to design a new subsidy and rationing system that is part of a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>approach</b> to solve the problems of the power sector.|$|E
