25|$|Water {{and steam}} {{are a common}} fluid used for heat exchange, due to its {{availability}} and high heat capacity, both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all thermal power stations, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower). In the United States, <b>cooling</b> <b>power</b> plants is the largest use of water.|$|E

40|$|Traditional bath {{recirculation}} cooler for {{precision machine}} tools always has the uniform and open-loop cooling strategy onto different heat generating parts. This causes redundant generated heat being transferred {{into the machine}} structure, and results in unsatisfactory thermal errors of precision machine tools. For the solution of this problem, this paper presents the differentiated multi-loops bath recirculation system. The developed system can accomplish differentiated and close-loop cooling strategies onto machine heat generating parts during its operation. Specially, in order to illustrate the advantages of this system, constant supply <b>cooling</b> <b>powers</b> strategy is presented with its applications onto {{a certain type of}} built-in motorized spindle. Consequently, advantages of the proposed strategy based on the differentiated multi-loops bath recirculation system are verified experimentally in the environment within consistent temperature (TR = 20 ± 0. 3 °C). Compared with room temperature tracing strategy based on the traditional bath recirculation cooler, the constant supply <b>cooling</b> <b>powers</b> strategy is verified to be advantageous in spindle temperature stabilization and thermal errors decrease. ...|$|R
