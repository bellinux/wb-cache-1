40|$|Based on {{the results}} of the {{development}} project ECDIS 2 and using the preliminary standards of the IMO, IHO and IEC available during the development period, the required functionalities and displays of the electronic sea chart were implemented and tested in the testbed on two ships. The results have flown into the international standards and regulations for ECDIS. Simultaneously, tests showed that the electronic chart databases prepared by different national hydrographic institutes can be jointly used in one system. The same applies to update information. With the aid of the testbed, it was also possible to derive significant findings not only with regard to the display of superimposed information from the sea <b>chart</b> <b>radar</b> position sensor but also with regard to the color display and the image content of ECDIS which is necessary and can still be processed by the operator. Requirements over and beyond the actual system which are not yet allowed for in the valid regulations or are even contradictory were identified in order to achieve the related harmonization of standards. For the prototype developed {{within the framework of the}} project, it was possible to successfully demonstrate the full functionality of a real-time navigation and information system as well as the potential of the system as a collision warning system.

Currently, many agencies continue to produce individual products and services on a component basis. Hydrographic offices grapple with trying to provide multiple products and services for paper charts, raster navigational charts (RNCs) and electronic navigational charts (ENCs) while a same time, Coast Guard and Maritime Safety agencies focus on improving Aids-to-Navigation (AtoN), Vessel Traffic Services (VTS), AIS networks [...] and more recently, port security. In some respects, the continued concentration on separate products and services represents an organizational reluctance to change. This in turn, results in a fragmented, sub-optimal approach to the safety-of-navigation caused by the inability to provide mariners with “seamless” information at reasonable cost. In particular, hydrographic offices must be willing to recognize that chart information can no longer be considered to be separate, individual products. When it comes to the provision and use of chart-related information for use in an INS, the focus needs to shift to what information is actually desired, how it will be provided, what other information it will be used with, and whether it is truly up-todate...|$|E

In spite of all the electronic navigation devices on a modern ship’s bridge, bridge crews sometimes lose their orientation. Reasons for this might be excessive cognitive workload caused by fatigue, short decision times due to high speed, or too many instruments to read and integrate. An information design research project focusing on cognitive off-loading has allowed us to evaluate different ways of displaying navigational information. Traditionally, electronic <b>charts</b> and <b>radars</b> onboard are displayed in a north-up orientation. On south-bound courses, this requires mental rotations to align the <b>chart</b> or <b>radar</b> image with the real world.

40|$|Abstract: Tea {{garden tiller}} {{is one of}} the most widely used in China, which is {{indispensable}} equipment for soil tilling in tea garden. The performance of tea garden tiller is always focused on when being used. Meanwhile, researches on evaluating the performance of tea garden tiller have been rarely reported. So it is of importance to find a methodology to evaluate tiller’s performance. In this paper, the important indexes of tiller performances are presented firstly, including fuel consumption, cultivation time, cultivation depth, cultivation width and soil crushing ratio. Then these indexes for eight different types of cultivation machineries from home and abroad are experimented and detected. Thirdly, rough sets and <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> are utilized for performance evaluation of cultivation machineries, where rough set theory is to determine the weight of performance index and <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> for performance analysis. Finally, performance of cultivation machinery is analyzed based on <b>radar</b> <b>chart,</b> which can provide the convenience and proof of optimal cultivation machinery selection for farmers. The results of <b>radar</b> <b>chart</b> analysis show that operational performance of KAMA B is the best and Little White Dragon B stand the second place. In addition, from the performance analysis, the deficiencies of service cultivation machinery can be found and the improvements can be suggested...|$|R
