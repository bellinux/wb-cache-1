50|$|Demand Response: Any {{reactive}} or preventative {{method to}} reduce, flatten or shift demand. Historically, demand response programs {{have focused on}} peak reduction to defer {{the high cost of}} constructing generation capacity. However, demand response programs are now being looked to assist with changing the net load shape as well, load minus solar and wind generation, to help with integration of variable renewable energy. Demand response includes all intentional modifications to consumption patterns of electricity of end user customers that are intended to alter the timing, level of instantaneous demand, or the total electricity consumption. Demand response refers {{to a wide range of}} actions which can be taken at the <b>customer</b> <b>side</b> of the electricity meter in response to particular conditions within the electricity system (such as peak period network congestion or high prices), including the aforementioned IDSM.|$|E
5000|$|Security experts {{quoted by}} the BBC {{indicated}} that well-written firewall rules can filter out most traffic from DDoS attacks by LOIC, thus preventing the attacks from being fully effective. In {{at least one}} instance, filtering out all UDP and ICMP traffic blocked a LOIC attack. [...] Because internet service providers provide less bandwidth to each of their customers {{in order to provide}} guaranteed service levels for all of their customers at once, firewall rules of this sort {{are more likely to be}} effective when implemented at a point upstream of an application server's internet uplink. In other words, it is easy to cause an ISP to drop traffic destined for a customer by sending a greater amount of traffic than is allowed on that customer's link, and any filtration that occurs on the <b>customer</b> <b>side</b> after the traffic traverses that link will not stop the service provider from dropping excess traffic destined for that customer.|$|E
5000|$|More typical systems {{incorporate}} a digital cellular communication unit that will contact the central station (or some other location) via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) {{and raise the}} alarm, either with a synthesized voice or increasingly via an encoded message string that the central station decodes. These may connect to the regular phone system on the system side of the demarcation point, but typically connect on the <b>customer</b> <b>side</b> ahead of all phones within the monitored premises so that the alarm system can seize the line by cutting-off any active calls and call the monitoring company if needed. A dual signalling system would raise the alarm wirelessly via a radio path (GPRS/GSM) or cellular path using the phone line or broadband line as a back-up overcoming any compromise to the phone line. Encoders can be programmed to indicate which specific sensor was triggered, and monitors can show the physical location (or [...] "zone") of the sensor on a list or even {{a map of the}} protected premises, which can make the resulting response more effective. For example, a heat sensor alarm, coupled with a flame detector in the same area is a more reliable indication of an actual fire than just one or the other sensor indication by itself.|$|E

50|$|Residential indoor {{water use}} can vary {{considerably}} across households {{depending on the}} number of residents (or more specifically, on the size and family composition of each household) and other circumstances (both systematic and random). It also depends on the contribution of the various domestic purposes of water use to the variability of total indoor use. The distributions of the observed average daily volumes for eight major end uses of water also shows considerable variability and a skew toward the right hand tails of the distributions (the data on the figure with distributions of end use volumes are truncated at 120 gpd to enhance the separation of the distribution graphs; in order to include all observations within the right tail of the distributions would require extending the horizontal scale to 560 gpd (to capture the maximum observed volumes of 553 gphd for leaks, 345 gphd for faucets and 223 gphd for toilets). Among the eight indoor end uses, five (i.e., leaks, toilet flushing, showering, clothes washing and faucet use) show pronounced right skew in their distributions that contributes to the “fatter” and longer right-hand tail in total indoor use. Significant reductions in some end uses of water could be achieved not only through the adoption of efficient technologies (i.e., fixtures and appliances) but also through consumers' small behavioral changes to reduce water use and wastage and by eliminating <b>customer</b> <b>side</b> leakage through automated metering and leak alert programs.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demand {{response}} (DR) is defined as: [...] “Changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns {{in response to}} changes in the price of electricity over time, or to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized.” DR includes all intentional modifications to consumption patterns of electricity to induce customers that are intended to alter the timing, level of instantaneous demand, or the total electricity consumption. [...] It is expected that {{demand response}} programs will be designed to decrease electricity consumption or shift it from on-peak to off-peak periods depending on consumers’ preferences and lifestyles. Demand Response can be defined as [...] "a wide range of actions which can be taken at the <b>customer</b> <b>side</b> of the electricity meter in response to particular conditions within the electricity system (such as peak period network congestion or high prices)". Demand response is a reduction in demand designed to reduce peak demand or avoid system emergencies. Hence, demand response can be a more cost-effective alternative than adding generation capabilities to meet the peak and or occasional demand spikes. The underlying objective of DR is to actively engage customers in modifying their consumption in response to pricing signals. The goal is to reflect supply expectations through consumer price signals or controls and enable dynamic changes in consumption relative to price.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{information}} technology (IT) in improving companies’ competitiveness, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs), has been widely accepted. But, the IT investment will be in vain, if SMEs do not align their business and IT. There {{is a need to}} develop a framework of business-IT alignment. The framework development requires an understanding of the patterns of IT implementation in supporting SMEs’ business (e-business initiatives). This paper presents an empirical study on e-business initiatives in Indonesian manufacturing SMEs. The study uses 41 business processes that are grouped into three business focuses: supplier side, internal side and <b>customer</b> <b>side.</b> Based on the complexity of IT support to business processes, supplier side score, internal side score, <b>customer</b> <b>side</b> score and global score can be calculated. These scores are used to develop e-business initiative groups by using cluster analysis. After validated using discriminant analysis, the cluster analysis gives five e-business initiatives. First initiative is e-business implementation in three sides of business focuses, although in the early stage. Second initiative is IT implementation with internal side focus. Third initiative is e-business with <b>customer</b> <b>side</b> focus. The fourth is initiative that focuses on internal and <b>customer</b> <b>side.</b> The last is e-business initiative that balances and extends IT implementation on the three sides of business focuses.
