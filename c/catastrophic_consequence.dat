40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} {{have been}} widely used in many practical optimization problems. Inspired by natural selection, operators, including mutation, crossover and selection, provide effective heuristics for search and black-box optimization. However, they have not been shown useful for deep reinforcement learning, possibly due to the <b>catastrophic</b> <b>consequence</b> of parameter crossovers of neural networks. Here, we present Genetic Policy Optimization (GPO), a new genetic algorithm for sample-efficient deep policy optimization. GPO uses imitation learning for policy crossover in the state space and applies policy gradient methods for mutation. Our experiments on Mujoco tasks show that GPO as a genetic algorithm is able to provide superior performance over the state-of-the-art policy gradient methods and achieves comparable or higher sample efficiency...|$|E

We show that the minimization of the overall cost can be performed efficiently using a branch and bound algorithm, which can be further speeded up by allowing for a small degree of sub-optimality. Detailed numerical simulations are presented to show the advantages of various branching alternatives, the overall algorithm effectiveness, and its scalability with the number of tasks...|$|E

This paper examines {{the relevance of}} the security concept of noninterference to safety-related properties, and conversely the applicability of fault-tolerance mechanisms usually applied to provide safety and reliability in the security domain. 1 Introduction Safety and security are two attributes of dependability, among with availability and reliability [13]. In broad terms, security is the prevention of unauthorized access to information and unauthorized modification of information. Safety is the avoidance of <b>catastrophic</b> <b>consequence</b> on the environment. Despite their common contribution to dependability, research in computer safety and security has followed mostly separate paths. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss possible connections between methods and models developed by the two communities.

Increased reliance on 3 rd party hardware intellectual property (IP) and automation tools in the IC design flow, as well as outsourcing of design/fabrication steps to external parties due to economic reasons, are rapidly increasing the vulnerability to Trojan attacks. An intelligent adversary can insert a tiny hard-to-detect Trojan into a large design, which can easily evade conventional post-silicon test and validation leading to <b>catastrophic</b> <b>consequence.</b> A Trojan attack can be mounted {{at different stages of}} IC life cycle with an objective to cause in-field operational failure or leak secret information from inside a chip – e. g. the key in a cryptographic IC.

Previous studies had found that reinforced concrete (RC) flat slabs had much higher vulnerability for {{progressive collapse}} compared with RC beam-slab structures due to without beams to redistribute the axial force initially carried by the lost column. Thus, {{in order to reduce}} the likelihood of collapse of flat slabs, necessary strengthening should be applied to the existing buildings. However, to date, limited studies had been carried out to investigate the efficiency of strengthening schemes to mitigate the progressive collapse of flat slabs. Therefore, a series of experimental and analytical analysis was carried out for this purpose. Two different strengthening schemes were proposed and evaluated. The experimental and analytical results indicated that proposed strengthening schemes could significantly improve the progressive collapse performance of flat slabs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Examples of {{repeated}} destructive behavior abound {{throughout the history}} of human societies. This paper examines the role of social memory — a society’s vicarious beliefs about the past — in creating and perpetuating destructive conflicts. We examine whether such behavior is consistent with the theory of rational strategic behavior. We analyze an infinite-horizon model in which two countries face off each period in an extended Prisoner’s Dilemma game in which an additional possibility of mutually destructive “all out war ” yields <b>catastrophic</b> <b>consequence</b> for both sides. Each country is inhabited by a dynastic sequence of individuals who care about future individuals in the same country, and can communicate with the next generation of their countrymen using private messages. The two countries ’ actions in each period also produce physical evidence; a sequence of informative but imperfect public signals that can be observed by all current and future individuals. We find that, provided the future is sufficiently important for all individuals, regardless of the precision of physical evidence from the past there is an equilibrium of th...|$|E

Through the analysis of existing anti-collision technology, the conclusion can be gotten that the failure of well bore anti-collision is brought by 4 factors which include the big error of survey steering tool data,low accuracy, distortion or loss of adjacent wells’ trajectory parameters,the over-idealized pathfitting method and the defective scanning method for anti-collision. The causes of failure of anti-collision is the fitted path based on the low accuracy parameters and over-idealized path-fitting method cannot be equivalent to the actual ones,and the relative positions of distorted well trajectories cannot reflect the facts either. This paper discusses the development tendency of anticollision technology in the future and puts forward the concept of active anti-collision. The paper also lists programs which probably solve the anti-collision problem and provide the reference to the pertinent research...|$|E

40|$|The North Constantine {{demonstration}} of May 1945 an insurrectional attempt ?, Charles-Robert Ageron. In May 1945, very violent demonstrations {{broke out in}} Algeria. Since then, various explanations have been given {{in an attempt to}} understand something that European public opinion hardly noticed. For some, it was an insurrectional attempt; for others, hunger riots or a peasant uprising. All such theses were based on political biases. New sources now make it possible to evaluate better both the divergent interpretations of the events, the number of victims and the state of political forces of a budding nation. Thus the idea of a colonialist provocation or that of an Algerian Popular Party maneuvre can be rejected. On the other hand, the APP's leaders' hesitations concerning strategy and their <b>catastrophic</b> <b>consequence</b> on the movement itself can no longer be neglected.

40|$|Ocean {{dynamics}} {{is known}} to have a strong effect on the global climate change and on the composition of the atmosphere. In particular, it is estimated that about 70  % of the atmospheric oxygen is produced in the oceans due to the photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton. However, the rate of oxygen production depends on water temperature and hence can be affected by the global warming. In this paper, we address this issue theoretically by considering a model of a coupled plankton-oxygen dynamics where the rate of oxygen production slowly changes with time to account for the ocean warming. We show that a sustainable oxygen production is only possible in an intermediate range of the production rate. If, in the course of time, the oxygen production rate becomes too low or too high, the system's dynamics changes abruptly, resulting in the oxygen depletion and plankton extinction. Our results indicate that the depletion of atmospheric oxygen on global scale (which, if happens, obviously can kill most of life on Earth) is another possible <b>catastrophic</b> <b>consequence</b> of the global warming, a global ecological disaster that has been overlooked.
