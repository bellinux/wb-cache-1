40|$|Almost all the {{published}} studies on <b>container</b> <b>handle</b> positions {{have used the}} psychophysical, physiological, and biomechanical criteria to evaluate the best handle locations on container. The primary intent {{of this investigation was}} to determine if force endurance relationship curves could be used as criterion for comparing the handle positions. Ten subjects participated in a factorial experiment involving four handle positions (2 / 2, 3 / 7, 8 / 8, and 6 / 8), and four levels of exertion (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % of maximum lifting capacity). On any treatment condition, the subjects held the box till their endurance limit. The endurance time and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were the dependent measures. For the RPE, it was observed that the asymmetric position 6 / 8 was the best. Similarly the handle position 6 / 8 had the longest endurance as observed by a third order polynomial fit. The differences among the handle position were consistent across all levels and exertions tested. Further, it appears that the maximum lifting capacity is closer to the grip strength of the non-dominant hand...|$|E
40|$|The Container {{industry}} is growing. Ships are built to carry an increasingly amount of containers, {{and there is}} no limit to how much a ship will be carrying in the future in sight. What are the reasons for delays at container port terminals? Are there any theoretical calculations that show when delays begin at container terminals due to defects in container handling? These are some of the questions that will be answered in this thesis. The port of Gothenburg will be the port we have chosen to focus on in this thesis. Many of the infrastructural parts that the container terminal in the port of Gothenburg will be upgrading, is going to be used as examples of how ports plan to meet the qualifications of effective container handling in the future. We have used a general plan and an interview from the port of Gothenburg to find information about the plans they have {{for the future of the}} container terminal, and we have used literature found at Chalmers University to find theoretical information about delays at container terminals. Our results as we have expected them to be. The reasons for delays that appear to be different for each infrastructural part of a container terminal cannot be precise. Especially due to the fact that it is being compared to a specific port that has different infrastructural properties than the port used in the theoretical equation. The result does although show that disregarding the fact that the results cannot be precise, they can still be compared and parallels can be drawn showing the reasons behind the delays. This thesis will discuss the infrastructure of a container terminal, and how container terminals prepare to meet the future qualifications of <b>container</b> <b>handle...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} <b>containers</b> <b>handled</b> by <b>container</b> {{terminals}} has increased significantly {{over the last}} fifty years and has stimulated researchers to improve storage yard operations. <b>Container</b> <b>handling</b> and crane deployment are two major yard operations that can impact the performance of a whole container terminal. This thesis establishes an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to combine <b>container</b> <b>handling</b> and yard crane deployment for Rubber Tired Gantry Cranes (RTG). Using real world data, we test the ILP for two different yard sizes. We find the resulting ILPs difficult to solve directly. In order to decrease the computation time, we apply a cascade method that solves the problem as a sequence of restricted subproblems. Each subproblem is restricted to a sequence of containers and the output of each subproblem provides an input to the next subproblem. This method provides better solutions than the solution that we get by solving the problem directly. The cascade method also decreases the computation time significantly. The results demonstrate the ability to combine <b>container</b> <b>handling</b> and yard crane deployment in a single model and they verify that the cascade method works well with the ILP.
