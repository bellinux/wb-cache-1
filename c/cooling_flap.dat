40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{evaluated}} {{the efficiency of}} median-nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) monitoring in determining the optimal level of hypothermia in 62 consecutive patients operated on under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (CA). METHODS: CA was started at 1 degree C below the temperature at which both brainstem and cortical SEP components disappear. No additional method of cerebral protection was used. RESULTS: New neurological complications were observed in 15 patients: long-lasting in 11 and transient in 4. A retrospective analysis of SEP monitoring identified {{the origin of the}} complications in 12 cases: early CA with incomplete cooling due to emergency (3 cases); inefficient retrograde perfusion through the femoral artery during cooling due to the dissection flap effect (4 cases); embolism during rewarming (2 cases); delayed embolism (2 cases); hemorrhagic shock (1 case). In 2 cases, neurological sequelae involved the lower limbs (extracerebral origin). One case without intraoperative SEP changes was neurologically abnormal preoperatively and did not change postoperatively. There were no cases with sequelae due to excessive CA duration. CONCLUSIONS: The use of SEP monitoring to determine the optimal level of hypothermia efficiently prevents neurological sequelae of CA. It helps in monitoring the degree of cerebral protection during <b>cooling</b> (<b>flap</b> effect), and rewarming...|$|E

25|$|The P-47D-1 through P-47D-6, the P-47D-10, and the P-47D-11 {{successively}} incorporated {{changes such as}} {{the addition}} of more engine <b>cooling</b> <b>flaps</b> {{around the back of}} the cowl to reduce the engine overheating problems that had been seen in the field. Engines and engine subsystems saw refinement, (the P-47D-10 introduced the R-2800-63, replacing the R-2800-21 seen in previous P-47s) as did the fuel, oil and hydraulic systems. Additional armor protection was also added for the pilot.|$|R
5000|$|P-61B-1NO c/n 964 AAF Ser. No. 42-39445, {{is under}} {{restoration}} to flying status by the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum in Reading, Pennsylvania. The aircraft crashed on 10 January 1945 on Mount Cyclops, Papua New Guinea and was recovered in 1989 by the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum of Reading, Pennsylvania. The aircraft has been undergoing a slow restoration since {{then with the}} intention of eventually returning it to flying condition, with the civilian registration N550NF. When finished, it is expected to be over 70% new construction. By May 2011, 80% of the restoration had been completed, with only the installation of the wings and engines remaining. As of June 2014, the engines (although not yet in running condition) were installed, as were the engine cowlings and <b>cooling</b> <b>flaps.</b> However, MAAM has only one usable propeller, and is attempting to raise funds for a second unit.|$|R
50|$|The Mitsubishi Ha-112-II {{was some}} 54 kg (120 lb) {{lighter than the}} Ha-140 and {{produced}} the same power more reliably. After the study of an imported Fw 190A, {{an example of an}} aircraft in which a wide radial engine had been successfully installed in a narrow airframe, three Ki-61-II-KAI airframes were modified to carry this engine and to serve as prototypes. Three engineers, Takeo Doi, chief engineer and head of project, his assistant Makato Owada, and head of engine systems at Kawasaki Kagamigahara, Tomio Oguchi, worked through several concepts for redesigning the Ki-61 airframe to accept the new engine before settling on a solution in which a second skin fairing was riveted to the fuselage to smooth out the airflow behind the adjustable <b>cooling</b> <b>flaps</b> and multiple exhaust stubs of the new engine cowling. At first, there were problems with the aircraft now being found to be very tail-heavy, but the removal of a large lead counterbalance, which had been placed in the Ki-61-II-KAI's rear fuselage to balance the increasingly heavy Ha-140 engine, restored the center of gravity (cg).|$|R
40|$|Flight {{and ground}} {{investigations}} {{have been made}} to compare an exhaust-ejector installation with a standard exhaust-collector-ring installation on air-cooled aircraft engines in a twin-engine airplane. The ground investigation allowed that, whereas the standard engine would have overheated above 600 horsepower, the engine with exhaust ejectors cooled at take-off operating conditions at zero ram. The exhaust ejectors provided as much <b>cooling</b> with cowl <b>flaps</b> closed as the conventional cowl flaps induced when full open at low airspeeds. The propulsive thrust of the exhaust-ejector installation was calculated to be slightly less than the thrust of the collector-ring-installation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe coupled {{numerical}} simulation of flow field, solid temperature field, species concentration field and gas radiation transfer/ energy field based on statistical narrow-band correlated-k (SNBCK) model, is employed to accurately predict aerothermodynamic characteristic of aircraft exhaust system. A series of methods to increase computational efficiency and descend computational resources {{make it possible}} to finish the calculation in PC. The parameters of narrow-band model are evaluated by HITEMP line-by-line database. Three examples have proved the accuracy of using these methods to solve flow heat transfer coupled problem and radiation transfer/energy equation, which are the calculation of temperature distribution of water-cooling nozzle in rocket engine, the calculation of carbon dioxide absorptivity at 4. 3 micron band, and the gas radiation heat transfer evaluation of the cylindrical furnace. Finally, the inner flaps temperature distribution of ejecting nozzle with floating outer flaps is computed, under high-altitude, high-speed and afterburning conditions. Two completely different air-inlet schemes of ejecting channel almost achieve the same effect in <b>cooling</b> inner <b>flaps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of a full-scale investigation conducted in the NACA 20 -foot tunnel to determine the pressure difference available for <b>cooling</b> with cowling <b>flaps.</b> The flaps were applied to an exit slot of smooth contour at 0 degree flap angle. Flap angles of 0 degree, 15 degrees, and 30 degrees were tested. Two propellers were used; propeller c which has conventional round blade shanks and propeller f which has airfoil sections extending closer to the hub. The pressure available for cooling is shown to be a direct function of the thrust disk-loading coefficient of the propeller...|$|R
60|$|The tents of the Indian native regiments are large, oblong tents, {{with two}} poles, holding thirty men each. They are {{manufactured}} {{at the government}} prison at Jubbalpore, and are made of thick cotton canvas, lined with red or blue cotton. In the daytime they open right along one side, {{the wall of the}} tent being propped outward, with two slight poles, so as to form a sort of veranda, and shade the inside of the tent while admitting the air. At night-time, in the <b>cool</b> season, this <b>flap</b> is let down and the tent closed. In front of the tents the muskets of the men inside are piled.|$|R
