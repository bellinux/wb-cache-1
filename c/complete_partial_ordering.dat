50|$|If all {{directed}} subsets of a poset have a supremum, {{then the}} order is a directed-complete <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> (dcpo). These are {{especially important in}} domain theory.

50|$|The set of all {{continuous}} functions {{between two}} dcpos P and Q is denoted P → Q. Equipped with the pointwise order, this is again a dcpo, and a cpo whenever Q is a cpo.Thus the <b>complete</b> <b>partial</b> <b>orders</b> with Scott-continuous maps form a cartesian closed category.|$|R

50|$|In the {{mathematical}} area of order theory, completeness properties assert {{the existence of}} certain infima or suprema of a given partially ordered set (poset).

Already Nelson [4] has shown that one can do universal algebra over the category dcpo of directed <b>complete</b> <b>partial</b> <b>orders</b> (dcpo's for short) with Scott-continuous functions (these preserve the order and directed suprema) just like over the category of sets and functions. Let dcpohΣ; Ei denote the category with objects the hΣ; Ei-algebras over dcpo's (i. e., dcpo's equipped with Scott-continuous Σ -operations subject to the pairs of E interpreted as inequalities), and with arrows the Scott-continuous Σ -homomorphisms.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between state transformers based on directed <b>complete</b> <b>partial</b> <b>orders</b> and predicate transformers. Concepts like `predicate', `liveness', `safety' and `predicate transformers' are formulated in a topological setting.

We relate the transformers by isomorphisms thereby extending and completing earlier results and giving a complete picture of all the relationships. 1 Introduction In this paper we give a full picture {{of the relationship between}} state transformers and predicate transformers.
