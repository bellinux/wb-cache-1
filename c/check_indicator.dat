40|$|We compare six {{state-of-the-art}} local optimization solvers with {{focus on}} their efficiency when invoked within an interval-based global optimization algorithm. For comparison purposes we design three special performance indicators: a solution <b>check</b> <b>indicator</b> (measuring whether the local minimizers found are good candidates for near-optimal verified feasible points), a function value indicator (measuring the contribution to {{the progress of the}} global search), and the running time indicator (estimating the computational cost of the local search within the global search). The solvers are compared on the COCONUT Environment test set consisting of 1307 problems. Our main target is to predict the behavior of the solvers in terms of the three performance indicators on a new problem. For this we introduce a k-nearest neighbor method applied over a feature space consisting of several categorical and numerical features of the optimization problems. The quality and robustness of the prediction is demonstrated by various quality measurements with detailed comparative tests. In particular, we found that on the test set we are able to pick a ‘best’ solver in 66 – 89 % of the cases and avoid picking all ‘useless’ solvers in 95 – 99 % of the cases (when a useful alternative exists). The resulting automated solver selection method is implemented as an inference engine of the COCONUT Environment...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a stochastic method {{to test the}} soundness of accounting based solvency of banks, over a five-year period, and to define a proper capital adequacy level inductively, from a very limited subset of balance sheet indicators. A {{review of the literature}} about stress testing and capital adequacy is provided first, aimed to give evidence of the existing approaches in use and their critical aspects. Then, starting from a sample of 246 listed banks, a few balance sheet indicators are considered. Having set a critical threshold for each of them, according to the regulatory prescriptions, their effective values are forced according to different confidence levels, and two separate kinds of vulnerabilities are defined for the individual banks. These values allow to build a “bank Resilience index” (bRi), which {{is a measure of the}} capability to stay within the threshold limits (in other words, to remain solvent). We conclude that the approach could constitute a new, powerful alternative to test “financial soundness”, inasmuch it can give evidence of which banks are solvent, actually, as a consequence of a temporarily efficient mix of ratios, and which banks show a higher resilience for being truly much stronger. In effect, the bRi candidates itself to be a major health <b>check</b> <b>indicator,</b> suitable for surveillance purposes...|$|E

The primary objective {{of this study is to}} model the cyclists’ red-light running frequency within the framework of Bayesian statistics. Data was collected at twenty-five approaches at seventeen signalized intersections. The Poisson-gamma (PG) and Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model were developed and compared. The models were validated using Bayesian p values based on posterior predictive <b>checking</b> <b>indicators.</b> It was found that the two models have a good fit of the observed cyclists’ red-light running frequency.

The validation result demonstrated the reliability of the PLN model. The research results can help transportation professionals to predict the expected amount of the cyclists’ red-light running and develop effective guidelines or policies to reduce red-light running frequency of bicycles at signalized intersections...|$|R
40|$|The civil {{engineering}} sector has an import role to devise sustainable solutions {{in order to}} reduce the negative environmental impact of its projects. Sustainable {{civil engineering}} projects are needed to achieve, for example, the goal of the European Union to cut the 20 % annual primary energy consumption of the construction industry in 2020. Currently, the sustainable performance of civil engineering projects is unknown since a standardized method that can measure sustainability in projects from different civil engineering fields is lacking. Although there are multiple tools that can assess the sustainability of specific elements in projects, a pragmatic method that has a broader view on project sustainability is not available. Therefore, this research aims to develop an sustainability indicator framework that is able to measure multiple sustainability aspects in projects from various fields of civil engineering. The research question is: How can sustainability of projects from different civil engineering fields be measured in a pragmatic and standardized way? The research has been performed on behalf of Grontmij Nederland B. V. and the University of Utrecht. The research starts with scrutinizing the most important sustainability indicators for civil engineering projects by doing literature research and interviews with civil engineers. The result is a framework that takes three important players in project development into account: the client, the civil engineering firm and the suppliers. For each player, one or more sustainability indicators are developed. Furthermore, each indicator consists of one or more <b>checks.</b> The client <b>indicator</b> <b>checks</b> if sustainability talks have been held with the civil engineering firm. For the civil engineering firm, three indicators are assessed: sustainability assessment tools, sustainable material-use and energy reducing measures. The sustainability assessment tools <b>indicator</b> <b>checks</b> if sustainably tools are adopted during the development of a project. The sustainable material-use <b>indicator</b> <b>checks</b> if sustainable materials are used and the energy reducing measures <b>indicator</b> <b>checks</b> if measures are applied to reduce the energy use during the use phase of a project. The supplier <b>indicator</b> <b>checks</b> if sustainable suppliers are involved in the project development. Finally, civil engineers and sustainability experts at Grontmij were asked in a workshop to weigh the importance of the <b>indicators</b> and <b>checks.</b> The result is a pragmatic sustainability assessment framework where hundred points are obtainable. By doing case study analysis, the framework is tested on four projects of Grontmij. The case studies show that the framework succeeds to measure sustainability in the projects...|$|R

Estimates of the association between EP and weight gain were obtained from multiple linear regression models, using coughing episodes or slaughter <b>checks</b> as <b>indicators</b> of EP status. Models were estimated for pigs in 2 different age groups: roasters (n = 1084, sold at 32 to 50 kg) and market hogs (n = 1162, sold at 100 to 110 kg). The relationship between presence of lung lesions at slaughter and previous coughing episodes was also investigated. Throughout the study period, clinical evaluations were performed weekly, and coughing episodes recorded for each pig. Lungs were inspected at slaughter, and scores were expressed {{as the percentage of}} the lung with gross pneumonic lesions. Coughing and lung scores were significantly correlated, after adjusting for other covariates (R = 0. 32 and 0. 59, respectively, for market hogs and roasters). However, the agreement beyond chance between coughing history and lung lesions at slaughter was poor among both roasters and market hogs (kappa = 0. 17 and 0. 07, respectively). Although very specific, weekly assessment of coughing was not a sensitive indicator of lung lesions at slaughter.
