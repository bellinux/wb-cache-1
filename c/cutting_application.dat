With the PMSM spindle, the spindle rotational characteristics can be adjusted for optimizing the cutting process in order to prevent tools from unwanted premature damage. Simulation models of the spindle motor drive system are presented, which show that a very stiff spindle can be realized by fully utilizing the potential capability of the PMSM and a spindle with the same dynamic properties of a conventionally used induction motor can be realized with a single PMSM spindle. The system prototype and feasibility studies are also presented in this paper. The experimental results show that the PMSM spindle characteristics behave differently depending on the controller setting, and the spindle motor drive system rotational characteristics greatly affect the cutting process, which confirms the importance of the flexible motor control concept...|$|E

Thin films of ZrAlN and TiAlN have been deposited using cathodic arc-evaporation. The microstructure of as-deposited and annealed films has been studied using electron microscopy and x-ray scattering. The thermal stability has been characterized by calorimetry and thermogravity and the mechanical properties have been investigated by  nanoindentation. The microstructure of Zr 1 −xAlxN thin films was studied {{as a function of}} composition, deposition conditions, and annealing temperature. The structure was found to depend on the Al content where a low (x 0. 70 the structure is hexagonal. For intermediate Al contents (0. 38 0. 70) above 900 ◦C causes formation of AlN and ZrN rich domains within the hexagonal lattice. Annealing of nanocomposite ZrAlN thin films results in formation of cubic ZrN and hexagonal AlN. The transformation is initiated by nucleation and growth of cubic ZrN at temperatures of 1100 ◦C while the AlN-rich domains are still amorphous or nanocrystalline. Growth of hexagonal AlN is suppressed by the high nitrogen content of the films and takes place at annealing temperatures of 1400 ◦C. In the more well known TiAlN system, the initial stage of decomposition is spinodal with formation of cubic structured domains enriched in TiN and AlN. By a combination of in-situ xray scattering techniques during annealing and phase field simulations, both the microstructure that evolves during decomposition and the decomposition rate are found to depend on the composition. The results further show that early formation of hexagonal AlN domains during decomposition can cause formation of strains in the cubic TiAlN phase...|$|E
