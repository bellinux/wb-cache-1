40|$|Abstract. With unique advantages, {{salt cavern}} gas storage was got {{more and more}} {{attention}} in the field of oil industry in the world. It is a complicated system engineering to build an underground dissolved <b>cavity</b> to store gas with a certain shape in salt layer. Combined with the characteristics on the gas storage construction in salt layer, and based on the <b>cavity</b> destination and implementation process of <b>cavity</b> construction, <b>cavity</b> construction technology of salt cavern gas storage was conducted a comprehensive exposition. Through analyzing the formation process of gas storage <b>cavity,</b> well-types of <b>cavity</b> construction, water recycle modes, steps of dissolving <b>cavity,</b> adjustment modes of two wells distance, shape control method, roof protection technology, sealing detection, <b>cavity</b> stability and many other techniques were put forward on the respect of <b>cavity</b> construction process, <b>cavity</b> control and detection method.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} on axisymmetric shallow <b>cavity</b> flows {{with the aim of}} investigating methods to modify <b>cavity</b> shear flows such that <b>cavity</b> noise may be reduced. The experiments indicate the presence of large gross lateral motion of the shear layer close to the downstream <b>cavity</b> corner which, on interaction with it, results in production of <b>cavity</b> flow noise. Results also show that the continuous injection of a fluid mass {{at the base of the}} <b>cavity</b> has a stabilizing effect on <b>cavity</b> shear flows. This stability is believed to have been achieved by supplying the mass required for <b>cavity</b> shear layer entrainment externally. This was also accompanied by a delay in large periodic lateral motion of the <b>cavity</b> shear layer close to the downstream <b>cavity</b> corner as observed without the mass injection. Thus the addition of a continuous fluid mass appears to be an effective means of suppressing <b>cavity</b> flow noise...|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{of partial}} {{discharge}} (PD) events allows {{a better understanding}} of the phenomena itself. In this work, an improved model representing PD behaviour within a spherical <b>cavity</b> in a homogeneous dielectric material has been developed to study the influence of <b>cavity</b> surface charge distribution on the electric field distribution in the <b>cavity.</b> Comparison of measurement and simulation results has been undertaken to validate the model. The model uses a two-dimensional axial symmetric Finite Element Analysis method, which is solved for local electric potentials. The model geometry consists of a homogenous dielectric material and a spherical <b>cavity.</b> The upper and lower <b>cavity</b> surfaces are divided into 10 boundaries each to model charge distribution along the <b>cavity</b> wall. Discharge is assumed to occur along the symmetry axis in the <b>cavity.</b> Once the discharge has passed through the <b>cavity</b> to the opposite surface, it is assumed that charge then propagates along the upper and lower <b>cavity</b> surfaces. Charge distribution is assumed symmetrical on the upper and lower <b>cavity</b> surfaces. During discharge, charge density increases on the <b>cavity</b> surface boundaries where charge propagates, until the field in the <b>cavity</b> centre is less than the extinction field. To model the charge movement along the <b>cavity</b> wall through conduction at other times, the change in the charge density on each <b>cavity</b> surface boundary is set as dependent on the <b>cavity</b> surface conductivity. Thus, <b>cavity</b> surface charge distribution will influence the electric field distribution in the <b>cavity,</b> affecting the likelihood of the next PD event...|$|R
40|$|One source {{contributing}} to wind tunnel background noise is microphone self-noise. An experiment {{was conducted to}} investigate the flow-induced acoustic oscillations of Bruel & Kjaer (B&K) in-flow microphones. The results strongly suggest the B&K microphone <b>cavity</b> behaves more like an open <b>cavity.</b> Their <b>cavity</b> acoustic oscillations are likely caused by strong interactions between the <b>cavity</b> shear layer and the <b>cavity</b> trailing edge. But the results also suggest that <b>cavity</b> shear layer oscillations could be coupled with <b>cavity</b> acoustic resonance to generate tones. Detailed flow velocity measurements over the <b>cavity</b> screen have shown inflection points in the mean velocity profiles and high disturbance and spectral intensities {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>cavity</b> trailing edge. These results are the evidence for strong interactions between <b>cavity</b> shear layer oscillations and the <b>cavity</b> trailing edge. They also suggest that beside acoustic signals, the microphone inside the <b>cavity</b> has likely recorded hydrodynamic pressure oscillations, too. The results also suggest that the forebody shape does not have a direct effect on <b>cavity</b> oscillations. For the FITE (Flow Induced Tone Eliminator) microphone, it is probably the forebody length and the resulting boundary layer turbulence that have made it work. Turbulence might have thickened the boundary layer at the separation point, weakened the shear layer vortices, or lifted them to miss impinging on the <b>cavity</b> trailing edge. In addition, the study shows that the <b>cavity</b> screen can modulate the oscillation frequency but not the <b>cavity</b> acoustic oscillation mechanisms...|$|R

The results are summarized to show variations in <b>cavity</b> axial-force coefficient for deep- and shallow-cavity configurations with detached and attached <b>cavity</b> flow fields, respectively. The {{results of the investigation}} indicate that {{for a wide range of}} <b>cavity</b> lengths and depths, good correlations of the <b>cavity</b> axial-force coefficients (based on <b>cavity</b> rear-face area) are obtained when these coefficients are plotted as a function of <b>cavity</b> length-to-depth ratio. Abrupt increases in the <b>cavity</b> axial-force coefficients at an angle of attack of 0 deg. reflect the transition from an open (detached) <b>cavity</b> flow field to a closed (attached) <b>cavity</b> flow field. <b>Cavity</b> length-to-depth ratio is the dominant factor affecting the switching of the <b>cavity</b> flow field from one type to the other.
