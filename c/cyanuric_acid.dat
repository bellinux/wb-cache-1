25|$|A {{toxicology}} {{study in}} animals conducted after recalls of contaminated pet food {{concluded that the}} combination of melamine and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in diet does lead to acute renal failure in cats. A 2008 study produced similar experimental results in rats and characterized the melamine and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in contaminated pet food from the 2007 outbreak. A 2010 study from Lanzhou University attributed renal failure in humans to uric acid stone accumulation after ingestion of melamine resulting in a rapid aggregation of metabolites such as <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> diamide (ammeline) and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid.</b> A 2013 study demonstrated that melamine can be metabolized to <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> by gut bacteria. In particular, Klebsiella terrigena was determined to be a factor in melamine toxicity. In culture, K. terrigena was shown to convert melamine to <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> directly. <b>Cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> was detected in the kidneys of rats administered melamine alone, and the concentration after Klebsiella colonization was increased.|$|E
25|$|This test {{works because}} {{melamine}} combines with the <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> {{in the water}} to form a fine, insoluble, white precipitate (melamine cyanurate) that causes the water to cloud {{in proportion to the}} amount of <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in it. More recently, a sensitive method has been developed for analysis of <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in urine.|$|E
25|$|FDA {{permits a}} certain amount of <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> to be present in some non-protein {{nitrogen}} (NPN) additives used in animal feed and drinking water. <b>Cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> has been used as NPN.

40|$|A {{series of}} various poly-substituted benzoxazoles were {{synthesized}} starting from readily available carboxylic acids.

40|$|A {{new family}} of {{compounds}} able to promote host-guest interactions with specific molecules (e. g., <b>cyanuric</b> and parabanic <b>acids)</b> and to coordinate metal ions, namely Zn(II) and Cu(II), has been synthesized and fully characterized.

40|$|The {{development}} of a synthetic method of radiolabelled methylphosphono-fluoridates on a milligram scale is presented. The aim of this method is, besides affording high yield, to choose reaction pathways and reagents so that handling and transfer of labelled toxic substances is minimised, thereby {{reducing the risk of}} exposure as much as possible. The only substituent that is stable enough to be labelled is the methyl group, directly bonded to phosphorus. A drawback when labelling the methyl group is that it requires the label to be introduced early in the synthesis since the carbon-phosphorus bond of the methyl substituent usually has to be synthesized a few steps ahead of the final product. Two new classes of reagents for halogenation of phosphorus oxyacids have been developed. Firstly, four different analogues of α-chloroenamines and α-fluoroenamines were evaluated. Secondly, cyanuric fluoride was assessed in solution, but more importantly, as a resin-bound reagent. The reagents are evaluated for halogenation of phosphinic, phosphonic and phosphoric <b>acids.</b> <b>Cyanuric</b> fluoride is also successfully loaded on a polystyrene resin and used as a solid-phase reagent. The reagents produce high yields and low levels of impurities on a milligram scale. Furthermore, a new method for the preparation of mono-alkylated phosphonic acids on a small scale has been developed. The new method utilises the crystal water bound to certain salts to liberate limited amounts of water in a controlled manner. Phosphonic dichlorides are in this way reacted with water to form anhydrides. The anhydride is then cleaved with an appropriate alcohol to produce mono-alkylated phosphonic acids.

25|$|Testing for <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> {{concentration}} is commonly {{done with a}} turbidometric test, which uses a reagent, melamine, to precipitate the <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid.</b> The relative turbidity of the reacted sample quantifies the CYA concentration. Referenced in 1957.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} has focused on the combination of melamine and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in causing renal failure. Reports that <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> may be an independently and potentially widely used adulterant in China have heightened concerns for both pet and human health.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> is {{implicated in}} {{connection}} to the 2007 pet food recalls, the contamination and wide recall of many brands of cat and dog foods beginning in March 2007. Research has found evidence that <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid,</b> a constituent of urine, together with melamine forms poorly soluble crystals which can cause renal failure (see Analysis section above).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nutritional {{supplements}} {{are used}} or experimented with by consumers, notably these are; competitive and recreational athletes of all ages, and 'weekend warriors'. As a consequence the supplement industry {{has grown to}} meet the increasing demand. A Global Industry Analysts Inc. report indicates that the herbal supplement market has not declined during the worldwide recession, but in fact exhibited steady growth over the period 2008 to 2009. It is anticipated that the market will reach US$ 93. 15 billion by the year 2015. These supplements may contain adulterated substances that may potentially have harmful short - and long-term health consequences to the consumer. "Scrap Melamine" is such an example, which has been implicated in the kidney failure and death of several cats, dogs and pigs. In China in 2008, reports described very severe health effects in infants and young children. At the time over 294 000 infants were screened and diagnosed with urinary tract stones and sand-like calculi associated with melamine in milk products, of which 50 000 infants were hospitalised, and at least six associated deaths, recorded. The extent that melamine contamination occurs in nutritional supplements is not known. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine whether commercially available nutritional and traditional supplement products contain melamine, even though they are not declared by the manufacturer on the product label. METHODS: A total of 138 nutritional supplements products were obtained from (i) direct purchases from shops, pharmacies and outlets, (ii) directly from consumers, and (iii) from suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. The products were laboratory analysed for melamine, using Tandem Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-seven % of all the products (n= 138) tested positive for melamine. Eight-two % of the South African produced products (n= 27) tested positive and 58 % of the products imported into South Africa (n= 50) tested positive. The median concentration estimate for melamine in the products tested were, 6. 0 mug/g for the 138 supplements tested, 8. 9 mug/g for South African produced products, and 6. 9 mug/g for products imported into South Africa. CONCLUSION: The melamine (undeclared on product label) levels detected in the nutritional supplements products investigated were within the Tolerable Daily intake (TDI) limit guidelines of 200 mug/g as set by WHO and others. Melamine over exposure within the context of the nutritional supplements consumption in the products investigated should not be of concern to the consumer provided the recommended guidelines of daily product use are adhered to. Further investigation is warranted to determine, (i) the link of melamine as (part) substitute for the perceived total declared protein content on the product label, (ii) <b>cyanuric</b> and uric <b>acid</b> presence in the supplement products that could form chemical-complex formation with melamine and/or analogues that could cause adverse health effects...|$|R
25|$|On 8 May 2007, the International Herald Tribune {{reported}} three Chinese chemical {{makers have}} said animal feed producers often purchase, or seek to purchase, the chemical, <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid,</b> from their factories to blend into animal feed {{to give the}} false appearance of {{a higher level of}} protein, suggesting another potentially dangerous way that melamine and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> might combine in protein products.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} USSR {{researchers}} in the 1980s suggested that melamine cyanurate, commonly used as a fire retardant, could be more toxic than either melamine or <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> alone. For rats and mice, the reported LD50 for melamine cyanurate was 4.1 g/kg (given inside the stomach) and 3.5 g/kg (via inhalation), compared to 6.0 and 4.3 g/kg for melamine and 7.7 and 3.4 g/kg for <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{cyanic acid}} polymerizes to form <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> which {{condenses}} with the liberated ammonia forming melamine which releases water which then reacts with cyanic acid present(which helps {{to drive the}} reaction) generating carbon dioxide and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Toxicity of {{melamine}} can be {{mediated by}} intestinal microbes. In culture, Klebsiella terrigena, which rarely colonizes mammalian intestines, {{was shown to}} convert melamine to <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> directly. Rats colonized by K. terrigena showed greater melamine-induced kidney damage compared to those not colonized.|$|E
25|$|On 27 April, {{researchers}} from the University of Guelph, in Ontario announced they had created crystals chemically {{similar to the ones}} found in contaminated animals by combining melamine and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in the laboratory under pH conditions similar to those in animal kidneys.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> or 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triol is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula (CNOH)3. Like many industrially useful chemicals, this triazine has many synonyms. This white, odorless solid finds {{use as a}} precursor or a component of bleaches, disinfectants, and herbicides. In 1997, worldwide production was 160 million kilograms.|$|E
25|$|However, when <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> {{is present}} {{together}} with melamine (which {{by itself is}} another low-toxicity substance), they may form extremely insoluble crystals, leading to formation of kidney stones and potentially causing kidney failure and death—as evidenced in dogs and cats during the 2007 pet food contamination and in children during the 2008 Chinese milk scandal cases.|$|E
25|$|The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) {{provides}} a test method for analyzing cyromazine and melamine in animal tissues. In 2007, the FDA began using a high performance liquid chromatography test {{to determine the}} melamine, ammeline, ammelide, and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> contamination in food. another procedure is based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).|$|E
25|$|In October 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued {{new methods}} for the {{analysis}} of melamine and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in infant formulations in the Laboratory Information Bulletin No 4421. Similar recommendations have been issued by other authorities, like the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, both based on liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC/MS) detection after hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation.|$|E
25|$|Crystallization {{and washing}} of {{melamine}} generates {{a considerable amount}} of waste water, which is a pollutant if discharged directly into the environment. The waste water may be concentrated into a solid (1.5–5% of the weight) for easier disposal. The solid may contain approximately 70% melamine, 23% oxytriazines (ammeline, ammelide, and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid),</b> 0.7% polycondensates (melem, melam, and melon). In the Eurotecnica process, however, there is no solid waste and the contaminants are decomposed to ammonia and carbon dioxide and sent as off gas to the upstream urea plant; accordingly, the waste water can be recycled to the melamine plant itself or used as clean cooling water make-up.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> can be {{produced}} by hydrolysis of crude or waste melamine followed by crystallization.

2500|$|Researchers {{have focused}} on the role of {{melamine}} and related compounds in causing renal failure. Beginning on 19 April, [...] researchers reportedly had ruled out aminopterin contamination and had found a [...] "spoke-like crystal" [...] in contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate and the tissues and urine of affected animals. (It was previously known that melamine and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> can form networks of hydrogen bonds, creating a tile-like planar structure through molecular self-assembly.) The crystal has been said to serve as a biomarker for contamination and is approximately 30% melamine. The remainder has been identified as <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid,</b> ammelide and ammeline, with crystals recovered from urine reported to be approximately 70% <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid.</b> While some researchers have theorized the three latter chemicals might have been formed as the animals metabolized the melamine, or as byproducts of bacterial metabolism (<b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> is a known intermediate byproduct of bacterial metabolism of melamine), their presence in the crystals found in contaminated protein itself, combined with media reports of widespread adulteration with both melamine and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in China, has focused research efforts on their combined effects in animals. Neither melamine nor <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid,</b> a chemical commonly used in pool chlorination, have been thought to be particularly toxic by themselves. The current hypothesis is, although these contaminants are not very toxic individually, their potency appears to be increased when they are present together.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 May, {{in further}} {{inquiry into the}} source of the <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> in the {{contaminated}} ingredients and the toxic effects of the chemical combination, Richard Goldstein of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, in response to reports the contaminant might be [...] "melamine scrap" [...] left over from processing coal into melamine, hypothesized: “It’s possible the other stuff they were left with was the bottom-of-the-barrel stuff, leftover melamine and possibly <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid.</b> I think it’s this melamine with other compounds that is toxic.” The composition of the crystals analyzed in contaminated pet food ingredients is similar to the composition of a waste product produced in <b>cyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> production.|$|E
