50|$|If one aims at {{drawing a}} {{distinction}} between corner detectors and blob detectors, this can often be done {{in terms of their}} localization properties at <b>corner</b> <b>structures.</b> For a junction structure in the image domain that corresponds to an intersection of physical edges in the three-dimensional world, the localization properties of a corner detector will in most cases be much better than the localization properties that would be obtained from a blob detector. Hence, for the purpose of computing structure and motion from multiple views, corner detectors will in many cases have advantages compared to blob detectors in terms of smaller localization error. Notwithstanding this, blob descriptors have also been demonstrated to be useful when relating object models to temporal imagery.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{a large amount of}} {{analysis}} techniques have been scaled down to the microfluidic level. However, in many cases the necessary sample preparation, such as separation, mixing and concentration, remains to be performed off-chip. This represents a major hurdle for the introduction of miniaturized sample-in/answer-out systems, preventing the exploitation of microfluidic’s potential for small, rapid and accurate diagnostic products. New flow engineering methods are required to address this hitherto insufficiently studied aspect. One microfluidic tool {{that can be used to}} miniaturize and integrate sample preparation procedures are microvortices. They have been successfully applied as microcentrifuges, mixers, particle separators, to name but a few. In this work, we utilize a novel <b>corner</b> <b>structure</b> at a sudden channel expansion of a microfluidic chip to enhance the formation of a microvortex. For a maximum area of the microvortex, both chip geometry and <b>corner</b> <b>structure</b> were optimized with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model.

30|$|Rupture of the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) most commonly {{occurs as a result}} of a pivot-shift injury, requires substantial force to occur and is rarely a truly isolated event. At least half of ACL tears in young patients are accompanied by other injuries such as meniscal or ligament tears and bony contusions [1 – 3]. In non-contact injuries, the ACL is at greatest risk of injury when excessive valgus and knee axial rotation loads are combined near full knee extension [4 – 6], such as when the patient lands on the ground with their centre of gravity moving away from the landing limb. In addition to tearing the ACL, this type of injury places tensile load on the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and posteromedial <b>corner</b> <b>structures,</b> and leads to impaction and shear injuries in the lateral compartment.|$|E

40|$|Background: Avulsion of the biceps femoris {{from the}} fibula and {{proximal}} tibia is encountered in clinical practice. While {{the anatomy of}} the primary posterolateral <b>corner</b> <b>structures</b> has been qualitatively and quantitatively described, a quantitative analysis regarding the insertions of the biceps femoris on the fibula and proximal tibia is lacking. Purpose: To quantitatively assess the insertions of the biceps femoris, fibular collateral ligament (FCL), and anterolateral ligament (ALL) on the fibula and proximal tibia as well as establish relationships among these structures and to pertinent surgical anatomy. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Dissections were performed on 12 nonpaired, fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens identifying the biceps femoris, FCL, and ALL, and their insertions on the proximal tibia and fibula. The footprint areas, orientations, and distances from relevant osseous landmarks were measured using a 3 -dimensional coordinate measurement device. Results: Dissection produced 6 easily identifiable and reproducible anatomic footprints. Tibial footprints included the insertion of the ALL and an insertion of the biceps femoris (TBF). Fibular footprints included the insertion of the FCL, a distal insertion of the biceps femoris (DBF), a medial footprint of the biceps femoris (MBF), and a proximal footprint of the biceps femoris (PBF). The mean area of these footprints (95 % CI) was as follows: ALL, 53. 0 mm 2 (38. 4 - 67. 6); TBF, 93. 9 mm 2 (72. 0 - 115. 8); FCL, 86. 8 mm 2 (72. 3 - 101. 2); DBF, 119 mm 2 (91. 1 - 146. 9); MBF, 46. 8 mm 2 (29. 0 - 64. 5); and PBF, 215 mm 2 (192. 4 - 237. 5).

Outcome was assessed at a mean of 12 years postoperatively using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) health survey, Lysholm score, Tegner score, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and Knee Society score.

40|$|The Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power {{has built}} a new modular type of dry storage facility, known as MACSTOR KN- 400 at Wolsong reactor site. The {{building}} {{has the capacity to}} store up to 24000 CANDU spent fuel bundles in a 4 rows by 10 columns arrangement of silos. The MACSTOR KN- 400 consists of 40 silos; each silo has 10 storage baskets, each of which can store 60 CANDU spent fuel bundles. The development of an effective method for spent fuel verification at the MACSTOR KN- 400 storage facility is necessary in order for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to meet with safeguards regulations. The IAEA is interested in having a new effective method of re-verification of the nuclear material in the MACSTOR KN- 400 dry storage facility in the event of any loss of continuity of knowledge, which occasionally happens when the installed seals fail. In the thesis work, MCNP models of central and <b>corner</b> <b>structures</b> of the MACSTOR KN- 400 facility are developed, since both have different types of re-verification system. Both gamma and neutron simulations were carried out using the MCNP models developed for MACSTOR KN- 400. The CANDU spent fuel bundle with discharge burnup of 7. 5 GWD/t (burned at specific power of 28. 39 MW/t) and 10 years cooled was considered for radiation source term estimation. For both the structures, MCNP simulations of gamma transport were done by including Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) detector inside the re-verification tube. Gamma analyses for different spent fuel bundle diversion scenarios were carried out. It was observed that for diversion scenarios wherein the bundles are removed from the inner portions of the basket (opposite side of the collimator of the re-verification tube), it was difficult to conclude whether diversion has taken place based on the change in gamma radiation signals. Similar MCNP simulations of neutron transport were carried out by integrating helium- 3 detector inside the re-verification tube and the results obtained for various diversion scenarios were encouraging and can be used to detect some spent fuel diversion cases. In the central structure, it was observed that addition of moderating material between the spent fuel and the detector increased the sensitivity of the detecting system for various diversion cases for neutron simulations. In the worst scenario, the diverting state could divert 14 spent fuel bundles from each of 10 baskets in a silo from the basket region opposite to the collimator of the re-verification tube. The non-detection probability for this scenario is close to 1. This diversion cannot be easily detected using the currently designed detection system. In order to increase the detection probability, either the design of the facility must be changed or other safeguard methods, such as containment and surveillance methods must be used for safeguarding the nuclear material at the facility...|$|E
40|$|Camera {{calibration}} {{information is}} required in order for multiple camera networks to deliver {{more than the sum}} of many single camera systems. Methods exist for manually calibrating cameras with high accuracy. Manually calibrating networks with many cameras is, however, time consuming, expensive and impractical for networks that undergo frequent change. For this reason, automatic calibration techniques have been vigorously researched in recent years. Fully automatic calibration methods depend on the ability to automatically find point correspondences between overlapping views. In typical camera networks, cameras are placed far apart to maximise coverage. This is referred to as a wide base-line scenario. Finding sufficient correspondences for camera calibration in wide base-line scenarios presents a significant challenge. This thesis focuses on developing more effective and efficient techniques for finding correspondences in uncalibrated, wide baseline, multiple-camera scenarios. The project consists of two major areas of work. The first is the development of more effective and efficient view covariant local feature extractors. The second area involves finding methods to extract scene information using the information contained in a limited set of matched affine features. Several novel affine adaptation techniques for salient features have been developed. A method is presented for efficiently computing the discrete scale space primal sketch of local image features. A scale selection method was implemented that makes use of the primal sketch. The primal sketch-based scale selection method has several advantages over the existing methods. It allows greater freedom in how the scale space is sampled, enables more accurate scale selection, is more effective at combining different functions for spatial position and scale selection, and leads to greater computational efficiency. Existing affine adaptation methods make use of the second moment matrix to estimate the local affine shape of local image features. In this thesis, it is shown that the Hessian matrix can be used in a similar way to estimate local feature shape. The Hessian matrix is effective for estimating the shape of blob-like structures, but is less effective for <b>corner</b> <b>structures.</b> It is simpler to compute than the second moment matrix, leading to a significant reduction in computational cost. A wide baseline dense correspondence extraction system, called WiDense, is presented in this thesis. It allows the extraction of large numbers of additional accurate correspondences, given only a few initial putative correspondences. It consists of the following algorithms: An affine region alignment algorithm that ensures accurate alignment between matched features; A method for extracting more matches in the vicinity of a matched pair of affine features, using the alignment information contained in the match; An algorithm for extracting large numbers of highly accurate point correspondences from an aligned pair of feature regions. Experiments show that the correspondences generated by the WiDense system improves the success rate of computing the epipolar geometry of very widely separated views. This new method is successful in many cases where the features produced by the best wide baseline matching algorithms are insufficient for computing the scene geometry...|$|E
