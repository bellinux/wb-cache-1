40|$|In this paper, we have {{design a}} model {{presents}} {{an example of}} pressure-driven flow and electrophoresis in a micro channel system. Researchers often use a device {{similar to the one}} in this model as an electro kinetic sample injector in biochips to obtain well-defined sample volumes of dissociated acids and salts and to transport these volumes. The model presents a study of a pinched injection <b>cross</b> <b>valve</b> during the focusing, injection, and separation stages. Focusing is obtained through pressure-driven flow of the sample and buffer solution, which confines the sample in the focusing channel. When the system reaches steady state, the pressure-driven flow is turned off and an electric field is applied along the channels. This field drives the dissociated sample ions in the focusing zone at right angles to the focusing channel and through the injection channel. A clean separation of the sample ions is important, so the model examines the effect on ion separation of different configurations of the electric field. This specific case does not account for electro osmosis because the channel surfaces are subjected to a treatment that minimizes the extension of the electric double layer...|$|E
40|$|Energy losses {{occurring}} in pipe junctions {{have been studied}} for many years. Head loss coefficients (KK) are commonly used to characterize losses across elbows, tees, <b>crosses,</b> <b>valves,</b> and other pipe fittings.

Although pipe junctions and fittings are at times considered 2 ̆ 2 minor losses 2 ̆ 2 {{in relation to other}} energy losses in a pipe network, there are cases where disregarding such losses in flow calculations will lead to errors. To facilitate these calculations, energy loss coefficients (K-factors) are commonly used to obtain energy losses for elbows, tees, <b>crosses,</b> <b>valves,</b> and other pipe fittings. When accurate K-factors are used, the flow rate and corresponding energy at any location in a pipe network can be calculated. K-factors are well defined for most pipe junctions and fittings; however, the literature documents no complete listings of K-factors for crosses. This study was commissioned to determine the K-factors {{for a wide range of}} flow combinations in a single pipe cross and the results provide information previously unavailable to compute energy losses associated with crosses. To obtain the loss coefficients, experimental data were collected in which the flow distribution in each of the four cross legs was varied to quantify the influence of velocity and flow distribution on head loss. For each data point the appropriate K-factors were calculated, resulting in over one thousand experimental K-factors that can be used in the design and analysis of piping systems containing crosses...|$|R

Results: Of 11 procedures, 10 (91 %) were successful in the TS group. The patient crossed over to the TA approach remained unsuccessful. Successful elimination of the AP was obtained in nine (82 %) of 11 of the TA procedures. Of the two patients who crossed over to a TS procedure in the same session, one was successful and one remained unsuccessful. Total procedure time {{did not differ in}} both groups (87. 1 +/- 30. 8 vs 90. 9 +/- 26. 5 minutes).

BackgroundOver the past 40 years, prosthetic conduits {{have been developed to}} surgically establish continuity between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. However, stenosis and insufficiency of the conduit due to valvular degeneration or panus ingrowth frequently occur, limiting patients’ lifespan. Percutaneous stenting of conduits has recently emerged as a technique for delaying surgical replacement, but it creates a pulmonary regurgitation when <b>crossing</b> the <b>valve.</b> MethodsSeven children and one adult with stenosis and/or insufficiency of the pulmonary graft underwent percutaneous implantation of a bovine jugular valve in pulmonary position.

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{electro-hydraulic}} precision {{motion control}} systems {{are controlled by}} either servo valves or proportional directional control valves. Neither of the valves are {{able to control the}} pressures at the two cylinder chambers independently or to use the regeneration flow. The result is that while precision motion control is possible, significant energy saving is not. In order to save energy while maintaining excellent motion performance, the independent control of the pressures at the two cylinder chambers and the accurate use of the regeneration flow are two key factors. The programmable valves, a combination of five independently controlled poppet-type cartridge valves, break the mechanical linkage between the meter-in and meter-out orifices, maintain the full functionality of conventional four-way valves and enable the accurate control of the regeneration flow via the true <b>cross</b> port <b>valve.</b> Therefore, the programmable valves are capable of both precision motion control and significant energy saving. This paper introduces the configuration of the programmable valves as well as how to control the programmable valves to achieve the dual objectives of precision motion control and energy saving.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the flow field inside hydraulic valves has become {{in the last few}} years a very important issue to be addressed in order to optimize the spool shapes and to obtain the desired flow metering characteristics. The Fluid-Power research unit of the Polytechnic of Bari realized many works dealing with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{analysis of}} directional control valves. Experimental measurements concerning discharged flow rate and needed driving force values have been performed in order to validate the numerical results, but the validation of CFD results has been limited, in the past, only to the global fluid dynamic response of the valve and not to the local flow conditions. In order to provide the flow field inside the valve through PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) measurements, a valve model, equipped with a great optical access, has been realized. The scaled model has been realized according to the fluid dynamic similarity laws in order to use a fluid different from the oil (water) and to increase the dimensions of the valve. In particular, the realized model has a circumferential development useful to acquire important data about the circumferential flows and their effects on the global flow rate <b>crossing</b> the <b>valve.</b> The experimental results show that the velocity profiles in the metering sections are strongly influenced by the three-dimensional effects of the flow, confirming the results obtained numerically in previous works...|$|R
40|$|The vortex {{formation}} process {{inside the}} left ventricle is intrinsically {{connected to the}} dynamics of the mitral leaflets while they interact with the flow <b>crossing</b> the <b>valve</b> during diastole. The description of the dynamics of a natural mitral valve still represents a challenging issue, especially because its material properties are not measurable in vivo. Medical imaging can provide some indications about the geometry of the valve, but not about its mechanical properties. In this work, we introduce a parametric model of the mitral valve geometry, whose motion is described in the asymptotic limit under the assumption that it moves with the flow, without any additional resistance other than that given by its shape, and without the need to specify its material properties. The mitral valve model is coupled with a simple description of the left ventricle geometry, and their dynamics is solved numerically together with the equations ruling the blood flow. The intra-ventricular flow is analyzed in its relationship with the valvular motion. It is found that the initial valve opening anticipates the peak velocity of the Early filling wave with little influence of the specific geometry; while subsequent closure and re-opening are more dependent on the intraventricular vortex dynamics and thus on the leaflets’ geometry itself. The limitations and potential applications of the proposed model are discussed...|$|R

Decision was made to perform emergent BAV. After <b>crossing</b> the <b>valve</b> with a 6 French catheter, the patient developed an electromechanical dissociation confirmed at transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac arrest. Manual chest compressions were initiated along with the application of high doses of intravenous adrenaline, and BAV was performed under ongoing resuscitation. Despite BAV, transoesophageal echocardiography demonstrated no cardiac activity. At this point, {{it was decided to}} advance a pigtail catheter over the wire already in place in the left ventricle and to inject intracardiac adrenaline (1 mg, followed by 5 mg). Left ventricular contraction progressively resumed and, in the absence of aortic regurgitation, an intraaortic balloon pump was inserted. The patient could be weaned from intraaortic balloon pump and vasopressors on day 1, extubated on day 6, and recovered from multiorgan failure. In the absence of neurologic deficits, he underwent uneventful transcatheter aortic valve implantation on day 12 and was discharged to a cardiac rehabilitation program on day 30. At 3 -month follow-up, he reported dyspnea NYHA class II as the only symptom.

Venous valves are frequent findings, either immediately peripheral to branching veins or at periodic 5 to 7 [*]cm points.

This layer is located c. 40 cm below layer CL 2, which has yielded numerous ostrich eggshell beads. The shell is identified as the valve of a Corbicula fluminea. Data on the occurrence of this species in the Shuidonggou region during Marine Isotope Stage 3 and taphonomic analysis, conducted in the framework of this study, of a modern biocoenosis and thanatocoenosis suggest that the archeological specimen was collected at one of the numerous fossil or sub-fossil outcrops where valves of this species were available at the time of occupation of level CL 3.

BackgroundPercutaneous pulmonary valve replacement {{has recently been}} introduced, and early clinical experience has been reported. This technique is presently limited to patients with a right ventricular outflow tract no bigger than 22 mm in diameter. MethodsIn seven animals (groups 1 and 3), we implanted a newly designed nitinol stent {{in the shape of}} a conduit with a central restriction of its diameter, containing an 18 -mm bovine valve, as a one-step procedure. The animals in groups 1 and 3 were sacrificed after valve implantation and after two-month follow-up, respectively. In the second group (n = 3), we expected to percutaneously reduce the diameter of the pulmonary artery. Eight weeks later, we implanted an 18 -mm valve mounted in a balloon-expandable stent. These animals were sacrificed after valve implantation. ResultsEight of 10 devices were successfully delivered and were functioning perfectly at the initial evaluation and after two months.

40|$|The two {{significant}} length {{scales of the}} unsteadiness in a turbocharger operation are those associated with engine-driven transients, for instance, engine acceleration and deceleration, and those associated with engine valve events. The engine-driven transients will primarily affect the compressor, because the surge line can be <b>crossed.</b> The engine <b>valve</b> events will primarily affect the turbine, and result in performance that deviates from steady-flow predictions. To address these issues, a lumped parameter model is first developed to show the essential features of the engine-driven transients {{on the performance of}} the turbocharger compressor. To improve the predictive tools for the effect of unsteady aerodynamics on these problems, a more advanced model is then developed using an approach based on the solution of the unsteady Euler equations with source terms (EEST). The model is then exercised against data obtained in on-engine studies of pulsed-turbocharged diesel engine turbocharger turbine performance. ^ The EEST model proved able to accurately predict the turbine inlet velocity waveform for a twin-entry turbine under the influence of boundary conditions obtained from experimental data. The model also correctly predicted the shape of the unsteady turbine performance trajectory during a typical valve event. Based on successful validation of the model, an investigation of the design implications of these results in terms of a comparison of true unsteady versus quasi-steady efficiency assumptions is presented. This study demonstrates that the optimum efficiency operating point cannot be achieved with knowledge of only the steady-flow operating characteristics. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{variability}} in size, shape, thickness, and texture of the persistent eustachian valve, and in {{the extent to which}} it encroaches on neighboring structures such as the atrial septum. At one end of the spectrum, the embryonic eustachian valve disappears completely or is represented only by a thin ridge. Most commonly, it is a crescentic fold of endocardium arising from the anterior rim of the IVC orifice. The lateral horn of the crescent tends to meet the lower end of the crista terminalis, while the medial horn joins the thebesian valve, a semicircular valvular fold at the orifice of the coronary sinus. At the other extreme, it persists as a mobile, elongated structure projecting several centimeters into the right atrial cavity. In this case, it may demonstrate an undulating motion in real time echocardiography; and when it is quite large, it may be confused with right atrial tumors, thrombi, or vegetations. Occasionally, the eustachian <b>valve</b> <b>crosses</b> the floor of the right atrium from the orifice of the IVC and inserts into the lower portion of the interatrial septum adjacent to the atrioventricular valves. However, higher insertion of a giant eustachian valve, which mimics the echocardiographic appearance of divided right atrium, is very rare. This type of abnormality may be confused with cor triatriatum dexter. Very rarely, such a configuration of a large eustachian valve may mimic a right atrial cystic tumor.|$|R

Four steps were followed: 1) Move the electrode with a straight stylet to the right atrium. 2) Change the straight stylet by a conventional J stylet and push the electrode to the lateral or anterolateral wall of the right atrium. 3) Remove the guide 3 - 5 cm and 4) Push the electrode which <b>crosses</b> the tricuspid <b>valve</b> into the right ventricle and finally deploy the active fixation mechanism. ResultsA total of 1198 patients were admitted for pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator implant during the 9 -year study period, 1114 received a left subclavian venous approach. There were 573 males and 541 females. Persistent LSVC was found in five patients (0. 45 %) Fluoroscopy time for implanting the ventricular electrode ranged from 60 to 250 seconds, 40 to 92 minutes being taken to complete the whole procedure. ConclusionsWe present a simple and rapid technique for electrode placement in patients with LSVC using usual J guide and active fixation electrodes with high success...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{developed}} and tested a novel transcatheter circumferential annuloplasty technique to reduce mitral regurgitation in porcine ischemic cardiomyopathy. BackgroundCatheter-based annuloplasty for secondary mitral regurgitation exploits {{the proximity of}} the coronary sinus to the mitral annulus, but is limited by anatomic variants and coronary artery entrapment. MethodsThe procedure, “cerclage annuloplasty,” is guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) roadmaps fused with live X-ray. A coronary sinus guidewire traverses a short segment of the basal septal myocardium to re-enter the right heart where it is exchanged for a suture. Tension is applied interactively during imaging and secured with a locking device. ResultsWe found 2 feasible suture pathways from the great cardiac vein across the interventricular septum to create cerclage. Right ventricular septal re-entry required shorter fluoroscopy times than right atrial re-entry, which entailed a longer intramyocardial traversal but did not <b>cross</b> the tricuspid <b>valve.</b> Graded tension progressively reduced septal-lateral annular diameter, but not end-systolic elastance or regional myocardial function. A simple arch-like device protected entrapped coronary arteries from compression even during supratherapeutic tension. Cerclage reduced mitral regurgitation fraction (from 22. 8 ± 12. 7 % to 7. 2 ± 4. 4 %, p = 0. 04) by slice tracking velocity-encoded MRI. Flexible cerclage reduced annular size but preserved annular motion. Cerclage also displaced the posterior annulus toward the papillary muscles. Cerclage introduced reciprocal constraint to the left ventricular outflow tract and mitral annulus that enhanced leaflet coaptation. A sample of human coronary venograms and computed tomography angiograms suggested that most have suitable venous anatomy for cerclage. ConclusionsTranscatheter mitral cerclage annuloplasty acutely reduces mitral regurgitation in porcine ischemic cardiomyopathy. Entrapped coronary arteries can be protected. MRI provided insight into the mechanism of cerclage action...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to set up {{reference}} values for Doppler flow-derived left ventricular filling parameters and to evaluate physiologic determinants of changes in signal expression related to maturation. Background. In left ventricular diastolic function studies, age-related modulations in signal expression are observed. Assuming degenerative myocardial changes to be absent during childhood and adolescence, the determinants of these modulations must be different from those suspected in adults. Methods. Pulsed wave Doppler signals from the mitral valve tip region were recorded in 329 healthy subjects aged 2 months to 39 years. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate statistical relations between Doppler flow signals and stroke volume in the mitral valve area. Results. Increasing early filling time velocity integral throughout maturation caused a decrease in atrial filling fraction from 0. 34 ± 0. 06 to 0. 24 ± 0. 04 (p < 0. 005). Peak flow velocities during atrial systole decreased from infancy to adolescence (66 ± 15 to 41 ± 10 cm/s). Main effects on signal modulation were caused by heart rate, stroke volume and mitral ring area with a linear model fit (R 2) of 0. 79 for early filling phase (E) -time velocity integral, 0. 6 for atrial filling phase peak velocity 0. 84 for total E duration and 0. 73 for E deceleration time. Atrial filling phase-time velocity integral, albeit significantly dependent on heart rate, was stable throughout growth. Conclusions. During infancy and childhood, the stroke volume <b>crossing</b> the mitral <b>valve</b> is a main modulator for early filling phase (E) -time velocity integral and diastolic time intervals during early filling, whereas atrial filling phase parameters are mainly dependent on heart rate. This results in a more pronounced atrial filling during infancy and childhood...|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims to {{determine}} the influence partial or complete submerge of hollow cone valve by outflow on its capacity without space restrictions, by outflow into discharge chamber and by outflow into water tunnel of circular <b>cross</b> section. The <b>valve</b> capacity is for mutual comparability purposes usually characterized by discharge coefficient. Research works have been performed on a spatial hydraulic model of the valve with inlet diameter D = 67 mm and an apex angle of a cone 90 °. Values of the discharge coefficient obtained from measurements were statistically analyzed. The dependence of discharge coefficient, expressed by energy head, on submerged level was approximated by an exponential function. Exponent value of this function express the dependance rate of valve capacity on downstream water level. This procedure didn’t demonstrate signifiant dependance downstream water level on hollow cone valve capacity, only on tests at outflow to water tunel showed a low increase in the discharge coefficient {{partly due to the}} influence of kinetic energy of the stream flowing out of the tunnel on the energy head and also due to underpressure. Independence of discharge coefficient value on valve head has been prooved for head greather than 232 mm. Also was defined 3 stages of interaction outflow jet from valve and downstream water, some of them may cause on real waterworks structures unfavorable situations (may affect excessive load on valve by pressure pulsations). The presented results allow better evaluation of bottom outlets capacity at higher water levels, when the valves are flooded. Significant effect of sufficient aeration (especially in long water tunnels) on valve capacity was also confirmed. Taking into account on the specifics of hollow jet valves and cone valves, it is possible to generalize some of this resultos on them as well...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that isolated {{coarctation of the aorta}} is associated with relative hypoplasia of the mitral valve, even when the valve is morphologically normal. DESIGN [...] Cross sectional and Doppler echocardiography were used in a prospective, paired, case control study to compare mitral valve dimensions and diastolic transmitral flow characteristics as indices of left heart development. 40 children with isolated coarctation and 40 size matched controls were examined. Within the coarctation group 14 children with apical diastolic murmurs were compared with 14 size matched patients without murmurs. SETTING [...] A supraregional tertiary referral centre for paediatric cardiology. OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Mitral valve diameters, measured from the parasternal long axis, short axis, and apical four chamber views; mitral <b>valve</b> <b>cross</b> sectional area measured from the parasternal short axis view; peak early (E) and peak atrial (A) phase diastolic transmitral flow velocities measured by pulsed wave Doppler from the apical four chamber view; derived E/A ratio and pressure half time of decay from peak E. RESULTS [...] Mitral valve dimensions were significantly smaller in children with coarctation than in controls for long axis diameter (median 1. 74 v 1. 90 cm, p = 0. 0001), short axis diameter (2. 21 v 2. 28 cm, p = 0. 027), and cross sectional area (2. 37 v 3. 15 cm 2, p = 0. 001). Peak E and A velocities were significantly higher in patients than in controls (0. 9 v 0. 82 ms- 1, p = 0. 013 and 0. 61 v 0. 51 ms- 1, p = 0. 007). The only difference between children with coarctation plus murmurs and those without murmurs was a marginally longer pressure half time. CONCLUSIONS [...] Smaller mitral valve dimensions and increased diastolic transmitral flow velocities in children with isolated coarctation compared with normal children suggests that coarctation may be part of a generalised hypoplasia of left heart structures...|$|R
