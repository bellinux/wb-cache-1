40|$|Linear {{compressor}} uses {{a linear}} actuator {{to drive the}} piston directly in its reciprocating motion, eliminating several bearings that convert rotational into linear reciprocating motion, which is the common case in conventional reciprocating compressors. Â Additionally, the presence of side loads is minimized because the main forces in the mechanism are aligned to the axis of motion. Â Since the only sliding surface is the piston-cylinder interface, lubrication can be achieved using the refrigerant gas. Â In the present investigation, the equilibrium condition of capillary compensated gas lubricated piston for a linear compressor is fully explored. Â The main objective of the present work is to evaluate {{the performance of a}} pneumatic bearing and to understand the influence of some design characteristics as radial <b>clearance,</b> <b>diameter</b> of the capillary compensation channels and the position of the feeding ports on the bearing during operation. Â A mathematical model is developed and then the resulting equations are numerically solved by finite volume methodology. Â Results indicated that the linear piston is very stable, and that the gas leakage necessary to lubricate the piston-cylinder interface during the reciprocating motion, is very small. Furthermore, the geometry of the feeding channels to the clearance between piston and cylinder is an important design parameter in achieving a better performance of the aerostatic bearing...|$|E

To achieve such a target, multi-objective optimization methodology is a good approach inasmuch as several types of objective are minimized or maximized simultaneously.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a sensibility {{analysis for the}} journal bearings of combustion engines mass balancing systems. Applying it, it's possible to improve the journal bearings and avoid possible failures. This analysis consists on studying {{the effects of the}} variation of the journal bearings main parameters (radial <b>clearance,</b> journal bearing <b>diameter</b> and journal bearing length) on the journal bearings operating conditions (minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and power loss). The analysis also includes the comparison and selection of the different metallic materials {{that can be used in}} these journal bearings, as well as the selection of the lubrication system groove suitable for the journal bearings used in this kind of application. This sensibility analysis shows that: increasing the radial clearance, the minimum film thickness increases, the maximum pressure remains approximately the same and the power loss decreases; increasing the journal bearing length, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases; increasing the journal bearing diameter, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases. At last, it's found that the white metals (Babbitts) are considered the most advantageous and indicated materials for these journal bearings, and that the lubrication system grooves should be circumferential.

A verification code is utilised, and comparisons are made between a fully-nonlinear representation, a linearised free-surface boundary condition rep-resentation, and the thin-ship representation of this code. This comparison allows us to determine, in a systematic manner, the source and magnitude of any inaccuracies that are found. Finally, the results produced by the verifica-tion code are compared with those produced by SWPE, in order to establish the accuracy of the SWPE code.

40|$|Mean age {{theory is}} {{a useful tool for}} {{analyzing}} mixing by providing spatial distributions of time based data for material inside a system using a steady-state CFD approach, but has been limited to single phase systems. Mean age theory was extended here to multiphase systems by defining the scalar tracer concentration independently for individual phases, which allows mean age to be solved at steady-state for each phase independently within a multiphase system. The theory was validated by comparing multiphase mean age (MMA) distributions extracted from spatial distributions determined computationally at two locations where RTDs were experimentally measured in a water-oil flow system. Mean residence times from MMA theory were within 1 - 3 % of experimental values and variances were within 3 - 11 %. MMA was then modified for applicability to closed systems and applied towards predicting just suspended speed in mixing tanks by evaluating MMA near the bottom surface through strategic zone selection. MMA equations were solved only in a thin section along the bottom of the vessel (~ 1 % of the vessel height), allowing the mean age in proximity to the bottom to be computed. The technique was accurate within 1 - 3 % of experimental values across a range of solid densities, solid fractions, and particle sizes while using multiple impeller types and vessel geometries. At high-solids conditions, biomass slurries exhibit non-Newtonian single phase behavior with a yield stress and require high power input for mixing. The goals was to determine the effect of scale and geometry on power number, P 0, and estimate the power for mixing a biomass slurry in a million gallon hydrolysis reactor of conventional design. A lab-scale CFD model was validated against experimental data and then scaled up. A pitched-blade turbine and A 310 hydrofoil were tested for various geometric arrangements. Flow was transitional; laminar and turbulence models resulted in equivalent P 0 which increased with scale. The ratio of impeller diameter to tank diameter affected P 0 for both impellers, but impeller <b>clearance</b> to tank <b>diameter</b> affected P 0 only for the A 310.

40|$|Study {{of surface}} quality and {{machining}} accuracy {{of a deep}} hole in the camshaft in manufacturing environment is conducted to make recommendations to eliminate emerging stress concentrators on the hole surface after machining and arising cracks while the engine is in operation. So {{it is important to}} conduct a comprehensive task-driven study to determine qualitative and quantitative values of arithmetical mean deviation of the surface roughness profile (parameter of height) and available stress concentrators, as well as to define regularities of changing accuracy parameters for deep-hole length such as deviation size, radial run-out, and geometric tolerance in cross section. A guide diameter of the drill bushing and an outer diameter of the cutting part of one-sided cut have been determined too. A camshaft casting from ductile iron HF 65 - 48 - 1 was processed in the automatic line on the machine "Hȕller" by a drill with the cutting head from the hard alloy VK 6 with simultaneously rotating workpiece and tool. The drill was guided through drill bushing from solid alloy VK 15. The measurement results showed that in 53 % of samples there were tears and scratches up to 0. 15 mm in depth, which could serve as stress concentrators and in the process of operation encourage growth of cracks in the bulk of the camshaft material. A significantly increasing value of the radial run-out size and all six studied harmonic components show that there is a deviation of the hole axis (run) from the nominal (specified) position and faceting available with their copied (increased) values along {{the entire length of the}} hole. This is a qualitative confirmation that in processing the holes in parts made from grey cast iron, there is a mechanism of copying errors earlier available. It is found that the size of a <b>clearance</b> between guide <b>diameter</b> of drill bushing and diameter of tool gage ribbon makes 0. 150 mm and almost 3 times exceeds the recommended value. All this reduces resistance, promotes a wear of the guide elements and a gauge part of the tool. In turn, these reasons create favorable conditions for built-up edge on calibrating and cutting parts of the one-sided cuts which contribute to tears and scratches on the surface of the camshaft hole. Thus, the causes and the mechanism of appearing stress concentrators and their possible growth in the bulk of the material during camshaft operation have been defined. As the wear mechanisms of guide bushing of various drill bits are different, it is advised to settle no more than 80 processing cycles for bushing and at most 63 cycles for drills. The technological operation content on deep drilling to be made has to contain a mandatory checking of the diametral clearance between the drill bushing hole and the calibrating part of the drill, which must be of 0. 055 mm at most. It is recommended to introduce a drill size m= 0. 26 0. 39 mm in its working drawing because it is unavailable there. It allows to reduce deviation of drill cutting part from the nominal position, tool vibration, run of axis and faceting the camshaft holes. The elaborated recommendations can be used in the development of similar drilling operations. </p...|$|R
