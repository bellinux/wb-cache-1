5|$|The {{giant otter}} shows {{a variety of}} adaptations {{suitable}} to an amphibious lifestyle, including exceptionally dense fur, a wing-like tail, and webbed feet. The species prefers freshwater rivers and streams, which are usually seasonally flooded, and may also take to freshwater lakes and springs. It constructs extensive campsites close to feeding areas, clearing large amounts of vegetation. The giant otter subsists almost exclusively on a diet of fish, particularly <b>characins</b> and catfish, but may also eat crabs, turtles, snakes and small caiman. It has no serious natural predators other than humans, although it must compete with other species, including the neotropical otter and caiman species, for food resources.|$|E
25|$|<b>Characins</b> {{are most}} diverse in the Neotropics, {{where they are}} found in lakes and rivers {{throughout}} most of South and Central America. The red-bellied piranha, {{a member of the}} Serrasalmidae family within Characiformes, is endemic to the Neotropic ecozone. At least 209 species of <b>characins</b> are found in Africa, including the distichodontids, citharinids, alestiids, and hepsetids. The rest of the <b>characins</b> originate from the Americas.|$|E
50|$|Hepsetus odoe, the African pike <b>characin</b> is a predatory {{freshwater}} <b>characin</b> {{belonging to}} the family Hepsetidae.

50|$|Corynopoma riisei, {{also known}} as the sword-tail <b>characin</b> is a species of <b>characin</b> found in Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. It is also kept as an {{aquarium}} fish. This species is the only member of its genus.|$|R
25|$|Their closest living {{relatives}} are the Characiformes (<b>characins</b> and allies), the Gymnotiformes (electric eel and American knifefishes) and the Siluriformes (catfishes).|$|E
25|$|Characiformes is {{an order}} of ray-finned fish, {{comprising}} the <b>characins</b> and their allies. Grouped in 18 recognized families, {{there are more than}} two thousand different species, including the well-known piranha and tetras.|$|E
25|$|A few <b>characins</b> {{become quite}} large, and are {{important}} as food or game. Most, however, are small shoaling fish. Many species known as tetras are popular in aquaria {{thanks to their}} bright colors, general hardiness, and tolerance towards other fish in community tanks.|$|E
50|$|The largest <b>characin</b> are Hydrocynus goliath and Salminus franciscanus, both {{of which}} are up to 1.3 m. The {{smallest}} size is about 1.7 cm in the Bolivian pygmy blue <b>characin,</b> Xenurobrycon polyancistrus. Many members are under 3 cm.|$|R

25|$|Historically these {{included}} all the forms now {{placed in the}} superorder Ostariophysi except the catfish, which {{were placed in the}} order Siluriformes. By this definition, the Cypriniformes were paraphyletic, so recently the orders Gonorhynchiformes, Characiformes (<b>characins</b> and allies), and Gymnotiformes (knifefishes and electric eels) have been separated out to form their own monophyletic orders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Characins</b> {{possess a}} Weberian apparatus, {{a series of}} bony parts {{connecting}} the swim bladder and inner ear. Superficially, the Characiformes somewhat resemble their relatives of the order Cypriniformes, but have a small fleshy adipose fin between the dorsal fin and tail. Most species have teeth within the mouth, since they are often carnivorous. The body is almost always covered in well-defined scales. The mouth is also usually not truly protractile.|$|E
25|$|Tree species {{adapted to}} {{seasonal}} inundation {{have adapted to}} maximize fruit production during periods of flooding {{in order to take}} advantage of newly available seed dispersal methods. Fish consume nearly all fruit that fall into the water, and species that are unable to digest the seeds eventually excrete and disperse them into the water. Dispersal by other vectors such as birds and monkeys is secondary to that of fishes in igap√≥. An important factor in seed survival is the presence of seed predators. Fishes that lack the strong jaws found in <b>characins,</b> such as catfish, digest the fleshy material of the fruit while the seeds pass through the gut unharmed. Because many catfishes are bottom-feeders, they are critical dispersers for seeds that sink upon entering the water.|$|E

500|$|The {{giant otter}} is an apex predator, and its {{population}} status reflects the overall health of riverine ecosystems. It feeds mainly on fish, including cichlids, <b>characins</b> (such as piranha), and catfish. One full-year study of giant otter scats in Amazonian Brazil found fish {{present in all}} fecal samples. Fish from the order Perciformes, particularly cichlids, were seen in 97% of scats, and Characiformes, such as <b>characins,</b> in 86%. Fish remains were of medium-sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water, {{to the advantage of}} the probably visually oriented giant otter. Prey species found were also sedentary, generally swimming only short distances, which may aid the giant otter in predation. Hunting in shallow water has also been found to be more rewarding, with water depth less than [...] having the highest success rate. The giant otter seems to be opportunistic, taking whatever species are most locally abundant. If fish are unavailable, it will also take crabs, snakes, and even small caimans and anacondas.|$|E
2500|$|Originally the <b>characins</b> {{were all}} grouped {{within a single}} family, the Characidae. Since then 18 {{different}} families have been separated out. However, classification varies somewhat, {{and the most recent}} (2011) study confirms the circumscribed Characidae as monophyletic. [...] Currently, there are eighteen families, about 270 genera, and at least 1674 species. The suborder Citharinoidei, which contains the families Distichodontidae and Citharinidae, is considered the sister group {{to the rest of the}} <b>characins,</b> suborder Characoidei.|$|E
