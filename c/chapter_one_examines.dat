40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{dialectic}}al concept {{of love in}} Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov through Katerina and Grushenka, the heroines, and Dmitri Karamazov. Dostoyevsky's dialectic is most accurately described by the terms Eros and Agape, as defined by Denis de Rougemont in Love in the Western World. <b>Chapter</b> <b>One</b> <b>examines</b> the character of Katerina and establishes that although her love is ostensibly Agape, her most frequent expression of love is Eros. Chapter Two establishes that Grushenka's most frequent expression of love is Agape although ostensibly Eros. Chapter Three demonstrates how each woman personifies a pole of Dmitri Karamazov's inner conflict, and then traces his development with regard to his relationship to each woman...|$|E

Chapter three focuses on the representation of the soldadera in Como agua para chocolate (1989) by Mexican author Laura Esquivel.

40|$|The Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act {{was passed}} into the Irish Statute books in December 1960. The Act {{provided}} for the mandatory fluoridation of public piped water supplies throughout Ireland. The {{aim of the programme}} being to improve dental health and protect against dental decay. Fluoridation is achieved through the addition to the water supply of hydrofluoric acid. In 1994, thirty-four years later, the Department of Health (now Department of Health & Children) published its health strategy "Shaping a healthier future. A strategy for effective healthcare in the 1990 s " 1 This strategy put forward a vision for the future development of the health services in Ireland to achieve both health and social gain. The strategy statement is underpinned by three key principles: equity, quality of service and accountability. In this project I propose to evaluate the water fluoridation programme to see if it is still relevant in the 1990 s and if it satisfies those three key principles of the Health Strategy. I will, therefore, in <b>Chapter</b> <b>One</b> <b>examine</b> the background to fluoridation; its early history, its introduction to Ireland, the passing of the Act through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the subsequent Constitutional challenge to the Act.

I will examine the meaning of equity as defined in the Health Strategy. I will also look at the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion and WHO's targets for Health for All by the year 2000...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} Jane Austen recasts the eye {{miniature}} portrait???s active, reciprocal gaze as an innovative narrative strategy in her final novel, Persuasion. Austen???s ???eye-miniature??? form of narration creates {{a novel that}} imagines its protagonists in unusually balanced social gender roles and as sharing keen ocular and narrative perception. My Introduction traces the relationship of fashionable appearance to ideologies of gendered vision, space and agency in eighteenth-century Britain; it culminates in how the eye miniature portrait redefined vision. In <b>Chapter</b> <b>One,</b> I <b>examine</b> three eighteenth-century novels by women alongside Jane Austen???s five earliest novels to suggest how the double logic of eighteenth-century visual ideologies both constrain female characters and allow women to craft signs, orchestrate space and act in their own narratives.

Byatt {{attempts}} to recover lost voices in Possession and Angels and Insects (a collection of two novellas) {{by examining the}} limiting roles of women in literature and society. <b>Chapter</b> <b>one</b> <b>examines</b> Possession in which the characters search for their connections to the literary past, ultimately locating them through a lesser-known, female, Victorian poet. In chapter two I consider "Morpho Eugenia," the first novella in Angels and Insects. Byatt illustrates how the male gaze names women and defines their roles. In the second novella, "The Conjugial Angel," analyzed in chapter three, Byatt (re) tells Emily Jesse's story, one formerly appropriated by Alfred Tennyson in In Memoriam. I conclude that Byatt {{attempts to}} relocate her heroines from the margins to the center by deconstructing hierarchical patterns of storytelling.

Gippius's treatment of androgyny was at odds with the prevailing theory because it was not based on the defeminization of humanity. Chapter Two addresses Gippius's reconstruction of Symbolist androgyny theory and explains the rejection of gender-based motivation in her metaphysical system by its orientation toward personality and an awareness of God. Chapter Three shows how she used her poetry and prose to advance her belief that a perfect, androgynous love could reunite humanity with God. While Gippius's prose describes the search for this type of love, her poetry deals with it as a lyric experience. The religious motivations of Gippius's redefinition of Symbolist androgyny indicate the need to re-evaluate the place of Orthodox Christianity in the evolution of Russian Symbolism...|$|E

40|$|My study {{concerns}} {{the works of}} William James (1842 [...] 1910) and the Buddhist thinker Vasubandhu (circa fifth c.). In both cases there is a detailed examination of consciousness which looks at its physiological concomitants. Where James is concerned, this physiological study is found mainly within his Principles of Psychology (1890). In Vasubandhu's case the physiological preconditions of conscious life is inherited from traditional Buddhist psychology (skandhas), but are expanded into the Yogacara concept of the alaya-vijnana (storehouse consciousness). This novel form of consciousness has been interpreted as both a soul theory in Buddhism, and a form of metaphysical idealism. It is these elements that I juxtapose with similar notions found in Jamesian studies (self and idealism). Thus, <b>Chapter</b> <b>One</b> <b>examines</b> consciousness from the isolated perspective of each thinker, Chapter Two moves to an examination of self, and Chapter Three looks {{at the possibility of}} Idealism which is explicitly rejected by James, and is rejected also by many interpreters of the alaya-vijnana...|$|E

I study the central protagonists in Pym's twelve novels {{in the context of}} British society in the 1950 s, 1960 s and 1970 s. I have drawn on feminist critical paradigms in my reading of Pym's novels in order to highlight my insights into her women characters. <b>Chapter</b> <b>One</b> <b>examines</b> Pym 's use of comedy and subversion in relation to her main protagonists.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} Protestant individualism {{and the degree}} to which it was potentially empowering to Victorian women. By Protestant individualism, I mean a way of thinking about and speaking about the self that arises from and is closely associated with Protestant theology. As I argue, this newfound emphasis on Protestant individualism placed Victorian women in a promising position. Unlike philosophy and political theory, which have traditionally based a person's claim to be an individual on his or her reason [...] -something that women have often been believed to lack, Protestantism has generally made a person's individual status the product of a far more universal condition: each person's ultimate accountability to God. People are all primarily individuals, Protestant individualism asserts, because each of them [...] -whether male or female [...] -must stand individually before God on Judgment Day. Since Western political thought has generally predicated a person's claim to rights on his status as an individual, Victorian women's improved claims to individual status gave them, in turn, improved cases for arguing for their personal and political rights. Included among these rights would have been their right to consent (to marriage, sex, etc.) and their right to follow their own consciences (in moral, religious, and political matters). The first two chapters of this dissertation focus on Protestant individualism as it appears in Evangelical Anglican and Broad Church Anglican religious writings, <b>chapter</b> <b>one</b> <b>examining</b> the individualistic and anti-individualistic currents within such theological texts and chapter two exploring the degree to which such works make Protestant available to women. Chapters three and four turn to Victorian women novelists Charlotte Bronte and Mary Augusta Ward and how their novels dramatize the promises and perils of female Protestant individualism. Bronte, who, as I argue, depicts a fairly religiously orthodox Protestant individualism, presents such orthodox Protestant individualism as generally available and empowering to women. In contrast, Ward, who portrays a much less orthodox Protestant individualism, presents such heterodox Protestant individualism as difficult, if not impossible, for women to realize...|$|R

One of the more hotly contested questions debated between the contributors to Camera Work was whether photography was even art or documentary, and whether the photographic image itself should be considered realistic or representational.

A presente tese de doutorado propõe-se a analisar a judicialização da política no Brasil, a partir das decisões do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral e do Supremo Tribunal Federal sobre questões partidárias e eleitorais, especificamente a verticalização das coligações e a fidelidade partidária. O objetivo da tese é {{investigar}} o que torna possível, por que ocorre e o que orienta a expansão da atuação desses tribunais, levando-os a deliberar sobre questões políticas. A tese contém cinco capítulos. No Capítulo I, examinam-se a teoria contemporânea sobre a judicialização da política, o controle de constitucionalidade como poder político do Judiciário, os instrumentos constitucionais de judicialização da política e as experiências desse fenômeno em outros países. No Capítulo II, aborda-se a governança eleitoral, seu conceito, os modelos comparados e o modelo adotado no Brasil, com o enfoque sobre a Justiça Eleitoral e o Ministério Público Eleitoral. No Capítulo III, discute-se o desenho da pesquisa, que engloba a metodologia, as hipóteses e a justificação dos casos estudados. No Capítulo IV, analisa-se o caso da verticalização das coligações, enfocando-se a contextualização, o debate judicial, a reação dos partidos e do Congresso Nacional, a aplicação das hipóteses e a conclusão do estudo de caso. No Capítulo V, examina-se o caso da fidelidade partidária, enfocando-se, de igual modo, a contextualização, o debate judicial, a reação dos partidos e do Congresso Nacional, a aplicação das hipóteses e a conclusão do estudo de caso. Finalmente, à guisa de conclusão da tese, procura-se apresentar uma reflexão crítica sobre a ascensão institucional do Judiciário brasileiro, em particular do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral e do Supremo Tribunal Federal, decorrente da judicialização da política. This doctorate thesis {{proposes to}} analyze the judicialization of politics in Brazil {{from the perspective of}} the decisions of both the Superior Electoral Court and the Supreme Federal Court regarding partisan and electoral issues, specifically on the verticalization of coalitions and party loyalty.

The thesis is divided into five chapters. Thus, in <b>Chapter</b> I, <b>one</b> approaches the contemporary theory about the judicialization of politics, the control of constitutionality as the political expression of the Judiciary, the constitutional instruments for the judicialization of politics and the experiences of this phenomenon in other countries. In <b>Chapter</b> II, <b>one</b> discusses the electoral governance, its concept, compared models and the model adopted in Brazil, with a focus on the Electoral Justice and Electoral Public Ministry. In <b>Chapter</b> III, <b>one</b> <b>examines</b> the research design wich includes the methodology, the assumptions and the justification of the cases studied.

Chapter three explores issues of incest, adultery, and death, which confront the community in The Shipping News. Rather than being destroyed by disaster, the community, consistently through the grace it receives, extends grace to those who most need it. Finally, chapter four reveals a community reconfigured by grace from a place of exclusion into a place of inclusion and restoration in Crackpot. The different perspective that each novel presents on the relationship between community and grace offers further insight into the incomprehensibility of grace and its consistent presence in Canadian literature...|$|E

First, I argue that in contrast to literary history 2 ̆ 7 s focus on Edward Bellamy 2 ̆ 7 s 1888 Looking Backward as the origin point for American utopian fiction, it is instead literature of the antebellum period that initiates this development in American letters. Second, in response to a critical tendency to mark history and utopianism as contradictory discourses, I demonstrate the role utopianism plays in aiding and expanding historiographical thought. Four case studies develop these assertions in the context of specific historiographical problems. <b>Chapter</b> <b>One</b> <b>examining</b> Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s The Crater reveals the pressures that new developments in the hard sciences placed on humanistic accounts of time and history. Chapter Two on Martin R. Delany 2 ̆ 7 s Blake confronts the inbuilt resistance of American historical narratives to the possibility of a slave-led revolution. Chapter Three focusing on Emily Dickinson 2 ̆ 7 s poetry speaks to the insufficiencies of Christian millennialism in providing a coherent and satisfying account of historical experience. The final chapter on Edward Bellamy 2 ̆ 7 s Looking Backward addresses the relationship between antebellum and turn-of-the-century utopian writing and explores the novel 2 ̆ 7 s struggle to represent radical historical change. In sum, these chapters demonstrate how, {{in the wake of the}} waning influence of the historical novel, utopianism offered writers a grammar for grappling with historiographical problems raised by new epistemologies (especially in hard sciences), race and revolution, shifting religious paradigms, and American imperialism. Utopian literary conventions provided ways for author to engage what I call the 2 ̆ 2 subjunctive 2 ̆ 2 aspects of these historiographical problems—desire, conjecture, ineffability, futurity, and loss—as the professional discipline of history became increasingly positivist and thus less capacious in its approach. In utilizing utopia as an analytic category, this project reclaims the undervalued critical lens of utopia, which like optics such as trauma and melancholy, offers an alternative approach to representing historical experience and theorizing historical expression. ...|$|R

For effective intervention development, an understanding of the underlying casual influences on consumption is needed. The current dissertation is intended to identify whether influences on youth fruit and vegetable consumption (FVC) vary by age, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). The series of four chapters focus on self-efficacy for FVC and proxy efficacy to influence other adults to provide supportive FV environments. <b>Chapter</b> <b>One</b> reviews studies <b>examining</b> the influences on youth FVC. Consistently across studies, FV preferences and FV availability influenced youth FVC. Chapter Two and Chapter Three report studies documenting that children’s confidence (proxy efficacy) to influence parents to make FV available and to influence other adults (after-school staff) to make FV available are independent but related constructs to self-efficacy to eat fruits and self-efficacy to eat vegetables. Differences were found in these constructs according to school demographi...|$|R
