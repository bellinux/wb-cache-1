50|$|Some escapements avoid sliding friction; {{examples}} include the grasshopper escapement of John Harrison in the 18th century, This may avoid the need <b>for</b> <b>lubrication</b> in the escapement (though it does not obviate the requirement <b>for</b> <b>lubrication</b> of {{other parts of the}} gear train).|$|R
5000|$|Graphite is {{best suited}} <b>for</b> <b>lubrication</b> in air. Water vapor is a {{necessary}} component <b>for</b> graphite <b>lubrication.</b> The adsorption of water reduces the bonding energy between the hexagonal planes of the graphite to a lower level than the adhesion energy between a substrate and the graphite. Because water vapor is a requirement <b>for</b> <b>lubrication,</b> graphite is not effective in vacuum. [...] Because it is electrically conductive, graphite can promote galvanic corrosion. In an oxidative atmosphere, graphite is effective at high temperatures up to 450 °C continuously and can withstand much higher temperature peaks.|$|R

50|$|Oil cooling is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available <b>for</b> <b>lubrication,</b> this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to an oil system used solely <b>for</b> <b>lubrication,</b> oil cooling requires additional oil capacity, a greater flow rate through the oil pump, and an oil cooler (or a larger cooler than normal).|$|R

40|$|The maximum {{temperature}} {{at which a}} mechanical system can operate is often determined by the need <b>for</b> <b>lubrication.</b> The paper considers the various heat sources, ambient temperature, mechanical or chemical inputs, and flash temperatures, and dis-cusses their influence on different types of lubrication. The actual temperature limitations are imposed by physical or chemical changes in the lubricant itself, or by changes in a specific lubrication mechanism such as adsorption. The nature {{of these types of}} change is described, together with the dominant importance of residence time on the extent of deterioration. Some actual temperature limits for particular lubricants are listed, and the paper suggests some possible design techniques for extending the upper temperature limits <b>for</b> <b>lubrication.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Design {{considerations}} <b>for</b> <b>lubrication</b> in {{high speed}} rotating MEMS devices are discussed, using the MIT Microengine program {{as the primary}} example. This device relies on the rotation of a microfabricated silicon rotor at speeds well in excess of one million RPM, and uses gas bearings to support the rotor both in the axial and radial directions.

40|$|Hip implant is an {{orthopedic}} procedure which the hip joint {{is replaced by}} prosthetic or artificial implant in order to replace arthritic or dysfunctional joint surface.

A micro pits formation is therefore used <b>for</b> <b>lubrication</b> purpose, which eventually prolong the lifespan of the hips. This paper will focus on the methods for machining the micro pits in terms of work piece placement, coordination and orientation related to the electrode of electrical discharge machining system <b>for</b> <b>lubrication</b> purpose.
