5000|$|After {{the control}} word comes the TDMoIP payload. For structure-agnostic {{transport}} (SAToP) {{this is simply}} a predetermined number of TDM octets, while for the structure-locked format the payload is an integer number of TDM frames. For structure-indication and structure-reassembly TDMoIP draws on proven adaptation mechanisms originally developed for ATM. A side benefit of this choice of payload types is simplified interworking with circuit emulation services carried over ATM networks. For statically allocated, constant bit-rate (CBR) TDM links, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 1 (AAL1). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.1 and ATM Forum specification atm-vtoa-0078, was developed for carrying CBR services over ATM. AAL1 operates by segmenting the continuous stream of TDM data into small 48-byte cells and inserting sequencing, timing, error recovery, and synchronization information into them. TDMoIP allows concatenation of any number of AAL1 cells into a packet (note that these are AAL1 cells and not ATM cells, i.e. they {{do not include the}} five-byte [...] "cell tax"). By allowing multiple cells per packet, TDMoIP facilitates flexible tradeoffs of buffering delay (which decreases with fewer cells per packet) for bandwidth efficiency (which increases with more cells per packet, due to the per packet overhead). For dynamically allocated TDM links, whether the information rate varies due to activation of time slots or due to voice activity detection, TDMoIP employs ATM adaptation layer 2 (AAL2). This mechanism, defined in ITU-T standard I.363.2, was developed for carrying variable bit rate (VBR) services over ATM. AAL2 operates by buffering each TDM time slot into short minicells, inserting the time slot identifier and length indication, sequencing, and then sending this minicell only if it carries valid information. TDMoIP concatenates the minicells from all active time slots into a single packet. For time slots carrying high-level data link control (HDLC) data, such as data for <b>common</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> (<b>CCS),</b> TDMoIP has a special adaptation that encapsulates stretches of non-idle data.|$|E

The bulk of signaling in D-AMPS-based PCS, as in most modern telecommunication systems, is based on Signaling System No. 7 (SS 7). SS 7 is a general-purpose <b>common</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> (<b>CCS)</b> system specified by the International Telecommunication Union â€” Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) and adapted to North American needs by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). Besides the orthodox use for signaling, SS 7 is used in D-AMPS-based PCS for operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning (OAM&P) of the D-AMPS-based PCS network and for short message service (SMS).

40|$|SS 7 or Signaling System Number 7 {{is a set}} of {{protocols}} {{that describes}} a means of communication between telephone switches in public telephone networks. SS 7 is a highly sophisticated and powerful form of <b>Common</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Signaling</b> (<b>CCS).</b> The use of out-of-band signaling procedures offers considerable benefits over and above other signaling methodologies. The primary function of SS 7 is to provide call control, remote network management, and maintenance capabilities for the inter- office telephone network. SS 7 performs these functions by exchanging control messages between SS 7 telephone exchanges (signaling points or SPs) and SS 7 signaling transfer points (STPs). The switching offices (SPs) handle the SS 7 control network as well as the user circuit switched network. Basically, the SS 7 control network tells the switching office which paths to establish over the circuit-switched network. The STPs route SS 7 control packets across the signaling network.
