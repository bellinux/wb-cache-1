40|$|The <b>converter</b> <b>steel</b> slag {{cannot be}} {{widely used in}} {{building}} materials for its poor grindability. In this paper, the grinding characteristics of untreated and pretreated (i. e., magnetic separation) steel slag were compared. Additionally, the grinding property of pretreated steel slag was also studied after adding grinding aids. The {{results show that the}} residues (i. e., oversize substance) that passed a 0. 9 mm square-hole screen can be considered as the hardly grinding phases (HGP) and its proportion is about 1. 5 %. After the initial 20 min grinding, the RO phase (RO phase is a continuous solid solution which is composed of some divalent metal oxides, such as FeO, MgO, MnO, CaO, etc.), calcium ferrite, and metallic iron phase made up most of the proportion of the HGP, while the metallic iron made up the most component after 70 min grinding. The D 50 of untreated steel slag could only reach 32. 89 μm after 50 min grinding, but that of pretreated steel slag could reach 18. 16 μm after the same grinding time. The grinding efficiency of steel slag was obviously increased and the particle characteristics were improved after using grinding aids (GA), especially the particle proportions of 3 – 32 μm were obviously increased by 7. 24 %, 7. 22 %, and 10. 63 % after 40 min, 50 min, and 60 min grinding, respectively.

40|$|Mineral {{carbonation}} {{is one of}} {{the options}} that can contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for climate change mitigation purposes. Steel manufacturing, which {{is one of the}} biggest industrial sources of CO 2 emissions, could benefit from this option by utilizing its own by-products, i. e., steelmaking slags, to combine with CO 2. Additional benefits would be achieved if the end product was a pure and marketable calcium carbonate. The utilization of CaCO 3 derived from steelmaking slag to replace some of the synthetic CaCO 3 used in industry would simultaneously save virgin material resources, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and provide a new utilization option for the low-value slag. The objective of the research reported in this thesis was to investigate the possibility of reducing CO 2 emissions by utilizing steelmaking slags as raw material for CO 2 mineralization. The target was that the end product of the CO 2 mineralization would be a pure CaCO 3 suitable for utilization. The suitability of the acetic acid process route suggested by Kakizawa et al. (2001) was tested first. Experiments showed that acetic acid dissolves calcium efficiently from steelmaking slags. A weak acetic acid solution was able to dissolve lime selectively from the <b>steel</b> <b>converter</b> slag, forming a clearly alkaline solution. Nonetheless, efficient CaCO 3 precipitation required the addition of NaOH to prevent the regeneration of acid during carbonation, as well as to increase the alkalinity of the solution in those cases where a stronger acetic acid solution was used for the dissolution step. Preliminary process calculations revealed that chemical costs make the process clearly too expensive for CO 2 sequestration. Because the production of pure CaCO 3 from steelmaking slags with acetic acid was not feasible, various other solvents were tested. Three ammonium salt solutions (CH 3 COONH 4, NH 4 NO 3, and NH 4 Cl) dissolved calcium selectively from the <b>steel</b> <b>converter</b> slag and almost as efficiently as acids. The precipitated calcium carbonates were very pure. It was calculated that the production of pure calcium carbonate from <b>steel</b> <b>converter</b> slag by using ammonium salts as a solvent has clearly negative CO 2 emissions. Since it was found that the method is not suitable for just any waste/by product materials that contain calcium, but should be applicable for at least those that contain free CaO, this method has potential only for minor-scale, yet significant, CO 2 storage. A clear advantage is, however, that it uses a low value by-product as its raw material and has economic potential...|$|R

Chemical characteristics of lanthanoid elements (La–Lu) and five heavy metals (Cr, Co, Mo, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed to determine the variation in spatial scale and deposition provenances. Factor analysis and ternary diagrams were used to identify principle pollution sources. The LaCeSm ternary diagram was used to identify oil refineries using fluid catalytic <b>converters</b> and <b>steel</b> plants, but could not differentiate crustal materials. Lanthanoid characteristic parameters showed similarity between deposition and soil in the local and southwest area {{in the vicinity of}} Beijing. Analysis of the five heavy metals enabled discrimination of contaminants originating from human activities. Cd, Pb, and Mo were found to originate from vehicular traffic, whereas Co and Cr originated from industrial emissions and coal combustion. Discriminant analysis established the causes of spatial variation. The result shows that Co, Mo, and Pb can mark the differences between urban and suburban sites. From the PbMoCo plot, it was inferred that the different chemical characters are mainly due to the differing origins of depositions. Deposition samples in suburban areas are principally influenced by soil, chimney soot, and fertilizer, whereas those in urban area are mainly affected by traffic emissions.

The current work deals {{with one of the most}} important factors influencing the formation of manganese sulfide in <b>converter</b> rail <b>steel.</b> The thermodynamic calculations of rail steel crystallization at the cooling rate of 100 K/min. are given in the work. Computer simulation results are presented as graphs showing the separation of components, as well as curves showing the process of nonmetallic inclusions formation.

Materials used for the rail {{steel production}} must meet the highest requirements as to the properties of materials, shape and durability. Non-metallic inclusions are one of the factors negatively influencing the strength of rail steel.
