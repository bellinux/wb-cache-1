25|$|The egg collection, {{consisting}} of 10,400 sets representing 733 species, is 11th largest in North America {{in number of}} sets and 15th largest in number of species. It represents approximately 90% of the species and subspecies of North American birds. The egg collection has grown by 1% {{in the last five}} years. It is cataloged in a card file that includes original collectors' data slips or page references to the collector's field notes. Especially well represented are sets from New England and Florida. The collection is rich in sets of raptor eggs, including bald eagles, ospreys, broad-winged hawks, red-shouldered hawks, northern caracaras, American kestrels, the Florida races of seaside sparrows and clapper rails. Rarities include sets of passenger pigeon, <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet,</b> and Bachman's warbler eggs.|$|E

5000|$|Young <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{differed}} {{slightly in}} coloration from adults. The face and entire body was green, with paler underparts.

The plumage of this bird, is very close to that of the Carolina's and can be distinguished from the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> by having a yellow neck and shoulders, and a black beak instead of a buff-colored beak as the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> has.|$|E

25|$|The bird skin {{collection}} contains approximately 20,500 specimens representing at least 2,300 species. These are mostly study skins, {{but in recent}} years the division has prepared a large proportion of new specimens as flat skins or spread wings with associated skeletons. In 1992, the division also received a collection of approximately 3,000 skins. The skin collection has grown by 23% in the last five years. Also wide-ranging taxonomically, it represents 27 orders, 129 families, and 850 genera. Rarities include skins of ivory-billed woodpeckers and extinct dusky seaside sparrows, passenger pigeons, and <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bush {{developed}} {{a love of}} the natural world as a young man by exploring the frontier country of post-Civil War western Missouri. Within a few miles of his home were prairies, dense woods, rocky glades, and small waterways connected to the Missouri River. Young Bush was particularly taken with the calls and songs of the bird species in the area, and he amassed an important collection of bird eggs from the region. He also tracked the behaviors of passenger pigeons, prairie chickens, and <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeets.</b> But his lifelong interest in birds was always superseded by his interest in plants.|$|R

50|$|Conuropsis carolinensis, the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet,</b> {{was one of}} {{only two}} parrot species endemic to the United States in {{recorded}} history. The <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> was a remarkably social bird, living in vast flocks. American bird hunters reported that Carolina parakeets would return to mourn dead members of the flock, making themselves easy targets. Considered a pest, popular in the pet trade, and bearing plume feathers valued for hats, this species was hunted to extinction around the beginning of the 1900s.|$|E
50|$|Within {{historic}} times, {{the passenger}} pigeon, the <b>carolina</b> <b>parakeet,</b> and the ivory-billed woodpecker were all found in Missouri, {{but they have}} since been eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|A fossil parrot, {{designated}} Conuropsis fratercula, {{was described}} {{based on a}} single humerus from the Miocene Sheep Creek Formation (possibly late Hemingfordian, c. 16 mya, possibly later) of Snake River, Nebraska. This was a smaller bird, three-quarters {{the size of the}} <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet.</b> [...] "The present species is of peculiar interest as it represents the first known parrotlike bird to be described as a fossil from North America." [...] (Wetmore 1926; italics added) However, it is not altogether certain that this species is correctly assigned to Conuropsis, but some authors consider it a paleosubspecies of the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet.</b>|$|E

50|$|The work {{consists}} of hand-coloured, life-size prints, made from engraved plates, measuring around 39 by 26 in. It includes images of six now-extinct birds: <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet,</b> passenger pigeon, Labrador duck, great auk, Eskimo curlew, and pinnated grouse. The plant-life backgrounds of some 50 {{of the bird}} studies were painted by Audubon's assistant Joseph Mason and reproduced uncredited in the book.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{recognized}} subspecies. The Louisiana subspecies of the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet,</b> C. c. ludovicianus, {{was slightly}} different in color than the nominate subspecies, being more bluish-green and generally of a somewhat subdued coloration, and became extinct {{in much the}} same way, but at a somewhat earlier date (early 1910s). The Appalachian Mountains separated these birds from the eastern C. c. carolinensis.|$|E
50|$|Incas, {{the last}} captive <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{died at the}} Cincinnati Zoo on February 21, 1918 in the same cage as Martha, the last {{passenger}} pigeon, which died in 1914. There are no scientific studies or surveys of this bird by American naturalists; most information about it is from anecdotal accounts and museum specimens. Therefore, details of its prevalence and decline are unverified or speculative.|$|E
50|$|The true parrots are {{distributed}} throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, covering many different habitats, from the humid tropical forests to deserts in Australia, India, Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, and two species, one extinct (the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet),</b> formerly in the United States. However, the larger populations are native to Australasia, South America, and Central America.|$|E

5000|$|Captain William Clark {{wrote on}} June 27, 1804, that [...] "the Countrey about {{the mouth of}} this river is verry fine."

5000|$|Conures {{are either}} large parakeets or small parrots {{found in the}} Western Hemisphere. They are {{analogous}} in size {{and way of life}} to the Old World's rose-ringed parakeets or the Australian parakeets. All living conure species live in Central and South America. The extinct Conuropsis carolinensis, or <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> was an exception. Conures are often called the clowns of the parrot world due to their constant attention seeking behavior including hanging upside-down and swaying back and forth or [...] "dancing." ...|$|E
50|$|The Eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis), {{possibly}} extinct today, occurred as a transient in Ohio until about 1900; {{to what extent}} it migrated through Seneca County is not well known {{but even if it}} did it is unlikely that it was often seen after deforestation had gotten underway in earnest. The extinct <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Conuropsis carolinensis) - or probably individuals of the western subspecies, the Louisiana Parakeet (C. c. ludovicianus) - may have on occasion have occurred in Seneca County as a vagrant before 1862.|$|E
5000|$|According to a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA recovered from museum specimens, their closest living relatives include some of the South American Aratinga parakeets: the Nanday parakeet, the sun parakeet, and the golden-capped parakeet. The authors note the bright yellow and orange plumage and blue wing feathers found in Conuropsis carolinensis are traits shared by another species, the jandaya parakeet (A. jandaya), that was not sampled in the study but is generally thought to be closely related. Carolinensis is in a sister clade to that of Spix's macaw. The <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> colonized North America about 5.5 million years ago. This was well before North America and South America were joined together by {{the formation of the}} Panama land bridge about 3.5 mya. Since the Carolina parakeets' more distant relations are geographically closer to its own historic range whilst its closest relatives are more geographically distant to it, these data are consistent with the generally accepted hypothesis that Central and North America were colonized at different times by distinct lineages of parrots - parrots that originally invaded South America from Antarctica some time after the breakup of Gondwana, where Neotropical parrots originated approximately 50 mya.The following cladogram shows the placement of the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> among its closest relatives, after a DNA study by Kirchman et al., 2012: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} is conclusive that humans caused {{the extinction of}} the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet,</b> {{through a variety of}} means. Chief was deforestation in the 18th and 19th centuries. Hunting played a significant role, both for decorative use of their colorful feathers, for example adornment of women's hats, and for reduction of crop predation. This was partially offset by recognition of their value in controlling invasive cockleburs. Minor roles were played by capture for the pet trade and, it was hypothesized, by the introduction for crop pollination of European honeybees that competed for nest sites.|$|E
50|$|Several species {{recorded}} at Engineer Cantonment {{are no longer}} present in the area. Two birds, the passenger pigeon and the <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet,</b> are entirely extinct. The local subspecies of gray wolf, Canis lupus nubilus, is likewise extinct. Several more of the larger carnivores, including black bear, eastern spotted skunk, and river otter, are no longer found in the vicinity; the mountain lion vanished from the area for many years, {{but in the early}} 21st century was once again found in eastern Nebraska. Hunting and destruction of habitat have led to the disappearance of three major herbivores: American bison, pronghorn, and elk.|$|E
50|$|The Cincinnati Zoo {{is located}} in the Avondale {{neighborhood}} of Cincinnati. It was founded on 65.4 acre {{in the middle of the}} city, and since then it has acquired some of the surrounding blocks and several reserves in Cincinnati's outer suburbs. The zoo conducts breeding programs, and was the first to successfully breed California sea lions. The zoo also has other breeding programs including South African cheetahs, Sumatran rhinoceros, Malayan tigers, western lowland gorillas, pottos, and Masai giraffes. The Cincinnati Zoo was the home of Martha, the last living passenger pigeon, which died there in 1914. It was also home to the last living <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> in 1918.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> had the northern-most {{range of}} any known parrot. It was found from {{southern}} New England and New York and Wisconsin to Kentucky, Tennessee and the Gulf of Mexico. It {{has also had}} a wide distribution west of the Mississippi River, as far west as eastern Colorado. Its range was described by early explorers thus: the 43rd parallel as the northern limit, the 26th as the most southern, the 73rd and 106th meridians as the eastern and western boundaries respectively, the range included all or portions of at least 28 states. Its habitats were old-growth wetland forests along rivers and in swamps especially in the Mississippi-Missouri drainage basin with large hollow trees including cypress and sycamore to use as roosting and nesting sites.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Carolina</b> <b>parakeet</b> was a {{small green}} parrot very similar in size and {{coloration}} to the extant jenday and sun conures. The majority of the plumage was green with lighter green underparts, a bright yellow head and orange forehead and face extending to behind the eyes and upper cheeks (lores). The shoulders were yellow, continuing down {{the outer edge of}} the wings. The primary feathers were mostly green, but with yellow edges on the outer primaries. Thighs were green towards the top and yellow towards the feet. Male and female adults were identical in plumage, however males were slightly larger than females (sexually dimorphic). The legs and feet were light brown. They share the zygodactyl feet of the parrot family. The skin around the eyes was white and the beak was pale flesh colored. These birds weigh about 3.5 oz., are 13 in. long, and have wingspans of 2123 in.|$|E
