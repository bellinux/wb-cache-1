But no matter how impressive a venue is, not much <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> the weather and Faisalabad has suffered {{at the hands of}} the elements. In 1998–99 fog caused the third Test against Zimbabwe was abandoned without a ball being bowled, while bad light is often an issue especially for matches played during the winter. However, when play has been possible, some memorable performances have taken place. An exciting Test was played out in 1997–98 when South Africa skittles Pakistan for 92, successfully defending a target of 142 on the final day. Then, in 2004–05, Sanath Jayasuriya smashed 253 as Sri Lanka powered to a 201-run victory. But the ground is most famous for the confrontation between Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana during England's 1987–88 tour, which led to a day being lost during the match and some long-lasting bad feeling between the teams.PCB(Pakistan Cricket Board) also conducts its domestic tournaments at this venue.Recencently, Super 8 T20 was held here from 11 to 18 May.The stadium itself is only 2km out of the city centre, which can be reached by a walk through the tree-lined suburbs.|$|E

500|$|Doggett has Duffy's {{fingerprints}} examined, {{and finds}} that {{they belong to}} a man who died thirty years previously. Doggett contacts an old military partner, Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin) to find Duffy's real identity. Although Rohrer assures Doggett he will investigate, the agent is not convinced, believing that Duffy is a CIA agent. He confides this to Skinner, who tells him to aid Scully at the military hospital. As Scully and Hendershot sneak out of the building, they are found by Rohrer and several marines, claiming Doggett has sent them to rescue her. Scully and Hendershot are driven away, but Hendershot enters labour. The women are separated, and Scully is drugged. When she wakens, Doggett informs her that Hendershot's baby was delivered and is normal. However, Scully is convinced something is amiss, but nothing more <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> it. In another flashback, Scully tells Mulder that her attempt at in vitro fertilization has failed, but he tells her to [...] "never give up on a miracle".|$|E
500|$|Patton's {{conduct in}} this {{campaign}} met with several controversies. When Alexander sent a transmission on July 19 limiting Patton's attack on Messina, his chief of staff, Brigadier General Hobart R. Gay, claimed the message was [...] "lost in transmission" [...] until Messina had fallen. On July 22 he shot and killed a pair of mules that had stopped while pulling a cart across a bridge. The cart was blocking {{the way of a}} U.S. armored column which was under attack from German aircraft. When their Sicilian owner protested, Patton attacked him with a walking stick and pushed the two mules off of the bridge. When informed of the massacre of Italian prisoners at Biscari by troops under his command, Patton wrote in his diary, [...] "I told Bradley that it was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell the officer to certify that the dead men were snipers or had attempted to escape or something, as it would make a stink in the press and also would make the civilians mad. Anyhow, they are dead, so nothing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Bradley refused Patton's suggestions. Patton later changed his mind. After he learned that the 45th Division's Inspector General found [...] "no provocation {{on the part of the}} prisoners... They had been slaughtered" [...] Patton is reported to have said: [...] "Try the bastards." [...] Patton also came into frequent disagreements with Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and acquiesced to their relief by Bradley.|$|E

Future study <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> the performance of the algorithm to other facility location problem.|$|R
2500|$|His royalism and {{religious}} zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He {{felt that he}} was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. Niels Henrik Abel called him a [...] "bigoted Catholic" [...] and added he was [...] "mad and there is nothing that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> him", {{but at the same time}} praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned Jean Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by Jean-Victor Poncelet, to be wrong.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2006 {{or early}} 2007, in what {{journalist}} Seymour Hersh called The Redirection, the United States changed its {{policy in the}} Muslim world, shifting its support from the Shia to the Sunni, {{with the goal of}} [...] "containing" [...] Iran and as a by-product bolstering Sunni extremist groups. Richard Engel, who is an NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, wrote an article in late 2011 alleging that the United States Government is pro-Sunni and anti-Shia. During the Iraq War, the United States feared that a Shiite-led, Iran-friendly Iraq could have major consequences for American national security. However, nothing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> this as Iraq's Shiite government were democratically elected. Shadi Bushra of Stanford University wrote that the United States’ support of the Sunni monarchy during the Bahraini uprising {{is the latest in a}} long history of US support to keep the Shiites in check. The United States fears that Shiite rule in the Persian Gulf will lead to anti-US and anti-Western sentiment as well as Iranian influence in the Arab majority states. One analyst told CNN that the US strategy on putting pressure on Iran by arming its Sunni neighbors is not a new strategy for the United States.|$|E
