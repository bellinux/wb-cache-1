There are {{a range of}} other remedies available to the holder of a mortgage, but they relate predominantly to land, and accordingly have been superseded by statute, and they are rarely exercised in practice {{in relation to other}} assets.

40|$|At common law, a {{landlord}} {{has the right}} to enforce forfeiture of a lease where the tenant breaches a term that is expressed as a condition of the lease agreement. Breach of covenant, on the other hand, does not give {{a landlord}} a right to forfeit the lease unless such a right is expressly embodied in the lease agreement. 2 In practice, this is rarely an issue as tenancies created by a formal document invariably reserve a right of forfeiture for breach of any covenant, including the <b>covenant</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> rent...|$|E
40|$|Plaintiff tenant {{entered into}} {{possession}} {{of an apartment}} with was no written lease and the rent was fixed monthly {{under the condition that}} the landlord would make certain repairs to render the premises ‘livable’. The landlord never did and tenant terminated rent payments. The landlord instituted a summary dispossess action against Berzito for nonpayment and the state district court held that the landlord was in violation of his express warranty of habitability and reduced the tenants rent but tenant still did not pay. The trial court ruled in the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s favor and rejected the landord 2 ̆ 7 s contention that by remaining in possession the tenant had waived the failure to repair. The appellate division reversed and tenant appealed. The NJ supreme court held that the landlord had breached his covenant of habitability 2 ̆ 7 and that the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s <b>covenant</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> rent depended upon the fulfillment of the warranty of habitability. Prior to this holding the NJ courts had only recognized two tenant remedies – caveat emptor by allowing the tenant to vacate the premises when constructively evicted and the common law belief that traditional common law relationships were ill suited to modern living conditions and should be relaxed. This latter remedy, the warranty of habitability, gave relief to the tenant when his landlord failed to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 This case does not present a fact pattern fitting New Jersey 2 ̆ 7 s available remedies since 2 ̆ 2 the tenant did not vacate the premises nor did she undertake the needed repairs herself and then seek to offset the expense so incurred against her obligation to pay rent. 2 ̆ 2 Due to this court’s holding, the tenant is no longer limited to the establishment of defenses in a landlord 2 ̆ 7 s action and can take the initiative establishing a new remedy for tenants. The trend in legislation and court decisions has been for the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s benefit and landlords’ duty has changed dramatically over {{a relatively short period of}} time, gaining equality in the landlord-tenant relationship...|$|E

Sir Joseph paid an initial deposit of £200,000 and <b>covenanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{the balance of the}} £2 million purchase price on 11 November. Within a month, however, the First World War broke out, and new official restrictions on the use of capital prevented the completion of the contract. [...] The estate and market continued to be managed by the Duke's staff, and in October 1916, Joseph Beecham died suddenly, with the transaction still uncompleted. [...] The matter was brought before the civil courts with the aim of disentangling Sir Joseph's affairs; the court and all parties agreed that a private company should be formed, with his two sons as directors, to complete the Covent Garden contract. In July 1918, the Duke and his trustees conveyed the estate to the new company, subject to a mortgage of the balance of the purchase price still outstanding: £1.25 million.|$|R
