Two multiply connected folding domains of the neutral endopeptidase locus splicing of exons 1, 2a, or 2b to the common exon 3 composed of 24 exons of the human CALLA/NEP gene containing the active site, it is known as peptidase family M13 (neprilysin family, clan MA(E)) the gluzincins a faint but significant structural relationship of the metzincins [...] to the thermolysin-like enzymes, Zincin is the simplest descriptor of biological space. The structure reveals two multiply connected folding domains which embrace a large central cavity containing the active site of the 5-indanyl ester prodrug candoxatril and differs from phosphoramidon leucyl)-L-tryptophan in several respects the structure of human neutral endopeptidase complexed with phosphoramidon is lost due to desolvation of the enzyme and ligand on formation of the complex Candoxatril.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Our primary {{objective}} was to compare the effects of three different doses of <b>candoxatrilat</b> {{with the effects of}} placebo on urinary volume in patients with moderately severe heart failure. The effects of <b>candoxatrilat</b> on urinary composition, neuroendocrine indexes and renal hemodynamic function were also studied. Background. <b>Candoxatrilat,</b> a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, reduces degradation of atrial natriuretic peptide and provokes diuresis in patients with mild heart failure, but the renal effects have not been studied in patients with moderately severe heart failure in a placebo-controlled study. Methods. In a double-blind crossover trial, the effects of intravenous boluses of saline vehicle (placebo) and 50, 100 and 200 mg of <b>candoxatrilat</b> were compared on separate days in 12 patients with heart failure. Urinary output and composition were measured for 8 h. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were determined by radionuclide techniques. Blood was withdrawn for the measurement of hormones before and 3 h after dosing. Results. All doses of <b>candoxatrilat</b> increased urinary volume (e. g., [mean ± SEM] 263 ± 53 to 490 ± 82 ml for saline solution and the 200 -mg dose, respectively, p < 0. 01) and sodium content (14 ± 4 to 37 ± 11 mmol, p < 0. 001) in the 1 st 4 h after dosing. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide increased (140 ± 26 to 279 ± 37 pg/ml, p < 0. 01), whereas aldosterone decreased (178 ± 41 to 125 ± 35 pg/ml, p < 0. 01), and renin activity was unchanged (10 ± 2 to 12 ± 3 ng/ml per h). Conclusions. <b>Candoxatrilat</b> given acutely causes diuresis, even in patients with moderately severe heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the therapeutic potential of prolonged inhibition of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) degradation in patients with severe chronic heart failure. Methods and Resuts. The effects of repeated doses of the endopeptidase inhibitor <b>candoxatrilat</b> (150 mg i. v.) were examined over a 24 -hour period in patients with severe chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class E-IV). Plasma a-hANF(99 - 126) was elevated at baseline (235 ± 59 pg/ml), increased 2. 5 -fold at 2 hours after the first dose, and remained significantly elevated throughout the 24 -hour protocol. In contrast, pro-hANF(31 - 67) decreased from 3, 151 ± 616 to 2, 072 + 362 pg/ml (p<O. O 5). Cardiac index (CI) increased only transiently after the first dose of <b>candoxatrilat</b> (CI, 2. 11 ± 0. 2 to 2. 67 ± 0. 28 I/min/m 2, p <O. OS). Sodium excretion increased sixfold (p<O. OS) 2 hours after the first dose of <b>candoxatrilat</b> and remained significantly elevated throughout the protocol. Degree of natriuresis and diuresis in response to <b>candoxatrilat</b> was closely related to baseline cardiac output. Glomerular filtration rate and volume excretion did not change significantly. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure fell from 23 ± 3 to 18 ± 3 mm Hg (p< 0. 05) and remained below baseline throughout the 24 hours. Arterial pressure, heart rate, and total peripheral resistance did not change significantly during the 24 -hour period. Urinary cGMP excretion increased fivefold (p < 0. 05), whereas urinary ANF immunoreactivity and plasma cGMP levels remained unchanged. Excretion of prostacycli...|$|E
40|$|Enhanced natriuretic {{response}} to neutral endopeptidase inhibition {{in patients with}} moderate chronic renal failure. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has natriuretic, renin-suppressing and chronic hypotensive actions that may be utilized by inhibition of ANF degradation by neutral endopeptidase, E. C. 24. 11 (NEP). Three groups of 8 male patients [GFR 103 ± 8 (Normal), 64 ± 6 (Moderate CRF), and 16 ± 2 ml/min (Severe CRF) ] received 100 mg i. v. bolus of the NEP inhibitor <b>candoxatrilat</b> or placebo in random order in a double-blind crossover study. GFR (51 CR-EDTA), ERPF (125 I-hippuran), ANF (IRMA), urinary cGMP (RIA) and albumin (RIA) and sodium excretion and flow rate were measured hourly for two hours before and for seven hours after <b>candoxatrilat</b> administration. After <b>candoxatrilat</b> plasma ANF rose two- to threefold from baseline, and remained elevated for 5 N and 7 MS hours (P < 0. 01 NS, P < 0. 03 M) associated with an immediate rise in urine cGMP excretion from 23. 5 N, 25. 4 M and 10. 4 s nmol/hr (base) to 51. 7 N, 73. 8 M and 27. 5 s(peak) lasting 7 N,M,S hours P < 0. 0 lN,M,S). There was a marked natriuresis in all three groups, the cumulative sodium excretion at seven hours post-candoxatrilat being 104 N, 140 M, 102 s mmol (P < 0. 05 N,M,S). This was greatest in those with moderate CRF (moderate CRF vs. normal, P = 0. 036, moderate vs. severe CRF, P = 0. 01, normal vs. severe CRF, P = 0. 74). Following <b>candoxatrilat</b> there was a near doubling of the urine flow rate (P < 0. 01 N,S, P < 0. 02 M). Urine albumin excretion increased in patients with renal failure (P < 0. 01), {{but there was no}} change in GFR, ERPF or systemic blood pressure. We conclude that the marked natriuretic effects of acute NEP inhibition seen in normal subjects are enhanced in the presence of moderate CRF and sustained even in severe renal impairment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{objectives}} {{of the current study}} were to define {{for the first time the}} roles of the natriuretic peptide (NP) receptors and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in mediating and modulating the renal actions of Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP), a new therapeutic synthetic NP. BackgroundRecent reports have advanced the therapeutic potential of a newly described synthetic NP called DNP. Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide is a 38 -amino acid peptide recently isolated from the venom of Dendroaspis augusticeps (the green mamba snake). MethodsSynthetic DNP was administered intra-renally at 5 ng/kg/min to 11 normal anesthetized dogs, 5 of which received the NP receptor antagonist HS- 142 - 1 (3 mg/kg intravenous bolus) while the remaining 6 dogs received an infusion of the NEP inhibitor, <b>candoxatrilat</b> (8 and 80 μg/kg/min) (Pfizer, Sandwich United Kingdom). ResultsIntra-renal DNP resulted in marked natriuresis associated with increased urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate excretion (UcGMPV), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal blood flow (RBF) and decreased distal fractional sodium reabsorption (FNaR) compared with baseline. HS- 142 - 1 attenuated the natriuretic response to DNP, resulting in decreased UcGMPV, GFR, and RBF and increased distal FNaR. In contrast, low and high doses of NEP inhibitor did not potentiate the renal actions of DNP. ConclusionsWe report that the NP receptor blockade attenuated the renal actions of synthetic DNP and that the NEP inhibitor did not alter the renal response to DNP. This latter finding is a unique property of synthetic DNP, as distinguished from other known NPs, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent...|$|E
