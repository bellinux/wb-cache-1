The method optimization included the study of binary mobile phases of water and acetonitrile. The optimum separation was achieved at 40 degrees C, with acetonitrile:H(2) O 29 : 71 v/v used as mobile phase and a 3 ml/min flow-rate, which resulted in their separation in about 5 min. Two reported sample procedures were applied to feed and for animal feeding water samples prior to HPLC. Method validation was carried out according to the EU criteria established for quantitative screening methods. The results indicate that this method is highly specific, reproducible and accurate. The proposed method {{was found to be}} robust and unaffected by small variations in the extraction procedure and in HPLC conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this report}} was to {{describe}} duodenal obstruction caused by a rubber foreign body in a cow. Case Presentation The clinical, biochemical and ultrasonographic findings in a five-year-old Swiss Braunvieh cow with duodenal ileus caused by a <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> nipple are described. The main clinical signs were anorexia, ruminal tympany, decreased faecal output and abomasal reflux syndrome. Ultrasonographic examination revealed reticular hyperactivity and a dilated duodenum. A diagnosis of duodenal ileus was made and the cow underwent right-flank laparotomy, which revealed a dilation of the cranial part of the duodenum because of obstruction by a pliable foreign body. This was identified via enterotomy as a <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> nipple. The cow was healthy {{at the time of}} discharge four days after surgery and went on to complete a successful lactation. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first description of duodenal obstruction by a <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> nipple.

The corresponding maximum levels have been recently introduced by European legislation. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by centrifugation and filtration of the supernatants for all matrices. For <b>calf</b> <b>feed</b> an additional de-fattening step of the filtrated supernatants with n-hexane was necessary. The resulting supernatants were submitted to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified by a modified approach of the standard additions technique applied to the extracts, hence allowing a workload comparable to matrix-matched standard calibration curves. A further simplification of this technique was reached by applying the same addition levels of the target analytes for different concentration ranging from 0. 5 × maximum level up to 2. 5 × maximum level (universal approach). The concentration independent intermediate precision {{expressed in terms of}} relative standard deviation varied between 3 and 12 % (except for maduramicin ammonium alpha and semduramicin sodium up to 21 %) and the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 111 %, depending on the target analyte and matrix.

40|$|Planning for {{the next}} {{generation}} in UK dairy herds A. Jennings As dairy farmers see their margins eroded further by the currently tumbling milk price, it becomes harder to plan for and invest in the future. Youngstock may be the first to suffer from such austerity because any investments made will not be seen for another three years, as cows are not thought to turn a profit until their second lactation. However, the future of all dairy herds rests on rearing healthy, productive and long-lived heifer replacements. It is widely understood that early life experience has long lasting and even intergenerational effects on health; the Dutch Famine Cohort study (www. dutchfamine. nl/index_files/study. htm) offered a grizzly but elegant human example. Back on the dairy farm, it has been demonstrated that management during the neonatal period and early life is crucial to the future success of dairy heifers. The risk of respiratory disease {{has been shown to be}} increased in calves with low levels of maternally derived immunoglobulins (Windeyer and others 2014), and a substantial 32 per cent of mortality in the first 16 weeks of life can be attributed to failure of passive transfer (Tyler and others 1999). Another less dramatic and more insidious effect of poor absorption of colostrum is lower growth rates to three months of age (Windeyer and others 2014). With good evidence available for the benefits of calving heifers at 24 months of age (Wathes and others 2008), this loss of growth will have hangover effects when selecting heifers for service. Apart from the impact that these losses have on individual farms, the livestock industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its impacts on the environment and to limit its contribution to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistant}} (AMR) {{bacteria are}} increasing threats for human and veterinary medicine. Faecal Escherichia coli (E. coli) from preweaned dairy calves is often resistant to multiple antimicrobials and calves may therefore serve as reservoirs for these bacteria and their resistance genes. This thesis investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and spread of resistant E. coli on Swedish dairy farms, with {{special emphasis on}} quinolone resistant E. coli (QREC). Faecal samples from preweaned calves and post-partum cows were analysed for resistant E. coli and set in relation to potential risk factors. The farm environment was sampled to study the occurrence and spread of QREC. The occurrence of faecal resistant E. coli in calves was strongly age-dependent, but was also associated with herd size, milking system, calf housing, and geographic location of the farm. Treatment with some broad-spectrum antimicrobials in cows or calves increased the occurrence of resistant E. coli in calves. Feeding waste milk (WM) from cows treated with antimicrobials during lactation to calves increased the proportion of streptomycin and quinolone resistant E. coli in calves, but feeding waste colostrum from cows treated with antimicrobials at drying off {{had no effect on}} AMR E. coli. Feeding such colostrum or milk to calves was a common practice on Swedish dairy farms, in particular on farms in southern Sweden, on non-organic farms, and on farms with tie stall housing. On farms where QREC is common in faeces of calves, these bacteria were also widespread in the farm environment. In particular, the <b>calf</b> <b>feed</b> andwater trough contained QREC. The same QREC genotype was found throughout the same and on different farms, suggesting contagious spread of QREC within and between farms. Fluoroquinolone treatment, WM feeding, group calving, poor farm hygiene, purchasing cattle or shared animal transports were some risk factors for increasing the occurrence of QREC on the farm. Altogether, the results indicate that proper biosecurity and improved hygiene, less exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and restrictive waste milk feeding may be important factors to reduce the burden of AMR E. coli on dairy farms...|$|E
40|$|During the mid 1990 s a {{potentially}} serious, chronic syndrome {{was reported in}} well-managed beef and dairy herds from unrelated parts of South Africa. Farmers reported that it manifested as various combinations of decreased production, decreased weaning masses, apparent immune breakdown in previously immunocompetent animals, increased reproductive disorders, various mineral imbalances in non-deficient areas and goitre, noticeable as enlarged thyroid glands. The farmers associated this syndrome with certain batches of sugar cane molasses and molasses-based products. The syndrome was reminiscent of an “endocrine disruptive syndrome”. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the suspected endocrine disruptive effect of molasses included in cattle feed. Using existing in vitro assays, four batches of molasses syrup were screened for possible inclusion in a <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> trial. Two batches were selected for the trial.

Thirty-six 4 -month-old Holstein steer calves were housed in groups of six with each group randomly assigned to either transport (T) or control (C) treatments. The T calves were hauled for 6 h in a 7. 3 m x 2. 4 m goose-neck trailer, at an average density of 0. 87 m 2 /calf, every 7 d for five consecutive weeks. Individual daily intake was determined using Calan gate feeders. Blood samples were obtained in the trailer or home pen via jugular venipuncture before loading, and after 2, 4, and 6 h of transport. Samples were analyzed for CORT, serotonin, tryptophan, and the gene expression of interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2, interleukin- 12, toll-like receptor- 4, toll-like receptor- 2, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor 2 A in leukocytes. Behavior was recorded for transported calves at 5 -min intervals for 1 h after return to their home pens. The C calves had a higher feed intake than T calves overall (P = 0. 01), on the day of transport (P = 0. 007), and the day after transport (P = 0. 02). Pre-transport CORT concentrations did not differ by treatment (P = 0. 77) or trial (P = 0. 32). However, the T calves had higher response CORT concentrations than C calves during Transport 3 (P = 0. 006), Transport 4 (P = 0. 001) and Transport 5 (P = 0. 02).

40|$|Summary of thesis entitled: “Food for Rumination – Developing novel feeding {{strategies}} {{to improve the}} welfare of veal calves”, Laura Webb Veal calves are typically fed high levels of milk replacer supplemented with solid feed, which tends to contain a relatively small roughage component. Feeding strategies used in veal production {{have been associated with}} welfare issues, including the development of abnormal oral behaviours (AOB) and poor gastrointestinal health. AOB include tongue playing, excessive oral manipulation of the environment, grazing of the coat of other calves, and sham chewing, and are thought to develop in calves when chewing activity (i. e. eating and rumination) is not adequately stimulated. Common gastrointestinal health issues include poor rumen development and lesions in the abomasum. The aim of this thesis was to develop novel feeding {{strategies to}} improve the welfare of veal calves, i. e. to minimise the development of AOB and gastrointestinal health disorders as well as maximise chewing activity. The EU legislation stipulates a minimum of 250 g of `fibrous feed&# 39; for 20 week-old calves, but this amount does not seem supported by previous research in terms of it optimising calf welfare. In addition, it does not specify what fibrous feed refers to in terms of source and particle length of roughage. Developing novel feeding strategies for calves necessitates {{a better understanding of how}} different roughage characteristics might affect behaviour and gastrointestinal health, and this is what was investigated in Chapter 2. Because none of the single roughage sources investigated were able to improve both behaviour and health, it is likely that a combination of roughage sources would be optimal. For example, an appropriate diet choice may include a combination of roughage sources that facilitate good ruminal papillae development (e. g. maize silage), minimise plaque formation, and encourage both rumen muscularisation and rumination (e. g. straw). This chapter also suggested that hay, as a roughage source with both high levels of structure and high levels of fermentable fibre, could achieve both objectives of encouraging rumination and rumen development. Hay, however, is not used in veal production due to its high iron content that would lead to darker meat colour, which is less preferred by consumers. In Chapter 3, different amounts of a solid feed mixture were fed to calves and behaviour was monitored. The results showed that calves fed no solid feed on top of their milk replacer still displayed a rumination-like behaviour, which was in previous literature referred to as `sham chewing&# 39;. This result gives an indication as to the importance of rumination in calves. Moreover, this chapter failed to find a straightforward linear relationship between amount of solid feed provided and level of AOB displayed. Certain amounts of solid feed were found to initially stimulate chewing activity to a high level, but later, as calves grew older and more experienced with roughage, failed to stimulate chewing above the level displayed by calves fed no solid feed. Providing such an amount of roughage seemed to be more detrimental in terms of behaviour than providing an amount that results in a constant level of chewing activity throughout the fattening period. In order to develop animal-friendly feeding strategies, it is important to know what the animals would choose when given free choice. Therefore, in Chapter 4, the feed preferences of calves for milk replacer, concentrate, hay, straw and maize silage were investigated. This study showed that at 6 months, calves selected on average approximately 1250 g dry matter (DM) milk replacer, 1000 g DM roughage and 2000 g DM concentrate. Although all calves with free choice showed high levels of chewing activity and subsequently low levels of AOB, large individual differences existed in intake levels and feed preferences. Moreover, outcomes were dependent on the variable used to assess preferences: i. e. intake (in g DM relative to metabolic body weight), duration of feeding, or number of visits to each diet component. On average, however, calves showed a preference for milk replacer, concentrate and hay, over straw and maize silage. In contrast to free choice testing, as was used in Chapter 4, double demand operant conditioning gives an indication as to the strength of a preference. In Chapter 5, different methods to analyse data collected from double demand operant conditioning studies were investigated. Due to the dependence level between the two resources presented simultaneously, i. e. at any given time the test animal can only work for one resource, it would seem that proportions of rewards achieved for one resource over the total number of rewards achieved for both resources would be an adequate dependent variable in this type of analysis. In Chapter 6 the statistical method developed in Chapter 5 was used to assess the preference of calves for long and chopped hay and straw, and their preference for hay versus straw. Two to five month-old calves learned the double demand operant task and were motivated to work for roughage on top of a high energy diet of milk replacer and concentrate. They showed a preference for long over chopped hay, but not for long over chopped straw, and showed a strong preference for hay over straw.  In Chapter 7 it was investigated whether temperament might affect learning of a double demand operant task in calves. Studies in horses and voles previously found that certain individuals seemed unable to learn certain tasks. If one could find out why, individual training programs could be designed and non-learners would not be removed from studies, potentially avoiding biases in data due to only certain temperament profiles making it through the learning criteria. Chapter 7 gave some indication that temperament may affect learning in calves, and it is the first study in calves to do so. However, due to the low number of animals used, further research is necessary to confirm which temperamental traits affect learning ability in calves. Relationships between tongue playing and: 1) hypothesised measures of chronic stress, and 2) hypothesised temperamental traits were investigated in Chapter 8. Large individual differences in the performance of tongue playing in calves subjected to similar husbandry conditions were found. This suggests that although tongue playing might well be a warning sign for chronic stress, and hence poor welfare, individual variation in the propensity to tongue play in response to stressful conditions exists. This could be due to differences in temperament. In contrast to what theoretical papers suggest, calves that showed more tongue playing showed characteristics of a reactive coping style. This result is, however, consistent with previous experimental papers on calves and other species. Results from Chapters 2 to 8 were combined into the design of the experiment described in Chapter 9. In this chapter, various feeding strategies (i. e. different amounts of solid feed combined with different concentrate to roughage ratios, different types of ad libitum choice diets, and feeding milk replacer via an open bucket or automated milk dispenser[AMD]) were applied and the effect on behaviour was recorded. Rumination was mainly affected by roughage provision, regardless of concentrate provision. Therefore, increasing solid feed provision without increasing the roughage content would most likely have little effect on rumination, although it would probably increase eating time to a certain extent. Because of the timing of tongue playing and oral manipulation of the environment (found in both Chapters 3 and 9), we suggest that the first of these two AOB is related to chewing activity in general, whereas the second may be more related to anticipation of an upcoming meal and positive reinforcement of feeding behaviours following an unsatisfactory meal. Calves provided ad libitum access to long straw in racks showed high levels of chewing activity and low levels of AOB relative to calves that did not have access to a straw rack but otherwise received the same diet. Six-month-old calves with ad libitum access to straw, maize silage and concentrate (but a restricted milk replacer allowance of 1050 g DM/d) consumed on average approximately 900 g DM/d roughage and 2300 g DM concentrate at 6 months of age. Feeding milk replacer via an AMD seemed to have little impact on behaviour, although it led to lower levels of tongue playing at 15 wk relative to bucket-fed calves. In Chapter 10, I first reflect on possible underlying mechanisms of AOB and on the best methods to assess animal preferences. AOB seem to develop in veal calves due to a number of factors, starting with the thwarting of chewing activity, of which rumination at least is most likely a behavioural need. Other factors involved in the development of AOB include chronic stress resulting from the thwarting of chewing activity, anticipation of an upcoming meal, and positive reinforcement of feeding behaviours following a meal that was unsatisfactory. Of great importance is the understanding of individual variation in the propensity to develop AOB, because stereotypic behaviours in sub-optimal environments have been linked to improvements in welfare (relative to non-stereotyping animals). Ruminants seem to be able to select a diet that maximises their comfort. Developing feeding strategies to improve veal calf welfare, therefore, requires the assessment of <b>calf</b> <b>feed</b> preferences. Choice tests and cross point analysis of double demand functions are two possible methods for the assessment of animal preferences, and both these methods include drawbacks and benefits. In contrast to choice tests, double demand offers a setting that closer mimics the complexity of natural environments by imposing a cost on access to resources and enables quantification of the strength of preferences. However, this procedure requires appropriate statistical methods, which take into account the dependence structure between the two simultaneously available resources. Finally, practical implications of the research presented in this thesis are described in Chapter 10. The development of novel feeding strategies to improve the welfare of veal calves is challenged by individual differences in feed preferences, chewing efficiency, and behavioural response to chronic stress caused by inadequate feeding. The latter is demonstrated by only certain calves developing AOB when chewing activity is not stimulated enough by the feeding strategy, whilst others do not develop such behaviours. This complicates the evaluation of the effects of feeding strategy on veal calf behaviour. However, based on the results of this thesis and previous research it seems that young calves should first receive a diet that optimises rumen development, before receiving coarser roughages that stimulate chewing activity, rumen muscularisation, and minimise plaque and hairball prevalence in the rumen. Adequate amounts of roughage and concentrate at 6 months of age seem to be 1000 and 2000 - 3000 g DM, based on voluntary intake.  ...|$|E

40|$|Individual {{animal feed}} {{efficiency}} {{plays a key}} role in the profitability and sustainability of the US beef industry. During the growing and finishing phase of production, a 10 % improvement in feed efficiency has a two-fold greater impact on profit than a 10 % increase in rate of gain (Fox et al., 2001). The traits that beef producers routinely record are outputs which determine the value of product sold and not the inputs defining the cost of beef production. The inability to routinely measure feed intake and feed efficiency on large numbers of cattle has precluded the efficient application of selection despite moderate heritabilities (h 2 = 0. 16 - 0. 46; Archer et al., 1999). <b>Feed</b> costs in <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> and yearling finishing systems account for approximately 66 % and 77 % of costs, respectively (Anderson et al., 2005). Feed costs account for approximately 65 % of total beef production costs. Of the metabolizable energy required from conception to consumption of a beef animal, 72 % is utilized during the cow-calf segment of production while 28 % of calories are utilized in the calf growing and finishing phases of production (Ferrell and Jenkins, 1982).

The addition of direct-fed microbials (DFM) to cow diets has been theorized to improve feed efficiency and milk production, with studies showing mixed results. However, few experiments have studied the effect of feeding DFM on colostrum quality. In this experiment two treatments were given, 1) DFM and 2) DFM and enzymes (DFME). Colostrum was analyzed to determine if yield, composition, and immunoglobulin (IgG and IgA) concentration were affected. Calf serum IgG and IgA concentrations were analyzed to determine if 24 h concentrations and apparent efficiency of absorption (AEA) were affected. There were no differences with regard to yield or IgA concentration. The percent of ash showed a positive trend, indicating a higher percentage with the treatments (P = 0. 067). The treatments had no effect on the additional components analyzed. The results for the IgG concentration were not significant although an increase was observed from 79. 1 mg/mL in the control to 91. 1 mg/mL in the DFME treatment. Neither treatment had an effect on calf immunoglobulin concentration or AEA.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (i) to characterise clinical health in dairy calves on an Irish research farm during the artificial calf-rearing period and (ii) to determine whether calves’ pre-weaning intakes and feeding behaviour, recorded by electronic calf feeders, changes in response to incidents of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Holstein-Friesian (H-F) and Jersey (J) calves were fed by automatic milk replacer (MR) and concentrate feeders. Feeding behaviour, including MR consumption, drinking speed, number of rewarded and unrewarded visits to the feeder as well as concentrate consumption, was recorded by the feeders. A modified version of the Wisconsin calf health scoring criteria chart was used to score calves’ clinical measurements and identify incidences of BRD. Thus, 40 % of calves were found to have at least one incident of BRD. Feeding behaviour was altered during incidents of BRD. The number of unrewarded visits to the feeder was reduced, by approximately four visits, for calves with BRD during the 3 d prior to the identification of BRD (P < 0. 05) and tended to be reduced during the 7 d following the identification of BRD (P = 0. 05), compared with healthy calves. Additionally, calves with BRD had a tendency for reduced net energy intake (approximately 8 %) during the 3 d prior to the identification of BRD, compared with healthy calves. Therefore, <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> behavioural data, recorded by electronic feeders during the pre-weaning period, can indicate cases of BRD. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the suspected endocrine disruptive effect of molasses included in cattle feed. During the mid 1990 's a potentially serious, chronic syndrome was reported in well-managed beef and dairy herds from unrelated parts of South Africa. Farmers reported that it manifested as various combinations of seriously decreased production, increased reproductive disorders, apparent immune incompetence in previously immune competent animals, various mineral imbalances in non¬deficient areas and goitre, perceptible by enlarged thyroids. Farmers related this syndrome to certain batches of sugarcane molasses and molasses¬based products. Their opinion was based on observations that dramatic improvements in health and productivity often followed the withdrawal of the molasses component of the diet. The syndrome had all the characteristics of an "endocrine disruptive syndrome". Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are exogenous substances that have the potential to alter the functions of the endocrine system and consequently cause ill health. The EDCs comprise a diverse group of compounds that are widely used in detergents, in the paint and plastics industries and as wetting agents in agricultural remedies. Contamination of molasses with these compounds could occur as a result of uptake of chemicals by growing sugarcane or by the use of contaminated river water in the extraction of sugar from chopped sugarcane. It was essential to investigate the safety of molasses, currently available as stock feed in South Africa and the rest of the world, to allay any fears created by the farmers. Four batches of molasses previously collected from four different sugar mills located in different parts of the country were screened for potential endocrine disruptive activity, including oestrogen and thyroid activity and immune suppression. Two batches of molasses were selected to be used in a <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> trial. Thirty-two, 4 to 6 week-old Holstein bull calves of approximately the same weight, and supplied by the same rearing facility, were included in a single phase, three treatment, parallel design experiment. Calves from the three experimental groups were housed in the same facilities, under the same conditions and fed diets with similar composition. Two of the groups had molasses (Umzimkulu and Komatipoort) included in their rations and the control group was fed a ration where no molasses was added, but fermentable sugars and minerals were included. The weight gain of the calves was recorded over a six-month study period. Regular clinical examinations were conducted and clinical pathology parameters, immune responses and endocrine effects were evaluated. Even though endocrine disrupting effects were detected in in vitro screening tests, these could not be reproduced in calves under experimental conditions. The two batches of molasses utilized in the <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> trial did not induce major differences in any of the parameters measured, except a lower weight gain in the Umzimkulu molasses fed group which tended towards significance. It appears improbable that these two batches of molasses had any endocrine disruptive or immunosuppressive effects. Therefore, these two batches of molasses per se were not deleterious when fed to calves. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Sciences)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|The use of {{substitutes}} for milk in {{the raising of}} calves is always {{of interest to the}} progressive dairyman, since {{there are a number of}} circumstances in which it is advantageous to reduce the milk feeding period. Producers of market milk often desire to raise their calves on as little milk as possible in order to have more milk available for market. When the demand for milk is good, dairymen who usually market cream only may prefer to sell milk and raise their calves on starters or other milk substitutes. Dairy farmers may wish to use the skim milk generally allowed the calves to replace a part of the protein concentrates used in swine and poultry production when these feeds become scarce or too high in price. In times of labor shortage, dairymen are especially interested in labor-saving methods, and usually methods which substitute dry feeds for liquid milk result in a saving of labor. When there is a scarcity of milk for human food, it may be desirable to raise dairy calves with as little milk as is practicable. Therefore, while there is normally an interest in methods of raising calves on limited amounts of milk, this interest often becomes acute in time of war scarcities. As a result of renewed interest in milk {{substitutes for}} <b>calf</b> <b>feeding,</b> this study was instigated [...] to determine the value of dried whey as a means of saving milk in the raising of calves, to demonstrate that calves can be raised with a limited amount of labor, and to find an additional use for whey, much of which is wasted annually...|$|R

Automated feeding systems are growing in popularity for dairy farms in America, but {{little is known}} about how these systems are managed. This study investigated the usage of automated feeders, and the implications of management practices for calf morbidity and mortality. Barn design, environmental and management factors were determined on 38 farms in the upper Midwest USA through a combination of questionnaire and on-farm measurements. These measurements were used to describe the current management practices of farms, identify risk factors for adverse calf health outcomes and calf mortality, and to determine best practices for the use of automated feeders. Among factors measured, those associated with early life procedures (colostrum management, navel disinfection), grouping strategies (age of calves at grouping, stocking density, group size, and age difference between the oldest and youngest animals in the group), feeding management (peak milk allowance, days to reach peak milk allowance), milk contamination (bacterial counts in the liquid diet exceeding recommended levels), and seasonal climatic variation were significantly associated with calf health outcomes. Overall, the outcomes observed in this study indicate that automated <b>calf</b> <b>feeding</b> systems can be effectively managed to provide high quality care for preweaned animals, while more consistency is needed in colostrum management and automated feeder cleaning and maintenance. More research is needed to investigate the causal relationships between factors identified in this work with calf health outcomes, particularly focused on encouraging good postnatal practices, calf grouping strategies, bacterial contamination of the feeder unit and of milk delivered to calves, and strategies for the mitigation of calf health issues resulting from seasonal environmental change...|$|R
