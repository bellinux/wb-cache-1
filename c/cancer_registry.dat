40|$|Abstract Background. The {{availability}} of quality assured, population-based <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> and biobanks with high quality samples {{makes it possible}} to conduct research on large samples sets with long follow-up within a reasonable time frame. Defined quality for both <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> and biobanks is essential for enabling high quality biobank-based research. Recent networking projects have brought these infrastructures together to promote the combined use of <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> and biobanks in cancer research. Materials and methods. In this report we review the current status and future perspectives of <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> and biobanks and how the interface between them should be developed to optimally further cancer research. Results and discussion. Major conclusions for future improvements are that the research exploiting <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> and biobanks, and the research that is building and optimising the infrastructure, should evolve together for maximally relevant progress. Population-based and sustainable biobanks that continuously and consecutively store all samples ("Biological registries") under strict quality control are needed. There is also a need for increased education, information and visibility of the interdisciplinary sciences required for optimal exploitation of these resources...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{despite his}} paper being widely {{reported}} by the media, an undermining error, according to teams of other epidemiologists who point out Tsuda's remarks are fatally wrong, is that Tsuda did an apples and oranges comparison by comparing the Fukushima surveys, which uses advanced ultrasound devices that detect otherwise unnoticeable thyroid growths, with data from traditional non-advanced clinical examinations, to arrive at his [...] "20 to 50 times what would be expected" [...] conclusion. In the critical words of epidemiologist Richard Wakeford, “It is inappropriate to compare {{the data from the}} Fukushima screening program with <b>cancer</b> <b>registry</b> data from the rest of Japan where there is, in general, no such large-scale screening,”. Wakeford's criticism was one of seven other author's letters that were published criticizing Tsuda's paper.

2500|$|John Gofman {{used his}} own, non-peer {{reviewed}} low-level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. A peer-reviewed research article by Dr. Steven Wing {{found a significant}} increase in cancers from 1979–1985 among people who lived within ten miles of TMI; in 2009 Dr. Wing stated that radiation releases during the accident were probably [...] "thousands of times greater" [...] than the NRC's estimates. A retrospective study of Pennsylvania <b>Cancer</b> <b>Registry</b> found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high-risk age groups but did not draw a causal link with these incidences and to the accident. The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically non-significant, increased cancer risks within the TMI population, such as a non-significant excess leukemia among males being observed. The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of problems in dose estimates {{due to a lack of}} accurate data, as well as illness classifications.|$|E

The ENCR-JRC project "Incidence and Mortality in Europe" ([URL] index. php/activities/encr-jrc-project) is finalised to create a standardised and comparable database for monitoring cancer incidence and mortality and provide regular information on the burden of cancer in Europe. The description, format, type of files and variables of the call are detailed in the submission guidelines, available both in the ENCR-JRC portal ([URL] and in the ENCR website at the following address: [URL] The reliability and utility of the in¬formation provided by <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> depends {{on the quality of}} the data collected; to this purpose, the ENCR, in cooperation with the JRC, set up a Working Group involving the main stakeholders in cancer data domain in order to establish a comprehensive and standardised list of data quality checks to be adopted by European <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> and European projects. The outcome of the Working Group was a proposal on one common procedure for data quality checks among the European <b>cancer</b> <b>registries,</b> reaching final agreements on case definition, variables to be collected and their format, and internal consistency rules; the final outcome of the project was an ENCR-endorsed recommendations document to serve as guidelines during the data acquisition procedure. Moreover, in order to enable <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> to perform data quality checks on their own and test the adherence of their data to the format required by the ENCR-JRC call for data, the JRC has developed a software respecting the rules codified in the above-mentioned guidelines. This software represents a first step in the process of providing <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> with a user friendly data-checking and quality control tool, and aims to standardize the procedures to be followed by European <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> when submitting data in order to improve their quality and comparability. The present version of the JRC – ENCR <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> data quality check software includes •	checks on the data files format (for incidence, mortality, lifetables and population) and on variables names and order according to the data call protocol •	verification of variables values •	cross checks among variables, internal consistency The software is distributed to <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> together with this manual.

40|$|AbstractProposals {{to improve}} implementation, {{monitoring}} and evaluation of breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening programmes have been developed in a European project involving scientists and professionals experienced in cancer registration (EUROCOURSE). They call for a clear and more active role for <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> through better interfaces with cancer screening programmes and adapting data contents of <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> for evaluation purposes. <b>Cancer</b> <b>registries</b> are recognised as essential for adequate evaluation of cancer screening programmes, {{but they are not}} involved in screening evaluation in several European countries. This is a key barrier to improving the effectiveness of programmes across Europe. The variation in Europe in the implementation of cancer screening offers a unique opportunity to learn from best practices in collaboration between <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> and screening programmes. Population-based <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> have experience and tools in collecting and analysing relevant data, e. g. for diagnostic and therapeutic determinants of mortality. In order to accelerate improvements in cancer control we argue that <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> should take co-responsibility in promoting effective screening evaluation in Europe. Additional investments are vital to further development of infrastructures and activities for screening evaluation and monitoring in the national settings and also at the pan-European level. The EUROCOURSE project also aimed to harmonise implementation of the European quality assurance guidelines for cancer screening programmes across Europe through standardising routine data collection and analysis, and definitions for key performance indicators for screening registers. Data linkage between cancer and screening registers and other repositories of demographic data and cause of death and where available clinical registers is key to implementing the European screening standards and thereby reducing the burden of disease through early detection. Greater engagement of <b>cancer</b> <b>registries</b> in this collaborative effort is also essential to develop adequate evaluation of innovations in cancer prevention and care...|$|R
