50|$|Studies in 2004 had {{indicated}} that <b>clobutinol</b> {{has the potential}} to prolong the QT interval.Clobutinol was in 2007 determined to cause cardiac arrhythmia in some patients.|$|E
40|$|QT prolongation, {{a classic}} {{risk factor for}} arrhythmias, can result from a {{mutation}} {{in one of the}} genes governing cardiac repolarization and also can result from the intake of a medication acting as blocker of the cardiac K(+) channel human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG). Here, we identified the arrhythmogenic potential of a nonopioid antitussive drug, <b>clobutinol.</b> The deleterious effects of <b>clobutinol</b> were suspected when a young boy, with a diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome, experienced arrhythmias while being treated with this drug. Using the patch-clamp technique, we showed that <b>clobutinol</b> dose-dependently inhibited the HERG K(+) current with a half-maximum block concentration of 2. 9 microM. In the proband, we identified a novel A 561 P HERG mutation. Two others long QT mutations (A 561 V and A 561 T) had been reported previously at the same position. None of the three mutants led to a sizeable current in heterologous expression system. When coexpressed with wild-type (WT) HERG channels, the three Ala 561 mutants reduced the trafficking of WT and mutant heteromeric channels, resulting in decreased K(+) current amplitude (dominant-negative effects). In addition, A 561 P but not A 561 V and A 561 T mutants induced a approximately - 11 mV shift of the current activation curve and accelerated deactivation, thereby partially counteracting the dominant-negative effects. A 561 P mutation and <b>clobutinol</b> effects on the human ventricular action potential characteristics were simulated using the Priebe-Beuckelmann model. Our work shows that <b>clobutinol</b> has limited effects on WT action potential but should be classified as a "drug to be avoided by congenital long QT patients" rather than as a "drug with risk of torsades de pointes...|$|E
40|$|Anaphylaxis is {{traditionally}} diagnosed and {{treated as an}} acute emergency but should be always followed by a search for specific triggers, resulting in avoidance strategies. This case report highlights the relevance of a detailed evaluation after anaphylaxis for diagnosis of a rare but potentially life-threatening allergy. Considering the high frequency of <b>clobutinol</b> application, IgE-mediated allergic hypersensitivity seems extremely rare {{and has to be}} distinguished from infection-associated urticaria and angioedema as well as non-specific summation effects. Accidental re-exposure has to be strictly avoided and therefore after identification of <b>clobutinol</b> as the anaphylaxis trigger, the patient received detailed allergy documents including international non-pro-prietary and trade names of the culprit drug. ...|$|E
40|$|We could {{determine}} carbetapentane, <b>clobutinol</b> and oxeladin, tertiary amino antitussives, with extremely high sensitivity by gas chromatography with surface ionization detection (GC-SID). The calibration curves showed satisfactory linearity {{in the range}} of 50 - 800 pg on column and the detection limit was about 30 pg on column (1. 5 ng/ml). Solid extraction method with Sep-pak C 18 cartridges was useful for purification of these antitussives from body fluids. We also quantitated oxeladin in whole blood and urine of a healthy volunteer 3 h after the administration; the concentrations were 12. 7 ng/ml in the whole blood and 72. 8 ng/ml in the urine. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine, and anti-cough drugs <b>Clobutinol,</b> Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine were studied and {{determined}} {{with the use}} of HPLC-reverse-phase. Initially, the chromatographic behaviour of each was determined in relation to certain parameters which change chromatographic conditions and influence duration of analysis, separation capability of determinated systems and measurement sensitivity. Specifically, the effect of polarity on the retention time of the solvent was studied. For mobile phase preparation, selected solvents were methanol and acetonitrile which were prepared in aqueous solution of various concentrations. It was observed that increased concentrations of mobile phase in organic solvents with little polarity resulted in increased solubility of the said mobile phase and, consequently a reduction in the required time for analysis of the analytes. Improvement in time required for analysis of these drugs and symmetry of chromatographic peaks was accomplished after exploring effects various salts (added in aqueous form) had on each mobile phase. Especially trialed were various types of regulating aqueous solutions of base salts CH 3 COONH 4, CH 3 COONa, CH 3 COOK and CH 3 COOMg, from which CH 3 COONH 4 was selected as being most suitable for the cases of anti-congestion drugs Ambroxol and Bromhexine. The latter improved chromatographic peak symmetry and quite perceptively reduced the retention time of the analytes in question. For anti-cough <b>Clobutinol,</b> Butamyrate and Pentoxyverine, mobile liquid phases were studied which contained CH 3 COONH 4, tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulphate or tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate. It became evident that retention time co-efficients of anti-cough pharmaceuticals are influenced to a great degree by the concentration and the type of salt. It was observed that additions in mobile phase of smaller size ions such {{as in the case of}} tetraethylammonium hydrogen sulphate and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate had as a result k’ co-efficient reductions, evidently due to its smaller ion solvency compared to that of the tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate ions. ...|$|E
40|$|A new, simple, fast, {{reproducible}} {{and sensitive}} reversed phase HPLC method, {{using a new}} stationary phase containing embedded urea polar groups, has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of <b>clobutinol</b> hydrochloride (CLO) and doxylamine succinate (DOX) in syrups. The determination was carried out on a C 8 urea column (125 mm x 3. 9 mm i. d., 5 µm particle size) synthetized at the Liquid Chomatography Laboratory (LabCrom) of the Chemistry Institute of Unicamp. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile:methanol:phosphate buffer (pH 2. 5) in the gradient mode. The diode array detector (DAD) was operated at 230 nm for CLO and 262 nm for DOX. The method showed adequate precision, with relative standard deviations (RSD) less than 1 %. The presence of the excipients did not interfere in {{the results of the}} analysis. Accuracy was determined by adding standards of the drugs to a placebo and good recovery values were obtained. The analytical curves were linear (r² 0. 9999 for CLO and 0. 9998 for DOX) over a wide concentration range (2. 4 - 336 µg mL- 1 for CLO and 2. 3 - 63 µg mL- 1 for DOX). The solutions were stable for at least 72 hours at room temperature. The criteria for validation using the ICH guidelines were fulfilled...|$|E
