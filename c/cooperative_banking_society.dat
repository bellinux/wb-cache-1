This paper empirically {{analyzes the}} role of <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> in financial stability. Contrary to some suggestions in the literature, we find that <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks</b> are more stable than commercial banks. This finding {{is due to the}} lower volatility of the cooperative banks'' returns, which more than offsets their lower profitability and capitalization. This is most likely due to cooperative banks'' ability to use customer surplus as a cushion in weaker periods. We also find that in systems with a high presence of <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks,</b> weak commercial banks are less stable than they would be otherwise.
