2500|$|The [...] Cosworth-tuned {{engine is}} heavily {{modified}} from the stock 2.3 litre Duratec. The cylinder head, block, crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons are upgraded by Cosworth. Cosworth also integrates an advanced dry-sump {{with an extra}} internal scavenge pump to distribute the oil. While a dry-sump system requires more oil (more weight), a dry-sump will keep the engine lubricated under hard cornering unlike a wet-sump system. Cosworth also radicalizes the <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> and upgrades the exhaust system. This may cause the engine to run a little more [...] "rough" [...] at low RPMs, but it drastically increases performance. The inlet system is also replaced with an advanced, custom roller-barrel system. This increases airflow at full throttle compared to a butterfly inlet, boosting performance. The engine also has a custom chip designed by Cosworth for a further increase in performance.|$|E

A disc lug is connected to a back side of a valve disc and has a circular bore that receives and is larger than a cam of a <b>cam</b> <b>shaft.</b> The valve disc is rotatable for a quarter turn within the body about a lug axis that is offset from the shaft axis. Actuating the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> in the closing rotational direction first causes the camming side of the cam of the <b>cam</b> <b>shaft</b> to rotate the disc lug and the valve disc a quarter turn from the open position to the closed position.

5000|$|The final {{incarnation}} of the 128 SOHC engine was modified to utilise 16 valves and dual <b>cam</b> <b>shafts.</b> The engine (using the designation [...] "Torque") featured the bore-spacing, bore and stroke of the 1580 cc 159/160 series engine with a new 16 valve DOHC cylinder-head. To incorporate the extra oil-return-paths and symmetrical head (as opposed to the asymmetrical SOHC head) the cylinder-block was slightly revised making the DOHC head non-interchangeable with the previous incarnations of the 128 engine. The [...] "Torque" [...] engine (178.B3 - 182.A4) powered the Brava/Bravo, Marea and Multipla Fiat automobiles {{as well as the}} second-generation Lancia Delta (never sold in the UK), finally ending production in 1999 for the European market.

50|$|Post INRC, most top drivers {{switched}} to the Maruti Gypsy for its off-road and Four-wheel drive capabilities. The highly modified Group A (II) IND category allowed tuners the flexibility to choose between {{a wide range of}} <b>cam</b> <b>shafts,</b> tuned exhausts and heavily modified cylinder heads. Till 1992, MRF was the principal choice of tyres for most Maruti Gypsys and twin Weber carburetors were the preferred choice for the fully modified class. For the 1994 season S. Karivardhan opted for computer programmable Electronic Fuel Injection for Hari Singh's Team JK Gypsy and they were dominant during that period, prompting N. Leelakrishnan to follow suit in EFI systems for his Rally cars. Alarmed at the high budgets and top speeds of the top runners, FMSCI for 1996 season finally outlawed the Group A (II) IND category and reverted to Group A (I) IND category which restricted engine modifications and the regular stock Group N category. The loud intake and screaming exhaust note with crackling backfire were missed by many rally fans.|$|E

50|$|The now popular “2D” was {{upgraded}} {{to keep up}} with the market. Yamaha added electronic ignition this year but retained the mechanical timing advancing unit. They also replaced the carburetors for Mikuni “Mark II” CV models. These offered easier maintenance and a “two position enricher” (Choke) as opposed to the single position on the “Mark I” model. The engine again had some improvements including <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> to boost the power of the engine. The rev limit was raised to 9000 rpm this year from 7500 which the electronic ignition had allowed. Later “E” models also had a viewing window for the engine oil added in place of the dipstick.This year also saw the introduction of the XS750 “SE”, Special or US custom model. With longer front forks and a teardrop shaped tank with shorter exhausts and seat it had a “Chopper” appearance in contrast to the tourer or now referred to as “Standard” XS750 “E”. The change of carburetors also meant a change of air box design and the air filter was now changed without lifting the seat.The XS750 also came with a stock fairing with full storage and aerodynamic enclosure of the rider. The fairing also introduced additional stability to the motorcycle by creating additional rake to the frame. This was a first for bikes of this time, especially those in the 2400 to 2700 dollar price range.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRapid {{prototyping}} is {{a technique}} used to quickly fabricate an assembly, components or parts using three-dimensional Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM). It is an additive layer manufacturing technology. Cam shaft is a component in which a set of cams becomes an integral part to a shaft placed in its respective positions and directions according to {{the application of the}} particular cam shaft. These <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> are used in many industries especially in automobile, aerospace and marine industries. They are used in the engines of any automotive. In the engines these <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> are used for operating the inlet valves and outlet valves. These <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> are to be precisely manufactured {{in order to avoid the}} timing errors in opening and closing of the ports. So these camshafts are mostly machined and manufactured by computer operated machine systems. In these systems the various process of machining are listed and arranged in a specific order and connected to a computer. So the raw material undergoes several processes in several machines during the manufacture and finally the cam shaft is obtained. The main advantage of this type of manufacturing is that more number of precise components is obtained. Rapid prototyping process is one of the newly emerging manufacturing processes that could be used to manufacture cam shaft precisely. Rapid prototyping uses the process additive manufacturing in which the molten raw material is added layer by layer. The major problem in the rapid prototyping process is inability to use metals. But there are somematerials that possess the properties of metals and also have the ability to be used in rapid prototyping process. The material which is best suited for camshaft manufacturing using rapid prototyping was poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Using this method of manufacturing process the space required and the cost required for manufacturing can be reduced. Performanceof the conventionally manufactured cam shaft and cam shaft manufactured by rapid prototyping can be compared and analysed...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{components}} such as <b>cam</b> <b>shafts</b> {{and ring}} gears often {{need to have}} a hard outer surface for wear resistance and a good internal toughness to resist deformation due to impact and loading. These two properties, however, are often mutually exclusive. Case hardening is one solution whereby carbon diffusion into steel results in hardened surface and near-surface layers. Wear resistance is improved while maintaining the bulk toughness of the component. As with many production processes, it is necessary to monitor the quality of the components being manufactured, with case hardening, it is the depth of treatment that is normally measured. Conventional case-depth measurements are destructive, time-consuming, and expensive. Although eddy-current techniques have been applied to the problem [1], the process is often cumbersome due to the need to use more than one frequency. In this paper we investigate how magnetic nondestructive measurement techniques can be used to form the basis of an NDE tool that can quickly and reliably determine case depth from surface measurements...|$|E

This report examines an approach to the analysis and design of functional shape interactions represented as motion constraints. In this approach, a graphical representation for motion constraints is used as the basis for visualizing and reasoning about the function derived from shape. This representation also serves as an environment for the interactive design of functional shapes. Specifically, we utilize the configuration space representation to make explicit the motion constraints imposed by the shapes of interacting objects.

It consisted of a 25. 5 cm circular saw blade, cam mechanism, bottom plate, electric motor (0. 75 kW) to operate saw blade and a motor (0. 37 kW). The cassava stems were fed manually into a feeding chute for free fall on to the bottom plate, and then these were cut by the circular saw operated by an electric motor.
