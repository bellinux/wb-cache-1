5|$|The Coronation Bandstand {{was built}} by the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge</b> in 1903, {{at a cost of}} £350, to {{celebrate}} the coronation of King Edward VII. The following year, a group of French Ursuline nuns, who were banned from teaching in France, fled with some of their pupils to Westgate-on-Sea and established the Ursuline Convent School, which in 1995 was re-established as Ursuline College. In 1910, a Swiss-Gothic styled town hall was built. However, it was soon decided that the building could be put to better use, and in 1912, it was transformed into the Town Hall Cinema. In 1932, it was renamed the Carlton Cinema.|$|E
5|$|The South Downs {{dominate}} Eastbourne and the Eastbourne Downland Estate can be {{seen from}} most of the town. These were originally chalk deposits laid down under the sea during the Late Cretaceous, and were later lifted by the same tectonic plate movements that formed the European Alps, during the middle Tertiary period. The chalk can be clearly seen along the eroded coastline {{to the west of the}} town, in the area known as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters, where continuous erosion keeps the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge</b> vertical and white. The chalk contains many fossils such as ammonites and nautilus. The town area is built on geologically recent alluvial drift, the result of the silting up of a bay. This changes to Weald clay around the Langney estate.|$|E

50|$|The exposed {{sandstone}} <b>cliff</b> <b>edges</b> so {{characteristic of}} {{the west side of}} North Fork Mountain support narrow zones of persistingly open, treeless habitat characterized by several unusual or regionally endemic plant species, including the silvery nailwort (Paronychia argyrocoma) and the white alumroot (Heuchera alba). Chestnut oak (Quercus montana) and Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens) are often found just back of the <b>cliff</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the spring, mature birds {{return to}} land, usually to the colony {{at which they}} were hatched. Birds that were removed as chicks and {{released}} elsewhere were found to show fidelity to their point of liberation. They congregate {{for a few days}} on the sea in small groups offshore before returning to the cliff top nesting sites. Each large puffin colony is subdivided into sub-colonies by physical boundaries such as stands of bracken or gorse. Early arrivals take control of the best locations, the most desirable nesting sites being the densely packed burrows on grassy slopes just above the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge</b> where take-off is most easily accomplished. The birds are usually monogamous, but this is the result of their fidelity to their nesting sites rather than to their mates and they often return to the same burrows year after year. Later arrivals at the colony may find that all the best nesting sites have already been taken and be pushed towards the periphery where they are in greater danger of predation. Younger birds may come ashore a month or more after the mature birds and find no remaining nesting sites. They will not breed till the following year although it has been found that if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these sub-adults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased.|$|E
5|$|Years go by as Scar squanders the kingdom's {{resources}} and allows his army of hyenas to wreak havoc upon the Pride Lands, which turn barren. Meanwhile, an alive and adult Simba is visited by Mufasa's ghost, who encourages {{him to return}} to the Pride Lands and take his rightful place as king. Aided by his friends Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba arrives at Pride Rock and witnesses Scar striking his mother Sarabi and confronts Scar, who demands that Simba admit to the pride that he killed Mufasa. As he prepares to throw Simba off Pride Rock and have him meet a similar fate to that of his father, Scar whispers that {{he was the one who}} killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba tackles Scar and forces his uncle to admit the truth to the pride, initiating a ferocious battle between the pride, Timon, Pumbaa, Zazu, Rafiki and Scar's hyenas. Scar tries to escape, but is cornered by Simba on the top of Pride Rock; Scar begs for mercy and even attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas, unaware that they are listening nearby. Simba ignores Scar and gives him one last chance to run away and never return. When Simba's back is turned, Scar attacks him and they fight. Simba bests Scar in combat and throws him over the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge</b> and into a pit. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.|$|E

25|$|He was hit {{again in}} July 1969. Unusually, {{he was hit}} while in his truck, driving on a {{mountain}} road—the metal body of a vehicle normally protects people in cases such as this by acting as a Faraday cage. The lightning first hit nearby trees and was deflected into the open window of the truck. The strike knocked Sullivan unconscious and burned off his eyebrows and eyelashes, and set his hair on fire. The uncontrolled truck kept moving until it stopped near a <b>cliff</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{farther from the}} sea than it is today, and it is {{possible}} that Skara Brae was built adjacent to a fresh water lagoon protected by dunes. Although the visible buildings give an impression of an organic whole, it is certain that an unknown quantity of additional structures had already been lost to sea erosion before the site's rediscovery and subsequent protection by a seawall. Uncovered remains are known to exist immediately adjacent to the ancient monument in areas presently covered by fields, and others, of uncertain date, can be seen eroding out of the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge</b> a little to the south of the enclosed area.|$|E
500|$|Cwrt (...) , now a large farm, was the {{administrative}} centre of Bardsey Abbey's mainland estates, and {{was known as}} the [...] "Court of Bardsey". The steepest cliffs in the Llŷn Peninsula are at Y Parwyd, the scene of a local ghost story. In 1794 a newly married couple moved into a cottage nearby. Within a few years they were disturbed by a phantom, but when they read a verse from the Bible, the phantom would retreat towards Y Parwyd and hover over the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge</b> before disappearing; the couple finally moved to Bodferin. In 1801 a ship pilot was put ashore on the rocks below the cliffs. Although very drunk, he managed to climb the cliff face and, reaching the top, fell asleep in a sheep pen. In the early morning, he awoke and, still drunk, headed for home; he walked in the wrong direction, however, and disappeared over the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge</b> into the sea.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{occurs in}} coastal {{areas as well}} as near inland rivers and lakes. They build stick nests in trees, on <b>cliff</b> <b>edges,</b> or on the ground on {{suitable}} islands.

50|$|Many petroglyphs and pictographs {{are located}} on cliff faces or under {{vertical}} overhangs, where they receive some limited protection from the elements. Water glyphs, however, typically lie along horizontal <b>cliff</b> <b>edges</b> or exposed rock surfaces. Occurrences of water glyphs are sometimes associated {{with the presence of}} Moki steps.|$|R

These two themes alternate between each other {{during the course of}} the video. [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] begins with a framed silhouette shot of dozens of cyclists moving in slow motion, backed by a sunset. From the scenic view of the city's skyline, the cast, crew and other members wrapped up and headed to downtown Los Angeles for scenes involving a horse and a fire thrower, among others.|$|E
500|$|The south {{coast is}} {{dominated}} by high cliffs, which rise to [...] at Skate Point (Rubha Sgait) in the south west. Barra Head itself is the southern prominence located mid-way along the south coast. The highest point of the island is Sotan, a Marilyn whose summit lies above high cliffs between Barra Head and Skate Point. This eminence is easily reached from the track that leads from Achduin to the lighthouse that passes just {{to the north of}} the summit, which is only [...] from the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge.</b> The skerry of Bird Rock guards the coast far below. The lighthouse is located near the prominence of Sròn an Duin, just east of Skate Point and above the narrow chasm of Sloc na Bèiste (ravine of the monster).|$|E
500|$|The {{lighthouse}} at {{the foot}} of the cliff came into operation in October 1902. Although originally manned by two keepers, it has been remotely monitored by Trinity House via a landline since June 1983. Prior to its construction, shipping had been warned by the Belle Tout lighthouse on the cliff top some 1,640 yards (1,500 m) to the west. Belle Tout lighthouse was operational from 1834 to 1902, and closed because its light was not visible in mist and low cloud. It became a private residence, but was severely damaged in the Second World War by Canadian artillery. In 1956, it was rebuilt as a house and remains a dwelling to this day. In March 1999, the structure was moved [...] back from the <b>cliff</b> <b>edge</b> to save it from plunging into the sea.The structure may need to be moved again to safeguard it from cliff erosion.|$|E
50|$|Boulders {{and rocks}} are wired into mesh cages {{and placed in}} front of areas {{vulnerable}} to erosion: sometimes at <b>cliffs</b> <b>edges</b> or at right angles to the beach.
