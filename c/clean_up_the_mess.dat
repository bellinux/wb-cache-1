After {{managing}} to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron. With the humans spreading panic across the planet's citizens, even scaring the source of all funk, Lamont the Funkapotomus, away to another dimension, it is up to ToeJam and Earl to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> they've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them back to where they came from.|$|E
5|$|Model {{spent the}} first year of World War II as a chief of staff, first of IV Corps during the {{invasion}} of Poland, and then of Sixteenth Army during the Battle of France. He was promoted to lieutenant general (Generalleutnant) in April 1940, and earned his first senior command posting in November that year, when he was assigned to lead the 3rd Panzer Division. He immediately proceeded to ignore all formalities of organization and command, which endeared him to his men and exasperated his staff—who often had to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> he left behind. He also instituted a combined arms training programme where his men were thrown together in various ad-hoc groupings regardless of their parent unit: tankers would train with infantry, engineers with recon units, and so on. Model thus anticipated by some months the regular German use of Kampfgruppen in World War II. While this would become routine later on, it was still not a universal practice in the Wehrmacht in late 1940 and early 1941.|$|E

25|$|On 13 September 1923, General Miguel Primo de Rivera, at {{the time}} Captain General of Barcelona, led a {{military}} revolt against the parliamentary government, and established himself as dictator.

25|$|During November 2007, Eduardo Maruri {{was elected}} President of Barcelona for the 2007–11 period. Maruri and Noboa (Barcelona's Vice President) {{introduced}} the slogan La Renovación (The Renovation), thereby promising {{to bring in}} key international players {{as well as the}} best Ecuadorian players and to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess</b> that had prevented Barcelona from winning the national title. However, the 2009 season was Barcelona's worst season in its history in the Serie A. Such teams as Deportivo Quito, ESPOLI, Deportivo Cuenca and LDU Portoviejo came out and spoke about their concern: if Barcelona were relegated, it would enormously impact those teams' economic situations, since when they would play at home against Barcelona it would almost guarantee a sell-out. (This was because Barcelona had the most fans of any team in Ecuador.) On October 3, 2009, more than 70,000 fans showed up at the Estadio Monumental Banco del Pichincha to support El Idolo del Ecuador so {{that it would not be}} relegated to the Serie B. In an intense match, Barcelona defeated LDU Portoviejo 2–0 with goals from José Luis Perlaza (46th minute) and Juan Samudio (90th minute). This allowed Barcelona to remain the only Ecuadorian team that has never played a game in Serie B.|$|E
25|$|The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo came in 1932. In 1934, Houston Junior College {{became a}} {{four-year}} institution and {{changed its name}} to the University of Houston. A flood in 1935 suddenly turned conditions for the worst, and Houstonians were forced to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>mess.</b> Air service by Braniff Airways and Eastern Air Lines came in 1935 and 1936. By the end of the decade, Houston was encountering growth pains, as the city had inadequate air service and that it was no longer a frontier town. Houston became the largest city in Texas in terms of population in 1939. Many immigrants and African-Americans from Louisiana and other parts of Texas moved to the city to find education or work. The city obtained a very multicultural atmosphere, with large African-American and immigrant communities scattered about. However, African-Americans faced bad housing and poor jobs during this time period. Nevertheless, African-American society developed so much that the city was, and still is, the African-American capital of Texas. The University of Houston moved to its present-day location donated by the Cullen family off of what would later be the first freeway in Houston, U.S. Highway 75 (now called Interstate 45), or Gulf Freeway.|$|E

500|$|California Republicans were {{impressed}} with Reagan's political views and charisma after his [...] "Time for Choosing" [...] speech, and in late 1965 he announced his campaign for Governor of California in the 1966 election. He defeated former San Francisco mayor George Christopher in the GOP primary.

500|$|California Republicans were {{impressed}} with Reagan's political views and charisma after his [...] "Time for choosing" [...] speech, he announced in late 1965, his campaign for Governor of California in 1966. He won the Republican primary with nearly 65% of the vote, not including write-in votes, defeating four other candidates, including former San Francisco mayor George Christopher. Although he did not run in the Democratic primary, Reagan received 27,422 votes as a write-in candidate. Not including write-in candidates, 2,570,396 total votes were cast in the Democratic primary, so Reagan's votes would have comprised about 1% of the total Democratic primary votes.
