2500|$|Drexler {{argues that}} {{we may need to}} wait until our <b>conventional</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> {{improves}} before solving these issues: [...] "Molecular manufacturing will result from a series of advances in molecular machine systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel rocket systems. We are now in a position like that of the British Interplanetary Society of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle." [...] However, Freitas and Merkle argue [...] that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their [...] "direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid".|$|E
40|$|Introduction Biomolecular {{computing}} is the computing methodology {{in which}} biologically important molecules {{are used as}} memory. The `aperiodic' nature of these polymeric molecules makes them suitable as memory units [GRY 56, WHR + 87]. Instead of monotonous repeating units of most synthetic polymers (such as polyethylene), certain biological polymers (such as DNA, RNA and protein) have sets of repeating (or information encoding) units, and these units can appear in any order. The use of atomic or molecular-scale particles for building machinery was first conceived by Feynman in 1959 [Fey 61], which {{gave rise to the}} recently emerging field of nanotechnology [...] -the fabrication technology of molecular machines [Cra 96, Dre 92]. The biomolecular computation we discuss here is somewhat different from what <b>conventional</b> <b>nanotechnology</b> pursues: here the definition of machines is obscure.

Using photons, only the Extreme Ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range comprising EUV, soft-X-rays, VUV offers an outstanding combination of features needed for structuring and analyzing of matter on the 10 to 1000 nm lateral and vertical scale: XUV-radiation is traditionally exploited at beamlines at large storage-ring facilities like BESSY II.

40|$|Glass ionomer cements (GICs) {{are being}} used {{for a wide range}} of {{applications}} in dentistry. In order to overcome the poor mechanical properties of glass ionomers, several modifications have been introduced to the <b>conventional</b> GICs. <b>Nanotechnology</b> involves the use of systems, modifications or materials the size of which is in the range of 1 - 100 nm. Nano-modification of conventional GICs and resin modified GICs (RMGICs) can be achieved by incorporation of nano-sized fillers to RMGICs, reducing the size of the glass particles, and introducing nano-sized bioceramics to the glass powder. Studies suggest that the commercially available nano-filled RMGIC does not hold any significant advantage over conventional RMGICs as far as the mechanical and bonding properties are concerned. Conversely, incorporation of nano-sized apatite crystals not only increases the mechanical properties of conventional GICs, but also can enhance fluoride release and bioactivity. By increasing the crystallinity of the set matrix, apatites can make the set cement chemically more stable, insoluble, and improve the bond strength with tooth structure. Increased fluoride release can also reduce and arrest secondary caries. However, due to a lack of long-term clinical studies, the use of nano-modified glass ionomers is still limited in daily clinical dentistry. In addition to the in vitro and in vivo studies, more randomized clinical trials are required to justify the use of these promising materials. The aim of this paper is to review the modification performed in GIC-based materials to improve their physicochemical properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{promise of}} {{nanotechnology}} {{lies in the}} possibility of engineering matter on the nanoscale and creating technological interfaces that, because of their small scales, may directly interact with biological objects, creating new strategies for the treatment of pathologies that are otherwise beyond the reach of <b>conventional</b> medicine. <b>Nanotechnology</b> is inherently a multiscale, multiphenomena challenge. Fundamental understanding and highly accurate predictive methods are critical to successful manufacturing of nanostructured materials, bio/mechanical devices and systems. In biomedical engineering, and in the mechanical analysis of biological tissues, classical continuum approaches are routinely utilized, even if these disregard the discrete nature of tissues, that are an interpenetrating network of a matrix (the extra cellular matrix, ECM) and a generally large but finite number of cells with a size falling in the micrometer range. Here, we introduce a nano-mechanical theory that accounts for the-non continuum nature of bio systems and other discrete systems. This discrete field theory, doublet mechanics (DM), is a technique to model the mechanical behavior of materials over multiple scales, ranging from some millimeters down to few nanometers. In the paper, we use this theory to predict the response of a granular material to an external applied load. Such a representation is extremely attractive in modeling biological tissues which may be considered as a spatial set {{of a large number of}} particulate (cells) dispersed in an extracellular matrix. Possibly more important of this, using digital image correlation (DIC) optical methods, we provide an experimental verification of the model...|$|R

More particularly the construction sector finds its advantage with nanotechnology, construction industry needs more material and energy resources. Among all the materials used in construction, concrete occupies nearly 70 % of the materials by volume and shows significant impact. The advent of nanotechnology helped in producing more strong and durable material than <b>conventional</b> materials. <b>Nanotechnology</b> in making concrete refers to the production and addition of nanosized particles in to concrete at suitable proportions by appropriate methods. The basic purpose of using nanosized materials in concrete is to improve compressive and flexural strengths at early age, it is possible due to the high surface – to volume ratio. It also helps to improve the pore structure of concrete. Nanosized materials help to reduce porosity as they absorb less water compared to traditional cementitious materials. The presence of nanomaterials reduces the amount of cement content in concrete than the conventional concrete. This can be achieved without sacrificing strength characteristics, thereby it is possible to produce eco friendly concrete called green concrete.

Deaths from cancer are {{continuously}} rising worldwide with a projection of about 12 million deaths from cancer in 2030. Hence, over the past few years, tremendous attention has been given to the cancer related research and there has been an outstanding progress in the basic cancer biology.

40|$|DNA {{functionalized}} gold-nanoparticles (Au-nps) {{have been}} broadly used as labeling reagents {{in the development}} of molecular diagnostics as well as building blocks in <b>nanotechnology.</b> <b>Conventional</b> methods for the synthesis of DNA functionalized Au-nps require long incubation, typically overnight, and delicate control of the ionic strength to compensate for the charge repulsion between the nanoparticles surface and the DNA strands, which generally affect the stability of the nanoparticles and the DNA loading density. In this study, we present a novel mononucleotide-mediated conjugation approach to synthesize DNA-functionalized Au-nps within 4 h in a high ionic strength environment. Au-nps covered with a thermally tunable stabilization layer through mononucleotide adsorption were shown to readily conjugate with thiol-DNAs in 0. 1 M NaCl solution upon heating. Monitoring this mononucleotide-mediated conjugation reaction through dynamic light scattering and UV-vis spectroscopy demonstrated the formation of stable DNA/Au-nps conjugates. The resulting conjugates, as characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, are loaded by similar to 80 strands per particle, comparable to the DNA loading density of current approaches. The general applicability of this approach was further verified in a nanoparticle-bound DNA hybridization test. Our results show that monomicleotide-mediated thermal conjugation is an attractive alternative that allows temperature-con trolled and salt-enhanced functionalization of gold nanoparticles with DNAs in just a few hours...|$|R
40|$|Reversible logic has {{received}} great {{attention in the}} recent years due to its ability to reduce the power dissipation which is the main requirement in low power digital design. It has wide applications in advanced computing, low power CMOS design, Optical information processing, DNA computing, bio information, quantum computation and <b>nanotechnology.</b> <b>Conventional</b> digital circuits dissipate a significant amount of energy because bits of information are erased during the logic operations. Thus, if logic gates are designed such that the information bits are not destroyed, the power consumption can be reduced dramatically. The information bits are not lost in case of a reversible computation. This has {{led to the development of}} reversible gates. ALU is a fundamental building block of a central processing unit (CPU) in any computing system; reversible arithmetic unit has a high power optimization on the offer.

40|$|Nanofabrication {{involving}} clay is {{a distinct}} field, because it departs from the <b>conventional</b> field of <b>nanotechnology</b> (e. g., nanoelectronics, nanomaterials), and is far more challenging than conventional application fields (e. g., cell phone, computer, sensors, cloths, and other industrial products). This is because: (a) clay is an interface {{of the physical world}} and the world of life, and (b) soil is the central domain of geosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere, and therefore, soil scientists have the responsibility to support life and protect the environment. For nanofabrication involving clays, methods followed in industry (like melting materials at a high temperature to segregate atoms / ions at plasma state) cannot be copied. It is no hindrance, because the system obeys the laws of ion exchange, adsorption-desorption, aggregation-dispersion, solubility-dissolution to name a few. The most vital yardstick is that the system has to be capable of releasing nutrient ions in plant-available forms. One of the key modules of nanofabrication is manipulation of bonds, which is a common phenomenon in soils. Clays have both covalent and ionic bonds; a feature unique for developing a passive control system for a nutrient supply mechanism. There are enormous numbers of examples in soils, where bonds are changed from one form to another through isomorphous substitution or insertion of small ions, or by the use of organic compounds (for masking of van der Waal&#x 2019;s force). Nanotechnology in the clay system does not promise a control system that we experience in electrical machines, or in satellites, or in chemical reactors. But, {{it has to be a}} knowledge-based passive system, and for sure, it is going to create millions of rhizospheres in an acre of land to support the growth of millions of plants for a crop; a breakthrough to place agriculture into the new millennium. |$|R
