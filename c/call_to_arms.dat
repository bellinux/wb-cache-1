5|$|In {{the initial}} <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms</b> issued in 1861, Indiana was {{assigned}} a quota of 7,500 men—a tenth of the amount called—to join the Union Army in putting down the rebellion. So many volunteered in the first call that thousands had to be turned away. Before the war ended, Indiana contributed 208,367men to fight and serve in the war. Casualties were over 35% among these men: 24,416 {{lost their lives in}} the conflict and over 50,000 more were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{both sides}} {{unleashed}} diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched {{letters to the}} monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered with his own letters to the monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms,</b> and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E

5|$|Destruction of the {{newspaper}} provoked a strident <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms</b> from Thomas C. Sharp, editor of the Warsaw Signal and longtime critic of Smith. Fearing an uprising, Smith mobilized the Nauvoo Legion on June 18 and declared martial law. Officials in Carthage responded by mobilizing their small detachment of the state militia, and Governor Thomas Ford appeared, threatening to raise a larger militia unless Smith and the Nauvoo city council surrendered themselves. Smith initially fled across the Mississippi River, but shortly returned and surrendered to Ford. On June 23, Smith and his brother Hyrum rode to Carthage to stand trial for inciting a riot. Once the Smiths were in custody, the charges were increased to treason.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to last two weeks were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a general <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms)</b> {{in response to an}} invasion. The sejm could be extended if all the deputies agreed. No set time of a year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in late fall or early winter.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones {{to attend}} a {{convention}} alongside Métis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded {{as a condition of}} union. Much of the settlement came to accept the Métis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, this group was led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms.</b> Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his house and store. Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were shaped}} by the traumatic nature of the conflict {{and its impact on}} individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms,</b> with a significant percentage of the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns were conducted on multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and poison gas. In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on the memories of the nations involved.|$|E
5|$|In Norfolk, {{the revolt}} {{was led by}} Geoffrey Litster, a weaver, and Sir Roger Bacon, a local lord with ties to the Suffolk rebels. Litster began sending out {{messengers}} across the county in a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms</b> on 14 June, and isolated outbreaks of violence occurred. The rebels assembled on 17 June outside Norwich and killed Sir Robert Salle, {{who was in charge}} of the city defences and had attempted to negotiate a settlement. The people of the town then opened the gates to let the rebels in. They began looting buildings and killed Reginald Eccles, a local official. William de Ufford, the Earl of Suffolk fled his estates and travelled in disguise to London. The other leading members of the local gentry were captured and forced to play out the roles of a royal household, working for Litster. Violence spread out across the county, as gaols were opened, Flemish immigrants killed, court records burned, and property looted and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the rebels}} had been subdued, Abu Bakr began {{a war of}} conquest, {{beginning}} with Iraq. Sending his most brilliant general, Khalid ibn al-Walid, Iraq was conquered {{in a series of}} successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persians. Abu Bakr's confidence grew, and once Khalid established his stronghold in Iraq, Abu Bakr issued a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms</b> for the invasion of Syria in February 634. The Muslim invasion of Syria was a series of carefully planned and well coordinated military operations that employed strategy instead of pure strength to deal with Byzantine defensive measures. The Muslim armies, however soon proved to be too small to handle the Byzantine response, and their commanders called for reinforcements. Khalid was sent by Abu Bakr from Iraq to Syria with reinforcements and to lead the invasion. In July 634, the Byzantines were decisively defeated at Ajnadayn. Damascus fell in September 634, followed by the Battle of Fahl where the last significant garrison of Palestine was defeated and routed.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the {{establishment}} of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers, Riel fled {{to the safety of}} the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald proclaimed a general <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arms</b> on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of $1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.|$|E

2500|$|Cameron {{inserted}} a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> the slaves {{in his report}} to Congress, which would be sent along with Lincoln's address to the legislature. Cameron gave the report to Stanton, who amended it with a passage that went even further in demanding that slaves be armed, stating that those who rebel against the government lose their claims to any type of property, including slaves, {{and that it was}} [...] "clearly the right of the Government <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> slaves when it may become necessary as it is to use gunpowder or guns taken from the enemy". Cameron gave the report to Lincoln, and sent several copies to Congress and the press. Lincoln wanted the portions containing <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> the slaves removed, and ordered the transmission of Cameron's report be stopped and replaced with an altered version. Congress received the version without the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> slaves, while the press received a version with it. When newspapers published the document in its entirety, Lincoln was excoriated by Republicans, who thought him weak on the issue of slavery, and disliked that he wanted the plea <b>to</b> <b>arm</b> slaves removed.|$|R
