Giuseppe was a rural worker in Sicily and then a <b>cane</b> <b>cutter</b> in Cairns in 1955. By the {{following}} year he was a labourer in Melbourne and later worked for Victorian Railways. Arena grew up in Moonee Ponds with two sisters, Nancy and Silvana; her family calls her Pina which provided her stage name, Tina. For secondary schooling she attended St. Columba's College, Essendon from 1980 and completed Year12 in 1985. She later recalled her upbringing [...] "It was a very Italian household, {{it was a very}} traditional household. There was a lot of love but {{there was a lot of}} discipline.

5000|$|By 1948, most sugar {{workers in}} Guyana were giving {{support to the}} Guyana Industrial Workers Union (GIWU). On 22 April 1948, <b>cane</b> <b>cutters,</b> backed by the union, went on strike {{demanding}} the abolishment of the existing [...] "cut and load" [...] system in the fields. This reaping system which forced <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> had to load the sugar punts with the cane they cut, was not popular among <b>cane</b> <b>cutters.</b> It was introduced in 1945, {{and from time to}} time workers had gone on strike to demand that it should be changed. As part of the demands of the 1948 strike, the <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> called for the replacement of [...] "cut and load" [...] with a [...] "cut and drop" [...] system by which the <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> should cut the cane, but other workers would load the cut cane into the punts for shipment to the factory.|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to justify future snail control on an {{irrigated}} sugar estate in Tanzania, the effects of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the productivity of apparently healthy <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> were investigated. The bonus earnings of <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> who {{were found to be}} infected with S. mansoni were compared, retrospectively, with earnings of uninfected <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> during the years 1968 - 69. For one 6 -month period a more detailed study was made to correlate bonus earnings with actual output in tons of cane cut. It was found that in the four 6 -month periods the mean bonus earnings of the uninfected <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> exceeded the mean bonus earnings of the infected men by 11. 0 %, 11. 4 %, 6. 0 %, and 13. 7 %, respectively. In all except the third period these differences were statistically significant. After treatment for S. mansoni infection, the workers were able to improve their earnings relative to both infected and uninfected workers. In a more detailed study of some of the workers during the third 6 -month period, it was discovered that a 4 % difference in bonus earnings represented a 1 % difference in output. Taking into account the variations of bonus earnings it was estimated that the overall difference in productivity between infected and uninfected workers was 3 - 5 %...|$|R

40|$|The thermal and {{exercise}} tolerances of 165 Sudanese <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> were {{measured in the}} laboratory and related to work performance and productivity in the cane fields. The {{results showed that the}} amount of cane cut per minute in the field was significantly correlated with changes in body weight (r = + 0 - 53) during the third hour of work, aerobic energy expenditure (r = + 0 - 43), and cardiac frequency during work. These variables in turn were associated with predicted maximal power output (VO 2 max) measured in the laboratory. The average energy expenditure during cane cutting was 1 - 66 +/- 0 - 33 1 /min- 1 (34 - 9 kJ/min- 1) which represents approximately 60 % of the workers predicted VO 2 max. This rate of energy expenditure was sustained in the cane fields for at least three hours without significant pauses for rest. The sweat losses measured in 32 <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> during the two and three hours of work averaged 637 +/- 221 and 770 +/- 282 g/h- 1 respectively, while the mean urine temperature immediately on cessation of effort was 37 - 74 +/- 0 - 46 degrees C. Despite the additional environmental heat load of the tropics, it would seem that <b>cane</b> <b>cutters</b> performing a self-paced task demanding heavy physical effort, are able to sustain work levels well in excess of those recommended for most European factory workers without obvious signs of fatigue or heat stress...|$|R
