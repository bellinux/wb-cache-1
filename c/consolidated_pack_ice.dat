40|$|In the Arctic Ocean, {{phytoplankton}} blooms on continental {{shelves are}} often limited by light availability, {{and are therefore}} thought to be restricted to waters free of sea ice. During July 2011 in the Chukchi Sea, a large phytoplankton bloom was observed beneath fully <b>consolidated</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> and extended from the ice edge to > 100 km into the pack. The bloom was composed primarily of diatoms, with biomass reaching 1291 mg chlorophyll a m? 2 and rates of carbon fixation as high as 3. 7 g C m? 2 d? 1. Although the sea ice where the bloom was observed was near 100 % concentration and 0. 8 – 1. 2 m thick, 30 – 40 % of its surface was covered by melt ponds that transmitted 4 -fold more light than adjacent areas of bare ice, providing sufficient light for phytoplankton to bloom. Phytoplankton growth rates associated with the under-ice bloom averaged 0. 9 d? 1 and were as high as 1. 6 d? 1. We argue that a thinning sea ice cover with more numerous melt ponds {{over the past decade}} has enhanced light penetration through the sea ice into the upper water column, favoring the development of these blooms. These observations, coupled with additional biogeochemical evidence, suggest that phytoplankton blooms are currently widespread on nutrient-rich Arctic continental shelves and that satellite-based estimates of annual primary production in waters where under-ice blooms develop are ~ 10 -fold too low. These massive phytoplankton blooms represent a marked shift in our understanding of Arctic marine ecosystems...|$|E

This transect encompassed samples from open waters of the marginal ice zone exhibiting low concentrations of chlorophyll- a (Chl a 1 img m - 3), {{as well as an}} extensive phytoplankton bloom (Chl a - 3) beneath <b>consolidated</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice.</b> Measurements included the spectral coefficients for particulate beam attenuation, backscattering, and absorption, bulk indicators of particle concentration and composition, and the particle size distribution. Within the bloom microphytoplankton contributed > 95 % to the total Chl a, and relatively small amounts of nonalgal particles were present. This assemblage exhibited low Chl a -specific phytoplankton absorption coefficients (0. 006 m 2 mg - 1 at 676 nm) indicating a strong influence of pigment packaging, and a weak spectral dependence of the particulate backscattering coefficient. In contrast, the phytoplankton community in nutrient-depleted surface waters outside the sea ice had a strong contribution of picoplankton to Chl a (54 %) and an increased abundance of nonalgal particles. The Chl a -specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient approached maximum values at 676 nm (0. 023 m 2 mg - 1) and particle backscattering had much stronger spectral dependence. Additional samples from near the sea floor exhibited characteristics of either mineral-dominated assemblages or a mixture of mineral and organic particles, and also displayed optical differentiation from the surface samples. The marked contrast in absorption, attenuation, and backscattering properties of these ecological regimes suggest that they can be discriminated from optical measurements available on a variety of in situ and remote-sensing platforms...|$|E

The FUJI, equipped with two Sikorsky S- 61 A helicopters and one Bell 47 G 2 A helicopter for polar operations, carried nearly 500 tons of cargo for the wintering party. Since the dry after the departure, scientific researches on board, comprising oceanography, biology, meteorology, gravity survey, radio wave propergation and cosmic ray, were performed according to the schedule. On December 16 th, 1971, the FUJI left Fremantle and reached the ice edge on January 1 st, 1972, approximately 40 miles north from Syowa. Since January 5 th, the FUJI tried to break through the fast ice to approach Syowa, but her progress against the hard winter fast ice averaged only one mile a day. Fortunately, the weather condition was good enough for the flights of helicopters throughout the period, so the transportation of supplies for the station and scientific field studies was carried out efficiently.

40|$|Synoptic {{observations}} of ice {{motion in the}} Arctic Basin are currently limited to those acquired by drifting buoys and, more recently, radar data from ERS- 1. Buoys are not uniformly distributed throughout the Arctic, and SAR coverage is currently limited regionally and temporally due to the data volume, swath width, processing requirements, and power needs of the SAR. Additional ice-motion observations that can map ice responses simultaneously over large portions of the Arctic on daily to weekly time intervals are thus needed to augment the SAR and buoys data and to provide an intermediate-scale measure of ice drift suitable for climatological analyses and ice modeling. Principal objectives of this project were to: (1) demonstrate whether sufficient ice features and ice motion existed within the <b>consolidated</b> <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> to permit motion tracking using AVHRR imagery; (2) determine the limits imposed on AVHRR mapping by cloud cover; and (3) test the applicability of AVHRR-derived motions in studies of ice-atmosphere interactions.
