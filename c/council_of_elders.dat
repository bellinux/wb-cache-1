5|$|The first kingdom's {{government}} {{consisted of}} the king (styled Malikum) and the grand vizier, who headed a <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders</b> (Abbu) and the administration. The second kingdom was a monarchy, but {{little is known about}} it {{because of a lack of}} written records. The third kingdom was a city-state monarchy with reduced importance under the authority of Yamhad.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 Burnet {{decided to}} officially retire; in {{retirement}} he wrote two books. During this time, {{he missed his}} laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet {{was one of three}} contributors to Challenge to Australia, writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result {{of the success of the}} book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders</b> to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{a period of}} {{financial}} and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, {{at the center of}} many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church bwing placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took {{an active role in the}} defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.|$|E
50|$|Jewish {{communities}} in Russia were governed internally by local, dominantly theocratic administrative bodies, called the <b>Councils</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders</b> (Qahal, Kehilla), constituted in every town or hamlet possessing a Jewish population. The <b>Councils</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders</b> had jurisdiction over Jews {{in matters of}} internal litigation, as well as fiscal transactions relating to the collection and payment of taxes (poll tax, land tax, etc.). Later, this right of collecting taxes was much abused; in 1844 the civil authority <b>of</b> the <b>Councils</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders</b> over its Jewish population was abolished.|$|R

5|$|The Spartan <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders,</b> the gerousia, {{suggested}} that the Spartan women be sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos.|$|E
5|$|The first {{city had}} the {{characteristics}} of large urban centers, such as monumental buildings, and {{seems to have been}} ruled by a kinship based assembly, headed by elders. The pre-Akkadian kingdom was decentralized, and the provincial center of Nabada was ruled by a <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> next to the king's representative. The Nagarite monarchs had to tour their kingdom regularly in order to assert their political control. During the early Akkadian period, Nagar was administrated by local officials. However, central control was tightened and the number of Akkadian officials increased, following the supposed environmental event that preceded the construction of Naram-Sin's palace. The post-Akkadian Nagar was a city-state kingdom, that gradually lost its political importance during the early second millennium BC, as no evidence for a king dating to that period exists.|$|E
25|$|Since Bolshevik {{power in}} Estonia was {{relatively}} weak, the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders</b> of the Maapäev declared on , that the assembly {{was the only}} legally elected and constituted authority in Estonia. Since even the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders</b> was too big to work underground, the three-membered Estonian Salvation Committee was formed on 19February 1918 and Konstantin Päts became one of its members.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} of chiefs and the Asantehene himself followed a pattern. The senior female of the chiefly lineage nominated the eligible males.

25|$|An {{inscription}} {{found there}} and dated {{around the middle}} of the 4th century BC states that the city had a constitution similar to that of Cyrene, with a board of chief magistrates (ephors) and a <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders</b> (gerontes). Later in the 4th century BC, during the unsettled period which followed Alexander's death, the city backed the losing side in a revolt by the Spartan adventurer Thibron; trying to create an empire for himself, he was defeated by the Cyreneans and their allies.|$|E

25|$|Sumerian cities {{during the}} Uruk period were {{probably}} theocratic and {{were most likely}} headed by a priest-king (ensi), assisted by a <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> including both men and women. It {{is quite possible that}} the later Sumerian pantheon was modeled upon this political structure. There was little evidence of organized warfare or professional soldiers during the Uruk period, and towns were generally unwalled. During this period Uruk became the most urbanized city in the world, surpassing for the first time 50,000 inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|As European {{colonization}} of the Americas took place, the European explorers regarded some newly contacted indigenous chieftainships {{as a form}} of monarchy, wherein warriors were under the command of a hereditary chief. However, though they may have been the holders of power, all chiefs were not necessarily free to mobilise troops without the consent of a <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> similar to the situation in a modern constitutional monarchy; for example, in the Cherokee nation, the approval of the council of women was required before war could be declared.|$|E
25|$|This {{elected and}} en-stooled chief enjoys a great majestic {{ceremony}} {{to this day}} with much spectacle and celebration. He reigns with much despotic power, including {{the ability to make}} judgments of life and death on his subjects. However, he does not enjoy absolute rule. Upon the stool, the Chief is sacred, the holy intermediary between people and ancestors. His powers theoretically are more apparent than real. His powers hinge on his attention to the advice and decisions of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders.</b> The chief can be impeached, de-stooled, if the Elders and the people turn against him. He can be reduced to man, subject to derision for his failure.|$|E
50|$|In 1578, Fray Juan de Plasencia and Fray Diego de Oropesa, two Franciscan missionaries from Spain {{founded the}} town of Tayabas in order to spread Christianity to its natives.

5000|$|Phoenician {{societies}} {{rested on}} three power-bases: the king; temples and their priests; and <b>councils</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders.</b> Byblos first became the predominant center {{from where the}} Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Erythraean (Red) Sea routes. It was here that the first inscription in the Phoenician alphabet was found, on the sarcophagus of Ahiram (c. 1200 BC).|$|R

25|$|In 1904 {{the first}} missionary workers, led by Mrs. Mary Bennett made their {{appearance}} in Awka-Etiti. The first C.M.S mission church {{was built in}} Iruowelle village. In 1913 the Roman Catholic mission was also introduced to the Town, which built a church and a school. These two churches rapidly led to a conversion {{of the majority of}} Awka-Etiti citizens to Christianity. In 1944 the Awka-Etiti Improvement Union (A.I.U) was formed, which was the governing body of Awka-Etiti, taking over the mantle of leadership from the traditional <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders</b> meeting (Okwu Azu-Oji). The name of the town was officially changed to Awka-Etiti by the A.I.U in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Shamhat brings Enkidu to the shepherds' camp, {{where he}} is {{introduced}} to a human diet and becomes the night watchman. Learning from a passing stranger about Gilgamesh's treatment of new brides, Enkidu is incensed and travels to Uruk to intervene at a wedding. When Gilgamesh attempts to visit the wedding chamber, Enkidu blocks his way, and they fight. After a fierce battle, Enkidu acknowledges Gilgamesh's superior strength and they become friends. Gilgamesh proposes a journey to the Cedar Forest to slay the monstrous demi-god Humbaba {{in order to gain}} fame and renown. Despite warnings from Enkidu and the <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders,</b> Gilgamesh is not deterred.|$|E
25|$|The {{elections}} of Year V (May 1797), {{in which one}} third of the representatives were replaced, turned the tables in favour of the royalists, who achieved a majority in both chambers. On 20 May 1797 (20 prairial V), Charles Pichegru was elected president of the Council of 500 and Barbé-Marbois of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Elders.</b> Vaublanc himself was named membre du bureau of the Council of 500. On the same day, the Legislature proceeded to replace the republican Director, Le Tourneur (who had gained the position by drawing straws), with the moderate royalist François de Barthélémy, at that time the French ambassador to Switzerland. Vaublanc voted against his nomination, preferring General Beurnonville, who was known for his forcefulness.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{practice}} is illegal in Kyrgyzstan, bride kidnappers are rarely prosecuted. This reluctance to enforce the code is in part caused by the pluralistic legal system in Kyrgyzstan where many villages are de facto ruled by <b>councils</b> <b>of</b> <b>elders</b> and aqsaqal courts following customary law, away from {{the eyes of the}} state legal system. The law against bride kidnapping was toughened in 2013.|$|R
