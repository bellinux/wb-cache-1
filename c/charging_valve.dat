30|$|The three {{revolute}} joints of each {{hind leg}} use six pneumatic muscles in total, and each pneumatic muscle {{is controlled by}} two high-speed switch valves. Thus, the entire hind limb requires 12 pneumatic high-speed switch valves. We consider the hip joint as an example to explain the working principle of the pneumatic circuit. The body and the thigh crank are connected with a joint shaft. Each end of the crank is hinged to the muscles, and the other ends {{are connected to the}} body frame. During muscle contraction and stretching, the crank (fixed with the thigh frame) rotates relative to the body. To reach the initial position, the <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> 1 and discharging valve 2 are open, and the discharging valve 1 and <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> 2 are closed. The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (Figure  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> 1 and discharging valve 2 are close, and <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> 1 and the discharging valve 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|E
40|$|Accumulators are {{important}} components {{used in many}} systems at commercial boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors in the United States. The accumulators are vessels attached to fluid systems to provide 1) a limited backup source of stored fluid energy for hydraulic/pneumatic mechanical equipment, 2) a damping effect on pressure pulses in fluid systems, and 3) a volume of fluid to be injected passively into a fluid system. Accumulators contain a gas that is compressed or expanded as the fluid from the system enters or exits the accumulator. The gas and fluid in accumulators are usually separated from each other by a piston or bladder. In support of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Nuclear Aging Research Program (NPAR), the Pacific Northwest Laboratory conducted an analysis of available industry databases to determine if accumulator components already had been studied in other NPAR assessments and to evaluate each accumulator type for applicable aging issues. The results of this preliminary study indicate that two critical uses of accumulators have been previously evaluated by the NPAR program. NUREGICR- 5699, Aging and Service Wear of Control Rod Drive Mechanisms for BUT Nuclear Plants (Greene 199 I), identified two hydraulic control unit components subject to aging failures: accumulator nitrogen-charging cartridge valves and the scram water accumulator. In addition, NUREGICR- 6001, Aging Assessment of BWR Standby Liquid Control Systems (Buckley et al. 1992), identified two predominant aging-related accumulator failures that result {{in a loss of}} the nitrogen blanket pressure: (<b>charging)</b> <b>valve</b> wear and failure of the gas bladder. The present study has identified five prevalent aging-related accumulator failures: rupture of the accumulator bladder separation of the metal disc {{from the bottom of the}} bladder leakage of the gas from the <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> leakage past the safety injection tank manway cover gasket leakage past O-rings. An additional study of the accumulator subcomponents associated with these failures is recommended, including an evaluation of current inspection programs to verify that they are detecting the aging degradation effects.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{internal}} combustion engines display high overall maximum global efficiencies, this potential cannot be fully exploited in automotive applications: in real conditions, the average engine load (and thus efficiency) is quite {{low and the}} kinetic energy during a braking phase is lost. This work presents a hybrid pneumatic-combustion engine and the associated thermodynamic cycles, which is able to store and recover {{energy in the form}} of compressed air. The study focuses on the two major pneumatic modes: pneumatic pump mode and pneumatic motor mode. For each of them, three valvetrain technologies are considered: 4 -stroke mode, 4 -stroke mode with one camshaft disengaged, and 2 -stroke fully variable. The concept can be adapted to SI or CI engines. In any case the valvetrain technology is the key to best fuel economy.

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{previous}} studies have proven that pneumatic hybridization of an internal combustion engine is a technically viable and cost-efficient alternative to electric hybridization. Because the heat transfer process remains a first order factor while the engine operates in a motored or pneumatic mode without combustion, an accurate instantaneous heat transfer model is {{required in order to}} predict the in-cylinder pressure. This study shows that the original Woschni model is not suitable for describing the shape of the measured instantaneous heat flux versus crank angle while the engine operates in a motored pneumatic mode, because of the extinction of tumble motion near Top Dead Center (TDC). A modified form of the Woschni model is therefore proposed here that better describes the instantaneous heat flux during compression and expansion strokes, applicable to pneumatic and motored with fuel cut-off modes. First, the new constant parameter model is identified from experimental measurements performed in various motored mode conditions. Next, the pneumatic supercharged mode without combustion (ignition not performed) is investigated with the new model using the same identification values as for the motored mode. This study shows that the modified model remains fully applicable to the supercharged mode, despite of a certainly modified in-cylinder aerodynamic structure created by the opening of the <b>charging</b> <b>valve</b> under a high pressure ratio...|$|E

In this, a single crankshaft was connected to two opposed pistons through a toggle jointed linkage that had a nonlinearity; for half a revolution, one piston remained almost stationary while the other approached it and returned, and then for the next half revolution, the pistons changed over which piston was almost stationary and which piston approached and returned. Thus, in each revolution, one piston provided a compression stroke and a power stroke, {{and then the other}} piston provided an exhaust stroke and a charging stroke. As the power piston remained withdrawn during exhaust and charging, it was practical to provide exhaust and <b>charging</b> using <b>valves</b> behind a port that was covered during the compression stroke and the power stroke, and so the valves did not need to resist high pressure and could be of the simpler sort used in many steam engines, or even reed valves.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of various intake charge motion control approaches on the cold start-up process of a port fuel injected SI engine. Engine experiments were performed to assess the effectiveness of enhanced charge motion on mixture preparation, combustion, and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Different charge motions were produced by three different shapes of <b>charge</b> motion control <b>valves</b> (CMCV), which block off 75 % of the engine's intake ports. Cold-fluid steady state experiments were carried out with the CMCV open and closed. Increased charge motion with the CMCV closed was found to shorten the combustion duration, which caused the 50 % mass fraction burned to occur up to 5 ⁰ CA earlier for the same spark timing. By the use of the CMCV, significant improvements in combustion stability (up to 1. 5 % reduction in COV) and fuel efficiency (up to 8 % reduction in ISFC) were achieved with increased levels of spark timing retard due to enhanced air-fuel mixing and relatively faster burning. Engine start-up experiments were conducted with three different geometric <b>charge</b> motion control <b>valves.</b> (cont.) The CMCV improved mixture preparation due to increased swirl and tumble intensities, which enhanced fuel distribution and evaporation. Moderate spark retard (AOp = - 5 ⁰) was found to reduce the engine-out HC emissions during the engine start-up process. Peak engine-out HC emissions with the CMCV closed occurred in the earlier stages of engine start-up process relative to the CMCV open case. Greater fuel vaporization and faster burning rate with the CMCV closed allowed reduced fuel injection and additional spark retard, resulting in significantly reduced HC emissions. The engine-out HC emissions were reduced by 18 % during the 0 - 3 seconds and by 7 % during the 3 - 20 seconds. by Dongkun Lee. Thesis (S. M.)

Computations are performed with state-of-the-art, well validated, engine and vehicle performance simulations packages, generally accepted to produce accurate results targeting major trends in engine developments.

On {{the basis of the}} results obtained in the previous studies, several combinations of late-closing (L.

With a large intake capacity, L. C. can decrease the pumping loss and thus increase the mechanical efficiency. Increasing the expansion ratio from 11 to 23. 9 with L.

The decrease of compression ratio from 11 to 5. 5 gives little effect on the thermal efficiency if the exp ansion ratio could be kept constant. Thus, the expansion ratio is revealed to be a determining factor for cycle efficiency, while compression ratio is no more important, which suggests the usefulness of controlling the intake <b>charge</b> with intake <b>valve</b> closure timing.

Realtime circulating oil concentration data were obtained for steady-state, quasi-steady, and start-up operating regimes with an installed optical concentration sensor. A two-phase refrigerant-oil model was developed for R 134 a and polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil to predict oil film thickness, average film velocity, and interfacial shear between the refrigerant vapor and the refrigerant-oil liquid film.

40|$|An {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS) is the primary motivation for this research. The ABS controller switches the actions of <b>charging</b> and discharging <b>valves</b> in the hydraulic actuator of the brake cylinder based on the wheels' angular speed and acceleration. The controller is, therefore, modeled by discontinuous differential equations where two smooth vector fields are separated by a switching manifold S. The goal of the controller is to maximize the tire-road friction force during braking (and, in particular, to prevent the wheel lock-up). Since the optimal slip L of the wheel is known rather approximately, the actual goal of the controller is to achieve such a switching strategy that makes the dynamics converging to a limit cycle surrounding the region of prospective values of L. In this paper we show that the required limit cycle can be obtained as a bifurcation from a point x 0 of S when a suitable parameter D crosses 0. The point x 0 {{turns out to be}} a fold-fold singularity (the vector fields on the two sides of S are tangent one another at x 0) and the parameter D measures the deviation of the switching manifold from a hyperplane. The proposed result is based on an extension of the classical fold bifurcation theory available for smooth maps. Construction of a suitable smooth map is a crucial step of the proof.

40|$|With highly {{efficient}} modem catalysts, startup HC emissions {{have become a}} significant portion of the trip total. Liquid fuel is a major source of HC emissions during the cold start and fast idle period. Thus the control of liquid fuel, particularly during startup, is required for future engine designs. The effect of a turbulence plate, or <b>charge</b> motion control <b>valve,</b> on the port liquid fuel mass is examined. A purging process was used to examine the effect of a charge motion control plate on the port fuel film mass. It was found that the charge motion plate can provide substantial reductions in both the total and downstream intake fuel film mass. These reductions are the result of the increased intake turbulence that results from the charge motion plate. This increased turbulence provides enhanced fuel - air mixing and increases port film strip atomization due to the increased viscous shear. The effect of different film locations was postulated and backed experimentally. The downstream and valve films have the most immediate effect on the fuel delivery. Large upstream films, which can take thousands of cycles to develop, influence the fuel delivery on a much longer time scale. (cont.) In-cylinder hydrocarbon measurements were made. Despite the high level of scatter in the measurements, similar transient responses were observed for both CMCV open and closed. This similarity despite different film masses was attributed to different t and x values. by Robert J. Scaringe. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{spite of}} much {{progress}} {{in the development of}} gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, choosing an appropriate piston top contour to obtain desirable combustion efficiency is still an arduous process for engineers. This study investigates the combined effects of piston bowl geometry and a <b>charge</b> motion control <b>valve</b> (CMCV) on tumble flow and combustion features in GDI engines. Based on the model validation, the processes of intake, spray, mixture formation and combustion at different engine speeds are simulated and analyzed for different piston shapes for the two cases of opening and closing the CMCV. The results show that the bowl on the top of piston is beneficial for the formation and development of tumble flow. The flat top piston with the CMCV closed is able to achieve acceptable combustion pressure. However, with the increase of engine speed and load, the advantages of the flat top pistons gradually disappear; the dual offset bowl piston has a minimum tumble ratio and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) {{at the end of the}} compression stroke because of the projection in the middle of the piston top surface which leads to a lower pressure rise rate and a reduced flame propagation speed at high load. The closed CMCV contributes to a faster evaporation rate and a more uniform mixture at lower speeds. It is not recommended for use at high speeds due to lower intake air mass and reduced combustion pressure. The research provides an effective way for engineers to choose an appropriate piston top contour combined with a CMCV to obtain desirable combustion efficiency...|$|R

In the first part are reviewed some of the principles and methods of the economic approach to these subjects: (i) the debate between Cost-Benefit Analysis and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, (ii) regulation by prices or quantities and the way models use ?environmental economics tools? that are taxes, tradable permits, norms and standards and hybrid instruments like ?standards and <b>charges?</b> or ?safety <b>valve?,</b> (iii) use and limit of economic models in international climate negotiation [...] The second part uses the concepts of the International Political Economy for studying the process of organising joint action at the global level that is finding a governance model for the global environment. It uses the concepts of international regime and of leadership and defines the principal rules and institutions of the existing international agreements, with their achievements and weaknesses. It finally identifies four scenarios for the future of collective action. Cet article traite des différentes modalités qui existent pour gérer un problème d'action collective, comme celui du changement climatique, susceptible d'affecter les conditions de vie et les activités économiques de toutes les régions du monde...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{impact of}} Society of Thoracic Surgeons {{predicted}} mortality risk score on resource use {{has not been}} previously studied. We hypothesize that increasing Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk scores in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement are associated with greater hospital charges. MethodsClinical and financial data for patients undergoing aortic valve replacement at The Johns Hopkins Hospital over a 10 -year period (January 2000 to December 2009) were reviewed. The current Society of Thoracic Surgeons formula (v 2. 61) for in-hospital mortality was used for all patients. After stratification into risk quartiles, index admission hospital charges were compared across risk strata with rank-sum and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Linear regression and Spearman’s coefficient assessed correlation and goodness of fit. Multivariable analysis assessed relative contributions of individual variables on overall charges. ResultsA total of 553 patients underwent aortic valve replacement during the study period. Average predicted mortality was 2. 9 % (± 3. 4) and actual mortality was 3. 4 % for aortic <b>valve</b> replacement. Median <b>charges</b> were greater in the upper quartile of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (quartiles 1 – 3, $ 39, 949 [interquartile range, 32, 708 – 51, 323] vs quartile 4, $ 62, 301 [interquartile range, 45, 952 – 97, 103], P < . 01]. On univariate linear regression, there was {{a positive correlation between}} Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score and log-transformed charges (coefficient, 0. 06; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 05 – 0. 07; P < . 01). Spearman’s correlation R-value was 0. 51. This positive correlation persisted in risk-adjusted multivariable linear regression. Each 1 % increase in Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score was associated with an added $ 3000 in hospital charges. ConclusionsThis is the first study to show that increasing Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score predicts greater <b>charges</b> after aortic <b>valve</b> replacement. As competing therapies, such as percutaneous valve replacement, emerge to treat high-risk patients, these results serve as a benchmark to compare resource use...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{surgical}} treatment of {{valvular heart disease}} has changed significantly {{in the past decade}} with more mitral valves being repaired and tissue valves implanted in the aortic position. The National Inpatient Sample was used to document national trends of primary isolated aortic and mitral valve surgical procedures. MethodsSubjects were adult patients who had an isolated aortic or mitral valve repair or replacement in the United States. Estimated institution cost and total billed charges data were provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ResultsFrom 1998 to 2005, an estimated 330, 000 aortic or mitral valve procedures were performed in the United States (repair, n = 46, 342; replacement, n = 287, 989). Since 1998, annual valve repair or replacement procedures increased 186. 6 % and 12. 6 %, respectively. Aortic valve repair or replacement procedures increased 102. 5 % and 28. 0 %, respectively, with an increased percentage for repairs from 2. 0 % in 1998 to 3. 1 % in 2005. Mitral valve repair procedures increased from 18. 9 % in 1998 to 45. 8 % in 2005, with mitral replacements decreasing 17. 2 % over the same period. Since 1998, the total hospital billed <b>charges</b> for aortic <b>valve</b> repair procedures increased 80. 6 % and aortic valve replacement procedures 90. 4 %; mitral valve repair procedures increased from 37. 8 %, replacement 42. 0 %. Annual increases in estimated institution cost increased for both aortic and mitral procedures on average 8 % to 9 %. ConclusionDuring the last decade the practice of valve surgery has changed significantly. The {{surgical treatment}} for mitral disease has transitioned to primarily one of repair, not replacement, with the use of bioprostheses more than doubled. For the aortic position, the primary procedure remained valve replacement with bioprosthesis being the valve of choice. Regardless of valve disease, institutional costs and charges for the surgical treatment have greatly outpaced physician reimbursement...|$|R
40|$|Although a first-law {{analysis}} {{can show the}} improvement that hydrogen addition impacts {{on the performance of}} a biogas-fuelled spark-ignition (SI) engine, additional benefits can be revealed when the second law of thermodynamics is brought into perspective. It is theoretically expected that hydrogen enrichment in biogas can increase the second-law efficiency of engine operation by reducing the combustion-generated irreversibilities, because of the fundamental differences in the mechanism of entropy generation between hydrogen and traditional hydrocarbon combustion. In this study, an experimentally validated closed-cycle simulation code, incorporating a quasi-dimensional multi-zone combustion model that is based on the combination of turbulent entrainment theory and flame stretch concepts for the prediction of burning rates, is further extended to include second-law analysis for the purpose of quantifying the respective improvements. The analysis is applied for a single-cylinder homogeneous charge SI engine, fuelled with biogas-hydrogen blends, with up to 15 vol% hydrogen in the fuel mixture, when operated at 1500 r/min, wide-open throttle, fuel-to-air equivalence ratio of 0. 9, and ignition timing of 20 ° crank angle before top dead centre. Among the major findings derived from the second-law balance during the closed part of the engine cycle is the increase in the second-law efficiency from 40. 85 per cent to 42. 41 per cent with hydrogen addition, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in the combustion irreversibilities from 18. 25 per cent to 17. 18 per cent of the total availability of the <b>charge</b> at inlet <b>valve</b> closing. It is also illustrated how both the increase in the combustion temperatures and the decrease in the combustion duration with increasing hydrogen content result in a reduction in the combustion irreversibilities. The degree of thermodynamic perfection of the combustion process from the second-law point of view is quantified by using two (differently defined) combustion exergetic efficiencies, whose maximum values during the combustion process increase with hydrogen enrichment from 49. 70 per cent to 53. 45 per cent and from 86. 01 per cent to 87. 33 per cent, respectively. © IMechE 2008...|$|R
