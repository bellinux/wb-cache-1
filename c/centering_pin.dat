40|$|The Turning Oars {{collection}} {{features a}} series of photographs depicting {{the process of creating}} oars for Cape Kiwanda Wood Products of Pacific City by partners Paul Hanneman and Terry Learned. To look at the process chronologically, view the images in numerical order (Turning Oars 001 — Turning Oars 072). Terry Learned provided the description for this image. This image provides a close-up view of the wedge shape of the oar blank situated in the headstock. With the <b>centering</b> <b>pin,</b> the oar blank will not fly out even if the fit into the metal is not perfectly tight. Some parts were missing when Paul Hanneman and Terry Learned purchased the machine, forcing them to be creative. For example, Learned found the large iron wheel seen here and welded the headstock to it. [URL]...|$|E

50|$|Studded {{tires are}} also used on bicycles, and the grip {{advantage}} on ice {{is similar to that}} from using traction sand, with the difference that there is no risk of blank spots when using studded tires. Quality tire manufacturers use studs with hard <b>center</b> <b>pins</b> also for bicycle tires, and just like their automobile counterparts, those studs will continue to protrude from the tire even after many years of usage on bare pavement. There are also low-quality studded bicycle tires being sold that have studs that lack the hard-metal <b>center</b> <b>pin</b> (there is still a <b>center</b> <b>pin,</b> but it is not made of hard metal). Such studs can wear out within a few weeks of cycling on dry pavement.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{parallel}} {{tracks of}} [...] were set approximately 9 ft apart. Between these two tracks, the standard and narrow gauge tracks descended into a pit, one from {{each end of}} the pit, overlapping in the center and having a common center line. Beams resting on trucks riding on the 18 in gauge tracks were inserted under the car to have its trucks changed. The car was then pushed over pit, resting on the beams. This allowed the old trucks to slip off the <b>center</b> <b>pins.</b> The old trucks were pulled out of the pit and new trucks were pushed in from the opposite side. As the car passed over {{the opposite side of the}} pit, the new trucks were guided to fit on the <b>center</b> <b>pins.</b> The car now continued on its way, its load undisturbed.|$|R

Smith & Wesson followed seven years later with the Hand Ejector, Model 1896 in [...]32 S&W Long caliber.
