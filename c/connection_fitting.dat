5000|$|An {{alternative}} to a low-pressure compressor for gas supply is high-pressure storage cylinders feeding through a pressure regulator which will be set to the required supply pressure for the depth and equipment in use. In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a gas panel. High-pressure bulk cylinders are quiet in operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested). This allows the relatively simple and reliable use of nitrox mixtures in surface-supplied diving. Bulk cylinders are also quiet in operation compared to a low-pressure compressor, but have the obvious limitation of amount of gas available.The usual configurations for surface-supplied bulk gas storage are large single cylinders of around 50 litres water capacity, often referred to as [...] "J"s or [...] "bombs","quads", which are a group (sometimes, but not necessarily four in number) of similar cylinders mounted on a frame and connected together to a common supply fitting, and [...] "kellys" [...] which are a group of [...] "tubes" [...] (long large volume pressure vessels) usually mounted in a container frame, and usually connected together to a common <b>connection</b> <b>fitting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square <b>connection</b> <b>fitting</b> (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|E
50|$|Busbars may be {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to electrical apparatus by bolted, clamped, or welded connections. Often, joints between high-current bus sections have precisely-machined matching surfaces that are silver-plated to reduce the contact resistance. At extra high voltages (more than 300 kV) in outdoor buses, corona discharge around the connections becomes a source of radio-frequency interference and power loss, so special <b>connection</b> <b>fittings</b> designed for these voltages are used.|$|R
50|$|The {{braiding}} also greatly {{increases the}} resistance of the hose to internal pressure. The braid flexibly moulds itself to the movement of the hose. This applies even if a second braiding is used, which further increases pressure resistance. The method by which the braiding is attached to the <b>connection</b> <b>fittings</b> depends on the type of fitting and the demands on the hose. Under rough operating conditions, an additional round wire coil can be wound over the braid or the braid can be sheathed in a protective hose.|$|R
50|$|Olet {{fittings}} (otherwise called Branch <b>Connection</b> <b>Fittings</b> or Outlet Fittings) will be fittings {{which give}} an outlet from a bigger pipe {{to a smaller}} one (or one of a similar size). The fundamental pipe onto which the branch association is welded is generally called the Run or Header size estimate. The pipe to which the branch association or connection gives a channel is normally called the Branch or Outlet size. Branch associations are in all sizes, sorts, bores, and classes, in an extensive variety of stainless steel, chrome-moly, and different amalgams alloys.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hot {{stamping}} ultra-high strength steel {{not only}} {{plays an important}} role in automotive field, but also has potential application in transmission line fittings industry. According to the current development status of Chinese electrical power fittings and the demand for new technique, combined with hot stamping technology, a new solution for reduction of weight in transmission line fittings has been proposed. This paper focuses on a new lightweight <b>connection</b> <b>fitting</b> with multilayer stack structure of ultra-high strength boron steel, and the key issue in design and manufacturing process of the deep U-shaped hot stamping stacked steel sheet. Numerical simulation method combining the experimental data is also used to predict mechanical performance of the new <b>connection</b> <b>fitting,</b> which provides guidance for the manufacturing process...|$|E
40|$|As the {{requirements}} {{and the demand}} on electronic packages increase, the thermal performance becomes {{one of the key}} considerations for electronic packages, especially for high frequency and high power applications. Thermal resistance, known as theta-ja in the electronic industry, is the measurement used to quantify the thermal performance of a package design. Therefore, the specification of the theta-ja measurement is critical and essential in this concern. In the JEDEC and the SEMI standards, the orientation of the testing board with package under testing is specified to be vertical. The board is subjected to an airflow within a wind tunnel, with the corresponding angle of attack prescribed to be zero degree. However, in practice, the angle of attack may not be zero, as it could vary due to the back-slash of the <b>connection</b> <b>fitting</b> or the misalignment of the installation. Previous numerical {{studies have shown that the}} effect of this variation in angle increases the thermal resistance. In the present study, it is shown that while the thermal resistance generally increases with the angle of attack, the minimum resistance does not correspond to the zero angle of attack. That is, the minimum resistance corresponds to an angle value slightly greater than zero. This result was confirmed experimentally. The change of airflow velocity on the surfaces was observed from numerical simulation model. The present results confirm the importance of fixing the angle of attack, which leads to the necessity of establishing a standard to ascertain this angle...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims to {{approach}} an important subject related to natural gas distribution networks which, {{depending on the}} expansion of the localities, are composed of intercommunicating pipes, pressure reducing stations and branch <b>connections</b> <b>fittings.</b> The urban networks are the most complex ones and the rural areas networks are the simplest. However, irrespective of their installation, they must meet the safety operating requirements as much as possible. According to standards, all these components must be tight and pressure resistant.

5000|$|Compression {{fittings}} {{are used}} in plumbing and electrical conduit systems to join two tubes or thin-walled pipes together. In instances where two pipes made of dissimilar materials are to be joined (most commonly PVC and copper), the fittings will be made {{of one or more}} compatible materials appropriate for the <b>connection.</b> Compression <b>fittings</b> for attaching tubing (piping) commonly have ferrules (or olives in the UK) in them.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{traditional}} {{types of}} compression fitting, standard (British type-A/non-manipulative) and flare fittings (British type-B/manipulative). Standard fittings require no {{modifications to the}} tubing. Flare fittings require modification of the tubing with a special tool. Standard fittings are typically used for water and compressed air <b>connections,</b> whereas flare <b>fittings</b> are used for gas and high pressure lines.|$|R
5000|$|Easier installation. Installing PEX is {{much less}} labor-intensive than copper pipes, {{since there is no}} need to use torches to solder pipes together, or to use glue to attach pipes to fittings. One home {{inspector}} wrote that [...] "Once you've worked with PEX, you'll never go back to that other stinky glue stuff." [...] Builders putting in radiant heating systems found that PEX pipes [...] "made installation easy and operation problem-free". PEX connections can be made by pushing together two matching parts using a compression fitting, or by using an adjustable wrench or a special crimping tool. Generally, fewer <b>connections</b> and <b>fittings</b> are needed in a PEX installation.|$|R

40|$|Nanoscale {{structures}} {{have been}} at the core of research efforts dealing with integration of nanotechnology into novel electronic devices for the last decade. For instance, the unique electrical and optical properties of nanowires, nanotubes and nanocables with vertical orientation, assembled in nanoscale arrays, have been used in many device applications such as sensors that hold the potential to augment brain functions. However, the challenge in creating nanowires/nanotubes or nanocables arrays based sensors lies in making individual electrical <b>connections</b> <b>fitting</b> both the features of the brain and of the nanostructures. This review discusses two of the most important applications of nanostructures in neuroscience. First, the current approaches to create nanowires and nanocable structures are reviewed to critically evaluate their potential of developing unique nanostructure based sensors to improve recording and device performance to reduce noise and the detrimental effect of the interface on the tissue. Second, the implementation of nanomaterials in neurobiological and medical applications will be considered from the brain augmentation perspective. Because the size of nanomaterials is of the same order of magnitude with that of biomolecules, these materials are valuable tools for nanoscale manipulation in a broad range of neurobiological systems. Novel applications for diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis, meningitis, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, and autism will be considered. Because the blood brain barrier (BBB) has a defensive mechanism in preventing nanomaterials arrival to the brain, various strategies to help them to passing through the BBB will be discussed. The nanostructures at the interface between nanotechnology and neuroscience will play a pivotal role not only in addressing the multitude of brain disorders but also to repair/augment brain functions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{argue that}} consequentialism may seem attractive, despite the {{well-known}} case intuitions against it, {{primarily due to}} the idea that it is clear how we have reason to bring about good states of affairs but entirely mysterious how we could have reason to do anything else. We show that a deep theoretical connection between good states of affairs and reasons to bring them about can indeed be vindicated by the conceptual connections between good states of affairs, fitting desires that they obtain, and reasons to act out of them. We argue, however, that the conceptual <b>connection</b> between <b>fitting</b> attitudes and reasons for action equally vindicates reasons to do things other than bring about the best states of affairs. The fittingness of motives other than desires for good states of affairs â some more intimately related to morality than such desires-undermines consequentialism whether as a theory of rationality or morality. ...|$|R
