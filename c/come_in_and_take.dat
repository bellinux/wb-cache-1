5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I knew that I was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> you down… Usually the athletes who win {{are the ones who}} can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Bono recounted another {{experience}} {{he had in}} El Salvador, where {{he had seen a}} body thrown from a van into the road. He remarked, [...] "People would just disappear. If you were part of the opposition, you might find an SUV with the windows blacked out parked outside your house.... If that didn't stop you, occasionally they would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> you and murder you; there would be no trial." [...] Bono understood the cause of the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to it. His experiences in Central America inspired the lyrics of [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] and another track from The Joshua Tree, [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cuts, McCall made a number of changes to his squad during the summer of 2009. His team started the 2009–10 season by going four games without scoring, until they {{recorded}} a 5–4 victory against Cheltenham Town. After the game, McCall said: [...] "That was the youngest, and certainly cheapest, team Bradford have put out {{for a long time and}} I’m really proud of them." [...] City continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy where they lost to Carlisle United, managed by McCall's friend Greg Abbott, but at the start of 2010 found themselves 16th in League Two and eight points off the play-offs after a run of five defeats in seven games. McCall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games, saying: [...] "The bottom line is that the players and me personally will get judged on results. And the results aren't good enough." [...] Despite the club's slide down the table, he denied he would resign, but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing Gareth Evans to give City a late 2–1 away at Torquay United saved McCall from being sacked. However, defeat to Bury in the club's following fixture was McCall's last game as manager, with McCall saying after the game: [...] "It's time for somebody else to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> up the reins and hopefully do well." [...] He won a little more than one-third of his 133games in charge of City. McCall left by mutual consent.|$|E
60|$|Now the men <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> up Saevuna's chair. Gudruda {{watched them}} bear her forth. Then {{suddenly}} she sprang {{from her seat}} and ran after her into the hall, weeping bitterly.|$|R

60|$|Reuben {{was again}} {{placed in the}} dock. The seats {{open to the public}} quickly filled, as the news spread through the town. Several {{of the members of the}} bar dropped <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> then the judge <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> his seat.|$|R
2500|$|In 1995, {{the fourth}} and final season, Kelley wrote only two episodes. [...] "We had almost 10 writers try to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> over for this one man", said Picket Fences actress Holly Marie Combs. [...] "The quality was not nearly what it was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conservative {{criticism}} of OWS {{has sometimes been}} vitriolic, casting the demonstrators as a thoroughly marginal group. [...] Andrew Hartman wrote in The Chronicle Review that [...] "many conservatives and pundits view the Wall Street protesters as envious ingrates looking for government handouts because they fear responsibility." [...] Kate Zernike said in The New York Times that the Tea Party Patriots [...] "portrayed Occupy protesters as freeloaders, or would-be freeloaders: 'Those occupying Wall Street and other cities, when they are intelligible, want less of what made America great and more of what is damaging to America: a bigger more powerful government to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> care of them so they don’t have to work {{like the rest of}} us who pay our bills.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Prue is in a {{park with}} Mac when crows <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> the baby off. Prue runs after Mac ({{followed}} by her classmate Curtis) who discovers he has been taken to the Impassable Wilderness. Prue heads home to her parents and manages {{to make it look}} like she still has Mac. Next morning she heads for the I.W. but discovers Curtis has once more followed her. Prue does not want Curtis along, but before she can send him back, they are separated while fleeing from Coyote Soldiers. Curtis is captured and taken to Alexandra, while Prue rides a mail truck to South Wood. There, Prue finds a Kafkaesque bureaucracy and dysfunctional government. Police state tactics and paranoia over foreign threats are used to keep the regime in power. Prue eventually meets the Crown Prince Owl Rex (who is later arrested), of the Avian Principality, who tells her how Alexandra came to be exiled. Alexandra's son Alexei died in a horse-riding accident, then her husband Grigor died of heartbreak; to remedy his death, Alexandra hired the two greatest toymakers in all of Wildwood to fashion her son a new body that was later brought to life via Black Magic by recalling his soul, but later Alexei learned the truth of his death and rebirth and so he destroyed a crucial part of his inner workings resulting in his death. Alexandra was exiled for the use of Black Magic and plotted her revenge, but many believed she would have never survived. Owl Rex proposes to Prue to cross Wildwood and find help from the Mystics of North Wood. Meanwhile, Alexandra is flattering Curtis with a fancy uniform and commissions him into the coyote army as an officer. In a battle against bandits Curtis breaks a howitzer by dumb luck, becoming a coyote war hero in the operation. He then finds [...] Mac in Alexandra's headquarters and she shows him her plan to sacrifice the baby to the ivy. Alexandra offers to share the power with Curtis, but he says no and is locked away with some other captured bandits and unfaithful coyotes.|$|E

25|$|Discussions and {{analysis}} still {{continue on the}} size of the migration, and whether it was a small elite band of Anglo-Saxons who <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> over the running of the country, or a mass migration of peoples who overwhelmed the Britons.|$|R
60|$|Pepper has {{his eyes}} open for the {{appearance}} of the students from Pornell. At first a few <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a stand <b>in</b> a corner, out of the way. They did not belong to the Bock crowd and seemed to be content to behave themselves.|$|R

60|$|The landlady <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a seat, {{without waiting}} to be invited, close by my side. She was no longer {{satisfied}} with merely asserting herself as my equal.

60|$|He {{reclined}} on his couch <b>in</b> the sitting-room, <b>and</b> extinguished the light.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes. I've got {{a little}} shack back here in the bush a hundred yards, and a pretty spring, and a few fruit trees and berry bushes. <b>Come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a look. And that spring is a dandy. You never tasted water like it. Come in and try it." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{spent the}} evening in little tastes {{of all their}} {{favourite}} drawing-room games, {{just for the sake}} of having tried them once more; <b>and</b> Papa himself <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> a share--a very rare treat;--and he always thought of such admirable things in [...] "Twenty questions," [...] and made [...] "What's my thought like ?"

60|$|Pickets <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> up the machetes, gasping men, {{dripping}} with perspiration, flung themselves {{down in the}} shadow until their turn came again, the sun climbed higher until it was almost overhead, and the juice exuded hot upon the toilers’ hands from the crackling stems, while the faint breeze seemed to have passed through a furnace, and the brightness was bewildering.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then Somers <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>took</b> the chair. I {{was very}} much afraid at one time that Father Barney was going to seat himself there." ...|$|R
60|$|Rachael {{was waiting}} for him when he returned.

6000|$|... "Molto bella!" [...] she cried, half ironically. [...] "Molto bella! Je vous envoie une rose--" [...] And {{she threw}} the roses out on to the drive.

It is the commonest thing in the world when a girl is left all alone as she is." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1871, a {{group of}} men from Toledo, Ohio {{organized}} a company to locate a colony of settlers in some western county. After traveling 20,000 miles in the Midwest, they decided on Nobles County and by the spring of 1872, hundreds of people <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> up land. Worthington became the County Seat in 1873. The Worthington & Sioux Falls Railway was established in 1876.

5000|$|At {{least five}} hundred {{came into my}} place Folklore Center ... and {{asked if it was}} about me. I don't know if it was, but it was unfair. I'm in the Village twenty-five years now.

Dylan <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>takes</b> from us, uses my resources, then he leaves and he gets bitter. He writes a bitter song. He was the one who left.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] was the answer. [...] "'Tis more direct, you see, no shoals, and {{the young}} gentlemen will get to their own homes and beds all the quicker.

5000|$|A {{few years}} after touring passed {{and they decided to}} make a new album.

25|$|The {{start of}} the match was delayed due to bad weather, but a full 50-over match was played, which {{resulted}} in West Indies' third defeat in four days.
