50|$|CRLs {{were first}} {{demonstrated}} in the mid-1990s {{by a group of}} scientists at the ESRF. They drilled holes in an aluminium block, and achieved focusing in two dimensions. For X-rays a <b>concave</b> <b>lens</b> <b>focuses</b> the X-rays because the index of refraction is slightly below unity. In a CRL of this type the walls between the cylindrical holes act as concave lenses for X-rays traveling perpendicular to the axis of the drilled cylinders. In contrast, for visible light the index of refraction is larger than unity and focusing is done with a convex lens.|$|R
40|$|This project's goal is {{the design}} of a Raman {{spectroscopy}} instrument to be utilized by NASA in an integrated spectroscopy strategy that will include Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Laser-Induced Florescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) for molecule and element identification on Mars Europa, and various asteroids. The instrument is to be down scaled from a dedicated rover mounted instrument into a compact unit with the same capabilities and accuracy as the larger instrument. The focus for this design is a spectrometer that utilizes Raman spectroscopy. The spectrometer has a calculated range of 218 nm wavelength spectrum with a resolution of 1. 23 nm. To filter out the laser source wavelength of 532 nm the spectrometer design utilizes a 532 nm wavelength dichroic mirror and a 532 nm wavelength notch filter. The remaining scatter signal is concentrated by a 20 x microscopic objective through a 25 -micron vertical slit into a 5 mm diameter, 1 cm focal length double <b>concave</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> The light is then diffracted by a 1600 Lines per Millimeter (L/mm) dual holographic transmission grating. This spectrum signal is captured by a 1 -inch diameter double convex 3 cm focal length capture lens. An Intensified Charge Couple Device (ICCD) is placed within the initial focal cone of the capture lens and the Raman signal captured is to be analyzed through spectroscopy imaging software. This combination allows for accurate Raman spectroscopy to be achieved. The components for the spectrometer have been bench tested in a series of prototype developments based on theoretical calculations, alignment, and scaling strategies. The mounting platform is 2. 5 cm wide by 8. 8 cm long by 7 cm height. This platform has been tested and calibrated with various sources such as a neon light source and ruby crystal. This platform is intended to be enclosed in a ruggedized enclosure for mounting on a rover platform. The size and functionality of the Raman spectrometer allows for the rover to carry other mission critical devices. This project will be continued at NASA until the requirements are met for the expected initial 2020 launch date...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} discloses {{a combined}} piezoelectric vibrator and a preparation method thereof. The combined piezoelectric vibrator comprises {{a plurality of}} piezoelectric columns which are distributed in arrays. The piezoelectric columns are bonded into a combined body through polymers. The upper surface of the combined body is an inwards concave curved surface. The upper end surfaces of the piezoelectric columns are exposed out of the upper surface of the combined body. The lower end surfaces of the piezoelectric columns are exposed out of the lower surface of the combined body. Two layers of electrode materials are respectively plated on the upper surface and the lower surface. By adopting the scheme, since the upper surface which {{is used as a}} transmitting surface of the piezoelectric vibrator is inwards concave, the energy of sound waves can be concentrated in an area required to be detected, the sensitivity and the lateral resolution of an ultrasonic transducer can be improved, the electromechanical coupling factor is improved and the mechanical quality factor is effectively reduced. Besides, since the upper surface of the piezoelectric vibrator is inwards <b>concave</b> and <b>focused,</b> sound <b>lens</b> materials are not required to be additionally used, the structure of the ultrasonic transducer is simplified and the energy loss caused by a sound lens during sound wave transmission is reduced. 本发明公开了一种复合压电振子及其制备方法，该压电振子包括：呈阵列分布的多个压电柱，多个压电柱由聚合物粘结成一复合体，复合体的上表面为内凹的曲面，多个压电柱的上端面暴露于该上表面，该多个压电柱的下端面暴露于该复合体的下表面，该上表面及该下表面分别镀有一层电极材料。本发明的方案中，由于作为压电振子的发射面的上表面内凹，可将声波的能量集中在需要探测的区域，可提高超声换能器的灵敏度及横向分辨率，提升机电耦合系数，有效地降低了机械品质因数值。此外，该压电振子本身由于上表面内凹而聚焦，因此不需要额外使用声透镜材料，精简了超声换能器的结构和减少声透镜造成的声波传输过程中能量的损失。Department of Applied PhysicsInventor name used in this publication: 周丹Inventor name used in this publication: 张国峰Inventor name used in this publication: 林国豪Inventor name used in this publication: 陈燕Inventor name used in this publication: 戴吉岩Inventor name used in this publication: 陈王丽华Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種復合壓電振子及其製備方法Chin...|$|R

Using William Crawford's concept of photographic 'syntax', the use of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is explored as an example of how technology shapes style. 	A detailed study of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> from the earliest forms to the present is presented, enumerating the core properties of pinhole, early experimental and commercial soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses.</b> This was researched via published texts in period journals, advertising, private correspondence, interviews, and the lenses themselves. The author conducted a wide range of in-studio experiments with both period and contemporary soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> to evaluate their character and distinct features, as well as to validate source material. 	Nodal points of this history and development are explored in the critical debate between the diffuse and sharp photographic image, beginning with the competition between the calotype and daguerreotype. The role of George Davison's The Old Farmstead is presented as well as the invention of the first modern soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens,</b> the Dallmeyer-Bergheim, and its function in the development of the popular Pictorialist lens, the Pinkham & Smith Semi-Achromatic. The trajectory of the soft <b>focus</b> <b>lens</b> is plotted against the Pictorialist movement, noting the correlation betwixt them, and the modern renaissance of soft <b>focus</b> <b>lenses</b> and the diffuse aesthetic.

50|$|Overhead {{projectors}} normally {{include a}} manual focusing mechanism which raises and lowers {{the position of}} the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> (including the folding mirror) in order to adjust the object distance (optical distance between the slide and the <b>lens)</b> to <b>focus</b> at the chosen image distance (distance to the projection screen) given the fixed focal length of the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> This permits a range of projection distances.|$|R
50|$|An {{overhead}} projector {{works on the}} same principle as a 35mm slide projector, in which a <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> projects light from an illuminated slide onto a projection screen where a real image is formed. However some differences are necessitated by the much larger size of the transparencies used (generally {{the size of a}} printed page), and the requirement that the transparency be placed face up (and readable to the presenter). For the latter purpose, the projector includes a mirror just before or after the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> to fold the optical system toward the horizontal. That mirror also accomplishes a reversal of the image in order that the image projected onto the screen corresponds to that of the slide as seen by the presenter looking down at it, rather than a mirror image thereof. Therefore, the transparency is placed face up (toward the mirror and <b>focusing</b> <b>lens),</b> in contrast with a 35mm slide projector or film projector (which lack such a mirror) where the slide's image is non-reversed on the side opposite the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|R

50|$|Because the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> (typically {{less than}} 10 cm in in diameter) {{is much smaller}} than the transparency, a crucial role is played by the optical {{condenser}} which illuminates the transparency. Since this requires a large optical lens (at least the size of the transparency) but may be of poor optical quality (since the sharpness of the image does not depend on it), a Fresnel lens is employed. The Fresnel lens is located at (or is part of) the glass plate on which the transparency is placed, and serves to redirect most of the light hitting it into a converging cone toward the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens.</b> Without such a condenser at that point, most of the light would miss the <b>focusing</b> <b>lens</b> (or {{it would have to be}} very large and prohibitively expensive). Additionally, mirrors or other condensing elements below the Fresnel lens serve to increase the portion of the light bulb's output which reaches the Fresnel lens in the first place. In order to provide sufficient light on the screen, a high intensity bulb is used which must be fan cooled.|$|R
