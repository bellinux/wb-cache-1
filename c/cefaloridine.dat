40|$|About 1500 {{strains of}} El Tor vibrios, {{isolated}} in 1964 and 1965 in the Philippines, were examined for their susceptibilities to 17 drugs. All the strains tested were highly sensitive to dihydroxymethyl-furalazine, and most were highly sensitive to tetracycline hydrochloride, chloramphenicol and erythromycin, and moderately sensitive to novobiocin, dihydrostreptomycin sulfate, kanamycin and neomycin. They showed a remarkable fluctuation of sensitivity to ampicillin, <b>cefaloridine,</b> cefalotin and sulfafurazole, {{and a high}} resistance to benzylpenicillin sodium, oleandomycin and spiramycin...|$|E
40|$|Padilla, C. (reprint author), 2 Norte 685, Talca, Chile. Univ Talca, Lab Invest Microbiol, Talca, Chile. Objective: To analyse the {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} the peptide PsVP- 10 against 67 resistant Enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from clinical samples. Methods: The qualitative disc diffusion method and MIC determinations were used. Results: The presence of several multidrug-resistant phenotypes of E. faecalis was demonstrated, in which there were high MICs to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, vancomycin, <b>cefaloridine,</b> ampicillin and gentamicin. In comparison, the peptide PsVP- 10 showed lower MICs against all the multidrug-resistant and susceptible E. faecalis. Conclusions: There is an urgent need {{for the development of}} novel antimicrobial agents against the highly resistant E. faecalis. The present study shows that the peptide PsVP- 10 might make a contribution to the solution of this serious problem...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCaulobacter crescentus 101123 {{possesses}} a gene (Mbl 1 b) encoding a metallo-β-lactamase with 32 % amino acid identity to the L 1 metallo-β-lactamase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The gene was cloned into an expression vector and the enzyme, Mbl 1 b, was expressed in Escherichia coli. Mbl 1 b was purified. Catalytic properties for several antibiotics were determined. The enzyme exhibits Michaelis–Menten kinetics for imipenem, meropenem and nitrocefin but substrate inhibition kinetics with cefoxitin, <b>cefaloridine,</b> penicillin G and ampicillin. A homology model predicts Mbl 1 b {{has the same}} structural fold as other metallo-β-lactamases with a detailed structure very similar to L 1 but whereas L 1 is a homotetramer, Mbl 1 b is monomeric. The main differences between Mbl 1 and L 1 are in the N-terminal region...|$|E
40|$|Penicillin-binding {{proteins}} (PBPs) are {{the targets}} of beta-lactam antibiotics. We have used a systematic five-alanine substitution method (called ASS [alanine stretch scanning] mutagenesis) to investigate the functional or structural role of various stretches of amino acids in the PBP 1 b of Escherichia coli. To probe the specific activity of each variant, the antibiotic discs assay was used with strain QCB 1 (delta ponB) {{in the presence of}} <b>cefaloridine,</b> which totally inhibits the complementing action of PBP 1 a. This in vivo test has been combined with a quick and efficient in vitro test of the penicillin-binding activity of each of these variants with fluorescent penicillin. This approach has enabled us to show an unexpected role of the N-terminal and C-terminal tails of PBP 1 b. Moreover, we have established the correct position in PBP 1 b of the SMN motif that, with the SXXK and the KTG motifs, constitutes the signature of the penicilloyl serine transferases family. Finally, we have shown that the transglycosylase and the transpeptidase domains are separated by an inert linker region, where substitutions and insertions can be made without hindering the in vivo and in vitro activity of the protein...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether {{a range of}} b-lactam antibiotics conjugate to and hence reduce the activity of IFN-g, {{as has been shown}} for penicillin G. A selection of penicillins, cephalosporins, a monobactam (aztreonam), a b-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid), a carbapenem (meropenem) and the non-b-lactam penicillin derivative D-penicillamine were tested for their effect on IFN-g activity. Methods: Following exposure to a range of concentrations of these compounds, for varying lengths of time, IFN-g activity was assayed by induction of CD 54 {{on the surface of the}} lung epithelial cell line A 549, utilizing an ELISA. Results: Clavulanic acid, cefoxitin and <b>cefaloridine</b> were the most potent inhibitors of IFN-g activity, followed by cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and phenoxymethylpenicillin. Ampicillin was less inhibitory than penicillin G, whilst meropenem and aztreonam had the least effect and D-penicillamine had no effect. The modulatory effect of these compounds was not due to a direct effect on CD 54 induction. Unlike freshly prepared drugs, aged preparations of penicillin G and clavulanic acid had no significant effect on IFN-g activity. Conclusions: b-Lactams differ in their capacity to modulate human IFN-g activity. This finding may have implications for the immunomodulatory effects of b-lactams and for the design both of b-lactams that do not affect the immune system and those which may be used therapeutically to target cytokine action...|$|E
