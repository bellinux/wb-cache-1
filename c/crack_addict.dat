500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] and [...] "Super Rich Kids" [...] depict decadent, {{alluring}} rich people, and {{are tied}} together by [...] "Not Just Money", a spoken interlude {{with a woman}} discussing the importance of money on happiness. [...] "Super Rich Kids" [...] references the thumping piano line of Elton John's 1973 song [...] "Bennie and the Jets" [...] and addresses young, wealthy characters' ennui and fears {{of the financial crisis}} with dry humor. [...] "Pilot Jones" [...] employs magic realism and escapist imagery, and depicts an emotional dependency between drug addicts, who confuse friendship with sexual love in their support of each other. The swooning song contains hazy electronic blips, impressionistic textures, experimental beat patterns, refracted sound effects, and vocal improvisation expressing the narrator's [...] "high". [...] "Crack Rock" [...] depicts a <b>crack</b> <b>addict,</b> likens love to the highs and lows of drug use, and broadly addresses corruption, broken homes, gun violence, and government indifference to rising crack-related deaths. It has fleeting multi-tracked harmonies, a non-sequitur chorus, and Ocean's occasionally fractured breathiness conveying an addict's voice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next three}} singles {{released}} from the album failed to enter the top 10, breaking a run stretching back to the 1996 single [...] "Trash". Anderson also attracted more criticism from fans for his frequent use of redundant vocabulary and limited lyrical themes. The track which received the most attention and criticism was [...] "Savoir Faire". Some critics felt that the album's lyricism could be linked to Anderson's heavy drug use at the time, especially when he later admitted that he [...] "was a <b>crack</b> <b>addict</b> for ages". Speaking of his addiction, which plagued him {{for two and a}} half years, Anderson said, [...] "Anyone who has ever tried crack will know exactly why I took it. It's the scariest drug in the world because the hit you get from it is so, so seductive. I wanted to experience that, and I did – repeatedly." [...] Suede headlined the Roskilde and V Festivals in July and August 1999 respectively. During 2000, there was press speculation that Suede were on the verge of disbanding, which was not helped by Codling's absence from some European gigs. Anderson denied these claims and insisted that Codling was healthy and that they were keen to record the next album. For the whole of 2000, Suede retreated from the public and played only one gig, in Reykjavik, Iceland. The band premiered several new songs that eventually appeared on the final album.|$|E
