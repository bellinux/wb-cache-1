They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design. Under Tom Porter, the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in Toy Story came from real objects: a shader for the <b>curtain</b> <b>fabric</b> in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth. Under Galyn Susman and Sharon Calahan, the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a [...] "render farm" [...] of 117 Sun Microsystems computers that ran 24 hours a day. Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week. Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total. There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots. A camera team, aided by David DiFrancesco, recorded the frames onto film stock. Toy Story was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen. During post-production, the film was sent to Skywalker Sound, where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.|$|E

40|$|Long lasting insect {{repellent}} curtain fabrics were developed and characterized. Different types of fabrics which are generally used in manufacture of curtain fabrics were functionalized with monochlorotriazenyl β-cyclodextrin (MCT-β-CD) then treated with different concentration from permethrin to impart the fabric {{insect repellent}} properties. These fabrics were 100 % cotton, cotton/viscose, cotton/linen, polyester/cotton, polyester/linen and polyester/viscose blend fabrics. The treated curtain fabrics were evaluated for insect repellent retention capacity against mosquitoes. The repellent efficacy comprises {{the determination of}} percent mosquitoes repelled, knockdown and killed (mortality) resulting from exposed mosquitoes to the treated fabric. Results obtained shows that, the insect repellent retention capacity of curtain fabrics functionalized with R-β-CD then treated with permethrin depends {{on the amount of}} β-CD moieties on the curtain fabrics, type of fabric and permethrin concentration. Higher action is obtained when the fabric was functionalized with 100 g/L, MCT-β-CD in alkaline medium followed by treatment with 15 g/L permethrin. The results show also that, <b>curtain</b> <b>fabric</b> made of cotton/linen shows highest mosquitoes repellent retention capacity and highest resistance against washing compared with 100 % cotton or cotton/viscose or polyester based curtain fabrics. The insect repellent treatment of curtain fabrics did not adversely affect the tensile strength or drapability index of <b>curtain</b> <b>fabric...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{flexible}} {{sound shielding}} curtain contains {{a plurality of}} sound insulating sheet inserts encased within pockets or otherwise secured on the exterior surfaces of the panels of a curtain. The sound insulating sheet inserts may be constructed {{of a combination of}} materials selected and configured such that sound impinging upon the curtain is absorbed or alternatively reflected. The sound shielding curtain can be tuned to insulate an area from a select range of frequencies inherent in select environments. Tuning may be accomplished through the selection and installation of sound insulating sheet inserts configured to reflect or absorb audible acoustical energy. The sound insulating sheet inserts are readily removable to permit periodic laundering of the <b>curtain</b> <b>fabric</b> and to provide adaptability for a number of applications. Sound shielding curtain(s) can be selected, configured, installed, and extended in such a manner as to provide sound reduction in a localized space. The sound shielding curtain(s) may also be configured with a view window by replacing a portion of one or more sound insulating sheets with an acoustically hard transparent material. The acoustically hard material may also comprise a panel of controllable privacy film. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E

50|$|In 1886 Friedrich Baumann and Albert Brand {{founded the}} company «Brand & Baumann» for the {{manufacture}} {{and distribution of}} linen goods. The two entrepreneurs went their separate ways {{at the start of}} the 20th century. Friedrich Baumann set up his own business called «Baumann-Grütter», which was taken on by his sons Willy and Fritz in 1930. Willy was responsible for the finances, whilst Fritz looked after manufacture and distribution. Step by step they built up exports. After the Second World War, the enterprise was split into two; an upholstery fabric manufacturing plant and a linen weaving mill. Fritz Baumann took charge of the linen weaving mill, which later developed into the trademark «Création Baumann». In 1951 the entreprise, which meanwhile was also producing <b>curtain</b> <b>fabrics,</b> relocated to new buildings at the Bern-Zürich-Strasse in Langenthal, at which Création Baumann's headquarters are still today. The company achieved continuous growth and exports flourished. In 1976 the third generation took charge of the company with Joerg Baumann. Création Baumann already numbered 200 employees. The trademark was promoted worldwide and in 1985 turnover reached the 40 million Swiss franc mark for the first time. Since 2000, the management has been under the stewardship of Philippe Baumann, the fourth generation Baumann entrusted with the management of the company. In the last few years export accounted for between 73 and 75 percent of sales.|$|R
