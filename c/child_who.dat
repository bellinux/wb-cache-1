40|$|The study {{investigated}} the teachers’ opinions about inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind; the factors which may influence their opinions and what they think {{can be done to}} include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind in primary schools. It was a qualitative study which purposely involved five teachers from two primary schools. Data was collected through interviews. The centre of interest in the study was on the acceptance of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind by the teachers; participation of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind in classroom and outdoor activities, benefits of placing <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind in mainstream primary schools, the challenges of including <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind in the mainstream and what teachers think ca be done to overcome such challenges. The study findings revealed that the nature of attitudes the teachers had towards <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind, additional disability and class size determined the teachers’ acceptance of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind. The teachers also believed that <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind can be helped to participate in school activities through classroom and physical environmental modifications; curriculum modifications and provision of specialised equipment. Teachers felt that placement of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind in the mainstream can make them achieve social benefits; academic benefits and acquire special skills. The study findings also revealed that for successful inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind, teachers needed support in the provision of special specialised equipment; collaboration with other professionals; construction and equipping the resource rooms where remedial support for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind can be exercised. The following challenges were expressed by the teachers: Lack of skills and competence, large class sizes and lack of specialised equipment. In order to overcome these challenges, teachers used various methods of teaching for example peer teaching, cooperative learning and team teaching. It is suggested that training and re-training of teachers in the filed of Special Needs Education, provision of specialised equipment, recruitment of more teachers and awareness seminars may help in the inclusion of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are blind...|$|R

40|$|Different authors {{agree that}} {{stuttering}} is a multifactorial disorder that {{manifests itself in}} verbal, psychological, physiological, physical and social fields and requires corresponding evaluation, diagnosis and treatment (Conture 2001 Logan, Yaruss, 1999 Vanryckeghem, Brutten, 1997 Zebrowski, Kelly, 2002). Contemporary research links the development of stuttering with certain temperamental characteristics, among which extraversion plays an important role. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate one such temperamental characteristic – extraversion – in Slovenian preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter and to compare these children with their fluently-speaking peers. Using a parent administered questionnaire (Inventory of Children’s Individual Differences, Zupančič, Kavčič, 2009), extraversion as a temperamental characteristic was assessed in 49 <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter and in 75 <b>children</b> <b>who</b> do not stutter. All children were aged between 3 and 6 years. The results demonstrated that preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter achieved, on average, a statistically significantly lower score on the dimension of extraversion than preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> do not stutter. Accordingly, <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter are not as extraverted, active, sociable and open to experience as <b>children</b> <b>who</b> speak fluently...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{gives an}} insight in the consisentcy between <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had been {{witnessing}} {{domestic violence and}} <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had been maltreated in an other way.

It appeared that more then half of the <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had witnessed domestic violence suffered from {{at least one other}} form of maltreatment. No differences were found in the nine characteristics that had been tested in their distributions for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had witnessed domestic violence compared with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had maltreated in another form.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the communication attitude of Slovenian preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter by means of the Communication Attitude Test for Preschool and Kindergarten <b>Children</b> <b>who</b> Stutter (KiddyCAT), and to determine whether differences in communication attitude existed among preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter, and their peers who are fluent speakers. In addition, the test’s discriminant value, its internal reliability and the factors underpinning the Slovenian version of the KiddyCAT were explored. Methods and Procedure: Data were gathered on a normative sample of 49 preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter and 74 who do not stutter. The children were divided into two subgroups according to age: a ‘’younger’’ (3 to 4, 4 years old) and ‘’older’’ (4, 5 to 6 years old) group. Outcomes and Results: Results showed that preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter scored statistically significantly higher on the KiddyCAT than preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> do not stutter. The effect size was large. A mean increase in scores among the preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter was observed, but was not statistically significant. An opposite observation, again not significant, was made for preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> do not stutter. Also gender did not affect the test results. The test is internally reliable and has construct validity. Conclusion and Implications: The KiddyCAT is a useful tool for early detection of negative communication attitude of preschool <b>children</b> <b>who</b> stutter and helps in targeting cognitive-related stuttering intervention goals...|$|R
5|$|Born the {{daughter}} of a commoner—Edward Hyde (later created Earl of Clarendon)—Anne is best known for her marriage to James, which caused much gossip. Two months after the marriage, Anne gave birth to the couple's first <b>child,</b> <b>who</b> had obviously been conceived out of wedlock. Until near the end of Anne's life, some observers disapproved of James' decision to marry Anne, but not King Charles II, James' brother, who wanted the marriage to take place. Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century.|$|E

He inaugurated popular Saturday-night concerts during the winter months and, keen to reduce the incidence of infant mortality, gave a sovereign to the mother of every <b>child</b> <b>who</b> reached the age of one.

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a <b>child</b> <b>who</b> can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it.|$|E

5|$|Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as {{his mother}} {{was the only person}} {{remaining}} in the Protestant line to the throne established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a <b>child</b> <b>who</b> survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.|$|E
