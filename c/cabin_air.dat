5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E

50|$|In 1973, Tallon set up {{the agency}} Design Programmes. Brother-in-arms with the LIP watchmakers, he created the Mach 2000 brand of watches and chronometers. In 1974, with Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, he created a concept {{aircraft}} <b>cabin</b> for <b>Air</b> France.|$|R
25|$|In the 787, <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> enters {{from under}} the {{fuselage}} and is compressed as required. De-icing is achieved by electro-thermal heating elements embedded in the wing's leading edge. Hydraulic pumps for flaps, slats, speed brakes and other control surfaces are also powered electrically.|$|E
25|$|The APU (auxiliary power unit) {{does not}} need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are {{improved}} {{due to the lack of}} bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air cycle machine (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> supply is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016, Tesla made {{minor changes}} in the Model S. The front fascia has a similar design as the Model X, adding {{adaptive}} LED headlights.

25|$|Many {{lobbying}} {{groups have}} been set up to advocate for research into this alleged hazard. The groups include the Aviation Organophosphate Information Site (AOPIS) (2001), the Global <b>Cabin</b> <b>Air</b> Quality Executive (2006) and the UK-based Aerotoxic Association (2007). Cabin Environment Research is one of many functions of the ACER Group, but their researchers have not yet established any causal relationship relationship.|$|E

50|$|The Beechcraft 60 Duke is an American-built {{twin-engine}} {{fixed-wing aircraft}} created by Beechcraft. The aircraft has retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} and a pressurized cabin. The two piston engines are turbocharged and the turbochargers also pressurize the <b>cabin</b> with bleed <b>air.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another hypothesis, {{advanced}} {{by the original}} crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft. A similar hypothesis, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.|$|E
25|$|In some engines, {{bleed air}} is also tapped to provide power for accessories, {{as well as}} a {{mechanical}} shaft drive. Bleed air is particularly useful when a source of compressed air is specifically needed, either to pressurise <b>cabin</b> <b>air,</b> or as a supply of cooling air to other components (to avoid excess heat, this is taken for a low-pressure tapping, or from the LP compressor of a two-shaft engine). One important use for bleed air is for cross-starting of other engines in a multi-engine aircraft.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 1975, NTO {{poisoning}} {{affected the}} three U.S. astronauts {{on board the}} Apollo-Soyuz Test Project during its final descent. This was due to a switch negligently, or accidentally, left in the wrong position, which allowed NTO fumes to vent out of the Apollo spacecraft then back in through the <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> intake from the outside air after the external vents were opened. One crew member lost consciousness during descent. Upon landing, the crew was hospitalized for 14 days for chemical-induced pneumonia and edema.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-late 1980s, Aeroflot's {{domestic}} {{flights were}} noted consistently as [...] "harrowing" [...] experiences for both Western and Soviet passengers.

50|$|At a maximum, three Dm12 units can be coupled into a {{train to}} {{increase}} capacity.

There are two places for wheelchair-using passengers, the unit has lifting platforms for wheelchair access and the toilet is designed to be accessible to the disabled. The heating of the passenger compartments uses waste heat from the diesel engines.|$|R
50|$|During the mid-1970s, several secondhand Electras {{were bought}} by travel clubs, {{including}} Adventurers and Shillelaghs. Others were retired from passenger service into air cargo use, 40 being modified by {{a subsidiary of}} Lockheed from 1968 {{with one or two}} large doors in {{the left side of the}} fuselage and a reinforced <b>cabin</b> floor. <b>Air</b> California and Pacific Southwest Airlines were still operating Electras for passenger service during the late 1970s into smaller airports in the western United States.|$|R
25|$|The Space Shuttle was {{the first}} American {{spacecraft}} to have an Earth-like atmospheric mixture, comprising 22% oxygen and 78% nitrogen.

The Shuttle Reference Manual contains ECLSS sections on: Crew Compartment Cabin Pressurization, <b>Cabin</b> <b>Air</b> Revitalization, Water Coolant Loop System, Active Thermal Control System, Supply and Waste Water, Waste Collection System, Waste Water Tank, Airlock Support, Extravehicular Mobility Units, Crew Altitude Protection System, and Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Cooling and Gaseous Nitrogen Purge for Payloads.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{completed}} {{detailed design}} for the −10 on December 2, 2015. Major assembly began in March 2016. Designers targeted 90% commonality between the 787-9 and -10 and achieved 95%; the 18-ft stretch was reached by adding 10ft forward of the wing and 8ft aft, and by strengthening the fuselage for bending loads in the center wingbox. Because of the length and additional tail strike protection needed, a semilevered landing gear enables rotation over the aft wheels {{rather than at the}} bogie center, like the 777-300ER, and the <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> conditioning system has 15% more capacity. The first and third -10s have Rolls-Royce's new Trent 1000 TEN engines, while the second is powered by the competing General Electric GEnx-1B engine.|$|E
25|$|The Boeing Model 307 Stratoliner was {{the first}} {{commercial}} transport aircraft to enter service with a pressurized cabin. This feature allowed the aircraft to cruise {{at an altitude of}} 20,000ft (6,000m), well above many weather disturbances. The pressure differential was 2.5psi (17kPa), so at 14,700ft (4,480m) the <b>cabin</b> <b>air</b> pressure was equivalent to an altitude of 8,000ft (2,440m). The Model 307 had capacity for a crew of six and 33 passengers. The cabin was nearly 12ft (3.6m) across. It {{was the first}} land-based aircraft to include a flight engineer as a crew member (several flying boats had included a flight engineer position earlier). In addition to its civilian service it was also flown as the Boeing C-75 Stratoliner by the United States Army Air Forces, who used it as a long-range cargolift aircraft.|$|E
