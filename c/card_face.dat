At {{the beginning of each}} season, each player secretly plans which action a region will take. Players assign actions to regions by placing the proper region <b>card</b> <b>face</b> down over the appropriate action. Blank region cards allow each player to hide which actions a player has selected to pass on.|$|E

2500|$|The dealer deals {{cards from}} his/her left (the {{position}} on the dealer's far left {{is often referred to}} as [...] "first base") to his/her far right ("third base"). Each box is dealt an initial hand of two cards visible to the people playing on it, and often to any other players. The dealer's hand receives its first <b>card</b> <b>face</b> up, and in [...] "hole card" [...] games immediately receives its second <b>card</b> <b>face</b> down (the hole card), which the dealer peeks at but does not reveal unless it makes the dealer's hand a blackjack. Hole card games are sometimes played on tables with a small mirror or electronic sensor that is used to peek securely at the hole card. In European casinos, [...] "no hole card" [...] games are prevalent; the dealer's second card is neither drawn nor consulted until the players have all played their hands.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{with the}} {{player on the}} dealer's left, each player in turn lays one <b>card</b> <b>face</b> up {{on the table in}} front of him or her, stating the count—that is, the {{cumulative}} value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says [...] "five", the next lays a six and says [...] "eleven", and so on)—without the count going above 31. The cards are not laid in the centre of the table as, at the end of the [...] "play," [...] each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.|$|E
2500|$|Players {{are each}} dealt two cards, face {{up or down}} {{depending}} on the casino and the table at which you sit. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer receives one <b>card</b> <b>face</b> up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value {{is the sum of}} the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called [...] "soft", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card; the value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21. Otherwise, the hand is [...] "hard".|$|E
50|$|Pöytäpaska (Table Shit) {{also known}} as Espanjalainen paskahousu (Spanish Shitpants) can be played by two or three players. The rules {{are the same as}} in Paskahousu, with the {{following}} additions. In addition to the hand, each player is dealt four <b>cards</b> <b>face</b> down and four <b>cards</b> <b>face</b> up on the table. They are played after the stock and the cards in your hand have exhausted. The <b>cards</b> <b>face</b> up are played before the <b>cards</b> <b>face</b> down. Note that you are allowed to see a <b>face</b> down <b>card</b> only when you (try to) play it. If it cannot be played according to the rules, you must take the card and the entire pile to your hand. If you must take the pile when playing the table cards, the pile becomes your hand cards, and you must get rid of your hand cards before you can continue playing from the table.|$|R

2500|$|The only {{exception}} to this rule is the Ace Check rule. If a player holds three or more Aces in his hand, that player may use the phrase Ace Check during the bidding round. The partner then discloses {{whether or not they}} have an Ace. If the initiating partner can now determine that all four Aces are held within the partnership, he or she may pass a <b>card</b> <b>face</b> down to his or her partner. Doing so creates a special contract where if the partnership retains all 4 Aces after all cards are played for the hand, they receive a 100-point bonus. If not, they receive a 100-point penalty. The Ace Check variant is optional to Partnership Bidding, and is generally only used in combination with [...] "Deuces High" [...] or similar Trump Variants where the Ace of Spades is more difficult to retain since other cards in the deck are assigned a higher rank.|$|E
