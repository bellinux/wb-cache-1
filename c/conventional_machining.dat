Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. Stereolithography (STL) {{is one of the most}} common file types that 3D printers can read. Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the <b>conventional</b> <b>machining</b> process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Machining of {{the part}} surface on the <b>conventional</b> <b>machine</b> tool {{sometimes}} presents geometrical problems that are not envisioned in classical geometry of surfaces. This paper presents definition and illustration of the basic conditions of proper part surface generating while <b>machining</b> on <b>conventional</b> <b>machine</b> tool, i. e. on turning machine tool, on milling machine tool, on machine tool for gear manufacturing operations etc. This result is significant for it substantiates earlier works in planning of part surface machining operations. From a theoretical viewpoint, {{it is remarkable that}} one can analytically describe all basic geometrical conditions that are necessary for proper part surface generating while <b>machining</b> on <b>conventional</b> <b>machine</b> tool.

50|$|Abrasive {{machining}} {{works by}} forcing the abrasive particles, or grains, into {{the surface of}} the workpiece so that each particle cuts away a small bit of material. Abrasive machining is similar to <b>conventional</b> <b>machining,</b> such as milling or turning, because each of the abrasive particles acts like a miniature cutting tool. However, unlike <b>conventional</b> <b>machining</b> the grains are much smaller than a cutting tool, and the geometry and orientation of individual grains are not well defined. As a result, abrasive machining is less power efficient and generates more heat.The grain size may be different based on the machining. For rough grinding, coarse abrasives are used. For fine grinding, fine grains (abrasives) are used.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{solution}} {{to overcome the}} shortcoming of <b>conventional</b> tensile test <b>machines</b> in dealing with unsymmetrical materials and off-axis testing of composites is presented. <b>Conventional</b> testing <b>machines</b> are designed {{on the basis of}} subjecting a specimen to axial load to determine the stiffness and strength of the material. For specimens with unsymmetrical cross-section this method is no longer valid due to induced additional bending stresses. To overcome this problem a novel tensile test machine was designed, which allows bending deformation, thus subjecting the specimen to pure tension instead of axial loading. To validate the design, the machine was fabricated and employed for tensile testing of an aluminum specimen with unsymmetrical cross-section. The comparison of test results from a <b>conventional</b> <b>machine</b> and from analytically calculations, based on pure tension, reveals that <b>conventional</b> <b>machine</b> generates significant errors, while the results from new machine are in good agreement.

50|$|Plowing {{occurs when}} {{material}} is displaced to the side, {{away from the}} wear particles, resulting {{in the formation of}} grooves that do not involve direct material removal. The displaced material forms ridges adjacent to grooves, which may be removed by subsequent passage of abrasive particles. Cutting occurs when material is separated from the surface in the form of primary debris, or microchips, with little or no material displaced to the sides of the grooves. This mechanism closely resembles <b>conventional</b> <b>machining.</b> Fragmentation occurs when material is separated from a surface by a cutting process and the indenting abrasive causes localized fracture of the wear material. These cracks then freely propagate locally around the wear groove, resulting in additional material removal by spalling.|$|E
50|$|Grinding wheel wear is an {{important}} measured factor of grinding in the manufacturing process of engineered parts and tools. Grinding involves the removal process of material and modifying {{the surface of a}} workpiece to some desired finish which might otherwise be unachievable through <b>conventional</b> <b>machining</b> processes. The grinding process itself has been compared to machining operations which employ multipoint cutting tools. The abrasive grains which make up the entire geometry of wheel act as independent small cutting tools. The quality, characteristics, and rate of grinding wheel wear can be affected by contributions of the characteristics of the material of the workpiece, the temperature increase of the workpiece, and the rate of wear of the grinding wheel itself. Moderate wear rate allows for more consistent material size. Maintaining stable grinding forces is preferred rather than high wheel wear rate which can decrease the effectiveness of material removal from the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|The narrowest colloquial {{sense of}} the term {{reserves}} it only for machines that perform metal cuttingâ€”in other words, the many kinds of <b>conventional</b> <b>machining</b> and grinding. These processes are a type of deformation that produces swarf. However, economists use a slightly broader sense that also includes metal deformation of other types that squeeze the metal into shape without cutting off swarf, such as rolling, stamping with dies, shearing, swaging, riveting, and others. Thus presses are usually included in the economic definition of machine tools. For example, this is the breadth of definition used by Max Holland in his history of Burgmaster and Houdaille, which is also a history of the machine tool industry in general from the 1940s through the 1980s; he was reflecting the {{sense of the}} term used by Houdaille itself and other firms in the industry. Many reports on machine tool export and import and similar economic topics use this broader definition.|$|E

The {{additive manufacturing}} process was primarily developed and engineered by Karen Taminger, material research engineer for NASA LaRC. EBF3 is a NASA-patented additive manufacturing process designed to build near-net-shape parts requiring less raw material and finish machining than traditional manufacturing methods. EBF3 {{is a process}} by which NASA plans to build metal parts in zero-gravity environments; this layer-additive process uses an electron beam and a solid wire feedstock to fabricate metallic structures. The process efficiencies of the electron beam and the feedstock make the EBF3 process appropriate for in-space use. Since 2000, {{a team of researchers}} at the NASA LaRC have led the fundamental research and development of this technique for additive manufacturing for metallic aerospace structures. Additive manufacturing encompasses processes in which parts are built by successively adding material rather than by cutting or grinding it away as in <b>conventional</b> <b>machining.</b> Additive manufacturing is an outgrowth of rapid-prototyping techniques such as stereolithography, first developed for non-structural plastic parts over 30 years ago.|$|E
