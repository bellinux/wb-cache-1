25|$|The Contender frame has two firing pins, and a {{selector}} on {{the exposed}} hammer, {{to allow the}} shooter to choose between rimfire or <b>centerfire</b> firing pins, or to select a safety position from which neither firing pin can strike a primer. The initial baseline design of the Contender had no central safe position on the hammer, having only <b>centerfire</b> and rimfire firing pin positions, each being selectable through using a screwdriver.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of straight-pull only (a.k.a. bolt-action only) Mini-14 and Mini-30 rifles were {{manufactured}} {{for sale in the}} United Kingdom as a result of legislation which banned semi-automatic <b>centerfire</b> rifles in 1988.|$|E
5000|$|Cooper {{was created}} to build {{affordable}} custom-quality accurate rifles. As they put it [...] "Rifles should shoot {{as well as they}} look and vice versa".

5000|$|The [...]19 Calhoon Hornet is a [...]19 caliber rifle wildcat {{cartridge}}. The cartridge {{is based}} on a necked-down blown-out [...]22 Hornet cartridge. This provides less stretching, and greater case capacity with a lighter bullet. The result is a flatter trajectory when compared to the [...]22 Hornet. Having a larger bore than the [...]17 caliber <b>centerfires</b> helps mitigate some of the fouling problems that rifles in that caliber tend to have.|$|R
5000|$|The Hornet is {{considered}} an optimal cartridge for turkey hunting, {{though it is not}} as powerful as modern [...]22 <b>centerfires.</b> At mid-century, southern sportsman Henry Edwards Davis pronounced the Winchester Model 70 chambered for the Hornet [...] "the best commercial rifle for wild turkeys the world has ever seen". In 2011, Lane Kinney was awarded the [...] "Top Turkey in the World" [...] award by Safari Club International for a record-setting Osceola turkey taken with a T/C Contender pistol in [...]22 Hornet.|$|R
25|$|After the {{introduction}} of cartridge-firing firearms, the LeMat system appeared in pinfire, but this version is exceedingly rare. A <b>centerfire</b> version in 12mm Perrin or 11mm Chamelot-Delvigne, with a 24 gauge shot barrel, was made in later years in Belgium. While having better sales than its pinfire relative, the <b>centerfire</b> LeMat also had no real commercial success due to {{the invention of the}} double-action system. With both weapons, loading was accomplished via a loading gate located at the 4 o'clock position for the cylinder, and by swinging the breech of the shot barrel up and left.|$|E
25|$|The Reffye mitrailleuse used a 13mm (.512inch) <b>centerfire</b> cartridge, {{designed}} by Gaupillat, which represented {{the state of}} the art in ammunition design at the time. It was rather similar to an elongated modern shotgun shell: <b>centerfire</b> with a rimmed brass head and a dark blue hardened cardboard body. The , 13mm (0.512inch) patched bullet was propelled by 185 grains (12 grams) of compressed black powder at a muzzle velocity of , three and a half times more powerful than Chassepot or Dreyse rifle ammunition. This was, by far, the most potent rifle caliber ammunition in existence at the time. The Montigny and Reffye mitrailleuse systems were not designed to function with paper cartridges such as the 11mm Chassepot combustible paper cartridge.|$|E
25|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the original}} Contender design were later developed, distinguished easily by the hammer design. The first variant has a push button selector on the hammer for choosing rimfire vs. <b>centerfire,</b> the second variant has a left-center-right toggle switch for selecting center fire-safe-rimfire firing pins, and the third variant has a horizontal bolt selection for choosing center fire-safe-rimfire firing pin positions. All three of these Contender variants have a cougar etched {{on the sides of}} the receiver, thereby easily distinguishing them from the later G2 Contender which has a smooth-sided receiver without an etched cougar. Some of the very earliest Contenders, those requiring a screwdriver to switch the firing pin between rimfire and <b>centerfire,</b> had smooth sides, without the cougar etched on the sides.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]303 {{cartridge}} {{has seen}} much sporting use with surplus military rifles, especially in Australia, Canada, New Zealand {{and to a}} lesser extent, in the United States and South Africa. In Canada, it was found to be adequate for any game except the great bears. In Australia, it was common for military rifles to be re-barreled in [...]303/25 and [...]303/22. However the [...]303 round still retains a considerable following as a game cartridge for all game species, especially Sambar deer in wooded country. [...] A recent change.org petition seeking Lithgow Arms to chamber the LA102 <b>centerfires</b> rifle in [...]303 as a special edition release has attracted considerable attention both in Australia and worldwide. [...] In South Africa [...]303 British Lee–Enfield rifles captured by the Boers during the Boer War were adapted for sporting purposes and became popular with many hunters of non-dangerous game, being regarded as adequate for anything from the relatively small impala, to the massive eland and kudu.|$|R
25|$|In 1903 and 1905, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company {{introduced}} the first semi-automatic rimfire and <b>centerfire</b> rifles designed {{especially for the}} civilian market. The Winchester Model 1903 and Winchester Model 1905 operated {{on the principle of}} blowback in order to function semi-automatically. Designed entirely by T.C. Johnson, the Model 1903 achieved commercial success and continued to be manufactured until 1932 when the Winchester Model 63 replaced it.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the later}} G2 Contender, the {{original}} Contender may be safely dry-fired (provided the hammer is not drawn {{back from the}} second notch) to allow a shooter {{to become familiar with}} the trigger pull. The break-action only has to be cycled, while leaving the hammer in the second notch position, to practice dry-firing. G2's with switchable firing pins (<b>centerfire</b> or rimfire) can be safely dry-fired with the hammer only in the safety (center) position.|$|E
25|$|The Ruger P-Series {{is a line}} of <b>centerfire</b> {{semi-automatic}} pistols made by Sturm, Ruger & Company {{produced from}} 1985 to 2013. The P-Series pistols were designed for military, police, civilian and recreational use. The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the safety mechanism and the barrel-camblock interface. Reviews have considered them rugged, reliable, and strong, though this strength comes {{at the price of}} bulk and a blocky appearance.|$|E
25|$|The Krag–Petersson {{remained}} {{in use in}} the Royal Norwegian Navy for almost 25 years, alongside the Jarmann, and, from 1896, the Krag–Jørgensen. By 1900, they were considered obsolete and sold to civilians, many of whom rebuilt the rifles to <b>centerfire</b> {{and in a few}} cases to shotguns. The details of the sales are lacking, although it is known that in 1928 only 70 Krag–Peterssons {{remained in}} military warehouses. It is likely that these were considered unsellable and scrapped. Today the Krag–Petersson is very rare, and unaltered specimens can fetch high prices – anywhere from 2,000 USD and up.|$|E
25|$|The mitrailleuse is {{best known}} for its service with the French Army but in fact it was first used in Belgium in the 1850s as a static weapon to defend the moats of fortresses. It was a 50-barrel needle fire, paper {{cartridge}} weapon which had been designed by a Captain T.H.J. Fafschamps. Then, after 1863, it was improved with only 37 barrels, 11×70mmR <b>centerfire</b> ammunition and the weapon's placement on a wheeled artillery carriage. This transformation was carried out as an industrial venture by Christophe and Joseph Montigny of Fontaine-l'Évêque near Brussels, who sought to sell the new weapon to the rest of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Handguns are {{becoming}} increasingly popular for hunting. Intended to be fired {{with one or two}} hands, but lacking a shoulder support, handguns are more challenging to shoot accurately than a long gun (a rifle or shotgun). Hunting handguns differ from defensive handguns in a number of ways; hunting handguns usually have longer barrels, better sights (often mounting telescopic sights or red dot sights), and, depending on the game, will fire a much more powerful cartridge. Rimfire hunting handguns can be of any action type, but <b>centerfire</b> hunting handguns are dominated by the single shot and revolver actions, such as the Thompson Center Arms Contender.|$|E

500|$|The FN 5.7×28mm is a small-caliber, {{high-velocity}} cartridge {{designed and}} manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium. It is a bottlenecked <b>centerfire</b> cartridge that is somewhat {{similar to the}} [...]22 Hornet or [...]22 K-Hornet. Unlike many new cartridges, it has no parent case; the complete package was developed from scratch by FN. The 5.7×28mm was developed {{in conjunction with the}} FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol, in response to NATO requests for a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge.|$|E

2500|$|The only {{cartridge}} {{offered by}} Winchester as a factory chambering in the Model 1907 was the [...]351SL <b>centerfire.</b> The energy of this cartridge at the muzzle approximates the original loading of the 30-30 or the modern 35 Remington at approximately 75-100 yards.|$|E
2500|$|Rifles are {{shoulder}} fired guns with rifled barrels, {{and provide}} the greatest accuracy and range of all hunting weapons. <b>Centerfire</b> rifles are generally used for killing big-game species.

2500|$|The [...]303 British {{is one of}} the few (along {{with the}} [...]22 Hornet, [...]30-30 Winchester, and 7.62×54mmR) bottlenecked, rimmed <b>centerfire</b> rifle {{cartridges}} still in common use today. Most of the bottleneck rimmed cartridges of the late 1880s and 1890s fell into disuse by the end of the First World War.|$|E
2500|$|In 1871, 6,600 {{carbines}} {{as well as}} 1,600 rifles {{that had}} been converted to use the [...]50-70 Government <b>centerfire</b> cartridge were sold to France {{for use in the}} Franco-Prussian War. Many of these were seized by Germany, sold to Belgium and ultimately were converted to shotguns and shipped to Africa.|$|E

2500|$|...32 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), {{also known}} as the [...]32 Automatic is a <b>centerfire</b> pistol {{cartridge}}. It is a semi-rimmed, straight-walled cartridge developed by firearms designer John Browning, initially for use in the FN M1900 semi-automatic pistol. It was introduced in 1899 by Fabrique Nationale, and is {{also known as}} the 7.65×17mmSR Browning or 7.65mm Browning Short.|$|E
2500|$|Despite being a {{trailblazer}} {{with its}} then-pioneering design, the Jarmann M1884 cannot be considered successful. The combination of tubular magazine and <b>centerfire</b> ammunition has {{been referred to}} as [...] "too excitable", especially when used with pointed bullets. Also, the balance of the weapon changed with every shot fired. However, both of these issues are common to all firearms that use tubular magazines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basic design}} for the Model 1907 is covered by [...] issued August 27, 1901 and {{assigned}} to Winchester by Thomas Crossley Johnson, a key firearms designer for Winchester. This patent was initially used to protect {{the design of the}} rimfire Winchester Model 1903, but came to be applied toward the <b>centerfire</b> Winchester Self Loading rifle series, which includes the Model 1905, Model 1907, and Model 1910.|$|E
2500|$|The {{very first}} {{production}} Single Action Army, serial number 1, thought lost {{for many years}} after its production, {{was found in a}} barn in Nashua, New Hampshire in the early 1900s. It was chambered in [...]45 Colt, a <b>centerfire</b> design containing charges of up to [...] of fine-grained black powder and a [...] blunt roundnosed bullet. Relative to period cartridges and most later handgun rounds, it was quite powerful in its full loading.|$|E
2500|$|Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is {{the best-known}} of his designs {{to use the}} short recoil {{principle}} in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern <b>centerfire</b> pistols. [...] It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as USPSA, IDPA, International Practical Shooting Confederation, and Bullseye shooting. Compact variants are popular civilian concealed carry weapons in the U.S. because of the design's relatively slim width and stopping power of the [...]45 ACP cartridge.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]38 Smith & Wesson Special (commonly [...]38 Special, [...]38 Spl, or [...]38 Spc, {{pronounced}} [...] "thirty-eight special") is a rimmed, <b>centerfire</b> cartridge {{designed by}} Smith & Wesson. It is {{most commonly used}} in revolvers, although some semi-automatic pistols and carbines also use this round. The [...]38 Special was the standard service cartridge of most police departments in the United States from the 1920s to the early 1990s, and was also a common sidearm cartridge used by soldiers in World War I. In {{other parts of the}} world, it is known by its metric designation of 9×29.5mmR or 9.1×29mmR.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]338 Lapua Magnum (8.6×70mm or 8.58×70mm) is a rimless, bottlenecked, <b>centerfire</b> rifle cartridge.

As a result of this, it became more widely available. The loaded cartridge is [...] in diameter (rim) and [...] long. It can penetrate better-than-standard military body armour at ranges up to [...] and has a maximum effective range of about [...] Muzzle velocity is dependent on barrel length, seating depth and powder charge, and varies from [...] for commercial loads with [...] bullets, which corresponds to about [...] of muzzle energy.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{shooters}} desiring {{to reload}} for obsolete rimfire cartridges alter the firearm in question {{to function as}} a <b>centerfire,</b> which allows them to reload. [...] Often it is possible to reform cases from similarly sized ammunition which is in production, and this is the most economical way of obtaining brass for obscure or out of production calibers. [...] Even if custom brass must be manufactured, this is often far less expensive than purchasing rare, out of production ammunition. [...] Cartridges like the 56-50 Spencer, for example, are not readily obtainable in rimfire form, but can be made from shortened 50-70 cartridges or even purchased in loaded form from specialty dealers.|$|E
2500|$|The IMI Desert Eagle is a {{semi-automatic}} handgun {{notable for}} chambering the largest <b>centerfire</b> cartridge of any magazine-fed, self-loading pistol. It {{has a unique}} design with a triangular barrel and large muzzle. Magnum Research Inc. (MRI) designed and developed the Desert Eagle. The design was refined and the pistols were manufactured by Israel Military Industries until 1995, when MRI shifted the manufacturing contract to Saco Defense in Saco, Maine. In 1998, MRI moved manufacturing back to IMI, which later commercialized its small arms branch under the name Israel Weapon Industries. [...] Since 2009, the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the United States at MRI's Pillager, Minnesota facility. Kahr Arms acquired Magnum Research in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The Jarmann M1884 is a Norwegian bolt-action repeating rifle {{designed}} in 1878 adopted in 1884. The Jarmann {{is the first}} <b>centerfire,</b> repeating bolt-action rifle, adopted as standard issue based on an entirely new design. Earlier rifles like the Swiss Vetterli used rimfire cartridges, the Winchester Hotchkiss and early models of the Remington Lee saw only limited military use, the German Mauser Model 71/84 and early Kropatschek rifles were based on earlier designs. The Jarmann's adoption, and subsequent modifications, turned the Norwegian Army from a fighting force armed with single-shot black-powder weapons into a force armed with modern repeating weapons firing smokeless ammunition. Several thousand were manufactured to equip both Norwegian and Swedish forces in the 1880s. The design is unique, and {{was the brainchild of}} Norwegian engineer Jacob Smith Jarmann. After the design had been phased out of the Norwegian Army, a number of the weapons were rebuilt as harpoon guns.|$|E
2500|$|The {{semi-automatic}} Tavor Carbine (TC-21) {{was first}} {{made available for}} civilian customers to purchase in [...] from 2008.

They were manufactured at Frankford Arsenal, Philadelphia, PA, through 1874. In 1875, the cartridge was shortened so that it would also function in the newly adopted S & W Schofield revolver. It was designated “Revolver Cartridge” and loaded with 28 grains of black powder and a bullet of 230 grain. The Bénet-primed cartridges were manufactured until 1882 and then replaced by reloadable cartridges with brass cases and external primers.|$|E
