25|$|In {{secondary}} electron imaging, or SEI, the {{secondary electron}}s are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by elastic scattering. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image <b>colloidal</b> <b>gold</b> immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images in biological specimens. Characteristic X-rays are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. These characteristic X-rays are used to identify the composition and measure the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|E

30|$|In summary, we {{have found}} a new {{strategy}} to successfully separate <b>colloidal</b> NIR-responsive <b>gold</b> NRs from the co-produced symmetric nanoparticles to achieve a purity level of 97 %. This purification strategy lies in the different shape-dependent solution stability between anisotropic nanoparticles and symmetric nanoparticles under a higher ion concentration. By post-adding salt solution, the charged gold surfaces are partially electrostatic shielded and thus the distance between nanoparticles was greatly shortened in which aggregation turns more favourable. As a result, preferential assembly and subsequent precipitation of NRs occurred spontaneously due to their large interrod contact area while keeping most of the symmetric nanoparticles in solution. These <b>colloidal</b> NIR-responsive <b>gold</b> NRs with high purity would further favour their usage in biomedical or nanotechnological fields. Since this purification strategy is efficient, scalable while non-destructive, we hope {{it could also be}} extended to the purification of other anisotropic nanoparticle systems not limited to gold.|$|R

Since he was already interested in the properties of light and matter, Faraday further investigated the optical properties of the <b>colloidal</b> <b>gold.</b> He prepared the first pure sample of <b>colloidal</b> <b>gold,</b> which he called 'activated gold', in 1857.

50|$|The precise {{structure}} of the ligands {{on the surface of}} <b>colloidal</b> <b>gold</b> NPs impact the properties of the <b>colloidal</b> <b>gold</b> particles. Binding conformations and surface packing of the capping ligands at the surface of the <b>colloidal</b> <b>gold</b> NPs tend to differ greatly from bulk surface model adsorption, largely due to the high curvature observed at the nanoparticle surfaces. Thiolate-gold interfaces at the nanoscale have been well-studied and the thiolate ligands are observed to pull Au atoms off of the surface of the particles to for “staple” motifs that have significant Thiyl-Au(0) character. The citrate-gold surface, on the other hand, is relatively less-studied due to the vast number of binding conformations of the citrate to the curved gold surfaces. A study performed in 2014 identified that the most-preferred binding of the citrate involves two carboxylic acids and the hydroxyl group of the citrate binds three surface metal atoms.|$|E

Zwitterionic polymers with different molar masses, synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of N,N'-dimethyl(methacrylamido propyl) ammonium propanesulfonate (SPP) exhibit a well known Upper Critical Solution Temperature (UCST) in water, i. e., phase separate at low temperature.
