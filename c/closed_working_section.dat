40|$|This Report {{describes}} {{the results of}} wind tunnel tests on a 1 / 4 th scale model of the Curtiss-Wright XP- 55 Airplane. The experiments {{were made in the}} <b>closed</b> <b>working</b> <b>section</b> of the 10 -foot wind tunnel of the GALCIT (Guggenheim Aeronautics Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology). The tests were made at a wind speed of approximately 150 m. p. h. (dynamic pressure 25 gm/cm^ 2), corresponding to Reynolds Number based on mean wing chord of about 1, 670, 000. The critical Reynolds Number at which a 15 cm. sphere has a drag coefficient of 0. 3 is about 325, 000, indicating a stream with rather low turbulences. The model was lacquered and rubbed down to a fairly high polish...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical investigation {{has been carried}} out to understand the tonal noise generation mechanism on aerofoils at moderate Reynolds number. Experiments were conducted on a NACA 0012 aerofoil section in a low-turbulence <b>closed</b> <b>working</b> <b>section</b> wind tunnel. Narrow band acoustic tones were observed up to 40 dB above background noise. The ladder structure of these tones was eliminated by modifying the tunnel to approximate to anechoic conditions. High-resolution flow velocity measurements have been made with a three-component laser-Doppler anemometer (LDA) which have revealed the presence of strongly amplified boundary-layer instabilities in a region of separated shear flow just upstream of the pressure surface trailing edge, which match the frequency of the acoustic tones. Flow visualization experiments have shown these instabilities to roll up to form a regular Kármán-type vortex street. A new mechanism for tonal noise generation has been proposed, based on the growth of Tollmien–Schlichting (T–S) instability waves strongly amplified by inflectional profiles in the separating laminar shear layer on the pressure surface of the aerofoil. The growth of fixed frequency, spatially growing boundary-layer instability waves propagating over the aerofoil pressure surface has been calculated using experimentally obtained boundary-layer characteristics. The effect of boundary-layer separation has been incorporated into the model. Frequency selection and prediction of T–S waves are in remarkably good agreement with experimental data. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{unsteadiness}} {{and model}} vibration in the RAE 3 ft x 3 ft tunnel have Impeded static and dynamic measurements at subsonic and transonic speeds. The unsteadiness {{was measured with}} pressure transducers both in the 3 ft x 3 ft tunnel and a l/ 9 scale model of this tunnel and good agreement obtained. For the closed 3 ft X 3 ft tunnel, successive modifications to the balance sectlon and diffuser derived from tests of the model tunnel have reduced the unsteadiness at subsonic speeds to an acceptable level for dynamic tests. The unsteadiness In the slotted tunnels operated by diffuser suction orlglnated in the extraction region and was reduced in the 3 ft x 3 ft tunnel by covermg the slots with perforated screens. The unsteadiness was still {{higher than in the}} closed tunnel and Just acceptable in the 0. 91 m x 0. 69 m (3 ft x 2. 2 ft) <b>working</b> <b>section</b> and unacceptable in the 0. 91 m x 0. 91 m (3 ft x 3 ft) working sectlon. The perforated and <b>closed</b> <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> of the model tunnel had nearly the same unsteadiness and a similar result was achieved with the ne...|$|R

40|$|The wall {{interference}} {{is obtained}} for a wind tunnel of elliptic section {{for the two}} cases of <b>closed</b> and open <b>working</b> <b>sections.</b> The approximate and exact methods used gave results in practically good agreement. Corresponding to the result given by Glauert for {{the case of the}} closed rectangular section, the interference is found to be a minimum for a ratio of minor to major axis of 1 :square root of 6 This, however, is true only for the case where the span of the airfoil is small in comparison with the width of the tunnel. For a longer airfoil the favorable ellipse is flatter. In the case of the open <b>working</b> <b>section</b> the circular shape gives the minimum interference...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{measurements}} of control-surface oscillatory derivatives on a sweptback, tapered half-model of a lifting surface of aspect ratio 2 are presented. The measurements were obtained {{during the development}} of a derivative rig which measures normal force, pitching moment, wing bending moment and hinge moment due to control surface oscillation. They were made in the 18 in. × 14 in. (0. 46 m × 0. 36 m) N. P. L. Teddington tunnel and the 3 ft (0. 91 m) R. A. E. Bedford tunnel, the rig being found to operate satisfactorily in both situations. Mach number was varied from 0. 4 to 1. 0 and stagnation pressure from 0. 5 to 2. 3 bar. With this combination of Mach number and stagnation pressure, Reynolds number varied from 1 to 6 millions based on mean chord. The effects of varying the control-surface deflection amplitude from 0. 4 to 1. 6 degrees and the oscillation frequency from 20 to 70 Hz were examined. The effect of tunnel interference was assessed by measurements in ventilated and <b>closed</b> wall <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> in each tunnel. Most of the tesfs were carried out with transition bands on the model, but a few tests were made with the bands removed. The measured derivatives are compared with those obtained by theoretical methods o...|$|R
40|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the design of the}} high speed Cooperative Wind Tunnel at the California Institute of Technology an aerodynamic model was built and tested. Methods of design of the contraction, <b>working</b> <b>section,</b> and diffuser are explained. The model test showed that the <b>working</b> <b>section</b> of a wind tunnel operating at a Mach Number greater than 0. 7 must have adjustable walls to maintain a constant velocity through the <b>working</b> <b>section.</b> The unsatisfactory design of the diffuser is demonstrated by both static pressure measurements and visual observations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work is to investigate experimentally and computationally the uniformity of velocity profile in wind tunnel. A wind tunnel is an instrument {{used to examine the}} stream lines and forces that are induced as the fluid flows past a fully submerged body.

50|$|Automotive {{aerodynamics}} is studied {{using both}} computer modelling and wind tunnel testing. For {{the most accurate}} results from a wind tunnel test, the tunnel is sometimes equipped with a rolling road. This is a movable floor for the <b>working</b> <b>section,</b> which moves {{at the same speed}} as the air flow. This prevents a boundary layer from forming {{on the floor of the}} <b>working</b> <b>section</b> and affecting the results.

40|$|Results of {{experimental}} {{studies on the}} effect of various factors on the transition of a supersonic boundary layer are discussed. It is shown that in supersonic wind tunnels, a significant effect on the transition of the boundary layer on a model is exerted by the scale of acoustic perturbations, which is proportional to the boundary layer displacement thickness of the <b>working</b> <b>section.</b> Experimental data obtained over a wide range of variation of flow parameters in aerodynamically similar test installations with different dimensions of the <b>working</b> <b>section</b> are generalized by means of a correlation parameter based on the displacement thickness...|$|R

40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{reducing}} dynamic interference in wind tunnels at subsonic and transonic speeds was {{tested in a}} pilot 4 in × 4 in tunnel. Two types of dynamic interference were considered: excitation of unwanted acoustic resonances within the <b>working</b> <b>section</b> and flow unsteadiness. The tests show that both types of interference could be substantially reduced by replacing the conventional hard walls of a closed or a slotted <b>working</b> <b>section</b> by appropriate sound absorbing walls. The models used to establish the resonances in the <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> with hard walls were small circular cylinders operating in the suberitical Reynolds number range (Rd < 2 x I 05) and thus generating discrete pressure fluctuations at the vortex shedding frequency. When the resonances were suppressed by the wall material the pressure fluctuations agreed well with previous measurements made in a much larger, low speed wind tunnel, and with predictions. The results of this small scale test were judged sufficiently encouraging to justify a further investigation in the RAE 3 ft × 3 ft tunnel, which it i...|$|R
