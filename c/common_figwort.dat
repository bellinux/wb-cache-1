50|$|Scrophularia nodosa (also called figwort, {{woodland}} figwort, and <b>common</b> <b>figwort)</b> is {{a perennial}} herbaceous plant found in temperate {{regions of the}} Northern hemisphere except western North America. It grows in moist and cultivated waste ground.|$|E
5000|$|The wild plants, [...] "weeds", {{are listed}} and {{discussed}} in the [...] "Urban Flora" [...] by Beesley and Wilde. They noted that the residents keep their gardens relatively weed-free. In the area [...] (<b>Common</b> <b>Figwort),</b> [...] (Foxglove) and [...] (Red Campion) were noted in an old lane off the Malone Park.

50|$|Scrophularia auriculata, the {{shoreline}} figwort or water figwort, is a perennial plant {{of the genus}} Scrophularia in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is found commonly in Western Europe and North Africa, {{on the margins of}} rivers, ponds and similar damp places.It is an upright plant reaching 70 cm with blunt oval, crenate leaves in alternate pairs on the greenish-purple square stem, most leaves may have two small lobes at their base. The spikes of flowers are held stiffly on square stems which arise from the main stem in the angle of the leaf stalks. The square stems have a wing running down each corner. These wings are more obvious than on the closely related <b>common</b> <b>figwort</b> (Scrophularia nodosa). The flowers are small, maroon-brownish and globular with two small lips above and below. The five sepals are green with a white margin, broader on the water figwort than the <b>common</b> <b>figwort.</b> The plant flowers from June to September after when the flowers produce small spherical to pear-shaped capsules containing a large number of seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Scrophularia californica is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} figwort family which is known by the <b>common</b> names California <b>figwort</b> and California bee plant.|$|R
50|$|The site is wet willow {{woodland}} on {{the bank}} of the River Lea. It is important for water voles and birds such as reed and sedge warblers. Water <b>figwort,</b> <b>common</b> meadow rue and water chickweed grow along the river bank.|$|R
50|$|Scrophularia desertorum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the figwort family known by the <b>common</b> name desert <b>figwort.</b> It is native to eastern California and Nevada, where it grows in dry areas in local mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada and the desert ranges adjacent. It is a perennial herb producing clusters of erect stems that often exceed one meter tall. The leaves have toothed, triangular or lance-shaped blades up to 13 centimeters long which are borne on petioles measuring up to 10 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a wide-open panicle with several hairy, glandular branches bearing flowers. The flower has a spherical corolla opening at the top into a hoodlike, lobed mouth. The corolla is just under a centimeter long and is whitish at the base and deep red around the mouth and on the lobes. The staminode is generally visible {{in the mouth of}} the corolla. The fruit is a capsule just under a centimeter long containing many seeds.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, <b>Common</b> <b>Figwort,</b> Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, {{on the slopes of}} the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.|$|E
50|$|Scrophularia lanceolata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the figwort family known by the <b>common</b> name lanceleaf <b>figwort.</b> It is native to North America, where it is known from western and eastern Canada {{and much of the}} United States except for the southeastern quadrant. It grows in many types of habitat, sometimes including disturbed areas such as roadsides. It is a perennial herb producing clusters of erect or spreading stems up to 1.5 meters long. The oppositely arranged leaves have toothed, triangular or lance-shaped blades up to 14 cm long which are borne on short petioles. The inflorescence is a wide-open panicle with several hairy, glandular branches bearing flowers. The flower has a spherical or urn-shaped corolla opening at the top into a narrow mouth edged with hoodlike lobes. The corolla is roughly 1 - 1.5 cm long and is greenish tinged with brown or dull pink. The wide staminode is generally visible in the mouth of the corolla. The fruit is a capsule just under a centimeter long containing many seeds.|$|R
50|$|Scrophularia atrata is an {{uncommon}} species of flowering {{plant in the}} figwort family known by the <b>common</b> names black-flowered <b>figwort</b> and darkflowered figwort. It is endemic to California, where it is known only from {{a section of the}} Central Coast Ranges in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties. It grows in the calcareous and diatomaceous soils of the coastal canyons at elevations not exceeding 500 meters. There have been 44 observed occurrences of this species, but perhaps 25 of these are historic and may no longer exist. This plant is a perennial herb producing an erect, four-sided stem up to a meter tall or slightly taller. It is somewhat hairy to densely woolly in texture. The leaves have toothed oval blades up to 10 centimeters long which are borne on long petioles. The inflorescence is a wide-open panicle with several hairy, glandular branches bearing flowers. The flower has an urn-shaped corolla with a rounded body and an open mouth at the top which is edged with hoodlike lobes. The corolla is deep, dark red to nearly black in color. The fruit is a capsule just under a centimeter long containing many seeds.|$|R
