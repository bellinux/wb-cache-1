40|$|For {{full-duplex}} hands-free acoustic human/machine interfaces, often {{a combination}} of acoustic echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> speech enhancement in order to suppress acoustic echoes, local interference, and noise is required.

40|$|Abstract. When {{dealing with}} complex {{business}} processes (e. g., {{in the context}} of a workflow implementation or the configuration of some process-aware information system), it is important but sometimes difficult to determine whether a process contains any errors. <b>Cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins are important features that are common in many business processes. The presence of <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins makes it difficult to perform verification. Therefore, existing approaches and tools are typically restricted to process models without such features. In this paper, we explore verification techniques for processes with <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins. We present these techniques {{in the context of}} workflow language YAWL that provides direct support for these features. We have extended the graphical editor of YAWL with diagnostic features based in the results presented in this paper. The approach relies on reset nets and can easily be adapted to support other languages allowing for <b>cancellations</b> <b>and</b> OR-joins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to acoustic echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> doubletalk detection for a teleconferencing system including a loudspeaker for which an estimate of the loud-speaker impulse response is available. The approach is general {{in the sense that it}} may be applied to most existing acoustic echo can-cellation and doubletalk detection algorithms. We show that the new approach reduces the computational complexity for both the echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> the doubletalk detection algorithms. Fur-thermore, the numerical examples show that the new approach also may increase the echo <b>cancellation</b> <b>and</b> doubletalk detection per-formances.
