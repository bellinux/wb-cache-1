5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale</b> is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

25|$|Thus, a {{temperature}} difference of one degree Celsius {{and that of}} one kelvin are exactly the same, with the null point of the Kelvin scale (0K) at exactly −273.15°C, and the null point of the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale</b> (0°C) at exactly 273.15K.|$|E
25|$|The lowest {{theoretical}} {{temperature is}} absolute zero, {{at which the}} thermal motion of all fundamental particles in matter reaches a minimum. Although classically described as motionless, particles still possess a finite zero-point energy in the quantum mechanical description. Absolute zero is denoted as 0K on the Kelvin scale, −273.15°C on the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale,</b> and −459.67°F on the Fahrenheit scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} became {{prominent in}} the sciences in the 18th century with names such as the physician and botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), the father of biological and mineralogical taxonomy, and his numerous important pupils, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), inventor of the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale</b> the predecessor of the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale,</b> and the chemist Torbern Bergman (1735–1784). Another scientist from this era is Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), better remembered today as a religious mystic. Several of the elements were discovered by Uppsala scientists during this period or later. Jöns Jakob Berzelius, one of the fathers of modern chemistry, received his doctorate in medicine in Uppsala in 1804, but later moved to Stockholm. Uppsala scientists of the 19th century include the physicist Anders Jonas Ångström (1814–1874). During the 20th century several Nobel laureates in the sciences have been Uppsala alumni or professors at the university.|$|E
25|$|This boiling-point {{difference}} of 16.1 millikelvin between the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale's</b> original definition {{and the current}} one (based on absolute zero and the triple point) has little practical meaning in common daily applications because water's boiling point is very sensitive to variations in barometric pressure. For example, an altitude change of only 28nbsp&cm (11nbsp&in) causes the boiling point to change by one millikelvin.|$|R
50|$|A {{practical}} {{effect of}} ITS-90 is the triple points and the freezing/melting points of its thirteen chemical elements are precisely known for all temperature measurements calibrated per ITS-90 since these thirteen values are fixed by its definition. Only the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) is known with absolute precision—regardless of the calibration standard employed—because the very definitions {{of both the}} Kelvin and <b>Celsius</b> <b>scales</b> are fixed by international agreement based, in part, on this point.|$|R
50|$|Although the kelvin and <b>Celsius</b> <b>scales</b> {{are defined}} using {{absolute}} zero (0 K) and the triple point of water (273.16 K and 0.01 °C), it is impractical {{to use this}} definition at temperatures that {{are very different from}} the triple point of water. ITS-90 is then designed to represent the thermodynamic temperature as closely as possible throughout its range. Many different thermometer designs are required to cover the entire range. These include helium vapor pressure thermometers, helium gas thermometers, standard platinum resistance thermometers (known as SPRTs, PRTs or Platinum RTDs) and monochromatic radiation thermometers.|$|R
25|$|Temperature is a {{physical}} quantity expressing the subjective perceptions of hot and cold. Temperature is measured with a thermometer, historically calibrated in various temperature scales and units of measurement. The most commonly used scales are the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale,</b> denoted in °C (informally, degrees centigrade), the Fahrenheit scale (°F), and the Kelvin scale. The kelvin (K) is the unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), in which temperature {{is one of the}} seven fundamental base units.|$|E
25|$|The value zero plays {{a special}} role for many {{physical}} quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished {{from all other}} levels, whereas for others it {{is more or less}} arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (as measured in kelvins) zero is the lowest possible value (negative temperatures are defined, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder). This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale,</b> where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. Measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In physics, the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system.|$|E
2500|$|Temperature is {{measured}} with thermometers {{that may be}} calibrated {{to a variety of}} temperature scales. In most of the world (except for Belize, Myanmar, Liberia and the United States), the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale</b> is used for most temperature measuring purposes. Most scientists measure temperature using the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale</b> and thermodynamic temperature using the Kelvin scale, which is the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale</b> offset so that its null point is [...] = , or absolute zero. Many engineering fields in the U.S., notably high-tech and US federal specifications (civil and military), also use the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Other engineering fields in the U.S. also rely upon the Rankine scale (a shifted Fahrenheit scale) when working in thermodynamic-related disciplines such as combustion.|$|E
50|$|Very pure, {{carefully}} distilled VSMOW {{water is}} important in the manufacture of high-accuracy temperature measurement reference standards. Both the Kelvin and <b>Celsius</b> <b>scales</b> are defined by the triple point of water (273.16 K and 0.01 °C). Due to differences in isotopic composition, water samples from various sources may exhibit slight differences in physical properties, such as density, boiling point, and vapor pressure. Consequently, snow, river water, and rainwater, all of which are recently evaporated ocean water, tend to be enriched in the lighter isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, causing water to evaporate more quickly.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Celsius</b> {{temperature}} <b>scale</b> {{was defined}} until 1954 by two points: 0°C being {{defined by the}} water freezing point and 100°C being defined by the water boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure.|$|R

He also determined with remarkable precision how water's boiling point varied {{as a function of}} atmospheric pressure. He proposed that zero on his temperature scale (water's boiling point) would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level.|$|R

2500|$|One {{effect of}} {{defining}} the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale</b> at the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW, 273.16K and 0.01°C), and at absolute zero (0K and −273.15°C), {{is that neither}} the melting nor boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere (101.325kPa) remains a defining point for the <b>Celsius</b> <b>scale.</b> In 1948 when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in Resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point {{was so close to}} being 0.01°C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as precisely 0.01°C. However, current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of VSMOW is actually very slightly (<0.001nbsp&°C) greater than 0.01nbsp&°C. Thus, the actual melting point of ice is very slightly (less than a thousandth of a degree) below 0nbsp&°C. Also, defining water's triple point at 273.16nbsp&K precisely defined the magnitude of each 1nbsp&°C increment in terms of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale (referencing absolute zero). Now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water, the value [...] "100nbsp&°C" [...] is hotter than 0nbsp&°C – in absolute terms – by a factor of precisely [...] (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering strictly to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339nbsp&K (99.9839nbsp&°C). When calibrated to ITS-90 (a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW is slightly less, about 99.974nbsp&°C.|$|E

Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing.
