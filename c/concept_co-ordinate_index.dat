The proposed algorithm can merge the two key steps of Conventional FastICA - Preprocessing and Update {{and is therefore}} capable of reducing the hardware complexity of the conventional FastICA significantly as demonstrated in this paper. Hardware implementation can further be simplified due to the recursive nature of the proposed algorithm where the same 2 D hardware module {{can be used as}} the fundamental core to implement nD architecture.

Conventional FastICA uses a preprocessing step involving classical Eigen Value Decomposition problem which, in hardware, is widely solved using Co-ordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) technique. The proposed co-ordinate rotation based 2 D FastICA algorithm {{opens up the}} opportunity to reuse the same CORDIC unit used for the preprocessing step and thus is capable of reducing the hardware complexity of the conventional FastICA algorithm. Along with the formulation and functionality validation of the proposed algorithm, a detailed hardware complexity analysis is also {{presented in this paper}} and compared with the already reported architectures...|$|R
40|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are available for}} constraint satisfaction problems. Most of them lack real time capability and distributed computational properties. Configuration of complex systems has today become a competitive edge, e. g. within e-business. The {{other side of the}} same coin can be used for diagnosis and simulation of safe critical applications. This paper gives a scientific background and comparison of methods for constraint satisfaction problems implemented in real time environment. Especially, the technique and its features of the array-based logic will be illustrated by three examples. The examples are: 1. Modelling and simulation of system wide protection applications of power systems 2. Modelling, simulation and implementation of safe critical switching in power systems 3. Modelling, simulation and implementation of safe critical systems of automatic train control Array-based logic is a novel technology, which is founded on a geometrical representation of logic in terms of nested data arrays. In this representation, logical inferences are executed on finite domain systems by a few standardised array operations. In computational practice, array-based logic makes it possible to solve large-scale constraint problems with combinations very efficiently. The major advantages of the technology are completeness, compactness, and speed of simulation (real-time capability), all of which derive from intrinsic properties of the underlying geometrical model. A system in array-based logic is considered analogously to electrical networks and is thus described by the constraints of the isolated elements as well as the constraints of the interconnected elements (the system topology). All system constraints are eliminated in accordance with the methods known from electrical network theory and other engineering disciplines rooted in classical physics. The configuration space is represented explicitly in terms of nested data arrays and the system can therefore be simulated in real-time by <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>indexing</b> on these arrays. This data driven approach makes it suitable for parallel processing, which is an important quality for distributed systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{international}} prominence {{accorded the}} 'One Health' <b>concept</b> of <b>co-ordinated</b> activity {{of those involved}} in human and animal health is a modern incarnation of a long tradition of comparative medicine, with roots in the ancient civilizations and a golden era during the 19 th century explosion of knowledge in the field of infectious disease research. Modern One Health tends to focus on zoonotic pathogens emerging from wildlife and production animal species, {{but one of the most}} significant One Health challenges is rabies for which there is a canine reservoir. This review considers the role of small companion animals in One Health and specifically addresses the major vector-borne infectious diseases that are shared by man, dogs and cats. The most significant of these are leishmaniosis, borreliosis, bartonellosis, ehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis and anaplasmosis. The challenges that lie ahead in this field of One Health are discussed, together with the role of the newly formed World Small Animal Veterinary Association One Health Committee. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to study {{the effect of the}} sequencing of the information in an instructional program. In both experiments, two different ordering principles were used. These principles were based on the relation between the to be learned concepts. The ordering of the information could be successive or simultaneous. The relationship between concepts is categorized either successive or coordinate. It was hypothesized that a simultaneous presentation would show better learning results than a successive presentation if between the to-be-learned <b>concepts</b> exists a <b>co-ordinate</b> relationship. A successive presentation would lead to better results in case of a successive relationship. Results suggest that the definition of both types of relationships needs refinement. Further the results show that for coordinate related concepts a simultaneous presentation is preferable...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a novel 1 -Dimensional representation of DNA, {{which is based}} on graphical representations of the 64 triplets of nucleic acids {{on the periphery of the}} unit circle. By using the polar coordinate of 64 codons (expressed in radians) four letter DNA sequence is transformed into a numerical sequence with no more than 64 different entries. By depicting the 1 -Dim representation (plotted on z-coordinate) and using the x <b>co-ordinate</b> as running <b>index</b> one obtains “spectrum-like ” graphical representation of DNA. The novel representation of DNA has some advantages over other spectrum-like 1 - dimensional and 2 -dimensional representations in using the same coordinates for the same codons thus avoiding computations of coordinates, which is characteristic of the Jeffrey’s algorithm and graphical representations of DNA based on its modification.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{distributed}} algorithm for mutual exclusion based on path reversal. The algorithm does not use logical clocks to serialize the concurrent events, and all the variables are bounded. When a process invokes a critical section, it sends a request to {{the tail of a}} queue. A dynamical rooted tree gives the path to this tail. The algorithm requires only O(Log (n)) messages on average, where n is the number of processes in the network. The performances analysis of the algorithm is based on generating formal power series.

50|$|The {{conceptual}} {{relationships within}} the complete works created over decades and continuously reworked have hardly been systematically investigated. The most important theoretical basis is the empirical-psychological theory of apperception, based on Leibniz's philosophical position, that Wundt, {{on the one}} hand, based on experimental psychology and his neuropsychological modelling and, on the other hand, extrapolated into a development theory for culture. The fundamental reconstruction of Wundt's main ideas is a task that cannot be achieved by any one person today due {{to the complexity of}} the complete works. He tried to connect the fundamental controversies of the research directions epistemologically and methodologically by means of a <b>co-ordinated</b> <b>concept</b> - in a confident handling of the categorically basically different ways of considering the interrelations. Here, during the founding phase of university psychology, he already argued for a highly demanding meta-science meta-scientific reflection - and this potential to stimulate interdisciplinarity und perspectivism (complementary approaches) has by no means been exhausted.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a series}} of {{comparisons}} of the structures of the three oxidation states of flavodoxin from Clostridium MP, phases for the semiquinono form were determined to 2. 0 A resolution by isomorphous replacement (m > = 0. 725). Subsequently, the structure was refined at 1. 8 A resolution by a combination of difference Fourier, real space and reciprocal space methods. After refining to an R of 0. 194, we explored the conformation of the FMN binding site by real space refinement versus maps with Fourier coefficients of the form (2 |Fo|- |Fc|) exp (i[alpha]c). To minimize bias in the fitting, groups of atoms were systematically omitted from the structure factors used in computation of the (2 |Fo - |Fc|) maps. One-electron reduction of oxidized flavodoxin is accompanied by several changes at the FMN binding site: the conformation of residues in the reverse bend formed by Met 56 -Gly 57 -Asp 58 -Glu 59 differs in the crystal structures of the oxidized and semiquinone species; further, backbone atoms in residues 55 and 89 shift by more than 0. 5 A and the indole ring of Trp 90 undergoes a significant displacement. The orientation of the peptide unit connecting Gly 57 and Asp 58 is consistent with the presence of a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly 57 and the flavin N(5) in flavodoxin semiquinone. No equivalent bond is found in oxidized flavodoxin. In both the oxidized and semiquinone species of clostridial flavodoxin, the isoalloxazine ring is essentially planar : the bending angles about N(5) [...] -N(10) are ~ 2. 5 [deg] for the semiquinone structure and ~ 0 [deg] in oxidized flavodoxin. The intensity changes resulting from the oxidized agsemiquinone conversion (RI = 0. 33) arise in part from changes in molecular packing. Intermolecular contacts, including neighbors of the prosthetic group, are altered in the repacking. Maps or models of the two oxidation states can be brought into approximate coincidence by a rigid body motion. The required transformation, determined for the isomorphous replacement maps by the method of Cox (1967), is equivalent to a screw motion with a rotation of 1. 18 [deg] and a translation of - 0. 34 A. The molecular structures of oxidized and semiquinone flavodoxins have been compared after superposition of models with idealized <b>co-ordinates</b> and discrepancy <b>indices</b> Rox = 0. 213 and Rsq = 0. 200.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of {{interpretation}} in design activity {{through the development of}} a computational model of constructive interpretation. It asks the question: how does the construction of interpretations from expectations within a situation affect design activity? This work hypothesises that designers construct their world from their expectations through interpretation. In interpreting their own work designers are able to make unexpected discoveries and explore the implicit knowledge held within their expectations of the world. These expectations are grounded in experience. A conceptual model for constructive interpretation is described. Knowledge held by designers is represented in a perceptual symbol system, in which knowledge organised in a hierarchy. Within this hierarchy, higher layers represent an increased level of abstraction. Knowledge is learnt through experience in an environment. The topmost layer in this hierarchy is the situation. Interpretation occurs through pull from the expectations. Expectations in a layer are changed by the layer above. The construction of expectations utilises knowledge about the world that the designer gains through experience. A computational framework for this conceptual model is described: (i) based upon conceptual spaces, where expectations within the situation perturb each other; and (ii) based upon a hierarchy of unsupervised learning networks, where prototypes represent convergence zones within conceptual space. Constructive interpretation is implemented in a number of demonstrations utilising modified self-organising maps linked together to represent layers in the conceptual model. Demonstrations show: (i) how situations are changed through construction from implicit expectations; (ii) how situations <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>concepts</b> through expectations that are grounded in experience; (iii) how construction from expectations produces stability in a chang ing environment; and (iv) how useful rather than accurate in! terpreta tions can be produced by constructing from expectations. A model of constructive interpretation in design is developed in which a system iterates through generation of designs from expectations and constructive interpretation. In one experiment an agent has experience with a number of floor plans. It uses its experience to draw in a design medium and interpret its own work. Through constructive interpretation from implicit expectations the situation changes leading to a new space of designs. It provides a model of the way that designers make unexpected discoveries within their work that are useful to the design task, through expectations, and relevant to the source, as the basis for constructing the interpretation. Another experiment uses sets of growth indicators about countries as concepts. The model shows how the space of designs changes through constructive interpretation and explores the effects of salience weighting upon the construction of interpretations. The work looks towards a situated model of design: a model of design that integrates interpretation, expectation and memory into the one cognitive framework. Constructive interpretation has applications for models of analogy and computational creativity. Future work in constructive interpretation is described...|$|R
