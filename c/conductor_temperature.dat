50|$|Some wires have a {{mechanical}} covering with no voltage rating—e.g.: service-drop, welding, doorbell, thermostat wire. An insulated wire or cable has a voltage {{rating and a}} maximum <b>conductor</b> <b>temperature</b> rating. It may not have an ampacity (current-carrying capacity) rating, since this is dependent upon the surrounding environment (e.g. ambient temperature).|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers of ACSR {{typically}} provide ampacity {{tables for}} a defined set of assumptions. Individual utilities normally apply different ratings due to using varying assumptions (which {{may be a}} result in higher or lower amperage ratings than those the manufacturers provide). Significant variables include wind speed and direction relative to the conductor, sun intensity, emissivity, ambient temperature, and maximum <b>conductor</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E
50|$|Almost all cross-linkable {{polyethylene}} compounds (XLPE) for {{wire and}} cable applications {{are based on}} LDPE.XLPE-insulated cables have a rated maximum <b>conductor</b> <b>temperature</b> of 90 °C and an emergency rating up to 140 °C, depending on the standard used. They have a conductor short-circuit rating of 250 °C. XLPE has excellent dielectric properties, making it useful for medium voltage—1 to 69 kV AC, and high-voltage cables—up to 380 kV AC-voltage, and several hundred kV DC.|$|E
40|$|Operating {{temperatures}} of conventional high voltage transmission cables are generally restricted to 90 °C {{in order to}} prevent thermal damage occurring to the XLPE dielectric. However new polymeric dielectrics may allow higher <b>conductor</b> <b>temperatures,</b> potentially increasing the current rating of the cable circuit. For buried cables this increases the rate of moisture migration away from the cable circuit, thus increasing the ground thermal resistivity. This paper outlines the development of a dynamic backfill model which permits moisture migration to be modelled explicitly. The model is then used to determine the likely magnitude of rating increase available from the deployment of high temperature cables on the transmission network...|$|R

50|$|Heat {{resistance}} {{is an important}} part of wrapped cable design. Conductors on overhead lines are subject to two different sources of severe temperature excursions: lightning strike and fault current. Lightning strikes produce a large and sudden increase in <b>conductor</b> <b>temperature</b> (from ambient temperature to over 200 °C in less than 40μs) followed by an exponential decay over tens of seconds back to ambient temperature. The amount of energy converted to heat in a lightning strike can be sufficient to melt several strands in a multi-stranded conductor. Fault currents tend to produce longer rise times (ms rather than μs) to somewhat lower temperatures (typically below 200 °C) and with a longer decay time. In order to cope with these temperatures, the sheath of a wrapped fibre optic cable must be made from a high-temperature material or it must be crosslinked to prevent melting. Suppliers will carry testing of their cable to demonstrate that it can survive a number of lightning strikes or fault current episodes.|$|E

This thesis investigates the effects that resistance variations, due to temperature and frequency, have on frequency scanning results. The maximum resistance change (increased and decreased) from the standard value is determined and applied to the transmission lines in four study system cases. The frequency scan output for the modified cases is used to determine if torsional interaction has become more severe.

40|$|In this paper, the {{calculation}} of the <b>conductor</b> <b>temperature</b> {{is related to the}} temperature sensor position in high-voltage power cables and four thermal circuits—based on the temperatures of insulation shield, the center of waterproof compound, the aluminum sheath, and the jacket surface are established to calculate the <b>conductor</b> <b>temperature.</b> To examine the effectiveness of <b>conductor</b> <b>temperature</b> calculations, simulation models based on flow characteristics of the air gap between the waterproof compound and the aluminum are built up, and thermocouples are placed at the four radial positions in a 110 kV cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulated power cable to measure the temperatures of four positions. In measurements, six cases of current heating test under three laying environments, such as duct, water, and backfilled soil were carried out. Both errors of the <b>conductor</b> <b>temperature</b> calculation and the simulation based on the temperature of insulation shield were significantly smaller than others under all laying environments. It is the uncertainty of the thermal resistivity, together with the difference of the initial temperature of each radial position by the solar radiation, which led to the above results. The thermal capacitance of the air has little impact on errors. The thermal resistance of the air gap is the largest error source. Compromising the temperature-estimation accuracy and the insulation-damage risk, the waterproof compound is the recommended sensor position to improve the accuracy of conductor-temperature calculation. When the thermal resistances were calculated correctly, the aluminum sheath is also the recommended sensor position besides the waterproof compound...|$|E

40|$|A special {{protection}} scheme (SPS) {{based on}} model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to mitigate thermal overloads in advance, and so avoid cascade line tripping.

50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{geometry}} of the wire, temperature also has {{a significant effect on}} the efficacy of <b>conductors.</b> <b>Temperature</b> affects <b>conductors</b> in two main ways, the first is that materials may expand under the application of heat. The amount that the material will expand is governed by the thermal expansion coefficient specific to the material. Such an expansion (or contraction) will change {{the geometry of}} the conductor and therefore its characteristic resistance. However, this effect is generally small, on the order of 10−6. An increase in temperature will also increase the number of phonons generated within the material. A phonon is essentially a lattice vibration, or rather a small, harmonic kinetic movement of the atoms of the material. Much like the shaking of a pinball machine, phonons serve to disrupt the path of electrons, causing them to scatter. This electron scattering will decrease the number of electron collisions and therefore will decrease the total amount of current transferred.|$|R

40|$|Wind farm {{collector}} circuits generally comprise several {{wind turbine}} generators (WTG’s). WTG’s are connected in parallel to a substation. This connection acts as the point-of-connection to the national electricity grid. The electrical load in these circuits is close to component (power cables and accessories) ratings.
