40|$|Following {{the peak}} in US <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> {{production}} 30 years ago, more and more non-OPEC producers have seen their production decline {{as a result of}} resource depletion. OPEC, on the other hand has extracted a comparatively smaller proportion of its reserve base. Given that new non-OPEC discoveries are growing ever limited, we explore the role of reserve additions and OPEC in determining future <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> supply: we formulate a model that embodies a weak and strong OPEC for various rates of reserve additions in mature <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> provinces. Using this geo-economic partial equilibrium model that generates a peak in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> production, we show that although potential conventional <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> resources may seem abundant, OPEC strategy could cause substantial <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> depletion in non-OPEC countries by 2050 (or even earlier) given likely depletion rates. In addition, we find that reducing reserve decline rates in mature <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> provinces not only extends the time to exhaustion substantially, but also discourages OPEC from engaging in an overly strategic extraction behavior. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The major alternative fuels under consideration are propane, methanol, ethanol and natural gas. Natural gas clearly stands out {{as one of the best}} alternative fuels currently available having substantial benefits compared to gasoline and diesel. These include lower cost, higher octane number, lower maintenance cost and produce cleaner exhaust emissions. Ethanol is one another alternative fuel that can be used in SI engine especially as an additive in gasoline. Its use in engine is characterized by improved power output, efficiency and fuel economy with lower exhaust emissions. In this paper, a comprehensive review on various aspects of S.

30|$|The drastic {{fluctuation}} {{of international}} oil price {{will have a}} significant impact on China, the second largest oil consumer and the third oil-importing country in the world. Supported by the favorable economic situation, substantial growth in petrochemical production and strong demand for car ownership, it is expected that China’s oil demand will increase by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2016 – 2022, with an average annual growth rate of about 2.4 %. In addition, the pattern of international <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> trade will also change. China, India and Southeast Asia will jointly push the international <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> flow from the west to the east. In the next 5 years, China’s net daily imports of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> will reach 9.5 million barrels, which is next only to the United States’ record of 10 million barrels per day in the beginning of this century. Firstly, in the process of strengthening international cooperation, China should make effective use of foreign resources to ensure energy security. Secondly, the trend of the international <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> price is needed for our country’s refined oil price adjustment. At present, China’s dependence on foreign <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and gas is more than 65 % and 30 %. The import price of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> in China is greatly affected by the price of international commodity futures market. With this background, China should continue to increase investment, accelerate the national strategic <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> facilities, increase enterprise reserves infrastructure, enhance the commercial <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> storage capacity and reduce the impact of the international energy market volatility on China’s economy. Thirdly, China will strengthen cooperation with the “One Belt and One Road” initiative along the country’s energy field, which can enrich China’s imports of energy sources to deal with future complicated geopolitical situations.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} written in Dr. Nathan Citino's history seminar, America in the Middle East (HIST 436). The Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), which {{controlled}} the world's largest <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>reserve</b> and was once the largest American investment overseas, often claimed that its petroleum extraction activities contributed to the modernization of Saudi society. Scholars have critiqued Aramco's narrative of enlightened self interest by showing how the company clung to a racialized labor hierarchy and repeatedly eschewed reforms. This essay continues that criticism by examining Aramco’s policies on women and the family. Using internal memos and publicity materials released between 1940 and 1970, this study reveals how Aramco’s American owners used gender to understand, manage, and Orientalize their Saudi employees. In its public image, Aramco claimed to be liberating Saudi women from an anachronistically oppressive society. Yet in the jobs it did (and did not) offer to women, {{as well as the}} housing options it gave to Saudi families, the company’s policies demonstrate a similarly patriarchal logical work.

30|$|It is hard {{to recover}} and process heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and bitumen, owing to their high {{viscosity}} (i.e. resistance to flow) at reservoir conditions (making their mobility extremely low) and high carbon-to-hydrogen atomic ratios. Hitherto, with the rising price of <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> declining <b>reserves</b> of medium and light <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and the abundance of unconventional <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> (i.e. heavy oil and bitumen/tar sands), their exploitation is therefore favoured. However, heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and bitumen exploitation is faced with technical challenges at all stages from recovery/production from the reservoir to transportation and refining. Transporting heavy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and bitumen via pipeline is usually challenging due to their high density and viscosity (> 1, 000  cP) and very low mobility at reservoir temperature. Asphaltene deposition, heavy metals, sulphur and brine or salt content {{make it difficult to}} be transported and refined using conventional refinery methods without firstly upgrading them to meet conventional light <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> properties (Zhang et al. 2010; Hart 2012). Also, the presence of brine or salt in the heavy crude stimulates corrosion problems in the pipeline (Martinez-Palou et al. 2011).
