60|$|Away {{went the}} {{children}} full of anxiety to clothe their beggar; and so well did they plead his cause {{with the good}} neighbors, that Ben hardly knew himself when he emerged from the back bedroom half an hour later, clothed in Billy Barton's faded flannel suit, with an unbleached cotton shirt out of the Dorcas basket, {{and a pair of}} Milly <b>Cutter's</b> old <b>shoes</b> on his feet.|$|R
5|$|During his cycling career, Marchant {{had worked}} as an {{apprentice}} <b>shoe</b> <b>cutter.</b> After his retirement, he continued along the same line of work, spending his entire working career in the shoe industry, designing and marketing women's fashion shoes under the brand Imps and Cadets. He married in 1962 and has two children.|$|R
25|$|Pingree {{was born}} in Denmark, Maine, to Jasper Pingree and Adeline (Bryant) Pingree and {{attended}} the common schools in Maine. At the age of fourteen, he moved to Saco, Maine, where he worked at a cotton factory.

50|$|The T.U. Lyon House is a {{historic}} house at 9 Warren Street in Stoneham, Massachusetts. The modest 1.5 story Greek Revival house was built c. 1850 for T.U. Lyon, a <b>shoe</b> <b>cutter.</b> At {{the time of its}} construction Warren Street had been supplanted as the major north-south road through Stoneham by the Medford-Andover Turnpike (now Main Street, Massachusetts Route 28). Most of its distinctive Greek Revival features, including corner pilasters and a larger-than-typical frieze, have been lost due to recent residing of the exterior (see photo).|$|R
40|$|A 171 m deep ice core {{from the}} surface to the bottom has been {{successfully}} drilled on the West Belukha snow-firn Plateau in the Russian Altai Mountains {{in the summer of}} 2003. The drill system used in this project was an electro-mechanical drill with a barrel 135 cm long and 9. 5 cm in inner diameter manufactured by Geo Tecs Co., Japan. The maximum core length for a drilling run is 55 cm. It took 87. 5 hours in actual working time of 7 working days to drill the core {{down to the bottom of}} the glacier. The total number of drilling runs was 325. The mean length of the drilled core was 48. 6 cm. Most of the cores were not brittle and had a good cylindrical shape. High air temperature above the melting point in the drilling shelter caused some trouble in drilling. One of the major troubles was slip of cutters due to adhesion of cutting tips to the <b>cutters</b> and <b>shoes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Schull {{was born}} in Louisiana, Missouri, the first son and second child of Eugene Schull, a <b>shoe</b> <b>cutter,</b> and Edna Gertrude Davenport. Among his distant {{relatives}} {{there were at least}} three geneticists, George H. Shull, the discoverer or hybrid vigor, A. Franklin Shull, a geneticist at the University of Michigan, and Franklin Shull’s daughter, Elizabeth “Tibby” Buckley Shull Russell, {{a past president of the}} Genetics Society of America. In the mid-1920s, the Schull family moved to St. Louis, Missouri and later to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Schull started his academic studies at Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1939. In December 1942 he enlisted in the army and served as surgical technician with the 37th Infantry Division in the South Pacific until December 1945. After the war, he finished his bachelor's degree in Zoology at Marquette in 1946, and then went on to obtain a master's degree in Zoology in 1947.|$|R
25|$|Gershwin was of Russian Jewish and Ukrainian Jewish ancestry. His grandfather, Jakov Gershowitz, {{had served}} for 25 {{years as a}} {{mechanic}} for the Imperial Russian Army to earn the right of free travel and residence as a Jew, finally retiring near Saint Petersburg. His teenage son, Moishe Gershowitz, worked as a leather <b>cutter</b> for women's <b>shoes.</b> Moishe Gershowitz met {{and fell in love}} with Roza Bruskina, the teenage daughter of a furrier in Vilnius. She and her family moved to New York due to increasing anti-Jewish sentiment in Russia, changing her first name to Rose. Moishe, faced with compulsory military service if he remained in Russia, moved to America as soon as he could afford to. Once in New York, he changed his first name to Morris. Gershowitz lived with a maternal uncle in Brooklyn, working as a foreman in a women's shoe factory. When he married Rose on July 21, 1895. Gershowitz soon Americanized his name to Gershwine.|$|R
40|$|Damage by {{excessive}} vibration is serious engineering problem in TBM boring process. Dynamic characteristic analysis {{is essential for}} TBM antivibration design. According to TBM horizontal support structure, a dynamic coupling nonlinear model is established, with consideration of time-varying impact load and multicomponent complex relationship from <b>cutter</b> to gripper <b>shoe.</b> A set of field vibration tests is set up to accurately collect data under extreme work conditions; then, field data is collected from Liaoning northwest engineering. Field data is applied to validate simulation model to make sure time-varying damping stiffness, support cylinder stiffness, and the TBM machine stiffness distribution are reasonable. Simulation indicates the weakest part of TBM in axial and torsional DOF is the cylinder hinge and the connection shaft between motor and pinion, and the horizontal and vertical weak parts are bull gear. It also shows that, in normal excavation conditions, the acceleration amplitude of the cutterhead in three directions ranges from 1. 5 [*]g to 2 [*]g. These results provide theoretical basis for the antivibration design and structural optimization of TBM...|$|R

40|$|This {{collection}} mainly {{documents the}} experiences of Otto Neubauer and his family members from 1938 - 1945 with a particular emphasis on their efforts to secure emigration visas for Maximilian Neubauer, Ernst (Elias) Neubauer, and Frieda Weil. The bulk of the materials consist of correspondence {{in the form of}} handwritten German-language letters, many of which are very fragile. Alongside this correspondence is a bound volume containing annotated, English-language translations of many of these letters along with accompanying materials. Further materials include a diary, cookbook, limited immigration and restitution documents, and records of Otto Neubauer’s schooling, apprenticeships, and employment. Neubauer, Carol : The correspondence of Maximilian Neubauer, 1938 - 1945 : typed manuscript (9 + 238 p.) consisting of the compiled, translated and annotated correspondence of Otto and Maximilian Neubauer (and others), Columbus, OH, 1986. Carol Neubauer is Otto Neubauer's daughter. Otto Neubauer was born on November 5, 1907 in Mannheim, Germany, as the second of two sons to Maximilian Neubauer (1873 - 1945) and his wife Agnes née Bloch (1877 - 1919). He worked as a sales and order clerk in the shoe industry and later as <b>shoe</b> <b>cutter</b> both in Germany and in the United States. Otto immigrated to the United States in 1938. His father Maximilian and brother Ernst (alternatively Elias) (1904 - 1942 ?) were not allowed to emigrate despite years of effort by Otto and other family members and friends. Maximilian was held in the Gurs and Les Milles concentration camps in France and perished at Cornil, France in 1945. Anneliese Dreifus Neubauer was born August 10, 1920; she died in 1999.
