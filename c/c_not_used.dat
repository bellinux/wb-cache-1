The colon notation (€:a) must <b>not</b> be <b>used</b> with the partitive of euro when the number is in the nominative.

We mutated an innocuous surface residue to cysteine and labeled separate pools with fluorescein (donor) and tetramethylrhodamine (acceptor).

40|$|Twenty {{genes in}} wheat, Triticum spp., for {{resistance}} to Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say),have been previously designated H 1 to H 20. The location on wheat chromosomes {{of some of}} the genes is known, but several have not yet been assigned to specific chromosomes. Four wheat differential cultivars have been used to identify 16 possible biotypes of Hessian fly; biotypes were designated GP and A-O. If an additional differential host genotype were added, it is apparent that there are not enough letters in the alphabet to designate all of the biotypes. Therefore, a new system of biotype designation is proposed. Three differential cultivars or lines are assigned to a set. Sets are designated A, B, C, and so on. There are eight combinations of resistant and susceptible reactions within a set. These are coded 1 to 8 for each set. Three sets are proposed to begin biotype designation. Abiotype avirulent to all differentials in three sets is coded 111. If set <b>C</b> were <b>not</b> <b>used,</b> a zero (untested) replaces the digit. In the above case, the biotype is designated 110. The biotype designation system provides flexibility for the addition ofnew sets as new genes are identified and for the deletion of sets no longer deemed useful...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore those events and circumstances leading to homelessness among women and their children who use public shelters in metropolitan Atlanta. To attain this objective, the researcher did the following: (a) identified the factors that influenced homelessness; (b) explained the various interactions between factors; and, (c) used simple theoretical models to test which of these factors had greater influence. The research design used in the study was an exploratory/descriptive design. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data in three shelters. The population served in the three shelters (A, B 2 ̆ 6 C) on a daily basis is approximately 130 women and their children. Samples used in Shelter A equaled to 31 women, Shelter B equaled to 29 women, and Shelter C to 5 women. Simple descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Data collected from Shelter <b>C</b> was <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in comparison with the other two shelters since this would distort the findings. Shelters A and B were almost equal and the sample in Shelter C was very small, therefore, Shelter C was excluded from the comparison. The findings reveal that the major contributory factors to homelessness among women and their children are economic, social, political and the legislative. Whereas, the secondary factors are personal crises, such as alcoholism, drug abuse, psychiatric disturbances, physical disablement and limited educational background...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} tylosin on erythromycin-resistant enterococci was {{examined}} on three farms; farm A used tylosin for growth promotion, farm B used tylosin {{for treatment of}} disease, and farm <b>C</b> did <b>not</b> <b>use</b> tylosin for either growth promotion or disease treatment. A total of 1, 187 enterococci were isolated from gestation, farrowing, suckling, nursery, and finishing swine from the farms. From a subset of those isolates (n = 662), 59 % (124 out of 208), 28 % (80 out of 281), and 2 % (4 out of 170) were resistant to erythromycin (MIC ≥ 8 μg/ml) from farms A, B, and C, respectively. PCR analysis and Southern blotting revealed that 95 % (65 out of 68) of isolates chosen from all three farms for further study were positive for ermB, but all were negative for ermA and ermC. By using Southern blotting, ermB was localized to the chromosome in 56 of the isolates while 9 isolates from farms A and B contained ermB on two similar-sized plasmid bands (12 to 16 kb). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that the isolates were genetically diverse and represented a heterogeneous population of enterococci. This study suggests that although there was resistance to {{a greater number of}} enterococcal isolates on a farm where tylosin was used as a growth promotant, resistant enterococci also existed on a farm where no antimicrobial agents were used...|$|R
30|$|According to Ichihara et al. (2012), the {{transfer}} coefficient for an incident infrasonic wave {{to generate a}} seismic wave is {{on the order of}} 10 − 7 m/s/Pa. The unprocessed seismic velocity and infrasonic data recorded during the eruption episode of 16 – 17 March 2013 (Fig.  2) have amplitudes of around 10 − 4 m/s and 102  Pa, respectively, suggesting that the eruption tremor seismic signals may be affected by infrasonic waves. For explosion events, the seismic waves generated by infrasonic waves were more clearly identified (Fig.  3 <b>c).</b> We did <b>not</b> <b>use</b> these to locate the explosion events because the ASLs estimated from them were not near the summit of the volcano. On the other hand, the ASLs of the eruption tremor signals derived from the large amplitude parts of the recorded data were determined to be near the summit (Fig.  1 a). This feature suggests that the seismic waves of the eruption tremor signals were dominantly radiated from their sources and the scatters of the ASLs may be caused by the effects of infrasonic waves and other ground noise.|$|R

Viewed with a light microscope, the spores are hyaline or pale yellow, elliptical, and visibly pitted. Electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy reveals the pits, or pores, to be an elaborate net-like structure called a reticulum. There are two to three such pores per micrometer, each approximately 400 nanometers deep. Most spores are 14-20 by 6-9 µm, but some may be as long as 24 or 28 µm; specimens from a Korean population were reported with slightly smaller spores.

40|$|For decades, many {{policymakers and}} economists have {{believed}} that by introducing choice into the public school system, competition will follow, and school and student achievement will improve. Until 2004, there were three major publicly funded voucher programs, in Milwaukee, Cleveland, {{and the state of}} Florida. In addition, many smaller privately funded programs existed, mainly in urban areas, around the United States. In January 2004, the U. S. Congress enacted a new voucher program in Washington, D. C.

40|$|Several {{mechanisms}} for attachment and entry of Chlamydia have been proposed. We previously {{determined that the}} major outer membrane protein of Chlamydia trachomatis is glycosylated with a high-mannose oligosaccharide, and a similar structure inhibited the attachment and infectivity of C. trachomatis in epithelial cells. Because insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF 2) was shown to enhance the infectivity of Chlamydia pneumoniae but <b>not</b> <b>C.</b> trachomatis in endothelial cells, a hapten inhibition assay was used to analyze whether the mannose 6 -phosphate (M 6 P) /IGF 2 receptor that also binds M 6 P could be involved in infection of endothelial cells (HMEC- 1) by Chlamydia. M 6 P and mannose 6 -phosphate-poly[N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) -acrylamide] (M 6 P-PAA) inhibited the infectivity of C. pneumoniae AR- 39, but <b>not</b> <b>C.</b> trachomatis serovar UW 5 or L 2, while mannan inhibited the growth of <b>C.</b> trachomatis, but <b>not</b> <b>C.</b> pneumoniae. <b>Using</b> metabolically labeled organisms incubated with cells at 4 °C (organisms attach but do not enter) or at 37 °C (organisms attach and are internalized), M 6 P-PAA was shown to inhibit attachment and internalization of C. pneumoniae in endothelial cells but did not inhibit attachment or internalization of C. trachomatis serovar E or L 2.
