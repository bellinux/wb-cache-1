25|$|Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was {{released}} on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features. As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256MB and a built-in FireWire port. Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used {{a modified version of}} Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, {{with the exception of the}} Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.|$|E

40|$|Gravitational lensing {{provides}} a unique probe {{of the inner}} 10 – 1000 pc of distant galaxies (z ∼ 0. 2 – 1). Lens theory predicts that every strong lens system should have a faint image {{near the center of}} the lens galaxy, which should be visible in radio lenses but have not been observed. We study these “core” images using models derived from the stellar distributions in nearby early-type galaxies. We find that realistic galaxies predict a remarkably wide range of <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> with lensing magnifications spanning some six orders of magnitude. More concentrated galaxies produce fainter <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> although not with any simple, quantitative, model independent relation. Some real galaxies have diffuse cores and predict bright <b>core</b> <b>images</b> (magnification µcore � 0. 1), but more common are galaxies that predict faint <b>core</b> <b>images</b> (µcore � 0. 001). Thus, stellar mass distributions alone are probably concentrated enough to explain the lack of observed <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> and may require observational sensitivity to improve by an order of magnitude before detections of <b>core</b> <b>images</b> become common. Two-image lenses will tend to have brighter <b>core</b> <b>images</b> than four-image lenses, so they will be the better targets for finding <b>core</b> <b>images</b> and exploiting these tools for studying the central mass distributions of distant galaxies...|$|R

40|$|Digital <b>core</b> <b>images</b> {{offer the}} highest {{resolution}} realization of core properties available to scientific investigators. The digital core scanner used aboard the JOIDES Resolution during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 303 captured ~ 10 pixels per millimeter of core. The ocean drilling community, however, {{has been slow}} to utilize these digital data as other than highly de-tailed pictures. In this study we illustrate a fast and simple method to extract <b>core</b> <b>images</b> as depth-scaled digital data. These data can then be manipulated through image enhancement to highlight detail not easily recognized in the original <b>image</b> or <b>cores.</b> Other data such as multisensor track core scans can be eas-ily overlain on the images. We use digital <b>core</b> <b>images</b> to examine <b>core</b> distortion by developing sets of tables for five Expedition 303 sites that precisely map features in the site composite to those same features in individual cores from each hole at that site. In general, results show that in 80 % of instances features within the composite section line up to within 35 cm of the same features in sections not used for the composite...|$|R

50|$|The DOS-11 {{operating}} system kernel was one file called MONLIB.LCL. The LCL extension was the acronym for LInked <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> Library (or LICIL). An LICIL could be stored on {{any type of}} media that the DOS-11 {{operating system}} was distributed on (disk, DECtape, punched tape or magnetic tape). When the LICIL file was installed (Hooked) onto a disk drive as a contiguous file, the monitor library name is changed to MONLIBCIL which could then be booted. The CIL extension was the acronym for <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> Library. Core, was the term for the core memory systems common to the PDP-11. A <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> Library could be created with the CILUS (<b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> Library Update and Save) program. A MONLIBCIL typically contained the resident monitor (RMON), the keyboard command routine, device drivers, EMT routines, the clock routines and the transient monitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> abstracts the pixel-level {{manipulation}} process required when {{applying a}} filter to an image, making it simple for applications to implement image transformation capabilities without extensive coding. In a simple implementation, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> applies a single Image Filter to the pixel data {{of a given}} source to produce the transformed image. Each Image Filter specifies a single transform or effect, either built into <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> or loaded from a plugin called an Image Unit. Combined with preset or user-defined input parameters, the filter {{can be applied to}} the original pixel data without modifying it, thereby providing non-destructive image editing.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the efficacy of}} digital materials for learning English. Since Nagasaki University introduced a computer assisted language learning system, we have developed materials for getting the <b>core</b> <b>images</b> of commonly used verbs, and speed reading. This paper, as a case in point, sees whether integrated digital materials are able to enhance English learning {{and it can be}} instrumental in internalizing the <b>core</b> <b>images</b> of basic verbs as well as grammatical items already leaned. Students had been given regular noticing exercises and subsequent enforcement exercises, which are designed to raise awareness of core lexical meanings. They had also been given exercises for speed reading. In order to assess the efficacy of the materials and exercises, I used the results of G-TELP test and a questionnaire study. This paper further discusses the implications of the conducted study for future development of digital English learning materials...|$|R

50|$|Like Photoshop, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> {{can apply}} {{multiple}} filters {{to the same}} image source. Instead of applying a series of filters individually, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> assembles a dynamic instruction pipeline so that only one calculation needs {{to be applied to}} the pixel data to achieve a cumulative effect. Applying the pixel operations associated with multiple filters can be achieved simultaneously and without a significant increase in processing time. Regardless of the number of filters, <b>Core</b> <b>Image</b> assembles the code for this instruction pipeline with a just-in-time compiler, which is executed by either the CPU or graphics card's GPU, whichever can perform the calculation faster.|$|E

40|$|A pseudo-outcrop {{visualization}} {{is demonstrated}} for borehole and full-diameter rock <b>core</b> <b>images</b> {{to augment the}} ubiquitous unwrapped cylinder view and thereby to assist non-specialist interpreters. The pseudo-outcrop visualization is equivalent to a nonlinear projection of the image from borehole to earth frame of reference that creates a solid volume sliced longitudinally to reveal two or more faces in which the orientations of geological features indicate what is observed in the subsurface. A proxy for grain size is used to modulate the external dimensions of the plot to mimic profiles seen in real outcrops. The volume is created from a mixture of geological boundary elements and texture, the latter being the residue after the sum of boundary elements is subtracted from the original data. In the case of measurements from wireline microresistivity tools, whose circumferential coverage is substantially less than 100 %, the missing circumferential data is first inpainted using multiscale directional transforms, which decompose the image into its elemental building structures, before reconstructing the full image. The pseudo-outcrop view enables direct observation of the angular relationships between features and aids visual comparison between borehole and <b>core</b> <b>images,</b> especially for the interested non-specialist.
