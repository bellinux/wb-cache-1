Core specimens (n= 5) of IPS E. max were produced and veneered with IPS E. max veneering porcelain to a final dimension (13 mm in diameter, 1. 5 mm in thickness). Luminous reflectance was measured three times each specimen with a calibrated spectrophotomete. <b>Contrast</b> <b>ratios</b> were measured from the luminous reflectance(Y) of the tested specimens with a black (Yb) and a white background (Yw). <b>Contrast</b> <b>ratios</b> ranged from 0. 798 - 0. 818 for LT core-veneer combinations, 0. 831 - 0. 845 for MO core-veneer combinations, 0. 929 - 0. 941 for HO core-veneer combinations. There were {{no significant difference in}} <b>contrast</b> <b>ratios</b> of core-veneer combinations of the same series (P> 0. 05). <b>Contrast</b> <b>ratios</b> of LT, HO, MO core-veneer specimens were significantly different (P< 0. 05).

25|$|On July 1, 2010, Amazon {{released}} the Kindle DX Graphite (DXG) globally. The DXG has an E Ink display with 50% better <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> due to using E Ink Pearl technology and comes {{only in a}} graphite case color. It is speculated the case color change is to improve <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> perception further, as some users found the prior white casing highlighted that the E Ink background is light gray and not white. Like the Kindle DX, {{it does not have}} a Wi-Fi connection. The DXG is a mix of third-generation hardware and second-generation software. The CPU has the same speed as Kindle Keyboard's CPU, but the DXG has only half the system memory, 128MB. Due to these differences, the DXG runs the same firmware as Kindle 2. Therefore, DXG cannot display international fonts, like the Cyrillic, Chinese, or any other non-Latin font and PDF support and the web browser are limited to matching the Kindle 2's features.|$|E

500|$|In April 2012 Asus {{revealed}} {{a revision of}} the two original Zenbooks, this time based on the Ivy Bridge microarchitecture. The model numbers were UX21A and UX31A for the 11 and 13inch models respectively but are more frequently referred to as Zenbook Primes. Changes made to the original included the aforementioned update to Ivy Bridge processors {{and the introduction of}} the corresponding HM76 chipset bringing native USB 3.0, 1920×1080 IPS displays for both models, an Intel Centrino Wi-Fi controller, an improved trackpad and new plastic keyboard with backlighting. The new screens were highly praised by reviewers when considering brightness, <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio,</b> viewing angle and colour accuracy, the improvements over previous models being put down to the switch from TN to IPS displays. The UX21A has <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> of 939 and the UX31A achieved 1085, giving it the highest resolution and <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> of any ultrabook at the time of release. The improved keyboard also garnered praise for the increased backlighting and improved key travel while the Intel Wi-Fi controller was found to perform better than the Qualcomm used in the first generation of Zenbooks. The Zenbook Primes still received some criticism: the latest version of the trackpad was acknowledged as an improvement over the original Zenbooks, but still irritating, and the sound quality was found to be worse than that with the first generation. Despite these issues, the overall reaction was positive: the UX31A was called [...] "today's best ultrabook" [...] and [...] "the best ultrabook out there" [...] at the time of release.|$|E
500|$|As {{a cheaper}} option the UX32A was praised by Chris Martin of PC Advisor for being [...] "a more {{affordable}} luxury", retaining the [...] "premium feel" [...] of the Zenbook range {{but at a}} lower price point. The aluminium chassis, which is identical to the UX32VD to keep costs down, was widely acclaimed for its strength and build quality. By contrast, the Sandy Bridge chip, a previous-generation part at the time of sale, was outlined as a detraction as was the lower battery life compared to the UX31E. Although the screen used was a TN panel and of a lower resolution than the UX32VD or UX31A, it was considered an acceptable compromise for the price. The screen has a matte finish and relatively high brightness which Notebook Check's reviewer, Christian Hepp, found [...] "quite suitable for outdoor use", noting that it had a good <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> but a narrow range of colours.|$|E
500|$|The first {{generation}} of Zenbooks was announced on October11,2011, one day before release, although they were first demonstrated at Computex 2011 in May that year. Two models were released in 2011 to positive reviews: the 11inch UX21E and the 13inch UX31E, also frequently known as the UX21 and UX31 respectively. The design of the UX21 drew comparisons to the Macbook Air and it was regarded as an [...] "excellent rival" [...] by CNET reviewer Andrew Hoyle. Other aspects of the laptops that reviewers liked were the Bang and Olufsen speakers, fast boot times due to Asus' BIOS design and the speed of general tasks within the operating system resulting from the SSD and Sandy Bridge processors. However, the screens drew criticism for their poor <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio,</b> colour accuracy and less than perfect viewing angle, although they were praised for their brightness and the sharpness of the UX31's screen. Reviewers also noted the shallow key-press of the metal keyboard and lack of backlighting, a feature that Asus {{did not have time}} to implement before shipping.|$|E

2500|$|Brightness and {{contrast}} ratio: [...] <b>Contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio of}} the brightness of a full-on pixel to a full-off pixel. The LCD itself is only a light valve and does not generate light; the light comes from a backlight that is either fluorescent or a set of LEDs.

Some LCD monitors using this technology have a feature called dynamic contrast, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan [...] Using PWM (pulse-width modulation, a technology where the intensity of the LEDs are kept constant, but the brightness adjustment is achieved by varying a time interval of flashing these constant light intensity light sources), the backlight is dimmed to the brightest color that appears on the screen while simultaneously boosting the LCD contrast to the maximum achievable levels, allowing the 1000:1 <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> of the LCD panel to be scaled to different light intensities, resulting in the [...] "30000:1" [...] contrast ratios seen in the advertising on some of these monitors. Since computer screen images usually have full white somewhere in the image, the backlight will usually be at full intensity, making this [...] "feature" [...] mostly a marketing gimmick for computer monitors, however for TV screens it drastically increases the perceived <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> and dynamic range, improves the viewing angle dependency and drastically reducing the power consumption of conventional LCD televisions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Planet Detection Testbed is {{designed}} to simulate the architecture and opera-tion of a space-borne four-telescope nulling interferometer. Constructed {{in the form of a}} dual chopped Bracewell interferometer, it comprises both star and planet sources and the principal features of the flight beam combiner designed at JPL for the proposed TPF-I Formation Flying Interferometer. The aims of the testbed are to demonstrate stable four-beam nulling and planet detection at representative star-planet <b>contrast</b> <b>ratios.</b> In the flight design, starlight between 7 and 17 micron wavelength is to be nulled, and 2 to 3 micron starlight is used for fringe tracking and phasing the interferometer. There are also the metrology systems and alignment systems which are required for deep and stable nulling. The testbed reproduces these features; 2 to 3 micron light from a thermal source is used for fringe tracking, and nulling and planet detection is performed at 10 microns. The testbed also incorporates laser metrology and other necessary systems enabling continuous control of beam alignment. The ultimate goal is to simulate planet detection at star-planet <b>contrast</b> <b>ratios</b> of order 10 − 7 during full rotations of the telescope array using the phase chopping method. The latest results from the testbed are presented including four-beam nulling experiments at null depths of 10 − 5 and planet signal detections at similar <b>contrast</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
