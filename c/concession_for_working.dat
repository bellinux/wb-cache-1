40|$|ABSTRACT. Using an anarchist {{theoretical}} framework, it {{is argued}} that the working class would obtain greater gains through militant direct action modeled on the labor movement of the past. The history of the 8 -hour workday is reviewed as a case study showing that it was won because of radical leaders who challenged existing legal institutional frameworks through societal education, militant ideology, direct action, and violent re-sistance against state attacks. Positive changes did not occur politically, peacefully, or voluntarily. Instead, oftentimes the threat of or use of vio-lent resistance and even rebellion had preceded major <b>concessions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>working</b> class. doi: 10. 1300 /J 134 v 11 n 02 _ 01 [Article copies available for a fe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere are {{approximately}} 45, 000 legally registered microbus drivers in Mexico City. Being legally registered {{means that they}} fulfill in due time all the obligations and observe the regulations derived from their vehicle and their <b>concession.</b> However, <b>for</b> <b>working</b> and social security purposes they are informal operators and live in precarious conditions, as {{they are not in}} receipt of benefits and do not have a fixed salary or health insurance. This means that their job and the risks and demands involved in it are translated into long days of work, fatigue, professional illnesses and stressful conditions which lead to aggressive behaviors and constitute a risk factor in road safety. In 2012 alone, 4, 712 accidents were recorded in this group. Thus, {{based on the premise that}} working and health conditions determine road safety, an exploratory descriptive study was conducted from a quantitative research approach. Such study consisted of 500 supervised interviews with drivers, to explore socioeconomic, work and health variables, including some aspects of road safety and driving styles. The exposure-effect ratio in road accidents was then analyzed. Among the main results of this research, a correlation of 0. 77 was identified between road accidents and drivers <b>working</b> <b>for</b> over 8 hours per day; 0. 78 <b>for</b> drivers <b>working</b> more than 5 days per week; and 0. 73 between the number of tickets and working days of more than 8 hours. Road accidents are explained by these high percentages...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade <b>concessions</b> <b>for</b> {{infrastructure}} in developing countries have become increasingly prevalent {{as a result of}} the perceived benefits to the country and its inhabitants. These infrastructure concession contracts delineate the allocation of rights, risks, costs, and incentives among the contracting parties. While the burgeoning growth of <b>concessions</b> <b>for</b> infrastructure is encouraging, the high rate of renegotiation of these concession contracts is not. Over 40 % of concessions are renegotiated after, on average, 2. 2 years of the contract signing date (Guash, Laffont, and Straub, 2002); the common change being a reallocation of risks among the parties. This work examines the proposed <b>concession</b> <b>for</b> a Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system in Cartagena, Colombia. By examining the legal environment of Colombia and building a model to simulate the operation of the concession, this work provides a policy recommendation applicable to the BRT and <b>concessions</b> <b>for</b> infrastructure in developing countries in general. ...|$|R
