This is the secret that has not yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what he did, and the story of subsequent attempts to cover-up, whitewash and protect senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.|$|R

Finally, Geoff's secret that he had assisted terminally ill patients to euthanise themselves came out and Geoff was fired from the clinic. In {{the midst of the}} scandal, Victor was forced to resign as CEO, leaving Chris to take up the position. The DHB decided to cover the whole thing up, but Geoff <b>continued</b> to make <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> of himself. At the same time, Geoff finally learned about Dominic's interest in Delphi and warned him away from his little sister. Geoff soon figured out that Dominic was drugging Emily and sought to expose him. Dominic was determined not to let that happen.|$|R

50|$|Delaware v. City of Westminster (2001 UKHL 55) is an English {{court ruling}} on nuisance, {{addressing}} {{the question of}} liability for repairing damage caused by tree roots. The court upheld a ruling of the Court of Appeal, stating that if a defendant knew about <b>a</b> <b>continuing</b> <b>nuisance</b> (in this case, cracking caused by tree roots), and had been given notice and opportunity {{to deal with it}} but failed to do so, then a claimant was entitled to receive costs for removing the nuisance themselves. It is a leading case, and has not been superseded or overturned by subsequent judgements.|$|R

"What is a {{place in}} this obscene state of {{dilapidation}} but <b>a</b> <b>Nuisance?</b> What is <b>a</b> man in your obscene state of dilapidation but <b>a</b> <b>Nuisance?</b> Then, as you very well know, you cannot do without an audience, and your audience is <b>a</b> <b>Nuisance.</b> You attract all the disreputable vagabonds and prowlers within ten miles around, by exhibiting yourself to them in that objectionable blanket, and by throwing copper money among them, and giving them drink out of those very dirty jars and bottles that I see in there (their stomachs need be strong!); and in short," [...] said Mr. Traveller, summing up in a quietly and comfortably settled manner, [...] "you are <b>a</b> <b>Nuisance,</b> and this kennel is <b>a</b> <b>Nuisance,</b> and the audience that you cannot possibly dispense with is <b>a</b> <b>Nuisance,</b> and the Nuisance is not merely <b>a</b> local <b>Nuisance,</b> because it is <b>a</b> general <b>Nuisance</b> {{to know that there}} can be such <b>a</b> <b>Nuisance</b> left in civilisation so very long after its time." ...|$|R
5000|$|By contrast, <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se is [...] "an activity, or an act, structure, instrument, or {{occupation}} {{which is}} <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> {{at all times}} and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings." [...] Liability for <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se is absolute, and injury to the public is presumed; if its existence is alleged and established by proof, it is also established {{as a matter of}} law. [...] Therefore, a judge would decide <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se, while a jury would decide <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in fact.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>nuisance</b> claims allege <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in fact, for {{the simple}} reason that not many actions or {{structures}} have been deemed to be nuisances per se. In general, if an act, or use of property, is lawful, or authorized by competent authority, it cannot be <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se. Rather, the act in question must either be declared by public statute, or by case law, to be <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se. There are few state or federal statutes or case law declaring actions or structures to be <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in and of themselves. Few activities or structures, in and of themselves and under any and all circumstances, are a nuisance; which is how courts determine whether or not an action or structure is <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{nuisance}} under the American law: <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in fact, or [...] "nuisance per accidens", and <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> per se. The classification determines whether the claim goes to the jury, or gets decided by the judge. An alleged nuisance in fact {{is an issue of}} fact to be determined by the jury, who will decide whether the thing (or act) in question created <b>a</b> <b>nuisance,</b> by examining its location and surroundings, the manner of its conduct, and other circumstances. [...] A determination that something is <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> in fact also requires proof of the act and its consequences.|$|R

40|$|Nebraska Livestock Nuisance Law Until 1976 the Nebraska Supreme Court {{had ruled}} that animal feeding {{operations}} (AFOs) located {{in rural areas}} did not legally constitute <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> unless the AFO were improperly operated. However, in 1976 the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that a rural AFO may constitute <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> even if properly operated. This decision made AFO operators liable {{for the first time}} in Nebraska if their AFO constituted <b>a</b> <b>nuisance.</b> In 1977 the Nebraska Unicameral adopted an amendment to the Nebraska Environmental Policy Act defining when AFOs would legally constitute <b>a</b> <b>nuisance.</b> Basically, the statute said that an AFO was not <b>a</b> <b>nuisance</b> (1) if the AFO was there first, (2) if the AFO complied with all state and local regulations, and (3) if best management practices to minimize dust, odors and other nuisance factors were used in the AFO. In 1982 the Unicameral adopted the Nebraska Right to Farm Act, which gave farmers broader protection against nuisance lawsuits...|$|R
