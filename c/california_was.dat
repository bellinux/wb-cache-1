5|$|<b>California</b> <b>was</b> quickly granted {{statehood}} in 1850 and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island {{to secure}} the San Francisco Bay. Silver discoveries, including the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further drove rapid population growth. With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city, lawlessness was common, and the Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals, prostitution, and gambling.|$|E

5|$|Gold {{was also}} {{discovered}} in Southern California {{but on a}} much smaller scale. The first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while <b>California</b> <b>was</b> still part of Mexico. However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E

5|$|Subduction of the Guadalupe Plate/Farallon Plate beneath Baja <b>California</b> <b>was</b> {{prevalent}} in the region until 12,5–11 million years ago; volcanic activity since then is due to tectonic changes associated {{with the development of}} the Gulf of California. Earlier subduction-related volcanism during the Miocene formed the volcanic deposits of the Comondú Group.|$|E
5|$|A season {{highlight}} was {{the final}} game against Stanford's arch-rival California at California Memorial Stadium, the last game of the regular season. Before the game, both teams were undefeated and Stanford had not beaten California since 1905. Nevers did not play due to a broken ankle. Late in the game, <b>California</b> <b>was</b> leading 20–3; California coach Andy Smith, sure the game was over, began substituting regular players. Warner {{seized the opportunity to}} combine passing with the trick plays for which he was known (a fake reverse and a full spinner), and Stanford made a comeback. The game ended in a 20–20 tie.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the casting}} director, Newt was the most {{difficult}} role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, but many of them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines. Henn, from Atwater, <b>California</b> <b>was</b> chosen out of 500 children for the role, although she had no previous acting experience. She received a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, but chose not to pursue an acting career, and became a teacher.|$|E

While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because <b>California</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the most}} populous states), that money went to pay his staff of 12 and {{to cover the cost of}} stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E

5|$|<b>California</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} at Foxy Studios between January and March 2016 with Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. Prior to his involvement, the trio began writing together in September 2015 and completed dozens of songs. They decided to shelve them upon working with Feldmann to start fresh, and they proceeded to record another 28 songs; in all, the group recorded upwards of 50. The band, {{as well as}} Feldmann, would regularly spend 18 hours in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. The album's title comes from the band's home state of California, and its artwork was illustrated by the street artist D*Face.|$|E

5|$|Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, <b>California,</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} {{location}} to open on May 17, 1977. The concept was authored by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, credited with bringing video games such as Pong to the mainstream. The Pizza Time Theatre {{was the first}} family restaurant to integrate food, animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade. Following a filing for bankruptcy, the chain was acquired by competitor Showbiz Pizza Place in 1984, forming Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. In 1990, the company began unifying the two brands {{with the goal of}} renaming every location to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza. They redesigned the logo in 1994, dropping Pizza from each store's name. In 1998, Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. became CEC Entertainment, Inc. As of 2017, 523 Chuck E. Cheese stores are open.|$|E
5|$|During the 1925 season, Stanford lost {{just one}} PCC game (to Washington); <b>California</b> <b>was</b> finally defeated, 27–7.

In their first game, at the Los Angeles Memorial Colosseum, Stanford scored twice in the first half but had to hold off the {{charging}} Trojans in a 13–9 win. Because of the loss to Washington, Warner's team was not invited to the Rose Bowl.|$|E
5|$|For 1996, the Angels {{replaced}} Smith in {{the closer}} role with second-year pitcher Troy Percival. After only eight {{games as a}} setup pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in <b>California,</b> <b>was</b> traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, {{who was in the}} midst of his best season—but did not fare as well in his return to the National League. His ERA was nearly as high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E

5|$|Fresno, <b>California</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} major Armenian {{community}} in the Western US.

5|$|From {{the late}} 1800s to around the 1990s, the Rossi-Massa-Vallerga Garden stood at Copia's site.

The site {{consisted}} of an Italian building complex and garden. The complex consisted of about eight structures—houses, wagon sheds, and a barn—arranged around a central space without any dominant building. The oldest of these dated to around 1880.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks on humans by wild killer whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, killer whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the killer whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in <b>California</b> <b>was</b> bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a killer whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E
