30|$|While Income Support has an {{unambiguously}} {{negative effect}} on work incentives, Family Credit exhibits a notch in the budget constraint, at the minimum level of hours for eligibility, which increases the probability of working this level of hours (although, because Family Credit is means tested, it may act as a disincentive to working longer hours). Prior to the 1988 reform both Income Support and Family Credit recipients were eligible for child nutrition programmes. Post-reform only Income Support participants were entitled, whereas Family Credit participants received cash but no child nutrition programme eligibility. The 1988 reform also involved an expansion of Family Credit so that <b>cash</b> <b>entitlement</b> levels were typically higher by approximately two thirds: average awards were around £ 15 per week prior to the reform and £ 25 after.|$|E
40|$|In {{seeking to}} {{understand}} the factors that lead to non-take-up of means-tested benefits {{it is important to}} identify the potential gains from claiming and the possible barriers to making a claim. Generally, the benefit of claiming is considered to be the <b>cash</b> <b>entitlement.</b> The barriers are lack of information, stigma and other claim costs. In any practical exercise based on survey data the picture is blurred " and may be distorted " by measurement error. Hancock and Barker (2003) examine these issues in relation to Income Support (IS) for British pensioners and Pudney (2001) investigates the possible impact of measurement error on estimates of the take-up of this benefit. However, as well as the cash income offered by IS, there are also benefits in-kind that may be received by virtue of being in receipt of this benefit. One example is free dental treatment; another is funeral expenses paid through the Social Fund. Such "passported benefits" may affect all three of the aspects of take-up modelling mentioned above. First, the prospect of being entitled to these additional benefits may make claiming IS more worthwhile: the costs of claiming {{are more likely to be}} offset by the gains from a successful claim. Secondly however, there may be additional stigma attached to the receipt of in-kind benefits, thus lowering the likelihood of claiming. Finally, data limitations regarding receipt and valuation of the benefits may introduce additional forms of measurement error. ...|$|E
40|$|The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC or EIC) {{began in}} 1975 as a {{temporary}} program to return {{a portion of the}} Social Security tax paid by lower-income taxpayers (the credit was, and remains, calculated as a percentage of earned income, with no direct link to Social Security taxes paid by the tax filer), and was made permanent in 1978. In the 1990 s, the program became a major component of federal efforts to reduce poverty, and is now the largest need-tested, anti-poverty <b>cash</b> <b>entitlement</b> program. Childless adults in 2011 (the latest year for which data are available) received an average EITC of $ 264, families with one child received an average EITC of $ 2, 199, families with two children received an average EITC of $ 3, 469, and families with three or more children received an average EITC of $ 3, 750. A low-income worker must file an annual income tax return to receive the EITC and meet certain requirements for income and age. A tax filer cannot be a dependent of another tax filer and must be a resident of the United States unless overseas because of military duty. The EITC is based on income and whether the tax filer has a qualifying child. The EITC interacts with several nonrefundable federal tax credits to the extent lower-income workers can use the credits to reduce tax liability before the EITC. Income from the credit is not used to determine eligibility or benefits for need-tested programs. The maximum earned income amounts, phase-out income levels, disqualifying investment income level, and maximum credit amounts are adjusted annually to reflect inflation. The actual amount of the credit a tax filer receives is determined by the tax filer’s earned income and number of qualifying children using these inflation adjusted parameters...|$|E

30|$|We {{estimate}} a {{model of}} labour supply and participation in multiple cash and in-kind welfare programmes. The modeling exploits a reform that affected U.K. single mothers. In-work <b>cash</b> <b>entitlements</b> increased under this reform but eligibility to in-kind child nutrition programmes was lost for some households. When we allow for differences in {{the costs associated with}} each welfare programme we find that in-work cash and in-work in-kind transfers both have large positive labour supply effects. There is, however, a utility loss from programme participation which is estimated to be larger for the cash programme than for the child nutrition programmes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} the program participation decision and {{the determinants of}} benefit levels for the two major poverty programs, cash transfers and food stamps, {{before and after the}} 1996 welfare reforms. While the 1996 reforms ended <b>cash</b> <b>entitlements,</b> the changes to the food stamp program were modest. The data for our study come from the March CPS for 1994 and 1999. We find there is less variation across states in food stamp participation rates and benefit levels than in cash transfers. Southerners are more likely to participate in food stamps yet are less likely to participate in cash transfers. Female heads, the less educated, lower income households, the young, and U. S. citizens are more likely to participate in both programs. Welfare reform has resulted in blacks being no more likely to participate in cash transfers than any other racial group. In addition, welfare reform has eliminated any advantage female heads received in cash benefits. In spite of the reformers efforts to redirect benefits to the most needy, we find that there is no relationship between income and the size of cash transfers. ...|$|R
40|$|Reductions {{in federal}} {{entitlement}} programs {{are a major}} component of both the House and Senate plans to balance the federal budget by the year 2002. While there are numerous reports that document the importance of entitlement benefits to low-income families, most studies focus on short-term benefit patterns. 2 In contrast, this study examines the impact of transfer programs on individuals both in one year, 1988, and over the 13 -year period 1976 - 88. If entitlement income is primarily an income support for the permanently poor, then both the annual and intermediate-term receipt of such income will be restricted to those who are {{at the bottom of the}} income distribution. On the other hand, if such programs serve primarily as a safety net for those who become temporarily vulnerable to changes in economic circumstances, then longer-term income histories will show substantial benefits to those who are not persistently poor. Through an examination of the short- and intermediate-term data, this study finds: l Overall, 23. 5 % of the population-nearly one-quarter-received <b>cash</b> <b>entitlements</b> during at least one year between 1976 and 1988; l In 1988, 39. 1 % of people in the lowest income decile (i. e., the bottom 10 %) and 14. 5 % in the second decile received cash transfers or Medicaid...|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} global trends Cash Transfers (CTs) are {{increasingly}} replacing in-kind assistance (such as food and seeds) across {{all sectors of}} humanitarian and development assistance in Zimbabwe. This study focused on assessing the impact of unconditional cash transfers in {{addressing the needs of}} vulnerable urban household headed by elderly women in Mucheke ward 2 of Masvingo. The study also sought to identify the needs and the coping strategies employed by the vulnerable urban household headed by elderly women. The study is a non-intervention descriptive study carried out on a small scale. It emerged from the study that remittances are dwindling for these households {{and at the same time}} dependency ratios are on the increase. Those receiving cash transfers are being innovative as they invest some of the cash into small income generating initiatives. It further emerged that the needs of the vulnerable urban elderly and non-elderly women are insufficiently met by the small amount of cash transfer which is more often than not unpredictable and inconsistently provided. Backdating of the <b>cash</b> transfer <b>entitlements</b> affects the labour constrained. It was also observed that utility bills for the 55 % of vulnerable urban household headed by elderly women gobble more of resources that the beneficiaries generate. The introduction of cash transfers improved social cohesion and household relationships and allowed women to make decisions on the use of the money. The study concluded and recommended that: Government, NGOs and donors need to work together to identify appropriate solutions to ensure that transfer values remain consistent in all locations, for example by building in reasonable allowances for exchange rate fluctuations into budgets. This also applies to those organisations whose budgets are not formulated in US Dollars. Computations for <b>cash</b> transfer <b>entitlements</b> should consider the beneficiary needs in line with the survival and or the livelihood promotion thresholds since the current cash transfers are too small to meaningfully leverage incomes for the vulnerable urban households headed by elderly and non elderly women. The cash transfer contributes 15 % to the household income for the vulnerable urban elderly women and 21 % to vulnerable urban household headed by the non-elderly women. There are some positive as well as negative impacts that have been realised as a result of cash transfers but more needs to be done in terms of reviewing the <b>cash</b> transfer <b>entitlements</b> as well as the CT policy framework which is good on paper (rhetoric) to be practically applied and supported. Comparatively, for two vulnerable groups, the assessment has shown that the cash transfers are modestly contributing to these householdsâ€™ income but would be better if the amount is increased to a standard that can lift the beneficiaries from the survival threshold to at least the livelihood protection threshold...|$|R
30|$|Here, we adopt {{structural}} assumptions on preferences {{to allow}} us to identify the costs, borne by the single mother, associated with each transfer programme and so enable us break down the effects of the 1988 reform into those due to changes in <b>cash</b> programme <b>entitlement</b> levels and those due to changes in the in-kind programme eligibility rules. Our structural model has two advantages over and above a strictly reduced form approach, such as difference-in-differences, which would only enable us to describe the gross effects of the reform. First, we are able to quantify the costs associated with participating in different welfare programmes. Secondly, we can compare the sensitivity of behaviour to variations in earned income across labour market states with responses to variations in each form of welfare programme income. This allows us estimate the relative work incentive effects of cash versus in-kind transfers.|$|R

40|$|This study explores {{neoliberalism}} and {{its influence}} on the undergraduate Economics curricula at selected South African Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Neoliberalism is a theory embracing political economic practices that propose that human well-being can be advanced by liberating individuals, entrepreneurial freedom and skills within an institutional framework, characterised by strong private property rights, free markets and free trade. However, {{little is known about}} the influence of neoliberalism on undergraduate Economics programmes. Researchers either criticise neoliberalism or they reserve some components of neoliberalism and concentrate on those per se. Research has revealed that, students exposed to neoliberalism have a desire for life-long learning and are in need of the following skills: analytical, social, entrepreneurial, accountability and employability skills. To survive in this forever-changing environment graduates need to be equipped with flexible skills so that they will be employable and remain employed. Neoliberalism is still accepted as the only possible economic and social order that is available to us. This is in agreement with the opinions of seasoned rulers such as Margaret Thatcher who maintains there is no alternative to neoliberalism. In support neoliberalists argue that global capitalism is promoted, because welfare states are costly, overburdened, inefficient, and incapable of eliminating poverty and are overly oriented to <b>cash</b> <b>entitlements</b> rather than empowering citizens. The importance of curriculum research and the development of the neoliberal theory motivated the researcher to undertake this study. A qualitative multiple case study design was utilised, because it is useful when not much is known about the phenomenon and when in-depth study is needed. Triangulation of data collection tools was employed in this study for validity and reliability of data. The researcher made use of document analysis and structured interviews. The data collected reveal that neoliberalism is attached to politics and that it is a higher stage of capitalism. However, there is a strong sentiment that neoliberalism has good development policies, but these policies should not be implemented as if they are one-size-fits-all. The study findings also reveal that inequality should not be blamed on neoliberalism, as the shift now should be towards how to deal with inequality and also the effects of technology, as technology is replacing human labour at an alarming rate. Pertinent aspects like cultural, environmental and religious issues should be included in the tertiary curricula. Curriculum and Instructional StudiesD. Ed. (Curriculum Studies...|$|R

It was possible for employees to request to cash out up to 2 weeks (or the pro rata equivalent for part-time employees) of their accrued annual leave entitlement every 12 months. However, this could only occur if a term in a workplace agreement specifically permitted cashing out. Requests to cash out annual leave had to be in writing and could be refused by an employer. An employer could not require an employee to <b>cash</b> out an <b>entitlement</b> to annual leave, or exert undue influence or pressure on an employee.|$|R
30|$|The major {{distinguishing}} feature of claiming <b>cash</b> programme <b>entitlements</b> {{is the high}} costs of claiming, as indicated above, compared to the small additional costs of claiming an associated in-kind transfer. Moreover, it seems likely that in the majority of cases the only agents who knew that individuals were receiving cash transfers were the recipients themselves and government officials, while knowledge of in-kind transfer receipt was potentially shared with local shop assistants, in the case of Welfare Milk Tokens, and with teachers and peers at school, in the case of Free School Lunches. It seems likely that non-participation in the cash programmes by those who were eligible was largely driven by imperfect information and the transaction costs of claiming. In contrast, it seems likely that in-kind transfers may have low value for the user, in addition to any stigma, but have relatively low information/transaction costs for the claimant. In the case of Free School Lunches {{it seems likely that the}} burden of any stigma is largely borne by the child. While we refer to stigma in what follows in principle we do not rely on this interpretation of the costs – our argument is that programmes may be differentially effective because of these costs, whatever their nature.|$|R
40|$|In 1996, {{transfers}} made under Established Programs Financing and the Canada Assistance Plan were {{replaced with the}} Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST). This paper examines {{the impact of the}} CHST on the net redistribution of revenues across provinces in its first few years of operation. The results show that, while the CHST alters recent trends in net redistribution, the effects are modest when compared to the impacts of earlier measures such as the freeze in per capita EPF entitlements and the "cap on CAP", imposed in 1990. The federal government's recent decision to raise the CHST cash floor further reduces the CHST's effect on redistribution relative to the status quo as does the decision to adjust the allocation of the CHST slowly (rather than immediately) in the direction of equal per capita shares. Finally, the distinction between <b>cash</b> transfers and <b>entitlements</b> is important when measuring net redistribution from federal transfers to provinces. ...|$|R

Some findings from the study show that the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) accounts and reports on SGIAL funds received from the General Appropriations Act (GAA) following standard government accounting rules and regulations deter scrupulous persons from misuse and misappropriation of the funds. However, administering scholarship funds has certain nuances that do not fit well with national procedures in the release of funds. For one, the fiscal year and the academic year do not jibe. DOST and CHED have to carefully consider this in their planning {{for the use of}} budgeted SGIAL funds from the GAA. The study recommends {{that there should be a}} creation of a scholarship trust fund to which releases from the GAA will be transferred. This will solve the problems caused by a nonsynchronized fiscal and academic year. It will also insure the availability of actual <b>cash</b> to pay <b>entitlements</b> of scholars on time. This also enables the agency implementing the scholarship program to have a better basis for planning and budgeting the funds allocated for the purpose that is released to it...|$|R
40|$|The American Welfare state {{evolved in}} a much {{different}} manner from the welfare states of other industrial nations. The formation {{of the welfare state}} in America was not the result of the political mobilization of labor but emerged during an economic crisis in an attempt to return the country to and reaffirm the capitalist economic system. The decentralized structure of the federal government, which shares power with the states in areas like social protection, has impeded the formation of a more comprehensive system. As such, the welfare state in the U. S. is market conforming and attempts to reaffirm market values of self-sufficiency. The welfare state that was created has remained largely incomplete with the majority of worker social protections to the private sector. In response, labor unions pursued a "mixed-benefit" strategy, which largely relied on private negotiations with individual employers and sought government intervention only to augment these efforts. Those left out of private sector benefits, the poor, racial minorities, and disabled, have had to rely on the paltry means-tested programs which were originally designed to phase out. As such they have been tarred with the brush of "undeservedness" that has helped fuel public hatred of means-tested programs. Growing backlash against the failure of these programs to disappear and the perception that only undeserving people benefit has prompted the abolition of <b>entitlement</b> <b>cash</b> assistance programs and the creation of assistance programs that require employment within the private sector...|$|R
25|$|Production {{of a new}} film, Scream 4 (2011) was {{announced}} in July 2008 by The Weinstein Company who approached Williamson about formulating a new script, {{with the intention of}} creating a new Scream trilogy if the fourth film proved successful. By late 2009, Williamson managed to develop an idea for the film and potential sequels and began work on the script. The film was given a budget of $40 million and the principal cast were signed to the film in September 2009 followed by Craven as director in March 2010. In May 2010, Cathy Konrad, producer on the original three films filed a $3 million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company accusing them of violating an agreement that her company, Cat Entertainment, be given first rights to produce all Scream films in order to cut costs by getting a cheaper producer (Craven's wife Iya Labunka, not named in the suit). In April 2011, it was reported that the Weinsteins had settled out of court with Conrad, the details remaining confidential. The Hollywood Reporter however, claimed that Conrad received a <b>cash</b> payment and <b>entitlement</b> to a percentage of the profits derived from Scream 4. In addition, she was given an executive producer credit on the film. Williamson and Bob Weinstein came into repeated conflict with each other during production with Williamson citing the creative direction of the film as the cause while Weinstein blamed the time constraints on the film's development. Williamson and Weinstein did not speak to each other after Williamson left the production, claiming other responsibilities, and he had not seen the finished version of the film prior to its release.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHealth equity is {{high on the}} {{international}} agenda. This study provides evidence of how health systems can be strengthened to improve health equity in a low-income state. The paper presents {{a case study of}} how the Government of Odisha in eastern India is transforming the health system for more equitable health and nutrition outcomes. Odisha has a population of over 42 million, high levels of poverty, and poor maternal and child health concentrated in its Southern districts and among Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste communities. Conducted between 2008 and 2012 with the Departments of Health and Family Welfare, and Women and Child Development, the study reviewed a wide range of literature including policy and programme documents, evaluations and studies, published and grey material, and undertook secondary analysis of state level household surveys. It identifies innovative and expanded provision of health services, reforms to the management and development of human resources for health, and the introduction of a number of <b>cash</b> transfer and <b>entitlement</b> schemes as contributing to closing the gap between maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes of Scheduled Tribes, and the Southern districts, compared to the state average. The institutional delivery rate for Scheduled Tribes has risen from 11. 7 % in 2005 – 06 to 67. 3 % in 2011, and from 35. 6 % to 79. 8 % for all women. The social gradient has also closed for antenatal and postnatal care and immunisation. Nutrition indicators though improving are proving slower to budge. The paper identifies how political will, committed policy makers and fiscal space energised the health system to promote equity. Sustained political commitment will be required to continue to address the more challenging human resource, health financing and gender issues...|$|R
