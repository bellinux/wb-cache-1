40|$|The {{purpose of}} a series of studies (2) made {{recently}} has been to elucidate the mechanism of the so-called promoter action on reactions taking place in homogeneous systems. The reactions chosen for this purpose were the <b>catalytic</b> <b>decompositions</b> of hydrogen peroxide as effected by various salts. Hydrogen peroxide was selected because its decomposition products, oxygen and water, have no effect upon the reaction, and because the mechanism of some of its <b>catalytic</b> <b>decompositions</b> are well enough known to admit of the study of the anomalous effects observed when two or more catalysts are present at once. Sometimes the effect of mixed catalysts is the sum of their separate effects, as when hydrogen peroxide is decomposed by sols of platinum and gold. (3) However, in many cases, the total effect is much greater than the sum of the individual effects; one of the catalysts being then said to exert a promoter action. In other cases, the resultant effect is less than the sum of the individual effects, and one of the substances is then said to produce negative catalysis...|$|R

In this study, Ru catalysts supported on different carbons were used for <b>catalytic</b> ammonia <b>decomposition.</b> The influences of the porous and graphitic structures of carbon supports on the activities of the catalysts were examined. The catalytic activity over supported Ru catalysts is ranked as Ru/GC (graphitic carbon) > Ru/CNTs (carbon nanotube) > Ru/CB-S (carbon black) > Ru/CB-C > Ru/CMK- 3 approximate to Ru/AC. The samples are characterized by XRD, N- 2 adsorption, Raman spectra and H- 2 chemisorption. Ru particles are highly dispersed on carbon supports. The optimum range of Ru particle sizes is around 3 - 4 nm. On the support side, the graphitic structure of the carbons is critical to the activity of the supported Ru catalyst, while the surface area of carbons is less important. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of oxygen between propylene and propylene oxide {{has been studied}} at surfaces of silver, gold and (VO 2) x. The study {{was carried out by}} following the rate of isotopic carbon distribution between propylene and propylene oxide. The following conditions were employed in the experiments: temperature, 60 to 270 [deg]C; partial pressure ratio propylene oxide to propylene, 0. 35 to 30; contact time, 1 to 10 sec. No homogeneous reaction nor <b>catalytic</b> <b>decompositions</b> were detected. CO 2 formation was 2 O 3 or complexed with poly(4 -vinylpyridine); gold was supported on MgO. The influence of the ratio of the partial pressures of propylene oxide to propylene on the reaction rate was quantitatively measured on each catalyst and taken as an indication of processes of competitive reactive chemisorption of propylene and propylene oxide. The analysis showed that on silver supported on low area Al 2 O 3, single site adsorption was predominant, while two site adsorption prevailed at the surfaces of the other catalysts tested. Some amount of mixed behavior occurred on all catalysts. Kinetically, the carbon isotope exchange reaction was analyzed in terms of sequence of adsorption-desorption steps.
