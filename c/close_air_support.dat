2500|$|AH-6 {{helicopters}} of the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and F-16s {{from the}} 410 AEW provided air cover as the Rangers took their convoy to Haditha. During {{the night of}} 1 April 2003, {{with support from the}} 410th, the Rangers seized the dam, a power station, and a transformer yard while facing light to moderate enemy resistance. Several Iraqis were killed and wounded; others, including 25 civilian workers, were taken prisoner. [...] As daylight broke over the dam, the Rangers began taking increasing enemy fire from the south as well as coordinated attacks {{at both ends of the}} dam. Although the Rangers repelled the initial assault, Iraqi counterattacks continued with heavy mortar and artillery shells that rained down on the Rangers. Fortunately, the Rangers had ample <b>air</b> <b>support</b> from the 410th which attacked several mortar positions. Even without the protection of darkness, the Air National Guard A-10s attacked numerous enemy positions. At nightfall the Iraqis resumed their attacks against the Rangers, but once again <b>close</b> <b>air</b> <b>supported</b> the U.S. forces. A single bomb obliterated the attackers and shattered every window in the dam complex. Nevertheless, the siege continued for ten more days.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of both the TSR-2 and P.1154 programmes, the RAF were still left with a requirement to replace both the Canberra and Hunter in the long-range strike, <b>close</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> and reconnaissance roles. This resulted in the procurement of two aircraft, the General Dynamics F-111K, intended for the long-range interdiction roles {{carried out by the}} Canberra, and the F-4M Phantom, which would be used in the <b>close</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> role undertaken by the Hunter. The F-111K was cancelled within a year of being ordered, but the order for 150 Phantoms went ahead alongside the Phantom order for the Royal Navy; the final 32 units of the RAF order were eventually cancelled. The RAF Phantom, given the designation FGR.2, was broadly similar to the naval version, with some minor variations in terms of engines, avionics and structure, which related to its use as a land-based, rather than carrier-based aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} develop a {{specialised}} shturmovik armoured assault aircraft {{in order to provide}} <b>close</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> for the Soviet Ground Forces. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (shturmovaya) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for <b>close</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> of the army. They lacked essential armour plating to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German offensive against Moscow, codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both fighters and anti-aircraft guns {{was similar to}} that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded air operations even more.

5|$|Like many ex-Army officers, {{he tended}} to see air power in the {{tactical}} role, providing support to land operations. In the historiography of the Luftwaffe Kesselring and Hans-Jürgen Stumpff are usually blamed for neglecting strategic bombing while over-focusing on <b>close</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> for the army. However the two most prominent enthusiasts for the focus on ground-support operations (direct or indirect) were actually Hugo Sperrle and Hans Jeschonnek. The two men were long-time professional airmen involved in German air services since their early careers. The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations due to demands from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel like Kesselring. Interdiction and <b>close</b> <b>air</b> <b>support</b> were operations that suited the Luftwaffe's pre-existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air campaigns. Moreover, many in the Luftwaffe command believed medium bombers to be sufficient in power for use in strategic bombing operations against Germany's most likely enemies; Britain and France.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{military}} tactics rely {{on small}} lightweight ground forces working in <b>close</b> conjunction with <b>air</b> <b>support.</b> To this end, a transponder based {{system has been}} employed since the 1960 ’s to provide aircrews with positional awareness of any friendly ground troops in the combat zone. However, airborne radar systems designed for tracking ground based radio transponders have seen very little revision since the original versions were produced in the 1960 ’s. As a result, current implementations are heavy, slow, large, expensive, unreliable and limited in capability. These characteristics are undesirable on airborne platforms where weight, size, and power constraints are tightly controlled. In this thesis, a GPS-like approach is proposed to calculate the location {{of one or more}} beacons based on several samples of the observing aircraft’s position, and the round trip delay of pulses sent to the beacons. We examine the feasibility of the approach and detail a proof-of-concept system for performing field measurements...|$|R

Sub Unit One's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel George H. Albers. It {{was the only}} Marine Corps organization reporting directly to Military Assistance Command, Vietnam which assumed operational control of the sub unit in September 1966. Throughout its involvement in Vietnam Sub Unit One NGLO and TACP teams operated in all four tactical zones and was the last Fleet Marine Force unit to stand down from the war. Sub Unit One provided naval gunfire and <b>close</b> <b>air</b> in <b>support</b> of South Vietnamese Army and Marine units, South Korean Army and Marine units, Australian and New Zealand Armed Forces as well as United States Army and Marine combat Divisions. While only an estimated 1350 men served the sub unit over those eight years they contributed in no small way to almost every combat operation of the war. In March 1972 naval gunfire spotters directing fire from the gunline ships of the U.S. Navy provided the only counter battery fires directed at North Vietnamese artillery raining ordnance all over I Corps {{in advance of the}} Easter Offensive. Unit strength at that time was only 107 officers and men both Navy and Marine who with their backs to the wall made up the numbers deficit by tenaciously providing around the clock support.|$|R
