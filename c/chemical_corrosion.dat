25|$|Dyfri Williams, {{previously}} the Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, dated {{the cup to}} AD 5–15. Williams {{identified several}} factors supporting this dating. The silver alloy being 95% pure is consistent with other known Roman silver vessels, with silver from later periods having a far higher purity. Cracks in the cup retain <b>chemical</b> <b>corrosion</b> products which are symptomatic of age, remaining despite being cleaned twice during the 20th century. An EDX analysis showed that the corrosion was silver chloride. The decorative style and shape have a close parallel with many other vessels of the period, such as the Chryses kantharos and the closely matching figures of nude men on the Hoby skyphoi, discovered {{a decade after the}} Warren cup was first recorded.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} {{chemical}} analysis were confirmed by measuring electrical capacitance and leakage current {{in a long-term}} test lasting 56days. Due to the <b>chemical</b> <b>corrosion,</b> the oxide layer of these capacitors had been weakened, so after a short time the capacitance and the leakage current increased briefly, before dropping abruptly when gas pressure opened the vent. The report of Hillman and Helmold proved {{that the cause of}} the failed capacitors was a faulty electrolyte mixture used by the Taiwanese manufacturers, which lacked the necessary chemical ingredients to ensure the correct pH of the electrolyte over time, for long-term stability of the electrolytic capacitors. Their further conclusion, that the electrolyte with its alkaline pH value had the fatal flaw of a continual buildup of hydroxide without its being converted into the stable oxide, was verified {{on the surface of the}} anode foil both photographically and with an EDX-fingerprint analysis of the chemical components.|$|E

40|$|Aluminum is of {{interest}} for use in heat exchangers and for some structural components in a steam water cycle. Generally, corrosion process is so limited {{that it does not}} challenge component integrity, but the corrosion products may transport and deposit, causing problems like deterioration of flow, blockages, efficiency changes and loss of heat transfer.

30|$|Metal {{surfaces}} are, {{with few}} exceptions, {{covered with a}} metallic oxide layer of a few to several nanometers in thickness. As a consequence, interactions between metal implants, proteins, and cells are governed by the physical–chemical properties of their corresponding metallic oxides. The excellent <b>chemical</b> inertness, <b>corrosion</b> resistance, repassivation ability, and biocompatibility of titanium are thought to result from the <b>chemical</b> stability (high <b>corrosion</b> resistance) a thermodynamically stable state {{and structure of the}} titanium oxide film mainly composed of TiO 2 at physiological pH values [19 – 22]. The following crystal structures have been recognized for TiO 2 : rutile (tetragonal), anatase (tetragonal), and brookite (orthorhombic). TiO 2 also exists in an amorphous state [23]. Regarding the surface oxide layer on c.p. Ti dental implant systems, spectroscopic studies suggest that the oxide is amorphous and its thickness is approximately 2 – 17  nm [22 – 24].|$|R

50|$|In some applications, {{for example}} {{prosthetic}} {{devices such as}} artificial joints, it is desired to have surfaces very resistant to both <b>chemical</b> <b>corrosion</b> and wear due to friction. Ion implantation is used in such cases to engineer the surfaces of such devices for more reliable performance. As {{in the case of}} tool steels, the surface modification caused by ion implantation includes both a surface compression which prevents crack propagation and an alloying of the surface to make it more chemically resistant to corrosion.|$|E
5000|$|Etching reveals and delineates grain {{boundaries}} and other microstructural {{features that are}} not apparent on the as-polished surface. The two most common types of etching in ceramography are selective <b>chemical</b> <b>corrosion,</b> and a thermal treatment that causes relief. As an example, alumina can be chemically etched by immersion in boiling concentrated phosphoric acid for 30 - 60 s, or thermally etched in a furnace for 20 - 40 min at [...] in air. The plastic encapsulation must be removed before thermal etching. The alumina in Fig. 1 was thermally etched.|$|E

Labor strife at the Horse Creek Valley mills was a major theme of Erskine Caldwell's book God's Little Acre. After World War II, the industrial economy continued to decline until 2005, when the last mill left standing was impacted by the Graniteville Train Derailment. Nine people in the area were killed by an early morning chlorine spill. According to Avondale Mills, owners of the Graniteville Mill, lingering <b>chemical</b> <b>corrosion</b> over the following months caused extensive equipment damage, ostensibly making the facility uneconomical to repair and operate, and leading to its closure in 2006 (Augusta Chronicle, 12 January 2005 and 1 June 2006).|$|E

50|$|Feldspar is {{a common}} raw {{material}} used in glassmaking, ceramics, {{and to some extent}} as a filler and extender in paint, plastics, and rubber. In glassmaking, alumina from feldspar improves product hardness, durability, and resistance to <b>chemical</b> <b>corrosion.</b> In ceramics, the alkalis in feldspar (calcium oxide, potassium oxide, and sodium oxide) act as a flux, lowering the melting temperature of a mixture. Fluxes melt at an early stage in the firing process, forming a glassy matrix that bonds the other components of the system together. In the US, about 66% of feldspar is consumed in glassmaking, including glass containers and glass fiber. Ceramics (including electrical insulators, sanitaryware, pottery, tableware, and tile) and other uses, such as fillers, accounted for the remainder.|$|E
