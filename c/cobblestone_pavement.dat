50|$|Elfreth's Alley {{is named}} for Jeremiah Elfreth, an 18th-century {{blacksmith}} and property owner. Among the alley's residents were tradesmen and their families, including shipwrights, silver and pewter smiths, glassblowers, and furniture builders. In the 1770s, one-third of the households were headed by women. The Georgian and Federal-style houses and <b>cobblestone</b> <b>pavement</b> of the alley were common in Philadelphia during this time.|$|E

50|$|In North America, where a more {{commonly}} used term is pedestrian mall, such areas are still in their infancy. Few cities have pedestrian zones, but some have pedestrianized single streets. Some cities have transit malls. Many pedestrian streets are surfaced with <b>cobblestones,</b> or <b>pavement</b> bricks, thus discouraging any kind of wheeled traffic, including wheelchairs. They are rarely completely free of motor vehicles. Often, all of the cross streets are open to motorized traffic, which thus intrudes on the pedestrian flow at every street corner. In a few pedestrian streets with no cross street cars or trucks, deliveries are made by trucks by night.|$|R

An urnfield cemetery with 940 graves dating to the early Iron Age lies between the megalithic tomb and the tumulus tomb. The graves are covered by heterogeneous stone pavement of up to four meters in diameter next to a standing stone. Circles of small stelae surround the graves and probably served to mark the graves {{and to protect the}} earthenware vessels. Occasionally, the cremated remains lay in a small stone box.

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the {{commercial}} significance of the Kramgasse waned as business moved to the newer, western part of the city and the authorities shut down the many noisy cellar taverns. At the turn of the 20th century, the Kramgasse was already a tourist attraction. Beginning in the 1920s, buses and tramways were routed through it, and from the 1970s on, motor traffic was gradually prohibited throughout the lower Old City. The number of apartments on the Kramgasse steadily dwindled as they came to be replaced by shops and offices.

However, many of the houses in the district have large backyards. Vacant lots, not all of which have been converted into parking lots, also provide breaks in development. Many streets have been lined with mature trees to further provide shade and calm traffic. Some retain their original <b>cobblestone</b> or brick <b>pavement,</b> and crosswalks have been paved that way in other areas.|$|R
40|$|Subsurface {{power grids}} {{constitute}} {{one of the}} largest copper stocks in many industrialized cities. Over time, parts and zones of these systems have been continuously disconnected and abandoned, resulting in the emergence of urban infrastructure ores. This study aims to assess how current conditions and practices influence economic and environmental motives of cable recovery from such power grids. By applying an infrastructure managers perspective and evaluating 16 scenarios involving different extraction technologies and procedures, surface materials, urban locations and types of cables, we identify key areas where solutions or changes to increase incentives for cable recovery are needed. The assessed scenarios display significantly different cable extraction costs, where excavation in city centers with asphalt or <b>cobblestone</b> <b>pavements</b> generates the highest costs while greenbelts offer the best conditions. In most cases, cable revenues are not even close to outweighing the extraction costs. This is especially true for paper-coated cables or cables with aluminum conductors, for which the revenues are much lower than for plastic-insulated copper cables. Although economic conditions could be improved by integrating cable recovery to regular system upgrade projects or by applying non-digging technologies, clear incentives rely on the cable in question being especially valuable. Most of the cable recovery scenarios display environmental motives in terms of net savings in GHG emissions due to metal recycling. In contrast to the economic results, recycling of aluminum power cables is here more awarding than that of corresponding copper cables. We conclude that under current conditions urban mining does not make economic sense to infrastructure managers unless it is integrated as an added value to system upgrade projects. Apart from such re-arrangements in infrastructure provision, several other practice-related changes to cut cable extraction costs are possibly within reach for the managers. Still, an economically motivated practice relies on several external performance drivers such as market diffusion of non-digging technologies, improved cable recycling processes, and increased scrap metal prices. Our conclusion that the arguments for urban mining are currently more environmental than financial, points towards changed perspectives where such activities are seen as a way for infrastructure managers to contribute to societal goals such as climate change mitigation and reduced mineral resource dependence.

50|$|December 1861 and January 1862 {{brought about}} devastating floods that placed {{the future of}} the city in doubt. In order to resolve the situation, the city {{residents}} agreed that additional levee construction was necessary. However, the city was divided between camps that supported a relatively small grading of a few feet to raise the city just above the rivers' cresting levels and those that supported a substantial grading to accommodate basements in city businesses. In the upcoming election of 1863, the level at which the city should be raised became a primary factor; a candidate that supported high-level grading won, and high-level grading renovation proceeded. Earth was removed from a dangerous bend nearby the confluence of the two rivers and used to raise city blocks in 1868; the city's sidewalks, until construction was finally finished, were uneven because neighbors of raised city blocks often remained at the pre-construction level. After the filled regions beneath buildings had settled, new streets had to be paved. While planking had been used in the past, newly raised streets chose either the smooth (though indurable) Nicolson pavement or the easily dirtied (though durable) <b>cobblestone</b> <b>pavement.</b> Grading and paving processes were fully completed by 1873, leaving the first floors of many buildings at the time as basements and leaving second floors as new main floors. Today, this system of 19th-century basements is known as the Sacramento Underground.|$|E
5000|$|The {{beginnings}} of Florida Street {{date back to}} the founding of Buenos Aires in 1580, when it was hewn as a primitive path uphill from the banks of the Río de la Plata. Its first official name was [...] "San José," [...] enacted by Governor Miguel de Salcedo in 1734. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the street was known popularly as Calle del Correo (Post Street) in reference to the post office located on what later became Perú Street (the southern continuation of Florida Street). It was also later known as Empedrado (Cobbled Street). Improved with boulders brought from Montevideo beginning in 1789, it became the first paved street in the city (a section of the original <b>cobblestone</b> <b>pavement</b> is displayed behind the entrance to the Cathedral Station on Diagonal Norte Avenue). Following the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1808, the street was called Baltasar Unquera, in homage to an aide-de-camp to Viceroy Santiago de Liniers, fallen in the fight against Admiral William Carr Beresford. The street was first named [...] "Florida" [...] in 1821. The name was designated in honor of the battle fought in 1814 in Upper Peru against the royalists during the Argentine War of Independence. Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas renamed the street [...] "Perú" [...] in 1837, and in 1857, the name was returned to the present one.|$|E

40|$|The {{forces of}} nature have always been admired by humans and {{affected}} their character. The proximity of water {{and the presence of}} nature create a spirit of freedom and independence. Over a period of several centuries the development of the city of Liepāja has been affected by a wide array of nearby water systems –the Baltic Sea, Liepāja and Tosmare lakes, Līva and Pērkone rivers. Pine woods at the seashore and the vastness of the sea are among the factors that influence the choice of location for living. By incorporating elements of nature in the city environment, it is possible to achieve a harmony between the natural and the man-made. At the end of the 19 th century Liepāja city experienced a period of an accelerated development. A city environment was created on the strip of land between the Baltic Sea and Liepāja lake, with a special emphasis on scenery. The layout of buildings was in a harmony with nature elements. The construction was composed as an ensemble. The magnificent and original greeneries together with the streets of the city created varied scenery, at the same time preserving the interrelations between large green areas, such as parks, gardens and squares. Buildings, <b>cobblestone</b> <b>pavement,</b> sidewalks and street greeneries together with city parks and squares created a unique ensemble of urban planning. Nowadays a great attention should be paid to the special aspect of the city environment and the improvement of the life environment, which is not achievable without the presence of nature elements. The connection between nature elements and architecture of buildings is characteristic of the historic design of the city. By exploring the previous experience in qualitative and balanced design of the city environment, it is possible to continue these traditions, thereby enriching the experience itself. Such approach is a key to preserving the identity of the city...|$|E

SU M M A R Y This article {{examines}} two Soviet Estonian screen adaptations of historical novels: The Last Relic (Viimne reliikvia, Tallinnfilm, 1969, directed by Grigori Kromanov), based on Eduard Bornhöhe’s novel Prince Gabriel or The Last Days of Pirita Monastery (1893), {{which became a}} box-office hit throughout the Soviet Union and even beyond; and Between Three Plagues (Kolme katku vahel, Eesti Telefilm, 1970, directed by Virve Aruoja) which reached much more limited TV-audiences; the connections between this film and its literary „source“ (a novel {{of the same name}} by Jaan Kross) are much more complicated. These screen adaptations are considered from the perspective of spatial representations. I examine which strategies and devices the scriptwriters, directors and production designers drew upon when constructing these cinematic spaces and how they related to their literary hypotexts. As generally for adaptations of historical novels to other media, both The Last Relic and Between Three Plagues speak (perhaps even primarily) about their time of production, about the present rather than the past. In this regard, it is important to recall the role of Tallinn’s Old Town as a locus of resistance in Soviet Estonian culture. Arguably, while the narrative of subversion of The Last Relic has predominantly been connected with the film’s soundtrack (in particular, with the lyrics), the ideologically ambiguous sub-currents of the film’s spatial representations have received much less attention. In addition, the generic difference of The Last Relic (a historical adventure film) and Between Three Plagues (a psychological drama, according to Jaan Kross, the scriptwriter of the film {{and the author of the}} novel), allows tracing their varying attitudes towards historical urban space and its representation. My analysis of these screen adaptations draws on the view according to which a novel and its cinematic adaptation are not involved in a hierarchical relationship of an „original“ and a „copy“; rather, they should be perceived as artworks of equal standing that are associated by links of intertextuality. The Last Relic, defined by its authors as a historical adventure film, is centred on a complicated love story from the 16 th century, presented against the background of the conspiracies and plots of church and nobility, and the revolt of Estonian peasants against these institutions. The approach to the urban space of the Old Town is romantic-rustic, showing the dirty grey colouring of patina on limestone building blocks and demonstrating the heaviness of squared timber. Regarding the relations between the good and the bad, and also the spatial representation of these relations, this is almost in every respect a true-to-the-regime film, which has all the prerequisites for belonging to the subject-dulling repressive entertainment mechanism of the society of spectacle. Despite this, the film managed to acquire clearly distinguishable connotations of national resistance, especially through its music, but also through subtle shifts in spatial representations. By means of its lyrics, but also due to its ambiguous attitudes towards the main settings of its story – the monastery and the Old Town – the film performed a brief intervention into the discursive space of the dominating power, creating a vacuum where, for a moment, the Other reigned. Between Three Plagues intentionally opposes the formulas of mass entertainment. The scenography and cinematography of the film are characterised by the „immobility of medieval engraving“ (Tobro 1970), suggesting a reflective mood instead of the dynamic spectacularity and false optimism of socialist realism. Stylistically the film resembles the works of Scandinavian authors like Carl Theodor Dreyer (esp.  Day of Wrath, 1943) and Ingmar Bergman (esp.  The Seventh Seal, 1957). The goal of contradicting easy entertainment was already embedded in the original version of Jaan Kross’ screenplay, which prohibited the „exhibition of old architecture and museum pieces“, and asked instead to emphasise „the material texture of the backgrounds and larger props…: <b>cobblestone</b> <b>pavement,</b> the grain of timber, rough textiles and especially, limestone walls“ (Kross 1965 : 2). Nevertheless, the film’s architectural setting does not form noticeable metaphors. Still, the avoidance of the romanticism and the lack of domineering popular music instantly locates this film outside the repressive desire-creating machine and the illusions that (re) produce wishful reality. But as far as the sense of national resistance is concerned, although the film indeed presents a number of elements that are ideologically problematic in the context of Soviet society, e. g., the question about the permissibility of speaking the truth and the censorship; the struggle between the authority and the arts, it remains firmly within the overall limits set by the Soviet system...|$|E
40|$|The {{clearing}} of {{the inner}} face of the West Cyclopean Wall revealed again the foundation existing below the retaining wall of the parapet of slabs of Grave Circle A (PI. 23). Its complete clearance proved {{that it is a}} segment of a circular wall that originally limited the area of the shaft graves. The investigation of its fill, under the supervision of Miss Olga Alexandri, yielded 22 small sherds dating the wall. Of these 4 were Gray Minyan, 11 Yellow Minyan, 7 mattpainted, one with a geometric decoration painted in dull white color. These sherds prove that the circular wall is contemporary with the earlier shaft graves of Circle A and place it to the second half and {{towards the end of the}} MH period. The clearance, by the late Dr. John Papadimitriou, of a cist grave under the slabs of the parapet some 1. 30 m. from the entrance of the Circle enabled him to point out that at places the foundation stones of the Ramp rest over a layer of chips formed when the slabs of the parapet were worked and to conclude that the Ramp was not contemporary with the rearrangement of the Circle as maintained by Wace. The further investigation of the area confirmed that observation (Figs. 68 and 69) and proved that the stones of that foundation in places overlap the base of the broken slabs (Figs. 71, 72, and 73). This proves definitely that the retaining wall of the Ramp was built sometime after the rearrangement of the Circle. The examination of the interstices of the block of that wall (Fig. 74) failed to yield sherds that would determine its date, but brought to light a drain which had remained undetected (Figs. 75, 76, and 77). Its opening was found closed with small stones and this seems to have occurred at the beginning of LH III C, as the latest sherds found in its fill indicate (Figs. 73, 78, and 79). The drain and its relation to the area immediately to the west of the Grave Circle — to the Little Ramp, the Ramp House, etc. — remain problematical and will be investigated at a later date. The effort to determine the date of the Great Ramp culminated in a trench some 5. 50 m. in length from north to south and 3. 45 m. in width from east to west. The present-day <b>cobblestone</b> <b>pavement</b> was considered as Stratum No. 1. Below it a layer of earth containing some small stones was found, Stratum 2, averaging 45 - 50 cm. in depth; it yielded 54 sherds, 4 of which were painted (Fig. 80, Nos. 6 - 14). Stratum 3 was composed of a fill of Cyclopean blocks in three superposed rows (Figs. 81, 82, and PI. 24, Γ) loosely piled. The earth between the stones yielded 42 sherds, 14 of which were painted (Fig. 84 Nos. 11 - 25). Incidentally, on this fill of stones were based the blocks which form the lateral wall of the Ramp (Fig. 83, ji - π). The conglomerate blocks ««», of the same figure, form but a single row and not another wall as was assumed heretofore, meant to retain the fill to the rocky formation beyond. Below the fill of stones, Stratum 4 was formed of a well - packed layer of earth 10 - 15 cm. in depth, evidently the surface of an earlier ramp that ascended from north to south (Fig. 81 and PL 74); this ramp had an average width of 2. 50 m., leaving a free passage to Grave Circle A of ca. 3. 50 m. 18 sherds were found in Stratum 4, of which 5 were painted (Fig. 84, Nos. 6 - 10). Stratum 5 consisted of another hard - surfaced layer, 5 - 17 cm. in depth, made up of hard reddish earth and pebbles (Fig. 81 and PI. 24). Bvidently it was another ramp which, however, ascended from south to north. It yielded 5 MH and 20 Mycenaean sherds, of which 9 were painted (Fig. 80, Nos. 15 - 23). Stratum 6 also contained a hard - surfaced ramp ascending from south to north laid over a packing of stones (Fig. 81 and PI. 24). All the sherds from this stratum belong to the MH period. The lowermost Stratum (No. 7) below the fill of stones of Stratum 6, extended to the rock, was made up of brownish earth, and contained MH sherds; its lowermost 10 cm. yielded also some BH plain sherds. It is. evident from the description of the layers that we have 4 different, superimposed ramps. Ramp No 1 is the existing cobble - covered Ramp that apparently was made towards the end of LH III B. Ramp 2 of Stratum 4 an earlier construction, belongs to the middle of LH III B and evidently was constructed when the Lion Gate was built. Ramp 3, in Stratum 5, with a different direction of ascent (from south to north), also belongs to LH III times, but it preceded the construction of the Lion Gate and led to the entrance of the first citadel (Fig. 85). Ramp 4, in Stratum 6, was the original ascent to the northwest slope and through it to the top of the hill used from MH to LH III A times. Ramp No i covered completely the area to the Grave Circle and thus blocked the passage to the houses and buildings to the west of that Circle. To make access possible the Little Ramp was then built, which thus is indicated to be contemporary with Ramp i, and should be placed towards the end of LH III B...|$|E
