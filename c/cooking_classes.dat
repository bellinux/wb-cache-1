25|$|As {{a result}} of much needed {{downtown}} investment, numerous properties have been renovated or {{are in the process}} of renovations, and new storefronts and lofts are being constructed. One of the spin-offs from the construction of Pullman Square was the renovation of the 900 block of 3rd Avenue, which was nearly all vacant. The renovation of numerous facades elsewhere, such as the removal of metal sheathing over brickwork, have been ongoing. During the construction of Pullman Square, the renovations along the 900 block of 3rd Avenue commenced, with most storefronts now being rented out. On the Friday after Thanksgiving in 2007, Le Cook Store opened across from Pullman Square; the Marshall Community and Technical College's Culinary Institute, which offers <b>cooking</b> <b>classes</b> and sample food tastings, also opened.

[...] She faced {{criticism}} {{from her parents}} over her decision to marry and start a large family so young. [...] She also felt snubbed by her peers, {{at a time when}} the feminist movement was blooming and educated women were establishing careers. [...] She later said, [...] "My parents were questioning my choices, my peers were. But [...] I was pretty resolute, pretty confident in what I was doing." [...] She taught early morning seminary to them and other children while her husband worked, first in business, then in politics. [...] She wanted to go on for a master's degree, perhaps in art history, but first taking care of her children, and later her health issues, forestalled that. [...] She was active in the local PTA and with the League of Women Voters. [...] With a friend, she held local <b>cooking</b> <b>classes</b> for a brief period.

500|$|A {{challenge}} for the filmmakers was creating computer-generated images of food that would appear delicious. Gourmet chefs in both the U.S. and France were consulted and animators attended <b>cooking</b> <b>classes</b> at San Francisco-area culinary schools to understand the workings of a commercial kitchen. Sets/Layout department manager Michael Warch, a culinary-academy trained professional chef before working at Pixar, helped teach and consult animators as they worked. He also prepared dishes used by the Art, Shade/Paint, Effects and Sets Modeling departments. Renowned chef Thomas Keller allowed producer Brad Lewis to intern in his French Laundry kitchen. For the film's climax, Keller designed a fancy, layered version of the title dish for the rat characters to cook, which he called [...] "confit byaldi" [...] {{in honor of the}} original Turkish name. The same sub-surface light scattering technique that was used on skin in The Incredibles was used on fruits and vegetables, while new programs gave an organic texture and movement to the food. Completing the illusion were music, dialogue, and abstract imagery representing the characters' mental sensations while appreciating food. The visual flavor metaphors were created by animator Michel Gagné inspired by the work of Oscar Fischinger and Norman McLaren.|$|E

40|$|Older {{adult men}} who have taken on an {{unfamiliar}} role as a caregiver find themselves at a loss with how to conduct meal preparation and cooking (Russell, 2007). The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the effects of a specialized <b>cooking</b> <b>class</b> on the perceptions of older adult male caregivers. Method: This mixed method, retrospective study analyzed surveys from subjects who attended a <b>cooking</b> <b>class</b> designed specifically for male caregivers. Participants were 60 years of age or older and were required to be living in one of nine participating local counties. Results: The participants reported that the course expanded their cooking skills, helped them feel more comfortable in the kitchen, and provided an enjoyable social outlet. Conclusion: Participation in a <b>cooking</b> <b>class</b> for older adult male caregivers may be an important step to meet the caregiving demands of this growing population. Additional research with a longer follow-up, is needed to determine if the results of this study are generalizable...|$|R
500|$|The Macdonald {{government}} took practical steps to promote tourism {{as a way}} of bringing money into the province. It improved conditions for tourists by granting small loans to hotel, motel and cottage owners to upgrade their facilities. It also offered <b>cooking</b> <b>classes</b> to restaurant and hotel employees. The government's extensive road building program made it easier for tourists to travel. But biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald went well beyond these practical steps to promote Nova Scotia as a beautiful and rustic place peopled by colourful Scots, Acadians, Germans and Mi'kmaq. Government advertising portrayed the province [...] "as a place where urban, middle-class families could go to 'step back in time'". Gradually, Henderson maintains, the tourism campaigns created a new identity for Nova Scotians. [...] "They witnessed the provincial state constructing an elaborate network of modern roads; they read books and brochures extolling the beauty of the province, and they heard their premier waxing romantically about the pure, simple nobility of their ancestors." [...] Macdonald was especially enthusiastic about [...] "the romanticized culture of the Highland Scots". Historian Ian McKay writes that under his leadership, the provincial government gave money to the Gaelic College; bestowed Scottish names on key tourism sites and stationed [...] "a brawny Scots piper" [...] at the border with New Brunswick. Macdonald also helped assemble {{more than a quarter of}} a million acres (4,000km2) for the Cape Breton Highlands National Park complete with a fancy resort hotel and world-class golf course. [...] "Macdonald believed", Henderson writes, [...] "he had created a piece of Scotland for tourists in the New World". And, as more tourists came, Macdonald's stature grew.|$|E

2500|$|Thus {{named because}} it is the area within the city limits that is {{on the west side of}} the Mississippi River, the West Side {{neighborhood}} is essentially south of downtown. Until the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, the West Side belonged to the Dakota people, and hence unavailable for settlement. After the 1851 treaty, it was available, but due to frequent flooding, prior to 1880, few people lived on the [...] "flats." [...] French-Canadians, Irish, and especially Germans lived on the banks and bluffs out of the flood zone; in 1874, the West Side was annexed by the city of Saint Paul. In 1882 a trainload of 200 Eastern European Jews arrived, having fled genocide in their homelands. Having no money, they initially set up tents on the lowlands on the West Side, Saint Paul. The tents gradually gave way to small houses and over the subsequent three decades, more refugees joined them, coming from Russia, Lithuania, Poland, Syria, and Lebanon. Synagogues and a Hebrew school were built. The neighborhood was bound by geography, with the river forming the west, north, and east boundaries and the bluffs demarking the southern one. Elevation divided the area economically and ethnically. After World War I, the flats began to be populated by Mexican-Americans who came to Minnesota to work in meat packing plants and the sugar beet fields, and settled there permanently. The Neighborhood House, a community support resource for social services was founded by the eastern European Jews, and became a haven for the Mexican immigrants in the 1920s and 1930s. The organization provided services such as English, sewing, and <b>cooking</b> <b>classes,</b> and employment referrals. As the Jewish residents built wealth and moved to higher ground, they rented their modest houses on the lowlands to the Mexican immigrants. The African-American architect, Clarence W. Wigington (18831967) designed several structures in the city, including the Harriet Island Pavilion. Little is left of the historical lowlands, as in the early 1960s, the entire neighborhood was bulldozed for urban renewal, destroying most of the historic structures on the lower West Side; but many of the homes of the wealthier residents on the high bluffs survive, including the Heimbach House and the Anthony Yoerg House.|$|E
