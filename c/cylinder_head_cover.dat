The second-generation CB900RR, which debuted in 1995, incorporated changes in damping rates and spring rates. The front fork was upgraded with a compression adjuster. The upper cowl stay went from steel to aluminum, and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> went from aluminum to magnesium. The styling {{of the bike}} also became more aggressive: The independent dual lights became irregular-shaped multi-reflector lights known as [...] "fox eyes" [...] and the bike had fewer of the RR's unique fairing holes.

50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{intake and exhaust}} ports and intake and exhaust manifolds are shape optimized for better volumetric efficiency. Mitsubishi lowered the friction of the engine by including elastic grinding of the valve stems, adopting a high-efficiency shroud equipped plastic impeller in the water pump and using 0W-20 low-viscosity oil. Mitsubishi increased the combustion efficiency by optimizing {{the design of the}} {{cylinder head}} intake and exhaust ports, by incorporating the MIVEC system on both intake and exhaust valves and by using injectors that give an ultra micro droplet fuel spray. To lower the engine's weight, Mitsubishi used die-cast aluminium for the cylinder block, plastic for the <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> <b>cover</b> and intake manifold, and stainless steel for the exhaust manifold. The engine features a compact balancer shaft module with an integrated oil pump. A silent chain is used to drive the camshafts. The compact balancer module, the silent chain, the stable combustion yielded by the intake and exhaust MIVEC system, and high rigidity designs for the cylinder head and cylinder block realize low vibration and noise.|$|E

The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the existing manufacturing operation at <b>Cylinder</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Cover</b> manufacturing process using Material and Information Flow Chart (MIFC), and identify the waste. From here, effective kaizen activities such as i) Work Standardization ii) U-shaped layout formation, and iii) Improved Material Handling System were recommended and implemented. Consequently, continuous flow process at the <b>Cylinder</b> <b>Head</b> <b>Cover</b> manufacturing line is achieved. Kanban system is the heart of Just In Time operation. To initiate kanban, the aforementioned activities must be in-placed.

With these implementation, the manufacturing performance were then measured according to the identified lean metric; such as i) productivity, ii) inventory level, iii) lead time, iv) manpower requirement and v) space utilization. These lean metrics were analyzed and compared against the manufacturing operation before the implementation was carried out. The research outcomes revealed that the company had gained significant improvement in term of performance and profit.

Those holes get constantly adjusted so as to guarantee the visibility of objects of interest from the parent view.
