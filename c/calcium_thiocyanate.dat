40|$|We {{investigate}} aerogel–aerogel composites {{to develop}} new materials for thermal insulation applications with reduced fragility and without release of dust. Two different kinds of highly insulating silica aerogels (SiO 2) were embedded into a cellulosic aerogel: a high-density (0. 25 g/cm 3) tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS) based and a low-density (0. 15 g/cm 3) waterglass based hydrophilic granular silica aerogel which {{are added to the}} salt hydrate melt of 59 wt. % <b>calcium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> and 2 or 3 wt. % of cellulose during the synthesis of a cellulosic aerogel. The silica aerogel species show a different behavior regarding the interaction with the cellulose network in the composite examined by scanning electron microscopy. With the synthesis method we were able to produce non-fragile aerogel–aerogel composites and a strong stiffening effect regarding Young’s modulus was achieved compared to pure aerogels. Density obtained is 0. 04 – 0. 15 g/cm 3 and thermal conductivity reached is between 0. 04 – 0. 05 W/mK...|$|E
40|$|Cellulose gels were {{synthesized}} {{in which}} the pore space was filled with resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) aerogel solution. Three weight percent microcrystalline cellulose was dissolved in an aqueous <b>calcium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> melt at 110 °C, which gelled on cooling building a nanofibrillar felt structure. The highly concentrated salt solution in the pore space is washed with ethanol until a test with Fe 3 + ions does yield a colorless solution. After washing with formaldehyde (24 %) the hydrogel was exposed to a resorcinol-formaldehyde solution while gelling. The RF solution had a molar ratio of resorcinol to water (R/W) of 0. 04 and of resorcinol to formaldehyde (R/F) of 0. 7. The molar ratio of resorcinol to catalyst sodium carbonate (R/C) used was 100, 500, 1000 or 1500. The composite gels prepared were dried supercritically and their nanostructure characterized by SEM. The aerogels were characterized by density, surface area, compression strength and thermal conductivity. Measurements of compression strength showed an anomalous behavior compared to those of pure cellulose aerogels...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} {{selected}} cellulose solvent systems {{based on the}} principal constituents tetrabutyl-ammonium fluoride (TBAF), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl- 1 H-imidazolium-acetate, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide, or <b>calcium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> octahydrate (CTO) on the properties of cellulose II aerogels prepared from these solvent systems has been investigated as a means towards tailoring cellulose aerogel properties with respect to specific applications. Cotton linters were used as representative plant cellulose. Cellulose was coagulated from solutions with comparable cellulose content, and dried with supercritical carbon dioxide after solvent exchange. The resulting bulk aerogels were comprehensively morphologically and mechanically tested to relate structure and mechanical properties. Different solvent systems caused considerable differences in {{the properties of the}} bulk samples, such as internal surface area (nitrogen sorption), morphology, porosity (He pycnometry, thermoporosimetry), and mechanical stability (compression testing). The results of SAXS, WAXS, and solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy suggest that this is due to different mechanisms of cellulose self-assembling on the supramolecular and nanostructural level, respectively, as reflected by the broad ranges of cellulose crys-tallinity, fibril diameter, fractal dimension and skeletal density. Both solid state NMR and WAXS experiments confirmed the sole existence of the cellulose II allomorph for all aerogels, with crystallinity reaching a maximum of 46 – 50 % for CTO-derived aerogels. Generally, higher fibril diameter, degree of crys-tallinity, hence increased skeletal density were associated with good preservation of shape and dimension throughout conversion of lyogels to aerogels, and enhanced mechanical stability, but somewhat reduced specific surface area. Amorphous, yet highly rigid aerogels derived from TBAF/DMSO mixtures deviated from this trend, most likely due to their particular homogeneous and nanostructured morphology...|$|E

30|$|With the {{addition}} of SA in mix S 2, {{there was a small}} reduction in the CH (normalised) value at 1  day, which reduced considerably at 7 and 28  days of curing, compared to S 1. Similar observations were seen in the reduction in the portlandite peaks of S 2 in the XRD spectra. This increase in the consumption of portlandite is attributed to the accelerating effect of SA on the pozzolanic reaction of the blended mix. The set accelerator used was calcium nitrate and sodium <b>thiocyanate</b> based. <b>Calcium</b> nitrate accelerates the setting time and moderately accelerates hardening whereas sodium thiocyanate accelerates the strength gain (Paillère 1994). As reported by Rettvin and Dalen and cited by Cabrera et al. (Cabrera and Rivera-Villarreal 1999) when calcium nitrate was used in combination with sodium <b>thiocyanate,</b> <b>calcium</b> nitrate started the hydration process earlier which was then hastened by sodium thiocyanate. The SEM image of S 2 shows an increase in the density and width of cracks in the cement matrix. The XRD spectra of S 2 shows a considerable increase in the intensity of ettringite peaks at 7 and 28  days compared to S 1. The growth of ettringite crystals in smaller diameter pores refined by silica fume (Zhang and Gjørv 1991), exerts the highest expansive pressure on the pore walls promoting the development of cracks in the cement matrix (Scherer 1999). Though, based on the increase in ettringite content in S 2 and the findings of (Scherer 1999), there is a possibility of ettringite being instrumental in the development of cracks, but no ettringite crystal was found within the cracks, when observed through the electron microscope. The addition of SA significantly increases the pore solution concentration of calcium ions (Ca+, CaOH+) which induces a high degree of super saturation of portlandite (Nonat 2000) that leads to the increase in disjoining pressure resulting in the development of micro cracks (Beltzung et al. 2001). Beltzung et al. (Beltzung et al. 2001) in their research on the influence of Ca(OH) 2 on shrinkage stresses observed that the samples containing high residual portlandite content (portlandite available in pore water after pozzolanic reaction and ettringite formation) showed higher shrinkage stresses resulting from high disjoining pressure, compared to the one having low residual portlandite. They also found that the specimens in which the portlandite produced in the system was progressively consumed during secondary pozzolanic and ettringite reactions, showed very low shrinkage stresses. They concluded that with the use of low alkali cements a significant reduction in the shrinkage stresses originating from the disjoining pressure can be achieved. Tazawa et al. (Tazawa and Miyazawa 1993) and Persson (Persson 1997) studied the relationship of self desiccation effect with the autogenous shrinkage. They reported that the self desiccation (reduction in internal relative humidity) at a particular age of curing increased with the decrease in w/c ratio, resulting in the increase in autogenous shrinkage. Tazawa et al. (Tazawa and Miyazawa 1993) also reported that the resultant increase in autogenous shrinkage leads to early age cracking. Therefore, the increase in the development of micro cracks in S 2 could be attributed to the combined effect of disjoining pressure and the self desiccation effect.|$|R
40|$|Nanocellulosic aerogels (NA) {{provide a}} {{lightweight}} biocompatible material with structural properties, like interconnected high porosity and specific surface area, suitable for biosensor design. We report here the preparation, characterization and activity of peptide-nanocellulose aerogels (PepNA) made from unprocessed cotton and designed with protease detection activity. Low-density cellulosic aerogels were prepared from greige cotton by employing <b>calcium</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> octahydrate/lithium chloride {{as a direct}} cellulose dissolving medium. Subsequent casting, coagulation, solvent exchange and supercritical carbon dioxide drying afforded homogeneous cellulose II aerogels of fibrous morphology. The cotton-based aerogel had a porosity of 99 % largely dominated by mesopores (2 – 50 nm) and an internal surface of 163 m 2 ·g− 1. A fluorescent tripeptide-substrate (succinyl-alanine-proline-alanine- 4 -amino- 7 -methyl-coumarin) was tethered to NA by (1) esterification of cellulose C 6 surface hydroxyl groups with glycidyl-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC), (2) deprotection and (3) coupling of the immobilized glycine with the tripeptide. Characterization of the NA and PepNA included techniques, such as elemental analysis, mass spectral analysis, attenuated total reflectance infrared imaging, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy and bioactivity studies. The degree of substitution of the peptide analog attached to the anhydroglucose units of PepNA was 0. 015. The findings from mass spectral analysis and attenuated total reflectance infrared imaging indicated that the peptide substrate was immobilized on {{to the surface of}} the NA. Nitrogen adsorption revealed a high specific surface area and a highly porous system, which supports the open porous structure observed from scanning electron microscopy images. Bioactivity studies of PepNA revealed a detection sensitivity of 0. 13 units/milliliter for human neutrophil elastase, a diagnostic biomarker for inflammatory diseases. The physical properties of the aerogel are suitable for interfacing with an intelligent protease sequestrant wound dressing...|$|E
