5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple <b>cell</b> <b>processes.</b> Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{ability to}} improve yield in the {{manufacturing}} process is an important competitiveness determinant for LCD factories. The TFT-LCD contains three major manufacturing sec-tors: the array, cell, and module assembly processes. The yield loss from the <b>cell</b> <b>process</b> {{is one of the}} most critical steps. To increase the <b>cell</b> <b>process</b> yield, more conforming LCD panels must be produced from one glass substrate. The sorter is a robot used in LCD manufacturing systems to achieve higher yield for matching TFT and CF plates. This sorter contains several ports that can transfer CF glasses from CF cassettes to match TFT glasses. In this paper, the Hungarian method is applied to solve the yield-mapping problem with the sorter. This method provides an optimal solution to improve the <b>cell</b> <b>process</b> yield...|$|R
25|$|Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) are cancer cells (found within tumors or {{hematological}} cancers) that possess characteristics associated with normal stem cells, specifically {{the ability to}} give rise to all cell types found in a particular cancer sample. CSCs are therefore tumorigenic (tumor-forming), perhaps in contrast to other non-tumorigenic cancer cells. CSCs may generate tumors through the stem <b>cell</b> <b>processes</b> of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types. Such cells are hypothesized to persist in tumors as a distinct population and cause relapse and metastasis by giving rise to new tumors. Therefore, development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds hope for improvement of survival {{and quality of life}} of cancer patients, especially for patients with metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes are glial {{cells that}} are {{abundant}} in {{the central nervous system}}. They are crucial for the metabolic and trophic support of neurons; additionally, astrocytes provide ion buffering and neurotransmitter clearance. Growing axons are guided by cues created by astrocytes; thus, astrocytes can regulate neurite pathfinding and subsequently, patterning in the developing brain. The glial scar that forms post-injury in the central nervous system is formed by astrocytes and fibroblasts; it is the most significant obstacle for regeneration. The glial scar consists of hypertrophied astrocytes, connective tissue, and ECM. Two goals of neural tissue engineering are to understand astrocyte function and to develop control over astrocytic growth. Studies by Shany et al. (2006) have demonstrated that astrocyte survival rates are increased on 3D aragonite matrices compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. The ability of <b>cell</b> <b>processes</b> to stretch out across curves and pores allows for the formation of multiple cell layers with complex 3D configurations.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} of isolating Schwann cells and subsequently inducing proliferation {{is a large}} obstacle. A solution is to selectively induce cells such as ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. EMSCs are neural crest cells that migrate from the cranical neural crest into the first branchial arch during early development of the peripheral nervous system. EMSCs are multipotent and possess a self-renewing capacity. They {{can be thought of}} as Schwann progenitor cells because they are associated with dorsal root ganglion and motor nerve development. EMSC differentiation appears to be regulated by intrinsic genetic programs and extracellular signals in the surrounding environment. Schwann cells are the source for both neurotropic and neurotrophic factors essential for regenerating nerves and a scaffold for guiding growth. Nie, Zhang et al. conducted a study investigating the benefits of culturing EMSCs within PLGA conduits. Adding foskolin and BPE to an EMSC culture caused the formation of elongated <b>cell</b> <b>processes,</b> which is common to Schwann cells in vitro. Thus, foskolin and BPF may induce differentiation into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. BPE contains the cytokines GDNF, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, which cause differentiation and proliferation of glial and Schwann cells by activating MAP kinases. When implanted into the PLGA conduits, the EMSCs maintained long-term survival and promoted peripheral nerve regeneration across a 10mm gap, which usually demonstrates little to no regeneration. Myelinated axons were present within the grafts and basal laminae were formed within the myelin. These observations suggest that EMSCs may promote myelination of regenerated nerve fibers within the conduit.|$|E

Identifying these interactions may provide clues to their effects on <b>cell</b> <b>processes.</b> [...] As these interactions can be affected by both the internal environment and external stimuli, studying these interactions in vivo and at endogenous levels, as is recommended in BiFC, provides a physiologically-relevant context from which to draw conclusions about protein interactions.|$|E
2500|$|In mammals, {{otoliths}} {{are small}} particles, {{composed of a}} combination of a gelatinous matrix and calcium carbonate in the viscous fluid of the saccule and utricle. The inertia of these small particles causes them to stimulate hair cells when the head moves. The hair cells are made up of 40 to 70 stereocilia and one kinocilium, which is connected to an afferent nerve. When the body changes position or begins a movement the weight of the membrane bends the stereocilia and stimulates the hair cells. Hair cells send signals down sensory nerve fibers, which are interpreted by the brain as motion. The brain interprets the orientation of the head by comparing the input from the utricules and saccules from both ears to the input from the eyes, allowing the brain to discriminate a tilted head from movement of the entire body. When the head is in a normal upright position, the otolith presses on the sensory hair cell receptors. [...] This pushes the hair <b>cell</b> <b>processes</b> down and prevents them from moving side to side. However, when the head is tilted, the pull of gravity on otoliths shift the hair <b>cell</b> <b>processes</b> to the side, distorting them and sending a message to the central nervous system that the head is no longer level but now tilted. (see: BPPV) This theory may have to be reevaluated because of an experiment in which a blindfolded owl in zero gravity was able to keep its head level while a handler was rocking its body back and forth.|$|E

The chlor-alkali industry The chlor-alkali industry is the industry that produces chlorine (Cl 2) and alkali, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH), by electrolysis of a salt solution.

40|$|The early chick cornea is {{composed}} of an acellular collagenous stroma lined with an anterior epithelium and a posterior endothelium. At stage 2 ?- 28 of development (51 / 2 days), this stroma swells so that the cornea is 75 120 #m thick.

Using Nomarski light microscopy, we have compared the behavior of moving cells in isolated corneas with the migratory activities of the same cells in artificial collagen lattices and on glass.
