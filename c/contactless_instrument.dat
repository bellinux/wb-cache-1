40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of a human-computer interface (HCI) for an expressive contactless musical instrument (using a ToF depth camera) that considers sensory feedback and sensorimotor adaptation {{in comparison with}} a conventional contact instrument. The design uses an intuitive ‘drum membrane’ paradigm for striking musical notes using simple pressing hand gestures on a notional keyboard in free air. In Experiment 1, 5 {{subjects were asked to}} complete a range of musical tasks using two forms of sensory feedback: Auditory-Only, where subjects could only hear the consequences of their pressing gestures, and Visual+Auditory, where subjects could both hear the sounds and receive visual feedback on a computer display. Results showed that Auditory+Visual feedback produced more precise performance (SD = 0. 894) in comparison to Auditory-Only feedback (SD = 3. 507), supporting the importance of a visual feedback element as an aid to natural gesture-based control in HCI. In Experiment 2, a comparison was made between sensorimotor adaptation in the <b>contactless</b> <b>instrument</b> (Visual-Only) and a conventional contact (Visual+Haptic) keyboard instrument. For each instrument, 7 subjects were asked to maintain tones at a perceived constant level (baseline) whilst a parameter (gain) was altered and then later restored. Once restored, the number of presses required to return to baseline was quantified as the after-effect of the adaptation. Results indicated that while design requirements for a <b>contactless</b> <b>instrument</b> may be very different from one that includes physical contact, similar neural mechanisms mediate a user's dynamic adaptation to both types of instrument...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA 2 D Hall microdevice for {{synchronous}} {{measurement of}} two in-plane magnetic-field components, using an original coupling concept {{based on two}} identical parallel-field three-contact (3 C) silicon Hall elements positioned at right angle and integrated on the same chip, is presented. The two pairs of outer contacts of 3 C Hall transducers are connected via two load resistors, converting simultaneously and independently the current changes in Bx and By magnetic fields into Hall voltages. Since the supply currents in both structures are equal, the magnetosensitivities are the same, too. At a fabrication of the devices on a common silicon chip, the output temperature drifts are perfectly matched. The high measurement accuracy, performance and compensated channel offsets of this 2 D magnetometer are achieved by the minimal interface components between both sensors. The suggested sensing microsystem is appropriate for many <b>contactless</b> measurement <b>instruments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{emergence}} of RFID tags capable of performing public key operations motivates new RFID applications, including electronic travel documents, identification cards and payment instruments. In this context, public key certificates form {{the cornerstone of}} the overall system security. In this paper, we argue that one of the prominent challenges is how to handle revocation and expiration checking of RFID reader certificates. This is an important issue considering that these high-end RFID tags are geared for applications such as e-documents and <b>contactless</b> payment <b>instruments.</b> Furthermore, the problem is unique to public keybased RFID systems, since a passive RFID tag has no clock and thus cannot use (time-based) off-line methods. In this paper, we address the problem of reader certificate expiration and revocation in PKI-Based RFID systems. We begin by observing an important distinguishing feature of personal RFID tags used in authentication, access control or payment applications – the involvement of a human user. We take advantage of the user’s awareness and presence to construct a simple, efficient, secure and (most importantly) feasible solution. We evaluate the usability and practical security of our solution via user studies and discuss its feasibility. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—One {{prominent}} open {{problem with}} RFID tags that support {{public key cryptography}} is revocation of reader certificates. This {{is an important issue}} considering that highend RFID tags are geared for public key applications such as e-documents and <b>contactless</b> payment <b>instruments.</b> Furthermore, the problem is unique to public key-based RFID systems, since tags have no clock and thus cannot use traditional (time-based) off-line revocation checking methods. Whereas, on-line methods require unrealistic connectivity assumptions. We address the problem of reader revocation in PKI-Based RFID systems. We begin by observing an important distinguishing feature of personal RFID tags used in authentication, access control or payment applications- the involvement of a human user. We then take advantage of the user’s awareness and presence to construct a simple, efficient, secure and (most importantly) feasible solution for reader revocation checking. And finally, we evaluate our solution via a user study and a discussion of its application feasibility. In our approach, the main extra feature is the requirement for a small passive on-tag display. However, modern low-power display technology is low-cost and appealing for other security purposes such as user-to-tag authentication and transaction verification. I...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} central {{perceptions}} of consumers influencing {{the decision to}} use <b>contactless</b> payment <b>instruments.</b> Aim is to define a customer core group narrowed down by several variables and to find a basis for a purposeful communication of advantages of the new payment process, as investment into this technology bears the risk of total loss if the customer group is declining acceptance and the image of a company might be excessively damaged. External variables in context with the usage of social online media and participation in customer loyalty programs have been selected to clarify possible impact. These factors offer comprehensive explanation and help interpreting mechanisms within the decision making process for acceptance of the payment technology. Data were collected in a survey with n = 1, 294 customers in a major city in Northern Germany. Results are displayed in a technology acceptance model, using structural equation modelling and regression analysis. The study is not limited on mobile payment instruments in the traditional context respectively involving a mobile phone. On the contrary this analysis is made on the belief that any device can be enabled for contactless payment processes, such as traditional items like credit or debit cards. Customers shopping online have a higher perceived usefulness an customers participating in loyalty programs tend to understand the argument of the ease of use of the technology more than their counterparts...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: : This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on polymerization shrinkage and bottom-to-top hardness ratios of composites. Materials and Methods : Six LEDs (Elipar FreeLight, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA; Versalux, Centrix, Shelton, CT, USA; Ultra-Lume LED 2, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA; Zap LED only, CMS-Dental/Soft-Core Texas, North Richland Hills, TX, USA; Zap dual light; and L. E. Demetron I, Kerr Manufacturing Inc., Orange, CA, USA) and a quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) light (Optilux 501, Kerr Manufacturing Inc.) were tested. Ten specimens each of a microhybrid (Point 4, Kerr Manufacturing, Inc.) and a hybrid (Filtek Z 250, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) composite, measuring 2 mm thick by 5 mm in diameter, were polymerized using each of the lights. Linear shrinkage was recorded using a <b>contactless</b> displacement <b>instrument.</b> Ten specimens were also polymerized with each light to determine the Knoop hardness number (KHN) {{at the top and}} bottom surfaces. Results : For the microhybrid, Zap dual light had the least volumetric shrinkage 2. 08 % (± 0. 33) and Elipar FreeLight had the highest 3. 02 % (± 0. 73). There was no significant difference (p <. 05) in shrinkage for the LEDs when compared with the Optilux 501. The hybrid showed the least amount of shrinkage with the L. E. Demetron I, 1. 42 % (± 0. 12), and the greatest with the Zap dual light, 2. 47 % (± 0. 31). The Ultra-Lume LED 2 (p <. 05) and Zap LED and dual light (p <. 001) had significantly greater shrinkage than did the Optilux 501. Zap LED had the lowest depth of cure with a bottom KHN of 11. 46 (± 2. 71) and 33. 62 (± 3. 57) for the microhybrid and hybrid, respectively. The L. E. Demetron I had the highest bottom hardness value for the microhybrid, with a value of 40. 65 (± 1. 50). The Optilux 501 had the highest bottom hardness value for the hybrid, with a value of 62. 03 (± 0. 82). The Zap LED and dual light and Versalux lights had significantly lower bottom-to-top hardness ratios than did the QTH (p <. 001) with the microhybrid. Conclusions : There was no statistically significant difference in shrinkage for the microhybrid with any of the lights tested. The hybrid, however, showed significantly less shrinkage with the halogen compared with the Ultra-Lume LED 2 and Zap LED and dual light. All LEDs had equal or lower bottom hardness values than did the QTH, except for L. E. Demetron I with the microhybrid...|$|R
