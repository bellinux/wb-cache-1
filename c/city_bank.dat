5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National <b>City</b> <b>Bank.</b> Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National <b>City</b> <b>Bank</b> with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether or}} not herd behavior exists between different types of Japanese banks. Using data of loans outstanding by bank type from 1980 to 2000, we investigate statistical causality between loans from different types of banks in Japan. The results manifest significant causality from <b>city</b> <b>banks</b> to regional banks, from long-term credit <b>banks</b> to <b>city</b> <b>banks,</b> and from trust <b>banks</b> to <b>city</b> <b>banks.</b> Consistent with historical events in Japan, these relationships have been particularly strong for loans to emerging industries and for loans in the 1980 s. We also conducted analysis to clarify possible causes of the detected herding. Among different stories behind herd behavior, the results are most consistent with the behavior based on reference from another type of bank. The results between long-term credit <b>banks</b> and <b>city</b> <b>banks</b> are also consistent with the "Cowbell"-like effect...|$|R

50|$|The third {{significant}} group in Chinese banking {{market is the}} <b>city</b> commercial <b>banks.</b> Many of them were founded {{on the basis of}} urban credit cooperatives. The first one was Shenzhen <b>City</b> Commercial <b>Bank</b> in 1995. In 1998, PBOC announced that all urban cooperative banks change their name to <b>city</b> commercial <b>bank.</b> And there are 69 <b>city</b> commercial <b>banks</b> set up from 1995 to 1998. In 2005 there were 112 <b>city</b> commercial <b>banks</b> in all of China. This number has increased through additional transformations to 140 in 2009.Most <b>city</b> commercial <b>banks</b> have strong ties to their local government and are majority or wholly state owned. Since 2005 some <b>city</b> commercial <b>banks</b> diversify their shareholders, inviting Chinese and international private companies to take minority shares, merging and cross-shareholding. Some of the banks have listed their shares. The <b>city</b> commercial <b>banks</b> market orientation is towards supporting the regional economy, but also towards financing local infrastructure and other government projects. Since 2008 a strong trend has emerged for <b>city</b> commercial <b>banks</b> to extend business beyond their home region. They are also often the main shareholder behind village and township banks (VTB). Some have founded so called small loans units to serve smaller business clients better. Taizhou <b>City</b> Commercial <b>Bank,</b> Bank of Beijing, Bank of Tianjin and Bank of Ningbo are examples for <b>city</b> commercial <b>banks.</b>|$|R

5|$|When {{the chaos}} {{began to shake}} the {{confidence}} of New York's banks, the city's most famous banker was out of town. J.P. Morgan, the eponymous president of J.P. Morgan & Co., was attending a church convention in Richmond, Virginia. Morgan {{was not only the}} city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan's brownstone at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York <b>City</b> <b>bank</b> and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.|$|E

Vanderlip also helped found and was the first president of Scarborough's Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Marian Cruger Coffin, a landscape architect, was born and grew up in Scarborough. The twentieth and last Third Assistant Secretary of State, J. Butler Wright, also lived in Scarborough, at Woodlea, later the golf house for Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Emily Taft Douglas, a U.S. Representative and wife of Senator Paul Douglas, lived in Briarcliff Manor from 1986 to her death in 1994. Composer and conductor Aaron Copland, famous for Rodeo and Fanfare for the Common Man, began spending weekdays at Mary Churchill's house in Briarcliff Manor in early 1929, and had a post office box in Briarcliff Manor. He spent almost a month living there before moving to nearby Bedford; his ultimate residence is in nearby Cortlandt Manor. Brooke Astor, a philanthropist, socialite, and member of the Astor family, lived in Briarcliff Manor for much of her life. Children's author C. B. Colby was on the village board, was the village's Fire Commissioner, and researched for the village historical society's 1977 history book. He lived on Pine Road until his death in 1977. Anna Roosevelt Halsted lived with Curtis Bean Dall on Sleepy Hollow Road; their children, Eleanor and Curtis, attended the Scarborough School. Blanchette Ferry Rockefeller, twice-president of the Museum of Modern Art, lived in the village until her death. Eugene T. Booth, a nuclear physicist and Manhattan Project developer, lived in the village. John Cheever lived in Scarborough, and spent most of his writing career in Westchester towns such as Briarcliff Manor and Ossining. He served in the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department. Coby Whitmore, a painter and magazine illustrator, lived in the village from 1945 to 1965. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and journalist John Hersey attended public school and lived in Briarcliff Manor; he was the village's first Eagle Scout and a lifeguard at the village pool, and his mother Grace Baird Hersey was a village librarian.

Using an unbalanced panel dataset for 63 banks over 1997 - 2006 and employing the stochastic frontier function approach, the empirical results reveal that the new entrants, small <b>city</b> <b>banks,</b> experienced a slightly higher efficiency score than incumbent large banks, on average. Compared with the pre-WTO accession period, the efficiency score is found to have improved significantly after entry into the WTO {{as a result of the}} competition effect. This competition effect is particularly relevant for small <b>city</b> <b>banks.</b> Finally, determinants of X-inefficiency are examined.

5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because of the direction the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually swallowed the entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of those who thought they would be safe {{within the confines of the}} reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the <b>city</b> <b>bank</b> was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in a twisted heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E

The empirical results show that the presence of <b>city</b> <b>banks</b> {{does not seem to have}} lessened the effects of local financial shocks on local economies. On the contrary, we find evidence that nation-wide <b>city</b> <b>banks</b> aggressively transmitted financial shocks that originated from major cities to local peripheral economies. These results suggest a dark side of large nation-wide banks: they can be a source of financial and economic volatility when they elect to take concentrated risk and spread out the impacts of large financial shocks to peripheral economies. ...|$|R

Consistent herding during the entire sample period is observed among regional <b>banks,</b> whereas <b>city</b> <b>banks</b> {{had been following}} a cyclical herd behavior with one peak around the bubble period in the late 1980 s.

The company's name was changed to The National <b>City</b> <b>Bank</b> of New York in 1865 after it joined the new U.S. national banking system, and it became the largest American bank by 1895. It became the first contributor to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1913, and the following year it inaugurated the first overseas branch of a U.S. bank in Buenos Aires, although the bank had, since the mid-19th century, been active in plantation economies, such as the Cuban sugar industry. The 1918 purchase of U.S. overseas bank International Banking Corporation helped it become the first American bank to surpass $1 billion in assets, and it became the largest commercial bank {{in the world in}} 1929. As it grew, the bank became a leading innovator in financial services, becoming the first major U.S. bank to offer compound interest on savings (1921); unsecured personal loans (1928); customer checking accounts (1936) and the negotiable certificate of deposit (1961).|$|E
