50|$|<b>Cheviot</b> <b>wool</b> {{possesses}} good spinning qualities, {{since the}} fibre is fine, soft, and pliable.|$|E
50|$|The Cheviot is a {{distinctive}} white-faced sheep, with a wool-free face and legs, pricked ears, black muzzle and black feet. It {{is a very}} alert and active sheep. <b>Cheviot</b> <b>wool</b> has {{a distinctive}} helical crimp, which gives it that highly desirable resilience. The fleece should be dense and firm with no kemp or coloured hair. The rams can have horns.|$|E
50|$|After railway {{nationalisation}} in 1948, {{it became}} inevitable {{that the need}} for two lines between Edinburgh and Carlisle would be questioned. The Caledonian's main line provided a faster connection and could be operated as a branch off the West Coast line. With passenger receipts inconsequential, the line relied on its good traffic - coal was brought {{in and out of the}} Tweed town mills and <b>Cheviot</b> <b>wool</b> brought from local farms. Once new road transport techniques allowed farmers to move their sheep to market in one move and merchants to shift coal from pit to boilerhouse without using the railway, the writing was on the wall for the line.|$|E
500|$|Stanley, as Port Jackson {{was soon}} renamed, officially became {{the seat of}} {{government}} in 1845. Early in its history, Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo-shipping losses; only in emergencies would ships rounding Cape Horn stop at the port. Nevertheless, the Falklands' geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the [...] "Wrecking Trade", the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes. Aside from this trade, commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low-value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures. Economic growth began only after the Falkland Islands Company, which bought out Lafone's failing enterprise in 1851, successfully introduced <b>Cheviot</b> sheep for <b>wool</b> farming, spurring other farms to follow suit. The high cost of importing materials, combined with the shortage of labour and consequent high wages, meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive. After 1870, it declined as the replacement of sail ships by steamships was accelerated by the low cost of coal in South America; by 1914, {{with the opening of}} the Panama Canal, the trade effectively ended. In 1881, the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain. For more than a century, the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago; in addition, it owned most housing in Stanley, which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK.|$|R
