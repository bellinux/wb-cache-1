40|$|As devices {{move from}} {{full-scale}} prototype to commercial installations, {{it is important}} that developers have detailed knowledge of the tidal energy resource. Therefore, the spatial distribution of the tidal currents over the northwest European shelf seas has been examined to improve understanding of the tidal-stream energy resource. Using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ROMS) at â�¼ 1 km spatial resolution, and applying device characteristics of the Seagen-S turbine, we show that the ratio of the amplitudes of the M 2 and S 2 tidal currents can lead to significant variability in annual practical power generation â�� variability that is not accounted for when considering only the mean peak spring tidal velocities, as is generally the case in resource feasibility studies. In addition, we show that diurnal inequalities (governed by K 1 and O 1 tidal constituents) and tidal asymmetries (governed by the relationship between M 2 and its <b>compound</b> <b>tide</b> M 4) over the northwest European shelf seas can further affect power generation at potential high-energy sites. Based on these variabilities, the spatial distribution of the tidal-stream â��capacity factorâ�� has been calculated. We find that mean peak spring tidal velocities can under-estimate the resource by up to 25 %, and that annual practical power generation can vary by â�¼ 15 % for regions experiencing similar mean peak spring tidal velocities, due to the influence of other tidal constituents. Therefore, even preliminary resource assessments should be based on annual average power density, rather than peak spring tidal velocity...|$|E

40|$|The Singapore Strait {{connects the}} South China Sea, where tides are dominantly diurnal, to the dominantly semidiurnal Indian Ocean. At this transition, the tidal water level {{oscillations}} are observed to be semidiurnal while the tidal current oscillations are mixed, diurnal to fully diurnal. Due to {{the interaction of}} the diurnal constituents with the semidiurnal M 2 tide, the tides are strongly asymmetric. Both residual flows and subtidal flows, with periodicities of 2 weeks to 1 year, are strong. In order to analyze and explain the hydrodynamics around Singapore, a well-documented and calibrated regional tidal model application was further improved and validated. Analysis of the results of this model shows that the diurnal tidal wave is primarily standing, with an amphidromic point close to Singapore, explaining the dominantly diurnal current and semidiurnal water level oscillations. Analysis of the model results further indicates that the fortnightly constituents in the subtidal flow are probably <b>compound</b> <b>tides,</b> with a combined amplitude over 10 cm/s. Pronounced yearly and half-yearly cycles in spring tidal current amplitude and asymmetry exist, resulting from interaction of the diurnal and the semidiurnal spring-neap cycles, <b>compound</b> <b>tides,</b> and the monsoon currents. A simple analytical transport formula was applied to determine the relative importance of tidal asymmetry and residual flows, verified with a full sediment transport model. With fine sediment being more sensitive for residual flow and coarser sediment for tidal flow, a pronounced divergence in sediment transport pathways may exist, depending on the grain size.

Two partial tides with angular frequencies σ 1 = 1, 4 x 10 - 4 and σ 2 = 1, 6 x 10 - 4 rad/sec and amplitude A 1 = 1 x 10 - 8 and A 2 = 0, 5 x 10 - 8 meters are used for defining external forcing in the model domain.

Harmonic analysis was applied to evidence tidal constituents and to predict tidal variations in the open ocean and in the fringing reef. The predicted signals were compared to assess the intratidal and supratidal variability {{as well as the}} synoptic response of the RSL in the reef. Finally, the non-tidal fluctuations of the signal recorded in the fringing reef were correlated with the external forcing data (wind and wave). The results show that the tide in the reef is reduced and delayed, compared to the tide of the open ocean. The neap-spring tidal cycle in the fringing reef appears more synchronized on the tropical cycle (27. 32 days) of the Moon, rather than its synodic cycle (29. 52 days). Due to the shallowness of the fringing reef, nonlinear bottom-friction interactions induce an amplification of <b>compound</b> <b>tides,</b> the fortnightly (Msf) and monthly (Mm) long-period tides (LPT), which have a major influence on the relative sea surface elevations variations. They cause relative high and low RSL reaching ± 10 cm in the fringing reef, which are significantly different from the sea level in the open ocean. It appears that the contribution of the external forcing to the RSL fluctuations in the fringing reef will largely depend on these high and low sea levels.

40|$|A {{discussion}} is presented about the mechanisms {{that govern the}} spatial and seasonal variability in sand-wave height and migration speed in the 4 km wide Marsdiep tidal inlet, the Netherlands. Since 1998, current velocities and water depths have been recorded with an ADCP that is mounted under the ferry ‘Schulpengat’. In this paper, the current measurements were used to explain the sand-wave observations presented in Buijsman and Ridderinkhof [this issue. Long-term evolution of sand waves in the Marsdiep inlet. I: high-resolution observations. Continental Shelf Research, doi: 10. 1016 / j. csr. 2007. 10. 011]. Across nearly the entire inlet, the sand waves migrate in the flood direction. In the flood-dominated {{southern part of the}} inlet, the ‘measured’ (i. e. based on sand-wave shape and migration speed) and predicted bedload transport agree in direction, magnitude, and trends, whereas in the ebb-dominated northern part the predicted bedload and suspended load transport is opposite to the sand-wave migration. In the southern part, 55 % of the bedload transport is due to tidal asymmetries and 45 % due to residual currents. In addition to the well-known tidal asymmetries, asymmetries that arise from the interaction of M 2 and its overtides with S 2 and its <b>compound</b> <b>tides</b> are also important. It is hypothesised that {{in the northern part of}} the inlet the advection of suspended sand and lag effects govern the sand-wave migration. The relative importance of suspended load transport also explains why the sand waves have smaller lee-slope angles, are smaller, more rounded, and more three-dimensional in the northern half of the inlet. The sand waves in this part of the inlet feature the largest seasonal variability in height and migration speed. This seasonal variability may be attributed to the tides or a seasonal fluctuation in fall velocity. In both cases sediment transport is enhanced in winter, increasing sand-wave migration and decreasing sand-wave height. The influence of storms and estuarine circulation on the sand-wave variability is negligible...|$|R

30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of electromagnetic fields induced in the Earth’s oceans by {{the motion of}} the conductive seawater {{in the presence of the}} main magnetic field has been known for decades (Sanford 1971). In particular, the electromagnetic signatures of the ocean flows driven by the gravitational forcing of the Sun and the Moon have recently attracted an increased interest in the geomagnetic field community. Although the existence of <b>compound</b> <b>tides</b> generated by nonlinear ocean dynamics is also well established (Einšpigel and Martinec 2017), the fundamental part of tidal flows consists of the constituents present at discrete frequencies related to the movements of the celestial bodies. This attribute allows us to distinguish the tidally induced magnetic field from the magnetic field originated in the Earth’s liquid core, in the lithosphere, or the external contributions from the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and their induced counterparts. Indeed, the magnetic signatures of the principal lunar semi-diurnal constituent M_ 2, the larger lunar elliptic semi-diurnal constituent N_ 2, and partially also the lunar diurnal constituent O_ 1 have been detected in ground geomagnetic observatory data (Maus and Kuvshinov 2004) and seafloor measurements in the Northwestern Pacific (Schnepf et al. 2014). Similarly, the low-orbit satellite missions, such as CHAMP (Sabaka et al. 2015; Tyler et al. 2003) and Swarm (Sabaka et al. 2016), have successfully recovered the M_ 2 and partially also the N_ 2 tidally induced magnetic signals. Other tidal signal, such as S_ 2, K_ 1, and P_ 1 can be obscured by external fields (Guzavina et al. 2018; Maus and Kuvshinov 2004). Consequently, the tidal signals extracted from satellite data were used to constrain the electrical conductivity across the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (Grayver et al. 2016, 2017). Recently, Schnepf et al. (2018) have compared the numerical predictions of magnetic fields generated by oceanic and ionospheric tides. The idea to assimilate the magnetic field measurements directly into the global ocean flow modelling has been implemented by Irrgang et al. (2017); however, tides were not considered there. Another application of the forward modelling of tidal signals is the construction of base functions optimized for tidal signal recovery from satellite and observatory data (Telschow et al. 2018).|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{of global}} oceanic tides has {{markedly}} advanced {{over the last}} two decades, in no small part because of the near-global measurements provided by satellite altimeters, and especially the long and precise Topex/Poseidon time series e. g. [2]. Satellite altimetry in turn places very severe demands on the accuracy of tidal models. The reason is clear: tides are by far the largest contributor to the variance of sea-surface elevation, so any study of non-tidal ocean signals requires removal of this dominant tidal component. Efforts toward improving models for altimetric tide corrections have understandably focused on deep-water, open-ocean regions. These efforts have produced models thought to be generally accurate to about 2 cm rms. Corresponding tide predictions in shelf and near-coastal regions, however, are far less accurate. This paper discusses the status of our current abilities to provide near-global tidal predictions in shelf and near-coastal waters, highlights some of the difficulties that must be overcome, and attempts to divine a path toward some degree of progress. There are, of course, many groups worldwide who model tides over fairly localized shallow-water regions, and such work is extremely valuable for any altimeter study limited to those regions, but this paper considers the more global models necessary for the general user. There have indeed been efforts to patch local and global models together, but such work is difficult to maintain over many updates and can often encounter problems of proprietary or political nature. Such a path, however, might yet prove the most fruitful, and there are now new plans afoot to try again. As is well known, tides in shallow waters tend to be large, possibly nonlinear, and high wavenumber. The short spatial scales mean that current mapping capabilities with (multiple) nadir-oriented altimeters often yield inadequate coverage. This necessitates added reliance on numerical hydrodynamic models and data assimilation, which in turn necessitates very accurate bathymetry with high spatial resolution. Nonlinearity means that many additional <b>compound</b> <b>tides</b> and overtides must be accounted for in our predictions, which increases the degree of modeling effort and increases the amounts of data required to disentangle closely aliased tides...|$|R
40|$|Elkhorn Slough {{was first}} exposed to direct tidal forcing from {{the waters of}} Monterey Bay with the {{construction}} of Moss Landing Harbor in 1946. Elkhorn Slough is located mid-way between Santa Cruz and Monterey close to the head of Monterey Submarine Canyon. It follows a 10 km circuitous path inland from its entrance at Moss Landing Harbor. Today, Elkhorn Slough is a habitat and sanctuary {{for a wide variety of}} marine mammals, fish, and seabirds. The Slough also serves as a sink and pathway for various nutrients and pollutants. These attributes are directly or indirectly affected by its circulation and physical properties. Currents, tides and physical properties of Elkhorn Slough have been observed on an irregular basis since 1970. Based on these observations, the physical characteristics of Elkhorn Slough are examined and summarized. Elkhorn Slough is an ebb-dominated estuary and, as a result, the rise and fall of the tides is asymmetric. The fact that lower low water always follows higher high water and the tidal asymmetry produces ebb currents that are stronger than flooding currents. The presence of extensive mud flats and Salicornia marsh contribute to tidal distortion. Tidal distortion also produces several shallow water constituents including the M 3, M 4, and M 6 overtides and the 2 MK 3 and MK 3 <b>compound</b> <b>tides.</b> Tidal elevations and currents are approximately in quadrature; thus, the tides in Elkhorn Slough have some of the characters of a standing wave system. The temperature and salinity of lower Elkhorn Slough waters reflect, to a large extent, the influence of Monterey Bay waters, whereas the temperature and salinity of the waters of the upper Slough (> 5 km from the mouth) are more sensitive to local processes. During the summer, temperature and salinity are higher in the upper slough due to local heating and evaporation. Maximum tidal currents in Elkhorn Slough have increased from approximately 75 to 120 cm/s over the past 30 years. This increase in current speed is primarily due to the change in tidal prism which has increased from approximately 2. 5 to 6. 2 x 106 m 3 between 1956 and 1993. The increase in tidal prism is the result of both 3 rapid man-made changes to the Slough, and the continuing process of tidal erosion. Because of the increase in the tidal prism, the currents in Elkhorn Slough exhibit positive feedback, a process with uncertain consequences. [PDF contains 55 pages...|$|R
40|$|As the SWOT wide-swath {{satellite}} altimeter mission {{transitions from}} the Science Definition Team to the Science Team, {{it is an}} opportune time to review the progress {{that has been made}} with respect to tides, and the work remaining to be done. As with previous altimeter missions, tides present both an opportunity and a challenge for the SWOT mission. The TOPEX/Jason class of altimeters have allowed high-accuracy mapping of open-ocean barotropic tides over their coverage latitudes (66 °S to 66 °N), but the inter-track spacing of these missions (~ 150 km) has limited their ability to map smaller-scale features such as shelf tides, coastal tides, and open-ocean internal tides. Because SWOT will measure sea surface height at unprecedented horizontal resolution, SWOT offers the chance to map shelf tides, coastal tides and open-ocean internal tides in unprecedented detail. In addition, the inclination of SWOT offers the chance to improve tide estimates poleward of 66 °, up to the SWOT orbit inclination of 78 °. At the same time, shelf tides, coastal tides, open-ocean internal tides, and high-latitude tides must be accurately removed from SWOT data before SWOT can be used to examine non-tidal signals such as mesoscale and submesoscale eddies, the main target of the SWOT oceanography mission. Shelf tides, coastal tides, and open-ocean internal tides will be difficult to remove not only because of their small horizontal scales but also because of their inherently more challenging predictability compared with open-ocean barotropic tides. For shelf and coastal tides one aspect of this is the greater number of constituents that must be considered because of possible <b>compound</b> <b>tides</b> and overtides generated by nonlinear interactions in shallow regions. An especially great challenge will be in estuaries, where the hydrology and oceanography mission interests intersect, and where the tides can be quite nonlinear and nearly unpredictable, with nonlinearity sometimes manifested by impressive tidal bores (Dronkers, 1964; LeBlond, 1978; Godin, 1999; Jay et al., 2011; among other works on river tides and their changes). Below, after reviewing the successes with open-ocean barotropic tides enabled by previous altimeter missions, we briefly review the progress-to-date, and work remaining, on shelf tides, coastal tides, open-ocean internal tides, and high-latitude tides as they pertain to the SWOT mission. In addition, we also discuss plans for tidal correction algorithms, the need for better bathymetry, especially in coastal regions, and the need for a coordinated effort to evaluate tidal models. Finally, the document concludes with some recommendations for SWOT-related tide model development efforts...|$|R
40|$|Estuarine morphodynamics are {{of broad}} {{importance}} to estuaries’ functions related to navigation, human settlement and ecosystems. Inspired by the Yangtze River estuary (YRE), {{this study aims}} to explore the impact of river discharge, tides and their interaction on long-term estuarine morphodynamics. Use is made of 1 D and 2 D process-based models. In first instance we focus on purely hydrodynamic characteristics in a 560 km long basin. We analyze the non-stationary river tides in the YRE by harmonic analysis and continuous wavelet transformation which reveals {{a wide range of}} subtidal variations and non-linear modulation by varying river discharges. An intermediate river discharge could be defined at which the amplitudes of the internally generated overtides and <b>compound</b> <b>tides</b> reach maxima. Based on these hydrodynamic insights we conduct long-term (millennia time scale) morphodynamic simulations in schematized long basins. Vanishing spatial gradients in tidal residual sediment transport indicate an approach towards morphodynamic equilibrium. Morphodynamic equilibrium is also reached in case of a seasonally varying river discharge, which is reflected by a balance between erosion and accretion during low and high river discharge periods, respectively. River flow supplies sediment, accelerates ebb currents, and alters tidal asymmetries. Each of these processes has its own effects on tidal residual transport and morphodynamics. For example, the interaction between a mean flow (i. e., Stokes return flow or river flow) and tidal currents induces significant tidal residual sediment transport which explains net ebb transport dominance {{in the presence of a}} flood tidal asymmetry. A larger river discharge does not necessarily lead to deeper equilibrium bed profiles. An intermediate river discharge is found which induces largest residual sediment transport gradients along the estuary leading to deepest equilibrium bed profile. Quantification of this medium river discharge is case dependent because of the non-linearities involved. The 2 D model approach applied in a large scale fluvio-deltaic system reveal river, estuarine and deltaic types of morphodynamic features, such as alternating sand bars, meandering channels inside the estuary and more elongated sand bars and distributary channels in the mouth zone and delta. The cross-sectionally averaged depth of the 2 D model responds in a similar way to increased river discharge as a 1 D model. Furthermore, a high river discharge induces ebb transport dominance, restricts development of flood channels and prolongs meander wavelength. In summary, this research unveils the fundamental effects of tidal asymmetries, river discharge, and river-tide interaction in governing residual sediment transport and associated long-term estuarine morphodynamics under combined river and tidal forcing.
