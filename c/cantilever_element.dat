40|$|In {{the present}} paper the use of tapered-screw bone {{expanders}} (TSBEs) is proposed, {{in combination with the}} placement of tilted implants in close proximity to the anterior sinus wall, solving the problem of the reduced height of the alveolar bone in the sub-antral area. The Authors named the procedure: Tilted Implant Expansion Osteotomy (TIEO). Fifteen patients (10 females and 5 males, mean age 47. 8 ± 8. 15 years) with distal edentulous maxillae were enrolled in this study. For each edentulous site 2 implants were placed, the anterior implant {{in the area of the}} most anterior missing tooth while, the posterior implant, immediately in front of the maxillary sinus, with an inclined position. Adopting the aforesaid procedure, 34 cylindrical two-piece implants were placed, 17 of which were placed in tilted position, in order to by-pass the maxillary sinus. After a healing period of 4 - 6 months, the second stage surgery was performed. The cases were finalized by metal-ceramic cementable restorations with a variable number of elements, from 2 to 4, without any <b>cantilever</b> <b>element.</b> The post finalization follow-up was at 12 months. Survival rate was 100 % since no fixtures were lost. At the one-year follow-up the clinical and radiological appearance of the soft and hard tissues was optimal and no pathological signs were recorded.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the stress on the cortical bone around single body dental implants supporting mandibular complete fixed denture with rigid (Neopronto System-Neodent) or semirigid splinting system (Barra Distal System-Neodent). Methods and Materials: Stress levels on several system components were analyzed through finite element analysis. Focusing on stress concentration at cortical bone around single body dental implants supporting mandibular complete fixed dentures with rigid (Neopronto System-Neodent) or semirigid splinting system (Barra Distal System-Neodent), after axial and oblique occlusal loading simulation, applied in the last <b>cantilever</b> <b>element.</b> Results: The results showed that semirigid implant splinting generated lower von Mises stress in the cortical bone under axial loading. Rigid implant splinting generated higher von Mises stress in the cortical bone under oblique loading. Conclusion: It was concluded that the use of a semirigid system for rehabilitation of edentulous mandibles by means of immediate implant-supported fixed complete denture is recommended, because it reduces stress concentration in the cortical bone. As a consequence, bone level is better preserved, and implant survival is improved. Nevertheless, for both situations the cortical bone integrity was protected, because the maximum stress level findings were lower than those pointed in the literature as being harmful. The maximum stress limit for cortical bone (167 MPa) represents the threshold between plastic and elastic state for a given material. Because any force is applied to an object, and there is no deformation, we can conclude that the elastic threshold was not surpassed, keeping its structural integrity. If the force is higher than the plastic threshold, the object will suffer permanent deformation. In cortical bone, this represents the beginning of bone resorption and/or remodeling processes, which, according to our simulated loading, would not occur. (Implant Dent 2010; 19 : 39 - 49...|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} the seismic {{response}} of precast balcony <b>cantilever</b> structural <b>elements</b> for prevention of thermal bridges was analysed. This solution {{has been developed}} in seismic non-prone areas with {{the main purpose of}} eliminating a thermal bridge {{at the point where the}} balcony is fixed to the building. The solution has been specially made to withstand vertical static loading, not accounting for eventual vertical seismic loads in the case of transferring the solution to more active seismic zones. This paper deals with the seismic analysis of existent precast <b>cantilever</b> <b>elements</b> exposed to vertical accelerations and has proven that some elements in the case of lifting are not sufficient from the safety point of view. The results of the main research results obtained by numerous seismic analyses can be summarized as follows: 1) the insertion of a precast load-bearing thermal insulation element increases the flexibility of RC fixed base cantilevers and therefore limits their length to 300 – 400 cm, 2) vertical seismic loads can result in the cantilever uplift, which means that tensile stresses could appear also at the bottom of the cross-section 3) precast elements, that appear on the Slovenian market to this day, do not have the appropriate steel reinforcement in the bottom part of the cross-section. For this reason, the possibility of damage is considerably higher for precast <b>cantilever</b> structural <b>elements</b> than for RC fixed base cantilevers. Statistically calculated probability of cantilever uplift for Ljubljana, which would result in severe damage, is relatively low (3 % in the 50 -year life span). However, the calculated value is greater than the maximum acceptable level of seismic risk for collapse. One of the possible solutions to prevent the negative influences of cantilever uplift is to consider the proper reinforcement also at the bottom of the precast elements' crosssection, or by other measures preventing uplift...|$|R

The requirement of room temperature reversibility requires the use of weak chemical interactions, for example hydrogen bonding, between the target molecules and the chemoselective interfaces. If the response from each cantilever is unique for a given chemical, it is possible to analyze the response using pattern recognition algorithms. The responses can include rise and decay times, as well as amplitudes. However, molecular recognition based on chemical interfaces relying on weak interactions is not specific enough to produce unique response pattern even in an array format. Increasing the number of sensor elements in the array for pattern recognition analysis does not improve the selectivity [13].|$|R
40|$|Background and aims. All-on-four {{technique}} {{involves the}} use of tilted implants to allow for shorter <b>cantilevers.</b> This finite <b>element</b> analysis aimed at investigating the amount and distribution of stress in maxillary bone surrounding the implants with all-on-four vs. frequently used method with six implants technique using different numbers and inclination angles. Materials and methods. A 3 D edentulous maxillary model was created and implants were virtually placed anterior to the maxillary sinus and splinted with a superstructure. In total, five models were designed. In the first to the fourth models, four implants were placed with distal implants inclined 0, 15, 30, and 45 degrees, respectively. In the fifth model, six vertical implants were placed. 100 N loading was placed in the left most distal region of the superstructure. Maximum von Mises stress values were evaluated in cancellous and cortical bone. Results. The maximum stress values recorded in cancellous and cortical bone were 7. 15 MPa and 51. 69 MPa, respectively (model I). The reduction in stress values in models II to V 6...|$|R
