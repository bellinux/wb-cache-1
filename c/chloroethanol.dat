40|$|Background. Vinyl {{chloride}} (VC) is {{an environmental}} pollutant {{found in many}} industrial sites and it ranks 4 th on the 2013 Hazardous Substances Priority List published by Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry’s (ATSDR). We have previously reported increased hepatocellular necrosis with high occupational VC exposure in human and in in vitro models; however, the effect of subtoxic VC exposure on liver with underlying conditions is unknown. The {{purpose of the current}} study is to investigate the hepatic injury caused by <b>chloroethanol</b> (CE; VC metabolite) and inflammatory response in two experimental models of high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity. Methods. Mice were administered a bolus dose of CE or vehicle after 10 weeks of high saturated fatty acid diet (HSFA; 42 % milk fat), high polyunsaturated fatty acid diet (HPUFA; 42 % corn oil) or low fat control diet (LFD; 13 % milk fat LSFA or 13 % corn oil LPUFA). Samples were harvested 24 hours after CE exposure for determination of liver damage, inflammation and inflammasome activation. Results. In LFD-fed control mice, CE did not cause any significant changes to the liver. <b>Chloroethanol</b> induced significant liver damage and inflammation in HSFA fed mice, as well as HPUFA fed mice but to a lesser degree. Moreover, steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, infiltrating 3 inflammatory cells and hepatic expression of proinflammatory cytokines that were observed with CE after HSFA-feeding was blunted by HPUFA-feeding. Conclusions. <b>Chloroethanol</b> (as a surrogate VC exposure) exacerbated liver injury in a ‘ 2 -hit’ paradigm through inflammasome activation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This serves as proof-of-concept that VC hepatotoxicity may be modified by diet-induced obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

40|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} (VC) is a prevalent environmental toxicant {{that has}} been shown to cause liver injury at high, occupational exposures. However, most studies have not addressed interactions of low doses with risk-modifying factors. This study aims to explore low-level VC metabolite exposure interactions with other potential risk-modifying factors and their effect on underlying liver disease. We examined sub-hepatotoxic effects of a VC metabolite (<b>chloroethanol,</b> CE) in two murine models of liver injury using ethanol and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In both, CE significantly enhanced liver injury when compared to either ethanol or LPS alone. Previous studies have shown an increase in mTOR activity with CE alone. Here, we used a pharmacologic inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin, to study its effect on injury progression. Indeed, the addition of rapamycin significantly attenuated liver injury, hepatic steatosis, and inflammatory markers in the CE + LPS model...|$|E

Chloroethanol-grown cells of strain G J 10 also contained an inducible NAD-dependent chloroacetaldehyde dehydrogenase.

Programa de Pós-Graduação em QuímicaA proposta deste trabalho foi a síntese, caracterização e estudo da atividade catalítica de nanopartículas (NPs) de prata e bimetálicas prata-paládio utilizando-se a polietilenoimina linear (LPEI) funcionalizada como estabilizante. A LPEI foi funcionalizada por meio de síntese do tipo "paralela" com grupos etanólicos e octílicos. Para a seleção dos melhores estabilizantes das Ag-NPs utilizou-se uma abordagem de processamento rápido e foram selecionados dois estabilizantes: F 1 (LPEI funcionalizada com 0, 4 eq. cloroetanol) e F 12 (LPEI funcionalizada com 0, 4 eq. cloroetanol e 0, 5 eq. bromoctano). Para a otimização das condições de síntese das Ag-NPs utilizou-se planejamento fatorial. Então, as NPs bimetálicas foram sintetizadas utilizando-se a banda SPR das Ag-NPs como um probe in situ. As F 1 -AgPd-NPs se mostraram completamente esféricas e ocas, enquanto as NPs preparadas a partir das F 12 -Ag-NPs se apresentam como esferas porosas. Por fim, foram determinadas as atividade catalíticas: (i) das Ag-NPs na reação de redução do p-nitrofenol utilizando-se NaBH 4 como agente redutor, onde foram obtidas as maiores constantes catalíticas encontradas na literatura; e (ii) das AgPd-NPs na reação de oxidação do ácido fórmico, onde apenas o sistema F 1 -AgPd-NPs foi eficiente, apresentando a maior atividade por área encontrada na literatura. As NPs foram caracterizadas por meio de diversas técnicas. The goal of {{this work}} was the synthesis, {{characterization}} and catalytic study of silver and bimetallic silver-palladium nanoparticles (NPs) having the modified linear polyethylene imine (LPEI) as stabilizer. In order to achive this goal, the methodoly used was based on five steps: (i) the LPEI functionalization with <b>chloroethanol</b> and bromoctane; (ii) selection of the best Ag-NPs stabilizers using a high-throughput in situ screening; (iii) optimization of the conditions to synthetize the Ag-NPs using a multivariate analysis; (iv) synthesis of bimetallic NPs using the Ag-NPs SPR band as a probe in situ; e (v) determination of Ag-NPs catalytic activity over the p-nitrophenol (Nip) reaction using NaBH 4 as a reducing agent and AgPd-NPs catalytic activity over the formic acid oxidation reaction. The NPs were characterized by UV-Vis, TEM, HR-TEM, EDX, XRD, SAXS e DLS techniques. The Ag-NPs were synthesized using two stabilizers: F 1 (LPEI functionalized with 0. 4 equivalents of <b>chloroethanol)</b> and F 12 (LPEI functionalized with 0. 4 eq. of <b>chloroethanol</b> and 0. 5 eq. of bromoctane). For the Nip reduction reaction (used {{as a model for}} the M-NPs catalytic study) with NaBH 4 and F 1 - and F 12 -Ag-NPs as catalysts the rate constant normalized to the surface area of the NPs per unit volume found were 1. 66 and 0. 37 s- 1 m- 2 L, respectively. These values are among the highest ones found in literature. A full kinetic analysis based on the Langmuir model indicates that all species are likely adsorbed and accommodated on the surface before they take part in any reaction, and the Nip molecules hava a much stronger adsorption affinity than BH 4 - ions for the Ag-NP surface. Finally, using the Ag-NPs as templates, the silver-palladium nanoparticles (AgPd-NPs) were obtained by adding palladium acetate in the reaction medium. These NPs were also fully characterized by the UV-Vis, TEM, HR-TEM, EDX and XRD techniques, and it was possible to verify that the F 1 -AgPd-NPs are spherical and hollow, while the F 12 -AgPd-NPs are spherical and solid. The bimetallic NPs were used as catalysts for the formic acid oxidation reaction (for further use in fuell cells), but only the F 1 -AgPd-NPs system was active. For this system, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) found was 1. 28 m 2 g- 1, and the area activity was 61 mA cm- 2, the highest value found in the literature, even when compared with nanocatalysts based only in Pd...|$|E
40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{has been}} applied to investigate the secondary structure of proteins and polypeptides in halogenated alcohols. Each alcohol studied was able, as a pure liquid, to induce conversion of the 3 ̆b 2 -sheet protein concanavalin A into a predominantly 3 ̆b 1 -helical configuration. In 2 H 2 O/alcohol mixtures, helicogenisis was also apparent, decreasing in the order dichloroethanol > bromoethanol > trifluoroethanol > <b>chloroethanol</b> > fluoroethanol. At concentrations below those found to be helicogenic, disruption of the protein secondary structure by the alcohols resulted in pronounced aggregation. At concentrations insufficient to cause noticeable disruptions of the secondary structure at room temperature, the thermal stability of the protein was greatly reduced. We suggest the helicogenic effect exhibited by halogenated alcohols to be related to a combination of a relatively low dielectric constant and a high dipole moment, the latter causing disruption of the internal hydrogen bond networks and the former causing refolding to a helical configuration. The results presented here highlight the risk of using halogenated alcohols, both as solvents for proteins and as a test of the intrinsic capacity of proteins and peptides to adopt helical secondary structures.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 173 - 196. Using tritiated {{triamcinolone}} acetonide to monitor purification, cytoplasmic {{triamcinolone acetonide}}-receptor complex has been purified 3 000 fold from rat liver cytosol. The isolated complex sedimented {{as a single}} radioactive peak on a 5 - 20 % sucrose gradient. Nuclear envelopes isolated from purified rat liver nuclei were found to contain binding sites for the partially purified cytoplasmic triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complex. The binding constants showed two saturable high affinity binding sites and the envelope bound the complex with a specific activity ten {{times higher than the}} plasma membrane and more than three times higher than the two endoplasmic types of membrane. Saturable binding to chromatin was not observed in the concentration range tested. Free steroid hormone did not bind the envelope. Binding sites for steroid hormones or steroid hormone-receptor complexes have been demonstrated both in chromatin and the nuclear protein matrix (Barrack and Coffey, 1980; Spelsberg, 1976). Because the nuclear envelope may be isolated with both these nuclear subfractions, the observed binding sites for steroid hormone-receptor complexes might be due to the presence of envelope components. The extent of association of nuclear envelope or nuclear envelope components with chromatin and the matrix was therefore investigated. Nuclear envelope fragments could be isolated from chromatin purified by centrifugation through 1, 7 M sucrose. The binding of triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complex to these fragments was indistinguishable from the binding to purified nuclear envelope. A certain class of saturable chromatin binding sites for steroid hormone-receptor complexes may thus be due to the presence of envelope fragments. Extensive association of nuclear envelope polypeptides with the nuclear protein matrix was also observed. The matrix however, failed to bind triamcinolone acetonide-receptor complex. The nuclear envelope comprises an inner and outer membrane with well defined pore complexes spanning both membranes. In order to identify the location of the binding sites for trimacinolone acetonide-receptor complex in the envelope, fractionation and reconstitution of envelope proteins and lipids was attempted. Envelopes were solubilized in 2 - <b>chloroethanol</b> and protein and lipid components separated by chromatography on Sephadex LH 20. Envelope protein and lipid could be successfully reconstituted from <b>chloroethanol</b> by dialysis against aqueous buffer. Results showed that the receptor complex binds to the protein rather than lipid component of the envelope. This component was extractable by concentrations of the nonionic detergent Triton X- 100 which do not extract the pore complex or lamina components of the envelope and is therefore probably a loosely bound membrane protein. The presence of specific binding sites for triamcinolone acetonidereceptor complex on the nuclear envelope may be necessary for the transport of the complex into the nucleus. The possibility that the envelope mediates the glucocorticoid response in ways not linked to transport of the cytoplasmic receptor complex into the nucleus cannot be ruled out...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The flavoprotein alcohol oxidase from the yeast Candida boidinii catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols to aidehydes with transfer of the electrons to molecular oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide. The mechanism of alcohol oxidase with beta substituted ethanois as substrates has been examined using kinetic isotope effects, structure-reactivity correlations, and pH effects. Initial velocity line patterns for ethanol and bromoethanol as substrates for alcohol oxidase showed parallel lines, consistent with an irreversible step between the binding of the alcohol and oxygen, whereas methoxyethanol, fluoroethanol, <b>chloroethanol,</b> iodoethanol, and trifluoroethanol showed intersecting line patterns, consistent with a reversible step between the binding of the alcohol and oxygen. The effects of substituents in beta substituted ethanois on V/K values showed a good correlation with the a, value of the substituent after correction for steric, and hydrophobic effects, with a p value of- 1. 24. This value is inconsistent with a carbanion intermediate. Primary and solvent deuterium isotope effects were determined on the V/K values for several beta substituted ethanols. As the primary deuterium isotope effect increased, the solvent isotope effect decreased. The observed D(V/K) EtOH values in H 2 O (1. 54 ? 0. 14) and D 20 (1. 51 ? 0. 19) were similar, consistent with a concerted mechanism. The above studies are consistent with an asynchronous concerted mechanism in which the OH bond cleavage is further advanced than carbon hydrogen bond cleavage. With methanol, ethanol, and trifluoroethanol as substrates for alcohol oxidase, a single ionizable group with a pKa value of 8. 3 must be deprotonated for binding and catalysis. This residue is proposed to be histidine. The D(V/K) EtOH values at low pH (1. 62 ? 0. 12) and high pH (1. 54 ? 0. 14) were similar, consistent with ethanol not being a sticky substrate...|$|E
40|$|Phosphororganic {{flame retardants}} and {{plasticisers}} are important contaminants in the aquatic environment. Whereas the non-chlorinated alkylphosphates were partly eliminated in {{wastewater treatment plants}} the amounts of the chlorinated flame retardants were hardly reduced. Thus these compounds are discharged into the aquatic environment by STP-effluents. The elimination efficiency of wastewater treatment depends {{on the one hand}} on the dimension of the respective STP {{and on the other hand}} on the treatment technique that is applied. The elimination was higher in larger STP (inhabitant equivalent values (IEV) 300, 000 - 1, 000, 000) than in smaller ones (IEV below 100, 000). Lower elimination rates were observed for the trickling filter plant that was sampled in comparison to the activated sludge plants. In degradation experiments of the selected organophosphates with activated sludge in batch reactors, bis-(2 -chlorethyl) phosphate was identified as metabolite of tris-(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate under aerobic conditions. The selected organophosphate esters were detected in surface water that is used for drinking water purification. Thus it was studied if the drinking water quality is affected by these compounds. For this purpose samples from different waterworks in the Ruhr catchment area were analysed. Moreover the elimination efficiency of diverse treatment processes such as slow sand filtration, ozonisation and activated carbon filtration was studied. In the finished water the concentrations of the organophosphates were below the respective limit of quantification (LOQ). The chlorinated alkylphosphates are very persistent in the aquatic environment as they have been detected and quantified in pristine waterbodies such as the German Bight and Lake Ontario. A reduction of these compounds in the German Bight was traced back to dilution effects only. The concentrations of the phosphororganic flame retardants in marine samples were one order of magnitude higher than for other contaminants such as herbicides and by-products of pesticide production. The non-chlorinated alkylphosphates have only been detected in the river Elbe plume. Similar results were obtained for samples of Lake Ontario. As expected from the respective log KOW values of the selected organophosphate esters the bioaccumulation of these substances in fish is low. The concentrations of tri-n-butylphosphate (TnBP), tri-iso-butylphosphate (TiBP), triphenylphosphate (TPP) and tris-(chloroisopropyl) phosphate TCPP in bream muscle from different sampling locations in Germany were in the lower ng/g range (dry weight). Tris-(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris-(dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCP), tris-(butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) and ethylhexyldiphenylphosphate (EHDPP) were not detected in any fish sample. Moreover a temporal trend in the concentrations was observed. The sampling location seems to be an important factor that influences the detected levels of these substances in fish muscle as in the conurbation area higher amounts were detected than in riverine ecosystems. For the extraction of the selected organophosphate esters from water samples liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) has been applied. Fish samples were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) in combination with different clean up steps (SPE on silica gel and size exclusion chromatography (SEC)). The different compounds were detected by gas chromatography mass spectrometry with electron impact ionization (GC-EI-MS). For quantification purposes the isotopic labelled internal standards tri-n-butylphosphate d 27 (TnBP d 27) and triphenylphosphate d 15 (TPP d 15) were used. TPP d 15 was synthesized from phenol d 6 and phosphorus oxytrichloride. The empiric formula of the product was confirmed by electrospray high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-HR-TOF-MS). The metabolites bis-(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP), bis-(methyl, 2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (BCPP) and bis-(butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBEP) were synthesized from phosphorus oxytrichloride and the respective alcohols <b>chloroethanol,</b> 1 -chloro- 2 -propanol and butoxyethanol.
