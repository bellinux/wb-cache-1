25|$|FIFA {{announced}} that the ranking system would be updated following the 2006 World Cup. The evaluation period was cut from eight to four years, and a simpler method of calculation is now used to determine rankings. Goals scored and home or away advantage are no longer taken into account, {{and other aspects of}} the calculations, including the importance attributed to different types of match, have been revised.

With 17.5% of total world's population, India had a 20.6% share of world's poorest in 2013. According to a 2005–2006 survey, India had about 61 million {{children under the age}} of 5 who were chronically malnourished. A 2011 UNICEF report stated that between 1990 and 2010, India achieved a 45 percent reduction in under age 5 mortality rates, and now ranks 46th of 188 countries on this metric.|$|E

2500|$|While {{differences}} in biblical interpretation or in <b>calculation</b> <b>methodology</b> can produce some {{differences in}} the creation date, most results fall relatively close {{to one of these}} two dominant models. The primary reason for the disparity seems to lie in which underlying Biblical text is chosen (roughly 5500 BC based on the Greek Septuagint text, about 3750 BC based on the Hebrew Masoretic text). Most of the 1,732-year difference resides in numerical discrepancies in the genealogies of the two versions of the Book of Genesis. Patriarchs from Adam to Terah, the father of Abraham, are said to be older by as much as 100 years or more when they begat their named son in the Greek Septuagint {{than they were in the}} Latin Vulgate ( [...] ; [...] ) or the Hebrew Tanakh ( [...] ; [...] ).
