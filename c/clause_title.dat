40|$|From establishments {{of state}} {{religions}} to bans on headscarves, religious minorities experience discrimination. In the post-September 11, 2001, world, Muslim {{women in particular}} have faced harsh forms of discrimination and stereotyping; this stigma has only been worsened with the recent influx of immigrants into Europe. With increasing numbers of immigrants, some countries have attempted to assimilate minority religious groups by banning the religious use of headscarves. EEOC v. Abercrombie 2 ̆ 6 Fitch Stores, Inc., a case from the United States Supreme Court, was a break for Muslim women. This case, which involved a Muslim plaintiff, held that religious practices are to be given favored treatment by employers in the workplace. This Note reads the Abercrombie case {{against the background of}} the First Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s Religion <b>Clauses,</b> <b>Title</b> VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and globalization. Given the widespread discrimination that Muslim women currently face across the globe, this Note considers what steps the international community might take next to protect not only Muslim women but also other religious minorities in the workplace...|$|R

40|$|This note {{explores the}} Ramsey County District Court’s {{decision}} in Unity Church v. Minnesota recently affirmed by the Minnesota Court of Appeals. This note does not, however, debate {{the merits of}} Minnesota’s conceal-and-carry law. Part II traces the legislative path taken by both the natural resource and conceal-and-carry bills. Part II surveys {{the history of the}} single-subject and <b>title</b> <b>clause</b> of the Minnesota Constitution and the evolution of the Minnesota Supreme Court’s interpretation of the clause since its enactment. Part III summarizes the factual and procedural posture of the Unity Church decision. Part IV then contends that the legislature’s enactment of the amended natural resource law failed to comply with the single-subject provision of article IV, section 17 of the Minnesota Constitution. Moreover, this note asserts a contrary holding eviscerates the Blanch v. Suburban Hennepin Regional Park District “mere filament” test to a “mere figment” and renders the single-subject and <b>title</b> <b>clause</b> meaningless. In contrast to the law’s failure to comply with the single-subject provision, this note contends that the amended natural resource law’s title gave reasonable notice of its contents. Further, Part IV asserts that the proper sanction renders the entire law unconstitutional. This note concludes that the appellate courts should return to their proper role in interpreting the single-subject and <b>title</b> <b>clause</b> of the Minnesota Constitution, namely to give each part of the constitution the plain meaning and effect of its language...|$|R

40|$|The {{rules of}} {{substantive}} law {{relating to the}} reservation of <b>title</b> <b>clause</b> differ from country to country. This book addresses {{problems which may arise}} if a reservation of <b>title</b> <b>clause</b> is employed within international transactions, especially transactions between Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The author seeks the solution in private international law, since other means of addressing the problem, such as harmonization and unification of substantive law rules, have failed so far. This book is strong in its analysis of the various conflict of laws solutions and pioneering in how it deals with the question {{of the extent to which}} rules of private international law in this field must be in compliance with European law. The consequences of the various modes in which such compliance may be achieved are carefully analysed. This study is an important contribution to the understanding of European integration in a hitherto relatively neglected subject area.

50|$|Ricci v.

Cabranes dissented from the denial of en banc rehearing of this case, observing that the appeal raised important questions of first impression regarding the application of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection <b>Clause</b> and <b>Title</b> VII's prohibition on discriminatory employment practices-primarily, whether a city employer may disregard the results of a qualifying employment examination, which was carefully constructed to ensure race-neutrality, on the ground that the results of that examination yielded too many qualified applicants of one race and not enough of another. Cabranes urged the Supreme Court to consider the question, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari on January 9, 2009. The Supreme Court reviewed the decision to dimsiss the suit, reversed it, and took the unusual step of granting judgment for the firefighters.|$|R
