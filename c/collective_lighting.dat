For few particles we derive explicit conditions for self-consistent stable ordering. In the purely dispersive limit with negligible back-scattering, we recover the prediction of an equidistant lattice as previously found for effective dipole-dipole in-teraction models. We generalize our model to experimentally more realistic configurations including backscattering, absorption and a di-rectional scattering asymmetry. For larger particle ensembles the re-sulting self-consistent particle-field equations can be numerically solved to study the formation of long-range order and stability limits. ...|$|R

40|$|We study off-resonant <b>collective</b> <b>light</b> {{scattering}} from ultracold atoms {{trapped in}} an optical lattice. Scattering from different atomic quantum states creates different quantum {{states of the}} scattered light, which can be distinguished by measurements of the spatial intensity distribution, quadrature variances, photon statistics, or spectral measurements. In particular, angle-resolved intensity measurements reflect global statistics of atoms (total number of radiating atoms) {{as well as local}} statistical quantities (single-site statistics even without an optical access to a single site) and pair correlations between different sites. As a striking example we consider scattering from transversally illuminated atoms into an optical cavity mode. For the Mott insulator state, similar to classical diffraction, the number of photons scattered into a cavity is zero due to destructive interference, while for the superfluid state it is nonzero and proportional to the number of atoms. Moreover, we demonstrate that light scattering into a standing-wave cavity has a nontrivial angle dependence, including the appearance of narrow features at angles, where classical diffraction predicts zero. The measurement procedure corresponds to the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of various atomic variables by observing light. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

In this way the group is capable of searching and approaching a light target in an environment scattered with obstacles, furrows, and holes, where robots acting individually fail.

40|$|The bond {{fluctuation}} {{model with}} a bond potential {{has been applied to}} investigation of the glass transition of linear chains and chains with a regular disposition of small branches. Cooling and subsequent heating curves are obtained for the chain energies and also for the mean acceptance probability of a bead jump. In order to mimic different trends to vitrification, a factor B gauging the strength of the bond potential with respect to the long-range potential (i. e. the intramolecular or intermolecular potential between indirectly bonded beads) has been introduced. (A higher value of B leads to a preference for the highest bond lengths and a higher total energy, implying a greater tendency to vitrify.) Different cases have been considered for linear chains: no long-range potential, no bond potential and several choices for B. Furthermore, we have considered two distinct values of B for alternate bonds in linear chains. In the case of the branched chains, molecules with different values of B for bonds in the main chain and in the branches have also been investigated. The possible presence of crystallization has been characterized by calculating the <b>collective</b> <b>light</b> scattering function of the different samples after annealing at a convenient temperature below the onset of crystallization. It is concluded that crystallization is inherited more efficiently in the systems with branched chains and also for higher values of B. The branched molecules with the highest B values in the main chain bonds exhibit two distinct transitions in the heating curves which may be associated with two glass transitions. This behavior has been detected experimentally for chains with relatively long flexible branches. Comment: 1 Table, 12 Figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} politicizing participatory policy processes for civil society groups operating in Venezuela’s environment of extreme polarization.

I find that processes of ideological-and partisan-based politicization have created a context where “loyalty ” activates repertoires of “voice ” that in turn range in their critical nature.

40|$|A dilute gas Bose-Einstein {{condensate}} was probed {{and manipulated}} by off-resonant laser beams. Spontaneous and stimulated off-resonant light scatterings were studied experimentally. Stimulated, two-photon Bragg scattering {{was used for}} spectroscopic measurement of the mean-field energy and of the intrinsic momentum uncertainty of the condensate. The high momentum and energy resolution of this method allowed {{the determination of the}} coherence length of the condensate, which was shown to be equal to its size. Spontaneous, off-resonant Rayleigh scattering was studied by exposing an elongated condensate to a single off-resonant laser beam. Highly directional scattering of light and atoms was observed. This <b>collective</b> <b>light</b> scattering is shown to be directly analogous to Dicke superradiance, where the electronic coherence is replaced by the coherent center-of-mass motion of the atoms in the condensate. Superradiant Rayleigh scattering was used to amplify atomic matter waves. The active medium was a Bose-Einstein condensate, pumped by off-resonant laser light ("Dressed condensate"). An atomic wave packet was amplified with a gain of 10 to 100. Phase-coherence of the amplifier was verified by observing the interference of the output wave with a reference wave packet. Optical properties of the dressed condensate were also characterized, focusing on the key role of long-lived matter wave gratings produced by interference between the condensate at rest and the recoiling atoms. The narrow bandwidth for the optical gain gave rise to an extremely slow group velocity of an amplified light pulse ([approx. ] 1 m/s). (cont.) The role of quantum statistics in these enhanced scatterings was studied. It was shown that the macroscopic occupation of a single quantum state is not necessary. These processes are in principle possible for fermionic or non-degenerate samples, provided the atomic ensemble has a sufficiently long coherence time. By moving a focused, far off-resonant laser beam through a condensate, vortex excitations were created in a Bose-Einstein condensate. They were observed as dislocations in the interference fringes formed by the stirred condensate and a second unperturbed condensate. The technique was shown to be a powerful tool to study turbulent superfluid flow. by Shin Inouye. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Physics, 2001.
