40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} pterygium of the household population aged 40 and above in Hengli Town of Dongguan. METHODS: Using the method of cluster random sampling, select 3 628 people aged 40 and above in four villages and one community for visual examination, intraocular pressure <b>check,</b> slit <b>lamp</b> examination and questionnaire. RESULTS: The actual number of subjects was 3 393 people, and examination rate was 93. 52 %. We detected 843 patients with pterygium. The prevalence of pterygium was 24. 85 %. CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of pterygium in Dongguan area. The prevalence of pterygium is related with age and working environment, but has no relation with gender...|$|R

The 'assembly line diagnostic link' (ALDL) protocol broadcasts at 160 bit/s Implemented on California vehicles for the 1980 model year, {{and the rest of}} the United States in 1981. Most owners can read DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Code(s)) by commanding the ECM (Engine Control Module) to flash the CEL (<b>Check</b> Engine <b>Lamp)</b> or MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on and off. [...] A PC based Software package called WinALDL will listen to the CLCC (Closed Loop Carburetor Control) and early CLC EFI datastreams over a fairly easy to construct interface cable that converts the 160 baud TTL serial data being transmitted by the ECM to RS232 or USB serial data [...] but there is not much information transmitted by these early ECMs.|$|R

Father Manfred believes that the evil spirits are finally gone from the house. Meanwhile, at the yard sale, a woman named Helen Royce (Peggy McCay) and her friend Rhona (Gloria Cromwell) are looking through the items when Helen finds the lamp. At only $100.00, Helen decides to buy the lamp. She even decides {{to send it to}} her sister as a birthday present, explaining that she and her sister send each other rather ugly gifts as a long-running joke. While <b>checking</b> the <b>lamp,</b> Helen cuts her finger on a brass collar around the bulb. Ignoring the cut on her finger, Helen buys the lamp. As the day goes on, Helen's finger begins to get infected and discolored. Helen later dies of Tetanus.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} testing of LED lamps are vital steps toward broader use of LED {{lighting}} for outdoor illumination and traffic signalling. The characteristics of LED sources, {{in combination with the}} need to limit light pollution and power consumption, require a precise optical design. In particular, in every step of the process, it is important to closely compare theoretical or simulated results with measured data (obtained from a prototype). This work examines the various possibilities for using an optical CAD (Lambda Research TracePro) to design and <b>check</b> a LED <b>lamp</b> for outdoor use. This analysis includes the simulations and testing on a prototype as an example; data acquired by measurement are inserted into the same simulation software, making it easy to compare theoretical and actual results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} implementation of a wireless system for street lighting control and monitoring, focusing on its energy efficiency and reliability. Each node of the network consists of a lamp connected to an electronic dimmable ballast through a control unit and a radio module. The network is designed using the 802. 15. 4 IEEE protocol and it is implemented using a mesh topology at 2. 45 GHz. It is possible to adjust the power consumption and luminosity of each lamp at a particular point (or street) relative to traffic intensity or safety considerations, saving a considerable amount of energy. It is also possible to adjust the luminosity of the lamp according to the environment light by using a radiant sensor present in the control unit and <b>check</b> the <b>lamp</b> status (on or off). The entire network is monitored by self-proprietary software, and also includes the ability to make decisions depending on local sensors. Each node can also be used as a router to transmit the information from one node to another in order to extend the distance range the network can achieve. The main advantages of this system are the reduction of costs related to energy consumption and the ability to detect in a short time a lamp failure. Results show that it is possible to reduce the power consumption of a single lamp by 69 %. The network range was adequate and each node itself could transmit and receive commands 130 m apart...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 -saporin to prevent lens regrowth in the rabbit. METHODS: Chemically conjugated and genetically fused FGF 2 -saporin (made in Escherichia coli) were used. Extracapsular extraction of the lens {{was performed on the}} rabbit, and the cytotoxin either was injected directly into the capsule bag or was administered by FGF 2 -saporin-coated, heparin surface-modified (HSM) polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses. The potential of the conjugate was <b>checked</b> by slit <b>lamp</b> evaluation of capsular opacification and by measuring crystallin synthesis. Toxin diffusion and sites of toxin binding were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Possible toxicity was determined by histologic analysis of ocular tissues. RESULTS: FGF 2 -saporin effectively inhibited lens regrowth when it was injected directly into the capsular bag. However, high concentration of the toxin induced transient corneal edema and loss of pigment in the iris. Intraocular lenses coated with FGF 2 -saporin reduced lens regrowth and crystallin synthesis without any detectable clinical side effect. After implantation, FGF 2 -saporin was shown to have bound to the capsules and, to a lesser extent, to the iris; no histologic damage was found on ocular tissues as a result of implantation of drug-loaded HSM intraocular lenses. CONCLUSIONS: Chemically conjugated (FGF 2 -SAP) and genetically fused FGF 2 -saporin (rFGF 2 -SAP) bound to HSM intraocular lenses can prevent lens regrowth in the rabbit...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results obtained}} from the SMOV IR FSM (Filter Select Mecha-nism) and internal <b>lamp</b> <b>check</b> proposals, programs designed to verify the operability of the IR filter wheel {{and the health of}} the primary and backup IR internal lamps. A tungsten flatfield was taken in each filter of the wheel, excluding the grisms. The wheel performed as expected and all data were successfully acquired. The resulting flatfield features, e. g the scratches, areas of lower QE, bad and unresponsive pixels, were similar to those seen in ground testing. However, some flatfields (F 098 M, F 130 N, F 132 N, and F 167 N) showed what appear to be glints and reflections at the few percent level or less, possibly caused by a light leak around the diffuser paddle used to acquire the internal flatfields. The output flux of both lamps is 6 - 10 % higher than it was on the ground, likely due to the lamps run-ning hotter in the space environment than they did in the thermal vacuum test chamber. The relative output of the primary to spare lamp is {{the same as it was}} on the ground, to within 1 - 2 %. On a more general note, the behavior of the early reads in the IR multiaccum files could benefit from a closer investigation: there appears to be a significant non-lin...|$|R

An {{alternative to the}} common toxic drug treatment could offer a better result. Methods Vitamin C was prescribed in crystal form in increasing amounts until loose stools were experienced {{at the level of}} approximately 500 grams per day. Results Iritis symptoms disappeared when <b>checked</b> with slit <b>lamp</b> examination, secondary elevated intraocular pressure returned to normal, head pain and a few herpes zoster vesicles of the scalp disappeared in the short time span of three days when treated by 12 grams of vitamin C, every thirty minutes for six days. Conclusion Iritis was a harbinger of herpes zoster. The free radical damage was quenched first in the iritis with less than bowel dosage of vitamin C. The continued increased intake of vitamin C was responsible to reduce the herpes zoster attack to one of extreme mildness and the short duration of only three days. 500 grams of vitamin C per day was given for six days.
