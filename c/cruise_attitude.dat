5000|$|When a {{pilot is}} {{undergoing}} flight training, the <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude</b> is usually {{one of the}} first things that they will learn. The sight picture associated with cruise flight, will include the horizon and a combination of sky and ground.|$|E
50|$|If {{the pilot}} does not adjust {{the engine power}} by {{decreasing}} the throttle setting, the aircraft's airspeed will increase. The amount of increase {{will depend on how}} much the nose was lowered compared to the <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude,</b> and what the previous power setting was. When flying aircraft, power usually is decreased to around 2/3 full for a cruise descent.|$|E
50|$|To make an {{aircraft}} climb, i.e. gain altitude, the pilot {{will raise the}} nose higher {{than it is in}} the <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude.</b> For many light aircraft, this will correspond to a sight picture where the aircraft nose appears to be on or just slightly above the horizon. The amount of movement will typically not exceed 10-15 degrees.|$|E

2500|$|As the Partnair {{aircraft}} {{passed over}} the water at its planned <b>cruising</b> <b>attitude</b> of 22 000 feet, a Norwegian F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jet passed by it. The fighter pilot was startled by the sudden appearance of the aircraft and contacted Oslo air traffic control. [...] He believed that the radar data were false and that the aircraft was closer to his jet than his on-board computer had indicated.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the pilot}} does not adjust {{the engine power}} by {{increasing}} the throttle setting, the aircraft's airspeed will decrease. The amount of decrease {{will depend on the}} amount the nose was raised compared to the <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude,</b> and what the power setting is. When flying light aircraft, power is usually increased to full for any extended climb.|$|E
50|$|To make an {{aircraft}} descend (i.e. lose altitude), the pilot will lower the nose {{lower than it}} was in the <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude.</b> For many light aircraft, this will correspond to a sight picture where the aircraft nose appears to be slightly below the horizon. The actual amount of down movement usually will not exceed about 10 degrees for most normal descents.|$|E
5000|$|Pitch is the {{vertical}} {{relationship between the}} nose and horizon. Since the pilot / cockpit and nose of the aircraft are all moving together, the pitch attitude {{is seen as the}} ratio of visible sky to ground in the view ahead. The exact ratio of sky to ground visible in the forward window will vary from one aircraft type to another. In a typical light aircraft, the ratio might be 2/3 ground and 1/3 sky when the aircraft is in the <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} the conceptual design phase: {{definition of the}} airplane configuration according to the standard requirements. The aim is the optimization of the payload and of fuel consumption which are fundamental elements {{in the design of}} a transport airplane. These are required in relation to the external configuration in order to define an optimum wing aspect ratio value. In detail, the work starts out from Breguet's formula, modified for jet airplanes, and develops it {{as a function of the}} different parameters. Calculations were performed for different cruising height values, selected from the flight levels usually utilized. The solutions are given as functions of the range, of the <b>cruise</b> flight <b>attitude</b> and of the cruise height. A simple formula is introduced in the flight performance equations for estimating the wing weight. Obviously, for the purposes of this optimization, the fuel consumption during the climb must be taken into account; this evaluation was performed using an energetic method. The computation program consists of a matrix of the variables and parameters, and determines the variation of each one with respect to the others. The results are presented in the form of diagrams and all quantities are represented as variables or parameters. This method, which is a development of that already proposed by the authors for turboprop airplanes, is very easy to use and permits the optimum solution for economy utilization to be found. This situation is determined by certain values for payload and fuel consumption. The external configuration of the airplane may be defined in this way following the most suitable criterion: optimization of the payload, or optimization of the fuel consumptio...|$|R
40|$|Maritime {{terrorism}} is a neglected {{area of research}} in tourism, particularly the use of scenario planning to understand potential threats to the cruise industry. Since the events of 9 / 11, terrorism, {{and the threat of}} terrorism, has become a major concern within the tourism industry. This article analyses tourist perception of perceived terrorist threats given that many ships are American owned. Using the scenario analysis presented by Greenberg, Chalk, Willis, Khilko, and Ortiz, this study suggests that an attack on a cruise ship is a distinct possibility. Indeed, 44 % of respondents questioned perceived the possibility of a terrorist attack on a cruise ship to be likely despite the fact that safety and security is seen by the industry as a ‘hallmark’ of <b>cruising.</b> Differences in <b>attitude</b> among potential passengers revealed a high level of confidence in the cruise ship companies. This finding is particularly marked among more experienced cruise ship passengers. However, this did not necessarily preclude the possibility of security measures being improved. All passengers appeared generally resigned to the fact that risk is associated with travel in the twenty-first century and welcomed any efforts by cruise shipping companies to improve safety and security...|$|R
40|$|Cruise {{tourism is}} a {{phenomenon}} that has rapidly developed {{in a very short}} period of time. Every year, larger and larger cruisers with the possibility to accept up to 6, 000 passengers are built. Arrival of a large number of passengers and mega-ships can have a dramatic impact on the visited port, the place and the population. There are three impacts of cruise tourism: the impact on society, economic impact and environmental impact. This form of tourism has a positive and negative impact on coastal and island tourist destinations. Economic effects are undoubtedly significant and contribute to the economic development of the region and the country. Revenues generated by this sector vary from country to country, depending on the inclusion of participants of operational and public sectors in various activities of this industry. However, negative effects on the image of the destination, on sojourns of stationary tourists, on the life of the local residents and the environment must not be ignored. In this paper, the attention is paid to the impact of <b>cruise</b> tourism, and <b>attitudes</b> of local people and professionals towards the impact of cruise tourism on the city of Split...|$|R
5000|$|Roundout : Contacting {{the runway}} with a 300 ft/min (100 m/min) descent rate will be {{extremely}} uncomfortable and can cause damage to both the aircraft and passengers. For that reason, the aircraft will be put into a roundout attitude shortly before it would otherwise contact the ground. The attitude {{is similar to the}} <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude</b> and is accomplished by the pilot increasing the pitch attitude (raising the nose) at approximately ten to fifty feet above the ground, depending on the aircraft type. Larger, heavier aircraft will be put into the roundout attitude at higher heights than smaller lighter aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests of}} a heavy-class {{helicopter}} model {{were carried out}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of several components optimised for drag reduction by computational fluid dynamics analysis. The optimised components included different hub-cap configurations, a fairing for blade attachments and the sponsons. Moreover, the effects of vortex generators positioned on the back ramp were investigated. The optimisation effect was evaluated by comparison of the drag measurements carried out for both the original and the optimised helicopter configurations. The comprehensive experimental campaign involved the use of different measurement techniques. Indeed, pressure measurements and stereo particle image velocimetry surveys were performed to achieve a physical insight about the results of load measurements. The test activity confirms the achievement of an overall reduction of about 6 % of the original model drag at <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the experimental activity {{carried out to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the CFD-based shape optimisation of several components of a common helicopter platform of the heavy-weight class. The considered geometry is basically the same of the model tested in the frame of thÃ¨ GO AHE AD project. The comprehensive wind tunnel campaign includes both the original helicopter configuration and the optimised version to assess the optimisation effectiveness by comparison. The optimised components included different hub-cap configurations, a set of fairings for the blade-stubs attachments and the sponsons. Moreover, the effects on drag reduction produced by an array of vortex generators positioned on the back-ramp were investigated. Different measurement techniques were employed as loads and moments measurements, steady and unsteady pressure surveys and stereo particle image vclocimetry. The performed measurements confirm a overall drag reduction of about 6 % at <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude</b> for the optimised configuration...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{management}} practices {{and content of}} the education/interpretation commentaries of two differing commercial dolphin watch operators in Nelson Bay, New South Wales, which is promoted as the “Dolphin Capital of Australia. ” The major objective {{of the study was to}} measure and evaluate the postexperience effectiveness of the education/interpretation components on the self-reported proenvironmental attitudes, beliefs, intended behaviors, and intended actions of participants. A questionnaire was administered to participants immediately after their half-day dolphin watch cruises. The most important feature of the experience for all participants was the opportunity to see wild dolphins behaving naturally in their natural habitat. Although the management practices {{and content of the}} education and interpretation messages differed aboard the two vessels, no significant differences occurred between the two differing samples for impacts on visitors’ intended proenvironmental actions. Significant differences did occur between samples for the self-reported impacts on participants’ strength of support for conservation of marine wildlife and for conservation of dolphins. The effectiveness and influence of the dolphin watch <b>cruises</b> on proenvironmental <b>attitudes,</b> beliefs, intended behaviors, and actions of participants appears to be related to two factors: the quality and content of the education/interpretive message, and the intensity level of the dolphin watching experience...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) {{spacecraft}} {{was successfully}} launched into orbit on September 8, 2016. It is traveling to a near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu, study it in detail, {{and bring back}} a pristine sample to Earth for scientific analyses. At the Outbound <b>Cruise</b> nominal spacecraft <b>attitude,</b> with Sun on +X, sunlight impinges on the OSIRIS-REx camera suite (OCAMS) PolyCam sunshade multilayer insulation (MLI) with microporous black polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{a portion of the}} PolyCam optics support tube (MLI with germanium black Kapton (GBK)), a portion of the OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES) sunshade (MLI with GBK), the Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) sunshade (MLI with GBK), and the OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter (OLA) sunshade (MLI with GBK). Sunlight is reflected or scattered by the above MLIs to the other components on the forward (+Z) deck. It illuminates the forward deck. A detailed thermal assessment on the solar impingement has been performed for the Proximity Ops at the asteroid, Touch-and-Go (TAG) sample acquisition, and Return Cruise mission phases. The OSIRIS-REx Outbound Cruise flight temperature telemetry and USM_ 3 _DPC_ 0 _CURRENT flight currenttelemetry data have been analyzed. It is evident that at the nominal Outbound Cruise spacecraft Sun-pointing attitude(i. e., Sun on +X), sunlight impinging on the PolyCam, OTES, IMU-sunshade and OLA-sunshade MLIs is reflected orscattered to the forward deck and components on the forward deck. It illuminates the forward deck. The StowCam imageof Day 265 2016 also provided an evidence. The reflected or scattered sunlight cause warming to the forward deck andcomponents on its +Z side. It may also contribute to degradation of thermal coatings over the mission life. It is a factorthat the OVIRS detector operating temperature exceeds the 105 K maximum AFT limit. The OVIRS PrincipalInvestigator indicated that it is not optimum but acceptable for science. With exception of the OVIRS detector, thecorrelated flight system thermal model predictions for the components on the forward deck have adequate margins in theProximity Ops, TAG and Return Cruise phases. The margins are expected to cover the warming caused by the solarimpingement and the contribution to degradation of thermal coatings. The solar impingement is not expected to be athermal risk to the OSIRIS-REx mission. The second SRC Optical Properties characterization will be repeated in theReturn Cruise to provide a good characterization of any changes in optical properties that might have occurred duringthe TAG, or during several years in space. If the SRC battery runs much warmer than that of the first characterization inthe Outbound Cruise, {{it will be necessary to}} make some changes to the SRC Release timeline to assure the SRC batterytemperature are within limits. If GBK, instead of microporous black PTFE, were used on the PolyCam sunshade MLI,much more sunlight would have been reflected or scattered to the forward deck and components on its +Z side. Microporous black PTFE should be considered to mitigate the optical and thermal issues of sunlight reflected/scatteredby MLI blankets in future missions...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{results show}} that for {{longitudinal}} stability at M = 0 - 3 and C L = 0 " 45, the centre of gravity of an actual aircraft could be located only forward of 45 % ~ (66 % Co). The centre of pressure of the wing with basic nose and no fin is at 53 % ~ (71 % Co) at the <b>cruise</b> <b>attitude,</b> M = 2. 2 and C c = 0. 075, so that the camber used is insufficient to trim the wing. Measured values of the drag increments due to control deflection show fair agreement with linear-theory estimates. The control effectiveness (dCz/d'qe, dC,,/d~ 7 ~ and dCjdesc) can be predicted with fair accuracy. The canopy nose is slightly de-stabilizing in yaw, {{and it has a}} drag penalty which is probably larger than could be tolerated (30 % of basic wing wave drag). At supersonic speeds slenderbody theory is generally inadequate for predicting the lateral derivatives of the wing. The fin effectivenes...|$|E
