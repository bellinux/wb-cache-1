25|$|Tooth {{whitening}} or tooth bleaching procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a bleaching agent is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide.</b> Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.|$|E

Examples include <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide,</b> allantoin, and hydantoin. Ureas {{are closely related to}} biurets and related in structure to amides, carbamates, carbodiimides, and thiocarbamides.|$|E
50|$|Bleaching {{solutions}} generally contain {{hydrogen peroxide}} or <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide,</b> which bleaches the tooth enamel {{to change its}} color. Off-the-shelf products typically rely on a <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> solution varying in concentration from 10% to 44%. Bleaching solutions may be applied directly to the teeth, embedded in a plastic strip that {{is placed on the}} teeth or use a gel held in place by a mouthguard. <b>Carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> reacts with water to form hydrogen peroxide. <b>Carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> has {{about a third of the}} strength of hydrogen peroxide. This means that a 15% solution of <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> is the rough equivalent of a 5% solution of hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide oxidizing agent penetrates the porosities in the rod-like crystal structure of enamel and breaks down stain deposits in the dentin.|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to determine if there is any change in the active ingredient of tooth-whitening agents when the products are received from the manufacturer (Baseline), two months, four months, and six months after they are received, under two different storage conditions. Thirty-six products were received from multiple manufacturers: eight with hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> and 28 <b>carbamide</b> with <b>peroxide</b> products. All the bleaching syringes for a specific product were from the same lot. Once the products were received, one sample of each product was stored at room temperature and the other sample was stored in a refrigerator. Assays to determine the baseline concentration were performed within {{the first two weeks of}} their arrival and again 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months after receiving the products. All samples were analyzed for peroxide content by using the United States Pharmacopeia recommended method. The results obtained from this study show the following: 1. 	Bleaching products have different concentrations than what are indicated on the label. 2. 	Storage of bleaching products for an extended time at room temperature can cause bleaching products to lose some of their potency. 3. 	The preferable storage condition verified in this study is under refrigeration...|$|R
40|$|Vital {{bleaching}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} requested cosmetic dental procedures asked by patients who seek a more pleasing smile. This procedure consists of <b>carbamide</b> or hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> gel applications that can be applied in-office or by the patient (at-home/overnight bleaching system). Some in-office treatments utilise whitening light with the objective of speeding up the whitening process. The objective of this article is to review and summarise the current literature with regard to the effect of light-activation sources on in-office tooth bleaching. A literature search was conducted using Medline, accessed via the National Library of Medicine Pub Med from 2003 to 2013 searching for articles relating to effectiveness of light activation sources on in-office tooth bleaching. This study found conflicting evidence on whether light truly improve tooth whitening. Other factors such as, type of stain, initial tooth colour and subject age which can influence tooth bleaching outcome were discussed. Conclusions: The use of light activator sources with in-office bleaching treatment of vital teeth did not increase the efficacy of bleaching or accelerate the bleaching...|$|R
40|$|Hydrazine {{replacement}} in hypergolic {{rocket propulsion}} systems requires new green oxidizers. In this paper an approach is investigated basing on commercially available concentrated hydrogen peroxide with purities from 60 % to 80 %. In scope {{to reduce the}} melting or glass transition temperature and to increase stability and to prevent ageing without ruining the oxygen balance, ammonium nitrate (AN), ammonium dinitramide (ADN) and urea hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> (<b>Carbamide)</b> were solved in hydrogen peroxide. Such oxidizers enable low operation temperatures far below - 40 °C. They were tested as hypergolic propellants in combination with an energetic ionic liquid (EIL) basing on AMIM DCA as fuel including appropriate catalysts enforcing hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Such systems provide a theoretical specific impulse up to 2500 N s/kg or 3300 N s/dm 3 and should suite as liquid or gelled propellants. Hypergolic lab scale ignition tests result in ignition delay times comparable to hypergolic systems in operation. The results were discussed in view of thermodynamic reaction data and measured temperatures. Especially {{it was found that}} the ignition delay time correlates with the inverse of the decomposition temperature of the oxidizer...|$|R
50|$|In-office {{bleaching}} procedures generally use a light-cured {{protective layer}} that is carefully {{painted on the}} gums and papilla (the tips of the gums between the teeth) {{to reduce the risk}} of chemical burns to the soft tissues. The bleaching agent is either <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide,</b> which breaks down in the mouth to form hydrogen peroxide, or hydrogen peroxide itself. The bleaching gel typically contains between 10% and 44% <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide,</b> which is roughly equivalent to a 3% to 16% hydrogen peroxide concentration.|$|E

5000|$|To whiten {{the natural}} tooth shade, {{bleaching}} is suggested. It {{is a common}} procedure in cosmetic dentistry, {{and a number of}} different techniques are used by dental professionals. Many different products are also marketed for home use. Techniques include bleaching strips, bleaching pen, bleaching gel, and laser tooth whitening. Bleaching methods generally use <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> or hydrogen peroxide. There are claims that <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> is less effective than hydrogen peroxide, but also has fewer side effects. Common side effects of bleaching are increased sensitivity of the teeth and irritation of the gums.

50|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} - urea {{is a solid}} {{composed of}} equal amounts of hydrogen peroxide and urea. This compound is a white crystalline solid, which dissolves in water to give free hydrogen peroxide. Often called <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> in the dental applications, it {{is used as a}} source of hydrogen peroxide for bleaching, disinfection, and oxidation. Hydrogen peroxide - urea contains solid and water-free hydrogen peroxide, which offers a higher stability and better controllability than liquid hydrogen peroxide when used as oxidizing agent.|$|E
5000|$|Toothpastes (dentifrices) {{which are}} advertised as [...] "whitening" [...] rarely contain <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide,</b> {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{or any other}} bleaching agent. Rather, they are abrasive (usually containing alumina, dicalcium phosphate dehydrate, calcium carbonate or silica), intended to remove surface stains from the tooth surface. Sometimes they contain enzymes purported {{to break down the}} biofilm on teeth. Unlike bleaches, whitening toothpaste does not alter the intrinsic color of teeth. Excessive or long term use of abrasive toothpastes will cause dental abrasion, thinning the enamel layer and slowly darkening the appearance of the tooth as the dentin layer becomes more noticeable.|$|E
50|$|At-home {{whitening}} {{methods include}} gels, chewing gums, rinses, toothpastes, paint-on films, and whitening strips. Most over-the-counter methods utilize either <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> or hydrogen peroxide. Although {{there is some}} evidence that such products will whiten the teeth compared to placebo, the majority of the published scientific studies were short term and are subject to a high risk of bias as the research was sponsored or conducted by the manufacturers. There is no long term evidence of the effectiveness or potential risks of such products. Any demonstrable difference in the short term efficiency of such products seems to be related to concentration of the active ingredient.|$|E
50|$|Viocin is a newly {{patented}} {{technology in the}} oral care industry. Viocin is an oral care whitening gel that, when applied to teeth, counteracts the yellow that traditional whitening leaves behind to reflect white.

Viocins new technology has recently been awarded the Best of State Utah: Science and Technology, as well as Best of State: Business Innovation. Viocin is fortified and sweetened with Xylitol. Xylitol has been proven to be beneficial in caries prevention and in remineralizing damaged teeth, helping to reduce sensitivity.

50|$|Lasers {{made their}} way into routine {{dentistry}} {{by the middle of the}} first decade, offering faster treatments, less pain and more precise results. They are used to remove tartar, treat soft tissues such as gums and to prepare cavities for filling. Of particular interest in the latter instance is the fact that this treatment is so painless that the use of a needle to inject a local anesthetic is usually unnecessary. Laser treatment results in little bleeding, a lower risk of infection and a quicker healing. Another innovation was the use of computer milled ceramic implants for repairing cavities. The use of a non-toxic chemical such as hydrogen peroxide or <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> for tooth bleaching has become popular in the new century.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Bleaching agents {{can cause}} {{alteration}} of hard tissues of the tooth. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of two different concentrations of <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> (10 % and 35 %) on human enamel microhardness. Material and Methods. The study was conducted on ten extracted teeth divided into two groups. The teeth were sectioned in mesiodistal direction using the diamond disc in order to obtain experimental and control samples. First group was exposed to the concentration of 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> (Opalescence gel, Ultradent. Pro, US) at the time intervals that corresponded to home night bleaching technique of vital teeth. Second group was exposed to high concentration of 35 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> (Opalescence Quick, Ultradent. Pro, US) at the time intervals that corresponded to the professional bleaching technique of vital teeth. Control samples were exposed to artificial saliva for the same time intervals as the samples from experimental group. Knoop’s test for enamel microhardness was performed at the beginning, after the first phase of therapy, after the therapy was completed and after three weeks of exposure to artificial saliva. The results were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student t-test. Results. The microhardness values of enamel samples treated with 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> decreased after 8 hours (261 khn) and three weeks of treatment (222 khn) but increased after three weeks of exposure to artificial saliva (263 khn). The decrease of enamel microhardness of the samples treated with 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> was not statistically significant. The microhardness values of enamel samples treated with 35 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> were reduced after 1 hour (235 khn) and 3 hours (190 khn) and increased after three weeks of exposure to artificial saliva (241 khn). Microhardness of enamel treated with 35 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> was significantly decreased in experimental samples compared to controls. Conclusion. <b>Carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> in concentration of 35 % leads to the significant decrease in enamel microhardness compared to 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of various Opalescence tooth-whitening products on enamel. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enamel blocks were exposed to Opalescence PF 10 % <b>Carbamide</b> <b>Peroxide</b> (n = 10), Opalescence PF 20 % <b>Carbamide</b> <b>Peroxide</b> (n = 10), Opalescence Trèswhite Supreme 10 % Hydrogen Peroxide (n = 10) and Opalescence Quick PF 45 % <b>Carbamide</b> <b>Peroxide</b> (n = 10) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The control group was enamel blocks (n = 10) kept in artificial saliva. The values were obtained before exposure and after the 14 -days treatment period. Enamel blocks were kept in saliva between treatments. Indent marks on enamel blocks were examined using the scanning electron microscope for treatment effects. RESULTS: All four different Opalescence products damaged enamel. The most damage was done when treated {{for a long period}} (112 hours). SEM images also showed damage to enamel by all 4 products.

40|$|Background: Limited {{evidence}} exists regarding {{the effect of}} <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> and casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) on composite-enamel bonding. Microshear bond strengths, using either a total-etch or self-etching adhesive, to enamel treated with <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> and/or CPP-ACP were investigated. Materials and methods: Twenty-six extracted human third molars were sectioned into four parts, each being allocated {{into one of the}} four groups (n= 26) : bleach (Polanight, 16 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide),</b> CPP-ACP (GC Tooth Mousse), bleach and then CPP-ACP, or untreated (control). The surfaces were bonded with a total-etch bonding system (Single Bond) or a self-etching primer system (Clearfil SE Bond) and tested using a microshear test. Results: A significant difference in bond strength was found between bonding systems. SE Bond showed the highest bond strength to untreated enamel (p< 0. 05). The microshear bond strength of SE Bond decreased when the enamel was treated with <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide,</b> CPP-ACP or both (p< 0. 05). Only combined use of <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> and CPP-ACP significantly affected microshear bond strength with Single Bond.

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} is aimed at {{evaluating}} the long-term color stability of endodontically-treated teeth which {{have been subjected to}} in-office and the walking bleach treatment with <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide.</b> Methods and Materials: Sixty patients in need of dental bleaching following endodontic treatment were selected for the study. After endodontic treatment, the patients were subjected to in-office dental bleaching and the walking bleach technique with 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide.</b> A color shade score was given to each patient before and after the bleaching procedures and at the final follow-up. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: At the 21 -year follow-up, 42 out of 60 patients were eligible for the retrospective evaluation. Failures were noticed in 9 patients showing a color mismatch of two or more shades in comparison with adjacent teeth. A success rate of 78. 6 % was reported. The statistical analyses showed significant differences between Baseline vs End of Treatment and Baseline vs Follow-Up (p 0. 05). The endodontic treatment failed in 3 patients. Discussion: The null hypothesis was rejected. The bleaching effect of <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> in non vital teeth proved to be stable and reliable in the long-term. The clinical observations performed in the present investigation are consistent with the results of previous studies. No chronic sensitivity was observed in any patient. Although no root resorption was observed, few root fractures were noticed and the detrimental effects of peroxide on dental hard tissue may have contributed to such failures. Conclusions: <b>Carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> proved to be an effective dental whitening agent in the long-term for endodontically-treated teeth with both in-office and walking bleach techniques. Moreover, the vertical condensation technique of warm guttapercha {{did not seem to be}} affected by the intra-coronal application of <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide.</b> Clinical Significance: <b>Carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> can be considered a safe and effective bleaching agent to maintain color stability of non vital teeth in the long term...|$|E

A total of 40 bovine incisors were divided into four groups (n= 10) according to the bleaching agent used: 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> only; a blend of 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> and a CPP-ACP paste; 16 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> only; and a blend of 16 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> and a CPP-ACP paste. During the 14 -day bleaching regimen, the samples were stored in artificial saliva. The Vickers microhardness and color of the teeth were assessed at baseline (T 0) and immediately after the bleaching regimen (T 14) using a microhardness tester and a spectrophotometer, respectively. The degree of color change was determined by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclariage (CIE) L*a*b* system (ΔE, ΔL*, Δa*, and Δb*) and Vita shade guide parameters. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance and the Tukey test (p< 0. 05). The teeth that were bleached with a blend of peroxide (10 % or 16 %) and the CPP-ACP paste presented increased microhardness values at T 14 compared with T 0, whereas the samples that were bleached with peroxide only did not show any differences in their microhardness values.

40|$|Background: The tooth {{whitening}} substances for extrinsic use {{that are available}} in Brazil contain hydrogen peroxide or <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide.</b> Several studies have attributed the appearance of lesions in the enamel morphology, including hypersensitivity, to these substances. Such lesions justify fluoride therapy and application of infrared lasers, among other procedures. However, {{there is no consensus}} among researchers regarding the relevance of the severity of lesions detected on the tooth surface. Objectives: The present study was carried out with an aim of evaluating in vitro the effects of the hydrogen peroxide, <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> and sodium bicarbonate contained in dentifrice formulations, on human tooth enamel. Materials and Methods: After darkening process in laboratory, human premolars were brushed using dentifrice containing the two whitening substances (Rembrandt - <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> and Mentadent - hydrogen peroxide) and the abrasive product (Colgate - sodium bicarbonate). The degree of specimen staining before and after this procedure was determined using spectrophotometry. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to obtain images, which were analyzed to show the nature of the lesions that appeared on the enamel surface. Results: The effectiveness of the whitening caused by hydrogen peroxide and <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> and the abrasion caused by bicarbonate were confirmed, given that the treated test pieces returned to their original coloration. Based on SEM, evaluation of the enamel surfaces subjected to the test products showed that different types of morphologic lesions of varying severity appeared.

Materials and Methods: In this in-vitro study, 76 cubic specimens (4 mm 3 × 4 mm 3 × 3 mm 3) were fabricated from 4 aesthetic A 3 -shade restorative materials. These materials consisted of two composite resins and two glass ionomers. The specimens made from each material were treated with the following surface treatments: 1. Control group: The specimens were not bleached and were stored in normal saline. Group 2. Fluoridated 20 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> gel, treated 3 h a day for 4 weeks. Group 3. Treated 1 h a day with fluoride-less 22 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> for two weeks. From each group, three other specimens were selected to be evaluated in terms of changes in surface roughness, under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: In this study, fluoridated 20 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> gel increased the microhardness of the four aesthetic restorative materials.

Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, a total of 75 disc shaped specimens were prepared from Z 100 &nbsp; composite resin (3 M) and randomly divided into three groups with following treatment designs: group 1, 370 C distilled water, group 2, 15 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide,</b> 6 hours/day for 3 weeks, group 3, 35 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> 30 minutes/week for 3 weeks. The microhardness (Vickers hardness) of samples was measured using Shimadzu set on three different points of each sample. 8 samples of each group were selected randomly to be assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for probable changes in surface topography. Data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and Duncan tests with p&lt; 0. 05 as the level of significance. Results: 15 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> group had the maximum amount of microhardness (84. 59 &plusmn; 1. 87) and 35 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> group had the minimum (76. 14 &plusmn; 1. 77). Only the difference between home bleaching and control group was not statistically significant (P= 0. 24). The SEM assessing revealed no changes in surface topography. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, in-office bleaching may decrease the microhardness of composite resin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} tooth whitening with 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> on the surface ultramorphology of three dental restorative materials. Materials and methodsThree materials were tested: (1) a reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol cement (IRM® Powder Zinc Oxide Eugenol, Dentsply, Konstanz, Germany), (2) a high copper amalgam with spherical particles (Ventura Finest®, Madespa SA, Toledo, Spain) and (3) a nanohybrid composite (EvoCeram Tetric®, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein). 6 specimens of each material (N= 18) were inserted into silicone molds with circular cavities of 10 mm× 2 mm. 3 specimens of each material were randomly assigned into the whitening or control groups. In the whitening group, the specimens were exposed to a 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> gel (Opalescence® PF 10 %, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) for 14 consecutive days, 6 h per day. In the control group, the specimens were exposed to distilled water. After 14 days stored at 37 °C, all specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. ResultsThe specimens exposed to <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> revealed an irregular surface, with cracks and pores. Specimens from all control groups showed a smooth surface. ConclusionThe 10 % <b>carbamide</b> <b>peroxide</b> gel may cause changes in surface ultramorphology of the materials tested: reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol cement, amalgam and composite...|$|E
