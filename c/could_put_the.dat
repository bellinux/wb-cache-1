5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants. Service {{was a natural}} part of the cycle of life, and it was common for young people to spend some years away from home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> earnings towards their dowry.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{experiences}} with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict {{the behavior of the}} arriving whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.|$|E
5|$|In June Metternich left Vienna to {{personally}} handle negotiations at Gitschin in Bohemia. When he arrived he benefitted from the hospitality of Princess Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan and began {{an affair with}} her that lasted several months. No other mistress ever achieved such influence over Metternich as Wilhelmine, and {{he would continue to}} write to her after their separation. Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Hugues-Bernard Maret remained elusive, though Metternich did manage to discuss the state of affairs with the Tsar on 18–19 June at Opotschna. In talks which would later be ratified as the Reichenbach Convention they agreed on general peace demands and set out a process by which Austria could enter the war on the Coalition side. Shortly afterwards Metternich was invited to join Napoleon at Dresden, where he <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> terms directly. Though no reliable record of their meeting on 26 June 1813 exists, it seems it was a stormy but effective meeting. Agreement was finally reached as Metternich was about to leave: peace talks would start in Prague in July and run until 20 August. In agreeing to this Metternich had ignored the Reichenbach Convention, and this angered Austria's Coalition allies. The Conference of Prague would never properly meet, since Napoleon gave his representatives Armand Caulaincourt and the Count of Narbonne insufficient powers to negotiate. At the informal discussions held in lieu of the conference, Caulaincourt implied that Napoleon would not negotiate until an allied army threatened France itself. This convinced Metternich, and, after an ultimatum Metternich issued to France went unheeded, Austria declared war on 12 August.|$|E

25|$|Hoping to find {{a leader}} that <b>could</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> team back on track, New York hired Larry Brown to coach the team. Brown, who idolized the team during his childhood, was well {{regarded}} for his coaching abilities and his arrival brought a sense of hope to the franchise. Hoping to find the next Patrick Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during the season. Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, Chicago's general manager. The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks 2006 first round pick, {{and the right to}} swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks. Isiah Thomas did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With a bloated payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that season, at 23–59. The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the move}} to a Friday evening timeslot, Enterprise was going up {{directly}} against episodes of Stargate SG-1 on the Sci Fi Channel.

However, the highest ratings of the seasons were received for the series finale, [...] "These Are The Voyages...", which gained ratings of 2.4/4 percent. Rick Berman credited the falling ratings received by the series to a variety of elements saying, [...] "The show certainly had a great start.

500|$|Originally, {{after winning}} a round, contestants spent their {{winnings}} on prizes that were presented onstage.

However, a contestant would lose any money on account by landing on Bankrupt or failing to claim it by not winning subsequent rounds. The shopping element was eliminated from the syndicated version on the episode that aired October 5, 1987, both to speed up gameplay and to alleviate the taxes paid by contestants. However, the network version continued to use the shopping element until the end of its first NBC run on June 30, 1989.|$|E

[...] He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009. In an interview for Blues & Soul, Saadiq elaborated on the album's impact on his career: [...] "before that record – after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! and Lucy Pearl – most people had thought 'Oh well, he's a producer now.
