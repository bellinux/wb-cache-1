5|$|A typical year in {{the life}} of a Senate {{legislation}} <b>committee</b> <b>will</b> see it conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates). In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. A references <b>committee</b> <b>will</b> conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate.

5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The <b>committee</b> <b>will</b> make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A <b>committee</b> <b>will</b> often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} the 2011 England riots both {{immediate}} and long-term {{have been the subject}} of media and academic debate.

25|$|The Select <b>Committee</b> <b>will</b> scrutinise the bill, {{going over}} it {{in more detail}} than can be {{achieved}} by the whole membership of the House. The public can also make submissions to Select Committees, offering support, criticism, or merely comments. Written submissions from the public to the committee are normally due two months after the bill's first reading. Submitters can opt to also give an oral submission, which are heard by the committee in Wellington, and numbers permitting, Auckland and Christchurch. The Select Committee stage is seen as increasingly important today — in the past, the governing party generally dominated Select Committees, making the process something of a rubber stamp, but in the multi-party environment there is significant scope for real debate. Select Committees frequently recommend changes to bills, with prompts for change coming from the MPs on the Committee, officials who advise the Committee, and members of the public. When a majority of the Committee is satisfied with the bill, the <b>Committee</b> <b>will</b> report back to the House on it. Unless Parliament grants an extension, the time limit for Select Committee deliberations is six months or whatever deadline was set by the House when the bill was referred.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between congressional committees, information, and gatekeeping power. It shows that the power to obstruct legislation increases {{the amount of information}} transmitted by committees in equilibrium.

The only <b>committees</b> that <b>will</b> be discharged are those which cannot credibly transmit any information to the parent body...|$|R
