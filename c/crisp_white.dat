500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the song}} premiered on June 12, 2012. The video was directed by BB GUN (consisting of Maxim Bohichik and Alex Bergman). The video integrates footage from Usher's performance during the Off-Broadway show Fuerza Bruta, where he first performed the song. In the video Usher takes the role of The Running Man, the character he portrayed during his performance. Dressed in a white suit, the video opens with Usher strolling and singing to the song. Throughout the video inter-cuts to a woman swimming above the ceiling. Entering the chorus, Usher begins to run, which he then instantly changes into different attire for the second verse, with the video inter-cutting to both the women and Usher in his original white suit. Following the second chorus, Usher starts dancing with the women. He then begins to sprint, ending the video with him bursting through a brick wall, showing clips of the Fuerza Bruta performance with Usher running across the venue's conveyor belt. Rap-Up reviewed the music video positively, writing that Usher [...] "makes all the right moves in the exhilarating video [...] Mr. Raymond shows off his fancy footwork in a <b>crisp</b> <b>white</b> suit as he glides across the stage during his show with Broadway's Fuerza Bruta." ...|$|E
2500|$|The subways of New York {{are also}} {{occasional}} venues for beauty pageants and guerrilla theater. The MTA's annual Miss Subways contest ran from 1941 to 1976 {{and again in}} 2004 (under the revised name [...] "Ms Subways"). Past Miss Subways winners include Eleanor Nash, an FBI clerk described by her poster that hung in subway cars in 1960 as [...] "young, beautiful and expert with a rifle." [...] The 2004 Ms Subways winner, Caroline Sanchez-Bernat, was an actress who {{played a role in}} Sunday Brunch 4. The 35-minute piece of performance art was a full enactment of a Sunday brunch — including <b>crisp</b> <b>white</b> tablecloth, spinach salad appetizer and attentive waiter in black tuxedo — performed aboard a southbound A train in 2000. With subway riders looking on, the actors chatted amiably about Christmas, exchanged gifts and signed for a package delivered by a United Parcel Service delivery man who entered the scene at the West 34th Street stop.|$|E
6000|$|It so fell out, as they started, that Graham {{found himself}} walking at Miss Staveley's side, {{to the great}} disgust, no doubt, {{of half a dozen}} other aspirants for that honour. [...] "I cannot help thinking," [...] he said, as they stepped briskly over the <b>crisp</b> <b>white</b> frost, [...] "that this Christmas-day of ours is a great mistake." ...|$|E
5000|$|Starting around 1940, Lichine and Schoonmaker {{promoted}} {{the idea that}} California producers should label their wines by the grape variety or varieties from which they were made. The standard practice among New World producers was to give their wines semi-generic labels. That is, they named them after the regions whose wines they resembled. For example, full-bodied red varieties might be labeled [...] "Burgundy", whereas <b>crisp</b> <b>whites</b> might be labeled [...] "Chablis".|$|R

6000|$|And how natural {{it was to}} get out! And how unnatural {{it seemed}} for a sober man to be plodding wearily along through miry roads, encountering the rude buffets of the wind and pelting of the rain, when there was a clean floor covered with <b>crisp</b> <b>white</b> sand, a well swept hearth, a blazing fire, a table {{decorated}} with white cloth, bright pewter flagons, and other tempting preparations for a well-cooked meal--when there were these things, and company disposed {{to make the most of}} them, all ready to his hand, and entreating him to enjoyment! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{dark eyes}} {{came from the}} father's side; Cecil had them, and very observing orbs they seemed to be, {{travelling}} about from one face to another, and into {{every corner of the}} room, scrutinizing every picture or piece of plate, and trying to see into the conservatory, which had a glass door opening {{from one end of the}} room. She was the youngest of the brides, and her features and form seemed hardly developed, nor had she attained the air of a matron; her fashionable dress of <b>crisp</b> <b>white</b> worked muslin with blue trimmings, and blue ribbons in her brown hair, only gave her the air of a young girl at her first party, in spite of her freedom from all shyness as she sat at the head of the table in contented self-possession, her little slender figure as upright as a perfect spine could make it.|$|E
60|$|Phineas went before, {{springing}} up the rocks like a goat, {{with the boy}} in his arms. Jim came second, bearing his trembling old mother over his shoulder, and George and Eliza brought up the rear. The party of horsemen {{came up to the}} fence, and, with mingled shouts and oaths, were dismounting, to prepare to follow them. A few moments' scrambling brought them {{to the top of the}} ledge; the path then passed between a narrow defile, where only one could walk at a time, till suddenly they came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth, and beyond which lay a pile of rocks, separate from the rest of the ledge, standing full thirty feet high, with its sides steep and perpendicular as those of a castle. Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat down the boy on a smooth, flat platform of <b>crisp</b> <b>white</b> moss, that covered the top of the rock.|$|E

The cold, <b>crisp</b> <b>whites</b> of prairie winters are unseen here. Instead, exotic blooms thrive, then wither and compost into t he rainforest floor. Torn leaves, misshapen branches and pods carrying the seeds of new life appear and disappear into this murky carpet as nature recycles itself, between the wet and dry of tropical seasons. I find beauty in this imperfection, but remain a stranger, looking for home.

40|$|Forecast {{accuracy}} {{of economic and}} financial processes is a popular measure for quantifying the risk in decision making. In this paper, we develop forecasting models based on statistical (stochastic) methods, sometimes called hard computing, and on a soft method using granular computing. We consider the {{accuracy of}} forecasting models as a measure for risk evaluation. It is found that the risk estimation process based on soft methods is simplified and less critical to the question whether the data is true <b>crisp</b> or <b>white</b> noise...|$|R
5000|$|The Ribeiro DO (which means [...] "river banks" [...] in Galician) {{is located}} along the Miño river and its tributaries. It {{received}} its DO status in 1957. In the 16th and 17th century, Ribeiro wine was often exported to England and Italy but suffered the same damages as Rías Baixas {{did during the}} phylloxera epidemic. However growers were quicker {{to turn away from}} the low quality hybrid plantings and back to the native Torrontés, Treixadura and Lado varieties. These grapes produce <b>crisp,</b> aromatic <b>white</b> wines. The area's red wine production is centered on the Garnacha Tintorera which produces dark colored but light bodied wines.|$|R

50|$|The film {{is unusual}} in that the sound and music were {{recorded}} before the film was shot, and does not match the visuals.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} statistical {{and machine}} learning methods for predicting different high frequency data sets. Firstly, {{in this paper}} we develop forecasting models based on the statistical (stochastic) methods, and on the soft methods using neural networks for the time series of daily exchange rates AUD currency against US dollar. Secondly, we evaluate statistical and machine learning methods for half-hourly 1 -step-ahead electricity demand prediction using Australian electricity data. To illustrate the forecasting performance of these approaches the learning aspects of RBF networks are presented. We also show that an RBF neural network trained by genetic algorithm can achieved better prediction result than classic one. It is also found that the risk estimation process based on soft methods is simplified and less critical to the question whether the data is true <b>crisp</b> or <b>white</b> noise.

5000|$|Viticulture {{has existed}} in the area {{since the time of}} the Romans. In 1866, during the Risorgimento, the region was united with Italy. In the 1970s, the white wines of the region began to receive {{international}} attention due to innovations in winemaking techniques that produced fresher, more vibrant white wines. In the 1980s, winemakers in the Colli Orientali del Friuli focused on increasing the quality of their red wine production. Following in the footsteps of the [...] "Super Tuscan" [...] producers, Friuli winemakers decided to produce red wines outside of DOC regulations under the vino da tavola designation.
