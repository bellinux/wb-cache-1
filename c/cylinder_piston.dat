25|$|VR {{designers}} {{wished to}} improve on aspects of the earlier S class design. These three-cylinder Pacifics, although capable of hauling heavy loads at high speed, had proved to be relatively maintenance-intensive, {{particularly with regard to}} the servicing of the valve gear and motion for their third (inside) cylinder. The Gresley conjugated valve gear, driven from the valve spindles of the outside <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> valves, was prone to heat expansion and wear, causing timing difficulties, and required dismantling and removal whenever the centre cylinder valve required service.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the brakes}} must be applied before {{recharging}} has been completed, a larger brake pipe reduction {{will be required}} in order to achieve the desired amount of braking effort, as the system is starting out at a lower point of equilibrium (lower overall pressure). If many brake pipe reductions are made in short succession ("fanning the brake" [...] in railroad slang), a point may be reached where car reservoir pressure will be severely depleted, resulting in substantially reduced brake <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> force, causing the brakes to fail. On a descending grade, the unfortunate result will be a runaway.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Time Ball {{consists}} of a cast iron <b>cylinder,</b> <b>piston,</b> rack and pinion lifting mechanism, safety lock, electric motor and ball. The cylinder is 30cm diameter and 3 m long. Approximately 7 litres of soapy water fills {{the bottom of the}} cylinder to act as a buffer for the piston. The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a bleeder valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a slide gear, which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|E
