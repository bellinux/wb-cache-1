50|$|In some cases, {{when the}} {{electronics}} {{of the trailer}} (especially the ABS sensors in the wheels) get wet, the brake pedal would not operate as normal, and even the slightest touch {{would result in a}} wheel-lock. There are problems with the calculation of the mileage available for the remaining fuel. Cases have been reported when the fuel has run out with the computer showing 25 more miles to go. Also, the statistics of average speed and fuel consumption are prone to failure when driving a digital tachograph truck without a driver card. This problem has now been solved by a software update from Mercedes. The Powershift transmission has also had a clutch kit/pressure plate failure issue with a recall in late 2009 some trucks have had further <b>clutch</b> <b>cylinder</b> failures with no remuneration from the manufacturer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} factors shaping electrorheological characteristics of a clutch. Dependencies on the torque transmitted by the output shaft of the clutch were determined for various rhelogical models. The {{main part of the}} work is devoted to rheological model-ling of the electrorheological <b>cylinder</b> <b>clutch.</b> The discussed rheological models include: visco-plastic and visco-elasto-plastic Bingham models, visco-elasto-plastic Gamota-Filisco, and Li models. The research stand and possible tests are described. The remaining part of the work discus-ses electrorheological characteristics of the ER fluid. Moreover, directions for further research on the laboratory stand designed and made by the author were formulated.

40|$|Nickel alloys have wide-spread {{applications}} in mechanical, tribological and corrosion components such as <b>clutches,</b> <b>cylinder</b> liners, pistons in {{the automotive industry}} and marine components in sea water owing to its relative corrosion resistant & good thermal conductivity. The presence of silicon results in reduction of the co-efficient of thermal expansion of nickel & produces an alloy with good casting machining & corrosion characteristics. Further it is reported that addition of silica, improves the mechanical properties {{which in turn has}} profound influence on the mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of Nickel-SiO 2 alloys. Therefore an investigation in the present research will be made to fabricate and evaluate the microstructure, corrosion of chilled composites consisting of nickel matrix and fused SiO 2 particles as the reinforcement (size 40 - 150 µm) in the matrix. The reinforcement being added ranges from 3 to 12 wt. % in steps of 3 %. The resulting composites cast in moulds containing metallic and non metallic chill block (MS, SiC & Cu) were tested for their microstructure and corrosion behaviors. The main objective of the present research is to obtain fine grain Ni/SiO 2 chilled sound composite having very good mechanical and corrosion properties...|$|R
50|$|Between April 1973 and August 1973, Ford Australia built 250 XA Falcon GTs {{fitted with}} the RPO 83 package, 130 of these being sedans and 120 being hardtops. RPO 83 {{comprised}} three variations {{from the standard}} XA Falcon GT, these being of a Holley 780 carburettor, 2.25 inch exhaust headers and a <b>clutch</b> slave <b>cylinder</b> hydraulic pipe heat shield. Pricing and external appearance did not vary from the standard models. The 2.25 inch exhaust headers were subsequently homologated for the XA Falcon GT for Group C Touring Car racing, including the 1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000.|$|R
50|$|Guererro slowed, and nursed his {{car back}} to the pits. Under the caution flag, the pit crew worked to replace the nosecone, and got Guerrero back on to the track, albeit a lap down. It was not {{immediately}} discovered at the time, but striking the tire had damaged the <b>clutch</b> slave <b>cylinder,</b> which was located in the nose. Fluid had begun to leak from the cylinder, which would ultimately render the clutch inoperable. At speed, use of the clutch was unnecessary, but exiting the pits would pose increasing difficulty.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the light car range, the Rapier's front {{suspension}} was re-engineered to replace the half king pin on each side of the car with a sealed for life ball joint. All other suspension joints became either sealed for life or were rubber bushed thereby eliminating every grease point on the car. Gearing was adjusted overall to compensate for the smaller wheels and the front brake discs were reduced in size so that they would fit inside the wheels. A brake servo became standard and the spring and damper settings were adjusted to give a softer ride. A new diaphragm clutch and new <b>clutch</b> master <b>cylinder</b> brought lighter and more progressive clutch operation.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} were oriented on {{two high}} flow, high modulus fiber-glass reinforced nylon 6 (HMG series) grades for automotive and other industrial applications requiring high stiffness and high strength. These materials combined the following improved technological (injection molding, vibration welding, etc.) and mechanical performance properties such as greater dimensional stability, higher short-term (strength and stiffness) and long-term (fatigue and creep). The current and possible applications of these plastics includes auto mirror housing brackets, clutch pedals, <b>clutch</b> master <b>cylinders,</b> ski bindings, steering wheels, levers, auto seat frames, door handles and door lock mechanisms. In Part I of this paper, we are presenting results of reinforcement analysis with {{the influence of}} level of loading and geometrical parameters of used fiber-glass.

50|$|The P1 {{class engines}} were {{initially}} equipped with two-cylinder boosters {{attached to the}} trailing axle. These were engaged using a Westinghouse pump mounted on the boiler to engage the <b>cylinder</b> <b>clutch.</b> These had a tractive effort of 8,500 lbf kN when used, increasing the tractive effort of the locomotive from 38,500 to 47,000 lbf kN. It was intended by Gresley these boosters {{would be used to}} assist the locomotive while starting and topping the banks over which they travelled.|$|R
5000|$|The next upgrade was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper 'S'), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, to a permanently affixed, folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. Separate brake and <b>clutch</b> master <b>cylinders</b> were fitted, as car manufacturers' thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of smog pumps and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time reversing lamps were made a standard fitment and the cars' electrical system was switched to negative earth and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.|$|R

ABSTRACT: The report of investigation of the wear behaviour of aluminium alloy samples used in the floating calliper of master <b>cylinder</b> <b>clutch</b> or brake is presented in this paper. As-received commercial aluminium alloy sample sourced from automobile hydraulic brake cylinder calliper was melted in electric furnace under a controlled atmosphere, and sand cast at pouring temperature range of 700 - 800 oC into rod of 300 mm long by 30 mm diameter. A wear jig {{was used to determine}} the wear resistance of the aluminium samples with and without the use of hydraulic fluid. The microstructures and surface of the as-received and cast specimen were examined under high resolution microscope to assess the effects of wear with and without hydraulic oil. It was observed that the aluminium sample wears faster in the absent of hydraulic fluid and was reduced to a bearable minimum when hydraulic fluid was applied. The results obtained are presented in figures showing the wear rates and weight loss of the aluminium samples with respect to the wear cycle, from which models equations are derived. The test results show that eutectic structured cast aluminium alloy behaves relatively better than the as-received aluminium alloy specimen in oil. It is significant that the oil functions as lubricant on the alloy under test, hence the common deteriorations experience from the cast alloy under service must have aggravated from the chemical adulterations in the oil wherewith a thin film of more wear and chemical resistance would bring effective and significant wear and corrosio...|$|R
