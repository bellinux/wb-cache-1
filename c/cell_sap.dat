40|$|SLAM (signaling {{lymphocyte}} activation molecule) -associated protein (SAP) is a Src homology 2 (SH 2) domain-containing adaptor {{expressed in}} T cells and natural killer cells. Its {{essential role in}} immune responses is underscored by the recent finding that mutations in SAP result in a rare but fatal X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP). Although SAP is known to associate with SLAM-family receptors, the exact molecular mechanism by which SAP regulates lymphocyte signaling remains elusive. We here report that in T <b>cells,</b> <b>SAP</b> associates with the PAK-interacting exchange factor (PIX), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specific for Rac/Cdc 42 GTPases. Moreover, SAP, PIX, and an activated form of Cdc 42 form a complex in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that the SAP-PIX interaction is specific and is mediated by the C-terminal region of the SAP SH 2 domain and the PIX SH 3 domain. We further show that SAP {{is required for the}} recruitment of PIX to the SLAM-family receptors. Interestingly, overexpression of SAP, but not its homolog EAT- 2, leads to a synergistic activation of nuclear factor of activating T cells (NFAT) in combination with a calcium signal in T cells. This SAP-mediated activation appears to be receptor-dependent and can be blocked by a dominant negative form of PIX.

We observed normal germinal center development, long-lived plasma cell development, and Ab responses in SLAM/ mice after a viral infection (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus). In a separate series of experiments, we show that SAP is absolutely required in CD 4 T cells to drive germinal center development, and that requirement does not depend on SAP-Fyn interactions, because CD 4 T <b>cells</b> expressing <b>SAP</b> R 78 A are capable of supporting normal germinal center development.

Ethylene glycol, a permeant osmoticum, had little effect on PD, showing that the PD was sensitive to turgor, not to solute potential per se. For S 1 and S 2, the PD was less negative for turgor potentials lower than 0. 1 MPa or greater than 0. 3 MPa. S 3 samples exhibited a different turgor dependence, with a sharp optimum of the negativity of the PD at 0. 3 MPa. The data are consistent with the proposal that the proton pump acts as a transducer of the osmotic conditions.

40|$|Why {{preserve}} bamboos? Bamboos are {{a natural}} material and under natural conditions will gradually decay. If {{they are used}} as structural components {{they will need to}} be replaced after a period of time. The costs of this may prove prohibitive and the status of the bamboo will need constant monitoring to determine when it needs to be replaced. Preserving bamboos extends their life, reduces costs in the long run and improves safety of the structures they are used to form. What are sap displacement preservation methods? Sap displacement methods replace the sap in the vessels of a fresh bamboo culm with preservative. The culms are then left to stand for two weeks in order that the preservative can diffuse into the surrounding tissues and the preserving salts can be fixed in the <b>cells.</b> <b>Sap</b> displacement can be done by using natural capillary action or by one of a small range of simple pressurised techniques. What is the role of a sap displacement preservation unit in rural development? The unit itself offers employment opportunities to its employees and to many people in its forward and backward linkages. The unit can only treat freshly harvested bamboos and so a source of bamboos near to the unit is required. Local bamboo plantations can be established to supply the unit and create further income generating opportunities. Bamboos can be intercropped with food plants and the plantations can thereby increase the food security of the rural people that manage them. How do I establish a sap displacement unit? A sap displacement preservation unit can be established very cheaply. The only requirements are a supply of freshly harvested bamboos, labour and information from the secondary processors of their requirements. If a pressurised unit is to be established then a source of energy for the compressor will be needed. A pressurised unit capable of treating 50 bamboos per day can be established for USD $ 500, including a compressor, and non-pressurised units can be established for considerably less. Preserving bamboos extends their life, reduces costs in the long run and improves safety of the structures they are used to for...|$|R
40|$|Boron (B) is an {{essential}} microelement for higher plants, and its deficiency is widespread {{around the world and}} constrains the productivity of both agriculture and forestry. In the last decades, accumulating studies on model or herbaceous plants have contributed greatly {{to our understanding of the}} complex network of B-deficiency responses and mechanisms for tolerance. In woody plants, however, only a few studies have been conducted and they are not well synthesised. Trees have a larger body size, longer lifespan and more B reserves than do herbaceous plants, indicating that woody species might undergo long-term or mild B deficiency more commonly and that a more complicated B reserves must accordingly be developed to cope with B deficiency. In addition, the highly heterozygous genetic background of tree species suggests that they may have a more complicated mechanism of response and tolerance to B deficiency than do model plants. B-deficient trees usually exhibit two key visible symptoms: depression of growing points (root tip, bud, flower, and young leaf) and deformity of organs (root, shoot, leaf, and fruit). These symptoms may be ascribed to B functioning in the cell wall and membrane, and B deficiency results in damage to vascular tissues and the suppression of both B and water transport. B deficiency also affects metabolic processes, such as increased lignin and phenol, and decreased leaf photosynthesis. These negative effects will influence the quality and quantity of wood, fruit and other agricultural products. B efficiency probably originates from a combined effect of three processes: B uptake, B translocation and retranslocation, and B utilization. Root morphology and mycorrhiza can affect the B uptake efficiency of trees. During B translocation from the root to shoot, differences in B concentration between root <b>cell</b> <b>saps</b> and xylem exudates, as well as water use efficiency, may play key roles in tolerance to B deficiency. In addition, B retranslocation efficiency primarily depends on the ability of xylem-to-phloem transfer and the variety and amount of cis-diol groups. The B requirement for cell construction seems to determine the B use efficiency in trees. Therefore, our review aims to provide an update on th...|$|R
40|$|Development of the rodent {{somatosensory}} cortex is well characterised and involves activity-dependent mechanisms that occur {{during the first}} postnatal week. Glutamate is a key neurotransmitter responsible for signalling events that result in formation of cortical barrels - aggregates of cells in the cortex corresponding to whiskers on the face pad. The molecular mechanisms that occur downstream of glutamate signalling are not fully understood and data here contributes to the unveiling {{of some of these}} mechanisms. Transgenic mice with deletions of genes that encode members of the post-synaptic complex associated with NMDARs were used to understand the role of individual genes in the formation of barrels. SynGAP, a ras GTPase activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the ERK-MAPK pathway downstream of NMDARs is required for the formation of barrels and data here agrees with other findings that the ras GAP NF 1 has a similar role. Examination of RICS, a RhoGAP and Dusp 6 - a phosphatase that inactivates ERK reveals that neither are necessary for the formation of barrels. This finding adds to previous data postulating that barrels form in an ERK-independent manner (Watson et al., 2006, Barnett et al., 2006). MAGUKs are important scaffolding molecules in the PSD and bind NMDARs to downstream signalling molecules such as SynGAP. Two of these MAGUKs SAP 102 and PSD- 95 have roles in hippocampal plasticity, and learning and memory and Sap 102 mutations result in a form of X-linked human retardation (Tarpey et al., 2004). Deletion of either gene does not cause defects in the development of barrels, perhaps due to compensation mechanisms already described in hippocampus (Vickers et al., 2006 Cuthbert et al., 2007). Double knockout mice die by P 3 and analysis of all other mutants revealed a defect in the formation of barrels and segregation of TCAs in Sap 102 -/y Psd- 95 +/-. Surprisingly this defect was not seen in Sap 102 +/- Psd- 95 -/- mice, agreeing with previous findings that SAP 102 is better able to compensate for loss of PSD- 95 (is up-regulated) than PSD- 95 is for SAP 102. An explanation for this effect may lie with the fact that Sap 102 is X-linked and therefore females that are heterozygote for Sap 102 are mosaic with a population of <b>cells</b> expressing <b>SAP</b> 102 and a population not expressing SAP 102. Using β-Galactosidase antibody to label one population of cells, female mice that had two populations of cells were examined. In these mice one population of <b>cells</b> were <b>Sap</b> 102 -Psd- 95 +/-, and did not previously segregate into normal barrels and the other population were Sap 102 +Psd- 95 +/- and should segregate normally. Both populations of cells segregated normally, indicating that the <b>cells</b> expressing <b>SAP</b> 102 were rescuing the <b>cells</b> not expressing <b>SAP</b> 102 by a cell non-autonomous mechanism. The final part of this thesis focuses on the role of glutamate-dependent signalling pathways in the regulation of CSPGs- key extracellular matrix proteoglycans that regulate the termination of the sensitive period. Analysis of 3 overlapping but distinct subsets of chondroitin-sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) reveals that expression of each of the three is different throughout development. After 2 - 3 weeks perineuronal nets (PNNs) labelled with Cat- 315 and Cat- 316 are visible and locate to specific regions within the cortical barrel-field. To determine whether the formation of PNNs is regulated by proteins involved in glutamate signalling, expression of the three CSPG subsets was analysed in mice with barrel defects due to mutations of Plcβ 1, Mglur 5, Syngap and Prkar 2 b. Interestingly, Prkar 2 b mutant adults but no other mutants have reduced Cat- 315 -PNNs, indicating that PKARIIβ regulates pathways that lead to formation of Cat- 315 -PNNs in adulthood. Cat- 315 has previously been found to be regulated in the cortex of visually deprived cats and the cortex of whisker-trimmed mice, indicating that specific subsets of CSPGs are regulated by neuronal activity. Molecular pathways that lead to expression of Cat- 315 positive PNNs involve PKARIIβ and the formation of PNNs may be an important step in the plasticity of circuits in barrels. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an important part of molecular signalling downstream of glutamate enabling barrels to form is played by molecules that maintain structure inside the synapse and outside the cell.
