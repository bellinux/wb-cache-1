25|$|An {{intermediate}} {{arachidonic acid}} is created from diacylglycerol via phospholipase-A2, then brought {{to either the}} <b>cyclooxygenase</b> pathway or the lipoxygenase pathway. The <b>cyclooxygenase</b> pathway produces thromboxane, prostacyclin and prostaglandin D, E and F. Alternatively, the lipoxygenase enzyme pathway is active in leukocytes and in macrophages and synthesizes leukotrienes.|$|E
25|$|If arachidonate is {{acted upon}} by a {{lipoxygenase}} instead of <b>cyclooxygenase,</b> Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids and leukotrienes are formed. They also act as local hormones.|$|E

50|$|COX-2 {{expression}} {{was found in}} human idiopathic epiretinal membranes. <b>Cyclooxygenases</b> blocking by lornoxicam in acute stage of inflammation reduced the frequency of membrane formation by 43% in the dispase model of PVR and by 31% in the concanavalin one. Lornoxicam not only normalized the expression of <b>cyclooxygenases</b> in both models of PVR, but also neutralized the changes of the retina and the choroid thickness caused by the injection of pro-inflammatory agents. These facts underline the importance of <b>cyclooxygenases</b> and prostaglandins {{in the development of}} PVR.|$|R
5000|$|Eicosanoids - hormones {{derive from}} lipids such as arachidonic acid, lipoxins and prostaglandins. These hormones are {{produced}} by <b>cyclooxygenases</b> and lipoxygenases {{and there are many}} drugs that include the NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen which effect the activity of the <b>cyclooxygenases</b> and inhibit the formation of these eicosanoid hormones.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cyclooxygenases</b> (particularily Cox- 2) are {{involved}} in carcinogenesis and metastatic cancer progression. The expression profiles of the <b>cyclooxygenases</b> and the roles they play in established tumours of similar stage remains unclear. We report that Cox- 1 and Cox- 2 expression is highly variable in Dukes' C tumours, and changes in Cox- 1 expression may be of importance...|$|R
25|$|Competitive inhibitionDGLA and EPA {{compete with}} AA {{for access to}} the <b>cyclooxygenase</b> and {{lipoxygenase}} enzymes. So the presence of DGLA and EPA in tissues lowers the output of AA's eicosanoids.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic action {{is thought to be}} inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of <b>cyclooxygenase</b> (COX). It also appears to exhibit bacteriostatic activity by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|A {{history of}} heartburn, {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (GERD) {{and use of}} certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for peptic ulcer. Medicines associated with peptic ulcer include NSAIDs (non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs) that inhibit <b>cyclooxygenase,</b> and most glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone and prednisolone).|$|E

We studied conserved residues of 7, 8 -LDS, which participate in <b>cyclooxygenases</b> for heme binding (His residues), hydrogen abstraction (Tyr), positioning (Tyr, Trp), and ionic binding of substrates (Arg). Site-directed mutagenesis abolished 8 R-dioxygenase activities with {{exception of the}} putative distal histidine (His 203 Gln) and a tyrosine residue important for hydrogen bonding and substrate positioning (Tyr 329 Phe). The results demonstrate structural similarities between 7, 8 -LDS and <b>cyclooxygenases...</b>|$|R

25|$|Indometacin is a nonselective {{inhibitor}} of <b>cyclooxygenase</b> (COX) 1 and 2, {{enzymes that}} participate in prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins are hormone-like molecules normally {{found in the}} body, {{where they have a}} wide variety of effects, some of which lead to pain, fever, and inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{commonly used}} as a prescription medication to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling from inflammation. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, endogenous signaling molecules known to cause these symptoms. It does this by inhibiting <b>cyclooxygenase,</b> an enzyme that catalyzes the production of prostaglandins.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid works {{through several}} {{different}} pathways. It produces its anti-inflammatory effects via suppressing {{the activity of}} <b>cyclooxygenase</b> (COX), an enzyme {{that is responsible for}} the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as the prostaglandins. It does this not by direct inhibition of COX like most other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but instead by suppression of the expression of the enzyme through a mechanism not yet understood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyclooxygenases</b> are {{enzymes that}} {{take part in}} a complex biosynthetic cascade that results in the {{conversion}} of polyunsaturated fatty acids to prostaglandins and thromboxane(s).|$|R
50|$|<b>Cyclooxygenases</b> ("COX") are {{enzymes that}} {{generate}} prostanoids, including thromboxane and prostaglandins such as prostacyclin. Aspirin and ibuprofen exert their effects through inhibition of COX.|$|R
2500|$|Prostaglandins are {{produced}} following the sequential oxigenation of arachidonic acid, DGLA or EPA by <b>cyclooxygenases</b> (COX-1 and COX-2) and terminal prostaglandin synthases. The classic dogma is as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{phospholipase}} C {{plays an}} important role in the inflammation pathway. The binding of agonists such as thrombin, epinephrine, or collagen, to platelet surface receptors can trigger the activation of phospholipase C to catalyze the release of arachidonic acid from two major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine. Arachidonic acid can then go on into the <b>cyclooxygenase</b> pathway (producing prostoglandins (PGE1, PGE2, PGF2), prostacyclins (PGI2), or thromboxanes (TXA2)), and the lipoxygenase pathway (producing leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4)).|$|E
25|$|Psychoactive {{drugs are}} often {{prescribed}} to manage pain. The subjective experience of pain is primarily regulated by endogenous opioid peptides. Thus, pain {{can often be}} managed using psychoactives that operate on this neurotransmitter system, also known as opioid receptor agonists. This class of drugs can be highly addictive, and includes opiate narcotics, like morphine and codeine. NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are also analgesics. These agents also reduce eicosanoid-mediated inflammation by inhibiting the enzyme <b>cyclooxygenase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{major cause}} {{is the use}} of NSAIDs, such as {{ibuprofen}} and aspirin. The gastric mucosa protects itself from gastric acid with a layer of mucus, the secretion of which is stimulated by certain prostaglandins. NSAIDs block the function of <b>cyclooxygenase</b> 1 (COX-1), which is essential for the production of these prostaglandins. COX-2 selective anti-inflammatories (such as celecoxib or the since withdrawn rofecoxib) preferentially inhibit COX-2, which is less essential in the gastric mucosa, and roughly halve the risk of NSAID-related gastric ulceration.|$|E
50|$|Increased {{expression}} of <b>cyclooxygenases</b> {{and their potential}} involvement in the progression of various human cancers have been described. Some {{studies suggest that the}} TXA2 downstream metabolite of these <b>cyclooxygenases</b> along with its TP receptor contribute to mediating this progression. TP activation stimulates tumor cell proliferation, migration, neovascularization, invasiveness, and metastasis in animal models, animal and human cell models, and/or human tissue samples in cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, colon, brain, and bladder. These findings, while suggestive, need translational studies to determine their relevancy to the cited human cancers.|$|R
25|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs are inhibitors of the <b>cyclooxygenases.</b> In the kidney, this {{inhibition}} results in decreased PGE2 concentration causing {{a reduction in}} blood flow. Because {{blood flow to the}} kidney first reaches the renal cortex (outside) and then the renal medulla (inside), the deeper structures of the kidney are most sensitive to decreased blood flow. Thus the innermost structures of the kidney, known as the renal papillae, are especially dependent on prostaglandin synthesis to maintain adequate blood flow. Inhibition of <b>cyclooxygenases</b> therefore rather selectively damages the renal papillae, increasing the risk of renal papillary necrosis.|$|R
50|$|Prostaglandins {{are formed}} through {{oxidation}} of arachidonic acid by <b>cyclooxygenases</b> and other prostaglandin synthases. There are currently nine known G-protein coupled receptors (eicosanoid receptors) that largely mediate prostaglandin physiology (although some prostaglandins activate nuclear receptors, see below).|$|R
25|$|Marked {{differences}} exist among NSAIDs in their selective inhibition {{of the two}} subtypes of <b>cyclooxygenase,</b> COX-1 and COX-2. Much pharmaceutical drug design has attempted to focus on selective COX-2 inhibition {{as a way to}} minimize the gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs such as aspirin. In practice, use of some COX-2 inhibitors with their adverse effects has led to massive numbers of patient family lawsuits alleging wrongful death by heart attack, yet other significantly COX-selective NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, have been well tolerated by most of the population.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandin (PGD2) is {{the primary}} cause of the {{flushing}} reaction, with serotonin appearing to have a secondary role in this reaction. The effect is mediated by prostaglandin E2 and D2 due to GPR109A activation of epidermal Langerhans cells and keratinocytes. Langerhans cells use <b>cyclooxygenase</b> type 1 (COX-1) for PGE2 production and are more responsible for acute flushing, while keratinocytes are COX-2 dependent and are in active continued vasodilation. Flushing was often thought to involve histamine, but histamine has been shown not {{to be involved in the}} reaction.|$|E
25|$|Some drugs used {{to treat}} {{inflammation}} have the unwanted side effect of suppressing normal platelet function. These are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Aspirin irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and hence normal hemostasis. The resulting platelets are unable to produce new <b>cyclooxygenase</b> {{because they have no}} DNA. Normal platelet function will not return until the use of aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. Ibuprofen, another NSAID, does not have such a long duration effect, with platelet function usually returning within 24 hours, and taking ibuprofen before aspirin prevents the irreversible effects of aspirin.|$|E
40|$|The immune {{response}} of the CNS is a defense mechanism activated upon injury to initiate repair mechanisms while chronic over-activation of the CNS immune system (termed neuroinflammation) may exacerbate injury. The latter is implicated {{in a variety of}} neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, HIV dementia and prion diseases. <b>Cyclooxygenases</b> (COX - 1 and COX- 2), which are key enzymes in the conversion of arachidonic acid into bioactive prostanoids, {{play a central role in}} the inflammatory cascade. J 2 prostaglandins are endogenous toxic products of <b>cyclooxygenases,</b> and because their levels are significantly increased upon brain injury, they are actively involved in neuronal dysfunction induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli. In this review, we highlight the mechanisms by which J 2 prostaglandins (1) exert their actions, (2) potentially contribute to the transition from acute to chronic inflammation and to the spreading of neuropathology, (3) disturb the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and mitochondrial function, and (4) contribute to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and demyelination in Krabbe disease. We conclude by discussing the therapeutic potential of targeting the J 2 prostaglandin pathway to prevent/delay neurodegeneration associated with neuroinflammation. In this context, we suggest a shift from the traditional view that <b>cyclooxygenases</b> are the most appropriate targets to treat neuroinflammation, to the notion that J 2 prostaglandin pathways and other neurotoxic prostaglandins downstream from <b>cyclooxygenases,</b> would offer significant benefits as more effective therapeutic targets to treat chronic neurodegenerative diseases, while minimizing adverse side effects...|$|R
50|$|Currently {{there is}} a large number of enzymes known to {{interact}} with transition state analogs, most of which have been designed with the intention of inhibiting the target enzyme. Examples include HIV-1 protease, racemases, Î²-lactamases, metalloproteinases, <b>cyclooxygenases</b> and many others.|$|R
40|$|Prostaglandins are {{important}} mediators of bone repair, and <b>cyclooxygenases</b> {{are required for}} prostaglandin production. Data from animal studies suggest that both non-specific and specific inhibitors of <b>cyclooxygenases</b> impair fracture healing but that {{this is due to}} the inhibition of COX- 2 and not COX- 1. Although these data raise concerns about the use of COX- 2 -specific inhibitors as antiinflammatory or anti-analgesic drugs in patients undergoing bone repair, clinical reports have been inconclusive. Because animal data suggest that the effects of COX- 2 inhibitors are both dosedependent and reversible, in the absence of scientifically sound clinical evidence it is suggested that physicians consider short-term administration or other drugs in the management of these patients...|$|R
25|$|The prostaglandins are {{synthesized}} in {{the cell}} membrane by the cleavage of arachidonate from the phospholipids {{that make up the}} membrane. This is catalyzed either by phospholipase A2 acting directly on a membrane phospholipid, or by a lipase acting on DAG (diacyl-glycerol). The arachidonate is then acted upon by the <b>cyclooxygenase</b> component of prostaglandin synthase. This forms a cyclopentane ring in roughly the middle of the fatty acid chain. The reaction also adds 4 oxygen atoms derived from two molecules of O2. The resulting molecule is prostaglandin G2 which is converted by the hydroperoxidase component of the enzyme complex into prostaglandin H2. This highly unstable compound is rapidly transformed into other prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxanes. These are then released into the interstitial fluids surrounding the cells that have manufactured the eicosanoid hormone.|$|E
25|$|In current research, the {{significant}} relationship between immune factors and hangover severity is the most convincing among all factors so far studied. An imbalance of the immune system, in particular of cytokine metabolism {{has been identified as}} playing a role in the pathophysiology of the hangover state. Especially the hangover symptoms nausea, headache, and fatigue have been suggested to be mediated by changes in the immune system. The concentration of several cytokines {{have been found to be}} significantly increased in the blood after alcohol consumption. These include interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFNÎ³) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). Some pharmacological studies such as on tolfenamic acid and Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) have also indicated an involvement of the immune system. These studies suggest that the presence and severity of hangover symptoms can probably be reduced by administration of a <b>cyclooxygenase</b> inhibitor such as aspirin or ibuprofen.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, aspirin, while {{inhibiting}} {{the ability}} of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins, converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming <b>cyclooxygenase</b> to a lipoxygenase-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirin-triggered lipoxins, aspirin-triggered resolvins, and aspirin-triggered maresins. [...] These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from <b>cyclooxygenase</b> to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cyclooxygenases</b> (COX), {{which are}} {{responsible}} for forming prostanoids in the human body, are the target of many NSAID pain relievers. Inhibition of COX leads to reduced inflammation and has an analgesic effect, due to the lowered level of prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cyclooxygenases</b> (COXs) {{catalyze}} the rate-limiting step in {{the production}} of prostaglandins, bioactive compounds involved in processes such as fever and sensitivity to pain, and are the target of aspirin-like drugs.

5000|$|Harpagoside {{is widely}} used as a folk remedy to treat rheumatic complaints. Subsequent {{studies have shown that}} {{extracts}} have good- anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. An assessment of 15 studies on the pharmacology of harpagoside concluded that daily doses of at least 50 mg are effective for treating arthritis. Clinical studies have confirmed an increase in pain relief for 60% of patients with an osteoarthritic hip or knee. Biochemical studies have elucidated the mechanism of action of pure harpagoside, showing that it moderately inhibited <b>cyclooxygenases</b> 1 and 2 of the arachidonic acid pathway ( [...] COX - 1/2) and overall nitric oxide production in human blood. COX 1 and 2 are key enzymes of the arachidonic acid pathway and {{it has been shown that}} inhibitors of theses <b>cyclooxygenases</b> have implications for treating rheumatoid arthritis.|$|R
