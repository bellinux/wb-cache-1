5|$|As a <b>case</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> disinformation, {{the authors}} {{describe}} journalist , whose publication in France was secretly financed by Soviet intelligence. Its contents were biased against the Western world {{in favor of}} the Soviet agenda, and had considerable impact on public opinion. In another example, the authors bring forth an analysis of the World Peace Council, which operated as a front organization for Soviet intelligence. They discuss its operations negatively impacting both NATO and the U.S. Shultz and Godson back up their analyses with interviews from two Soviet officials who had defected from their posts in Soviet intelligence, and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests.|$|E

With a citywide implementation, added benefits from the lowering smog-level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year.|$|E
