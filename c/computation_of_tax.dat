40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{preferential}} features for a simplified tax regime (STR) in the view of two important players in its application: chartered accountants and tax auditors. Portuguese Chartered Accountants (PCA) have a key role in recommending the STR to small firms and in its accounting and fiscal monitoring. Tax auditors, working for the Portuguese Tax Authority, control the regime´s application, and are also important agents in the STR´s functioning. A questionnaire was used as primary data collection method. Out of the 435 questionnaires considered valid, 315 were answered by PCA and 120 by tax auditors. Preferences for the STR´s design are the use of presumptive or indirect methods, specifically when the <b>computation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> to be paid is made on the basis of turnover and activity sector.

The basic structure of these models is similar to that of the AGE models used for the applications to the international trade analysis (multi-country models), although in this case further issues emerge: in particular the interaction among different levels of government and the interregional factors mobility. On the other hand, the construction of regional models poses the same methodological problems as those presented by AGE models designed for the applications to Fiscal Policy analysis, which are in general single-country models.

This area of research did not appear to have been previously studies in Sri-Lanka context and in this respect the research represent an original contribution while research have been conducted in Sri-Lanka. Tax evasion is said to occur when eligible taxpayers deliberately fail to comply with their tax obligations, which may cause serious damage to total tax revenue loss and create problems of the proper functioning of the public sector and threatening its capacity to finance the public expenses. Tax compliance means true reporting <b>of</b> all <b>tax</b> bases, correct <b>computation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> liability and timely filling and paying correct amount <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> on due.

40|$|Objective] Every year ZEW Mannheim computes {{measures}} of corporate effective taxation in Europe {{based on the}} Devereux/Griffith methodology. The measures aim at comprehensively reflecting and consistently comparing the effective corporate tax levels in the different member states. For the <b>computation</b> <b>of</b> the effective <b>tax</b> rates, assumptions on economic parameters {{have to be made}} - in particular on the values of the inflation and interest rate. Common assumptions on these variables are strictly necessary in order to compare effective levels of taxation across countries in a meaningful way. In some cases these assumptions could interact with the effects <b>of</b> specific <b>tax</b> parameters on the effective tax burdens. For example, capital allowances become less effective in reducing tax burdens in inflationary environments. As a consequence, countries with high capital allowances appear more attractive when inflation is low.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{theoretical}} framework for quantitative assessment <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> burdens on investments in physical, human and R&D capital in Russia. The modified and extended version of King–Fullerton model for <b>computation</b> <b>of</b> marginal effective <b>tax</b> rates on marginal hypothetical investments was used. Calculations performed show non-neutrality <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> treatment <b>of</b> investment across types of assets {{and types of}} financing. Debt financing receives preferential tax treatment, while the less favorable is financing through retained earnings. The most preferential treatment receives household investment in higher education. Combined tax and budget system as of now provide significant subsidies to "free of charge" education in state institutions and fairly small subsidies to "paid" higher education in commercial sector. "Subsidizing" effect shrinks rapidly with continuing commercialization of higher education. Calculated estimates <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> burdens on investment in physical capital {{are more or less}} compatible with those in the OECD countries. The less favorable tax treatment in Russia is on investment in R&D. Tax burdens are especially high for short-lived successful investment and almost prohibitively high for partially unsuccessful R&D investment projects. Such <b>tax</b> treatment <b>of</b> R&D investment contrasts sharply with practices of many OECD countries, which provide tax incentives to risky investment and where governments share risks with private investors. Simulations performed showed that certain adjustments in the Russian Tax Code could reduce the tax load on investment in risky R&D projects.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we visit the capital income {{taxation}} in Brazil {{to know whether}} {{and to what extent}} interest on net equity (INE) has an influence on tax neutrality, i. e., if it helps reducing debt financing advantage over equity. The paper also addresses the persistent Brazilian high interest rates influence on the cost of capital, especially for small and medium enterprises (SME), given that big companies are usually allowed to access low interest rates from BNDES, the National Public Development Bank in Brazil. Based on King and Fullerton methodology for <b>computation</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>tax</b> rates, this paper derives the pre-tax and post-tax rates of return on investment, the tax wedges and the correspondent effective tax rates in Brazil, comparing three sources of finance (debt, retained earnings and new equity) and three types of assets: machinery, buildings and inventories. Our simulations show that INE reduces the cost of capital for new equity by 40 % but it cannot offset the debt advantage. On the other hand, very high interest rates as found in Brazil make debt finance the worst option, forcing SME to finance themselves...|$|R

The work presented in this report updates for the year 2015 the analyses of the previous projects within the former Framework Contract TAXUD/ 2008 /CC/ 099 and the current Framework Contract TAXUD/ 2013 /CC/ 120. Following the methodology used in previous work, we apply the Devereux and Griffith framework to compute effective tax levels. The report considers primarily taxes on corporations in each country, but also includes analyses <b>of</b> personal <b>taxes</b> on investment and saving. It also considers both cross-border investment and investment by small and medium sized enterprises (SME). This report is organized as follows. Section A introduces the tax parameters for the period 1998 - 2015 covered by this report. These tax parameters form the basis <b>of</b> the <b>computations</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>tax</b> rates. Section B provides worked examples for several countries for {{a better understanding of}} the model. Section C then provides detailed results for domestic investment in all countries covered in this report. In addition to results focusing on the corporate level, this report comprehensively includes the analysis <b>of</b> personal <b>taxes</b> on investment and saving at the shareholder level for three different types of shareholders when calculating effective tax rates on domestic investment. Section D presents estimates for effective <b>tax</b> burdens <b>of</b> cross-border investment if all countries were either locations of investment or locations of the investor. Finally, Section E provides effective <b>tax</b> burdens <b>of</b> SMEs in selected countries. Please note that all results presented in this report refer to the legal situation as of 1 July 2015...|$|R
