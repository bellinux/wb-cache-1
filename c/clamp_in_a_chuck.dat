40|$|The model {{presented}} {{in the first part}} of this work is used here to estimate the diameter error in the most common turning operations. In fact, the diameter error is considered as a variable depending on the deflections of the tool, workpiece holder and workpiece, which are considered the main factors responsible for the machining accuracy. The proposed model has been applied to the three most common turning schemes related to workpiece fixturing, where the workpiece is <b>clamped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck,</b> or supported between two centers, or <b>clamped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> at the spindle and supported on a center at the tailstock. Some numerical examples have been computed using the proposed model to predict the diameter error along the workpiece and the cutting force along the workpiece axis, as well as the influence of the cutting force components on the error prediction. The results provide additional insight into error formation in the turning process. Finally, some experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the developed model. Good agreement has been obtained between numerical and experimental results. The proposed model represents a first step towards accuracy control in machining operations and, thus, towards optimization of the manufacturing process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} concerning a predictive compensation method which corrects for the error on the diameter caused by the deflection when machining a workpiece on a lathe. The deflection model which was formulated to predict the error on the diameter considers the smaller emerging diameter formed by the depth of cut as the tool tip moves along the workpiece, thus improving the accuracy with which the deflection can be predicted. The model also recognizes {{the fact that the}} total deflection undergoes an equilibrium search causing the final deflection to reach a smaller value than that which is obtained when using the methods described in literature. Furthermore, {{the way in which the}} workpiece is commonly supported in industrial practice, which is having one end rigidly <b>clamped</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> at the spindle while the other end is supported by its center at the tailstock, is included in the deflection analysis. The compensation method can be applied not only to uniform cylindrical bars but also to general shaped workpieces. However the latter must first be partitioned into segments forming a multidiameter shaft for the deflection analysis. Implementation of this predictive compensation method introduces the possibility of obtaining single pass machining with final pass accuracy...|$|R

2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just {{thread cutting}} when the context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external thread cutting, the piece can either be held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck</b> or mounted between two centers. With internal thread cutting, the piece is held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>chuck.</b> The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth of the thread.|$|R
