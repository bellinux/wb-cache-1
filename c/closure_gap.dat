40|$|Closure dams are {{structures}} {{that are used}} to close off basins, usually from the sea. A sand closure is the construction of a closure dam made out of sand. During the last stage of a sand closure, there is a <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> through which the tide forces a current with flow velocities up to five metres per second. The flow pattern that occurs during a sand closure is three-dimensional. Furthermore, the sediment transport does not reach an equilibrium due to the constantly changing flow conditions and gap geometry. During sand closures, large amounts of erosion occur. Because the main costs of a sand closure lie in the transportation of sand to the building site, {{it is important to know}} how much sand is needed for the sand closure and how much sand is loss during the closing process. The quantification of the sand loss still requires attention. The currently used models require calibration factors, which are not known beforehand, to give a reasonable prediction of the sand loss. A model that can be applied to any sand closure and does not require calibration factors is desirable. To achieve this, the different processes that occur during sand closures should be parameterized and need to be quantifiable by a model. In this study the important processes of a sand closure are identified. With the results of this study, the sand loss prediction can be improved by considering the processes that are expected to have the largest contributions to the sand loss. It was found that the amount of turbulence in the flow has a large impact on the erosion. There are two mechanisms that appear to have the largest impact on the erosion during a sand closure. The first mechanism is that during a sand closure, mixing layers originate from the heads of the dams. These have higher turbulence intensities than the main current, which causes strong vertical mixing, so the sediment particles are brought up higher into the water column. It was found that possibly, these higher turbulence intensities also lead to pick-up rates orders of magnitude larger than the ones predicted by the current pick-up equations, although it is not known if extrapolating the formula of the TKE method, designed for river flow, to higher turbulence intensities is justified. Because the magnitude of the turbulence intensities seems to have a large influence on the predicted erosion velocity, it may be important for the total erosion at the <b>closure</b> <b>gap.</b> The second mechanism is that the flow is contracted downstream of the <b>closure</b> <b>gap.</b> This increases the flow velocities of the main current. Unfortunately, it is unknown what the impact of these higher flow velocities is on the turbulence at the origin of the mixing layers. It is desirable to be able to model the important mechanisms that occur during sand closures in a numerical model. The contraction of the flow behind the <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> is already modelled by most two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical models. It is advised to look further into the pick-up rates of sediment at higher turbulence intensities. Since there is no satisfactory formulation for the pick-up of sediment that can be implemented into a numerical model directly and the erosion at the origin of mixing layers is found to be most influential, it is recommended to carry out a physical scale model to quantify the pick-up of sediments at the origin of a mixing layer. This will be the subject of a forthcoming MSc thesis. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Squeak and rattle (S&R) are two {{undesired}} {{phenomena that}} can affect the quality perception of cars. The main reason of S&R is the relative displacement between parts [1]. One mean to identify the critical area for S&R at Volvo Cars during the virtual phase is the E-line method. This method, which was presented in a SAE paper [2] 2012, calculates the relative displacement along a line/gap. The application of the method at Volvo Cars was shown in a Beta paper 2013 [3]. Relative displacement calculation along the closure gaps such as tailgate <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> is shown high sensitivity to damping value and sealing stiffness. Therefore, a correlation work in time domain has been performed to update the damping value and sealing stiffness. The test object is a body in white (BIW) including some assembly parts. The relative displacement along the <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> of tailgate is measured and simulated in different setups which results in updating the unknown parameters. The updated sealing stiffness value takes into account all three directions and the damping value is only valid for the BIW. Moreover, {{in order to increase}} the precision of the E-line method, a new principle to align measurement directions of the dynamic displacement with measurement directions of calculated geometrical variation has been developed. Geometrical variation or static displacement must be considered when assessing rattle because the minimum size of a gap is one of the essential parameters. Definition of measurement direction is based on a surface strip that is generated in the CAT (Computer Aided Tolerancing) tool RD&T. The combination of E-line with the surface strip shows a higher accuracy in the simulation method, which is presented in an industrial case-study. These enhancements improve the capability of relative displacement simulation significantly...|$|E

40|$|In {{the region}} of the Riau Islands of Indonesia fresh water {{scarcity}} is one of the challenges the local community is facing. In order to increase the catchment of fresh water the choice is made to turn Bintan Bay, part of the Riau Islands, into a fresh water reservoir. Hereby collecting the fresh water runoff from local rivers. It is however unknown where the reservoir, and thus dam, will be positioned and whether the closure can be constructed with sand. This thesis focusses on those two topics. Based on an investigation into the hydraulic boundary conditions six alternative dam locations are defined. To weigh the alternatives a preliminary cost-benefit analysis is carried out. The outcome of the analysis is that the alternative in which the whole bay is turned into a reservoir can be considered most favourable. However, underlying assumptions and simplifications need to be verified in order to assess the effects on the outcome of the analysis. One of these assumptions is that a sand closure is constructible for all alternatives. This implies that additional effort, in terms of the required capacity of the dredgers, and sand losses are not included. To investigate these assumptions a more detailed research is carried out into the sand closure. The principle of a sand closure is fairly straightforward: the supply of sand has to be larger than the losses due to erosion in the <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> to be able to close the dam. Since the sand losses are directly linked to the flow velocities in the <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> a one-dimensional flow model has been created. This shows that maximum flow velocities at Bintan are higher than the limit according to a rule of thumb provided in literature. Therefore, the closure seems difficult, if not impossible. However, since a spring-neap cycle is applied a worst case scenario is simulated where also the critical closure stage is during springtide. This can be considered an overestimation of reality since it is common practise to close during neap tide. By introducing a sediment transport function and a sand input, the <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> area is made time dependent. With this upgraded model, more realistic scenarios can be simulated where the critical closure phase is executed around neaptide. After optimizing, the maximal flow velocities showed a significant reduction while the production rate is high compared to other closures, but not unrealistic. The one-dimensional closure model has limitations in describing the flow velocities and erosion. Therefore, an additional two-dimensional model is set up in FINEL. The applied erosion function was already calibrated on the recent closures at the Maasvlakte 2, and is therefore regarded to provide more accurate results. Various simulations are conducted to recognise sensitivities and to identify the differences between the one- and two-dimensional models. The comparison shows that the original erosion function applied in the one-dimensional model indeed highly overestimates the sand losses. Because of this, new simulations are performed in the one-dimensional model with calibrations based on the MV 2 closures. A comparison shows that for the identical dredger capacities the sand losses are significantly reduced. Therefore, a successful closure proves to be achievable with half of the original production capacity. Since all computations are conducted for the most favourable alternative, a final comparison is conducted with the other alternatives. This results in the conclusion that solely the sand losses will not result in another alternative to become more favourable in the cost-benefit analysis. However, dredgers that can achieve the required production capacity should be available in the area. If not, other alternatives might be cheaper to execute since these can be closed with smaller dredger capacities and thus smaller vessels. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|For the LITFASS- 2003 {{experiment}} conducted through May and June 2003 in {{a heterogeneous}} landscape around the Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg of the German Meteorological Service, different aspects relevant {{to close the}} energy balance at the surface based on radiation, soil and turbulent flux measurements were investigated. The careful correction of the eddy-covariance data (and the comparison of all instruments including net radiometers) can reduce the residual of the energy balance closure, but still a significant <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> remains. The same result was found when carefully calculating the ground heat flux including all storage terms. The use of the ogive test to estimate the energy loss for long wavelengths showed an effect of up to 5 % on the residual. Finally, energy balance closure could not be achieved for the surface layer measurements in LITFASS- 2003. Recent findings of large-eddy simulations (LES) have shown organised turbulence structures in the lower boundary layer. With the application of LES and the calculation of the horizontally averaged fluxes of sensible and latent heat closure of the energy balance was possible for one selected day, when the LES was available. This result was supported by large aperture scintillometer measurements {{as well as by}} averaging of the eddy-covariance measurements over longer time periods up to ten hours.

40|$|Dams are an {{essential}} part of the Dutch flood defence works to protect the hinterland from flooding by the sea. Sand closures are the construction of closure dams with sand as the main building material. The rising and falling tide generates a current through the <b>closure</b> <b>gap,</b> which increases in strength as the gap becomes smaller. This current is quite strong and transports a significant amount of sand from the gap to areas where the current is weaker. The sand that is transported away from the <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> is called the sand loss. The changing tide and constantly moving sand grains result in a dynamic environment. This makes it difficult to estimate the total amount of sand that is necessary to close the dam. It is important to be able to assess the amount of sand loss accurately, because it could make the difference between needing an extra dredging vessel or not. The costs of these dredging vessels are about 1 million euro's a week; therefore, having an unnecessary vessel present due to very conservative sand loss predictions is costly. Laboratory experiments and a numerical model were used to investigate the morphology during bedload transport under a lateral expansion. A streamwise bar formed behind the tip of the lateral expansion for both the laboratory experiments and the numerical simulations. However, it was not possible to replicate the bedforms that occurred during the laboratory experiments with the numerical model. These bedforms are deemed to be important for the morphology during bedload transport. The numerical model was used to expand the research to suspended sediment transport by decreasing the grain size of the sediment. In the obtained morphological patterns, four areas are distinguished where the morphology was found to depend on the flow velocity and the degree of turbulence in the flow. It is expected that a variation of these patterns can be found during a sand closure, although these findings should be validated with a laboratory experiment or in situ measurements. Therefore, it is recommended to set up a laboratory experiment to investigate the morphology under a mixing layer for suspended sediment transport. Based on the results of the laboratory experiments and the numerical model, it is advised to look into the possibility to use the sand deposited as a streamwise bar during a sand closure as an additional borrow pit to aid the closure process, since it would lead to less sailing time for the dredging vessels. For the first stage of a sand closure, it is advised to use a two-dimensional model that incorporates a bedload transport formula to model the sediment transport. It is important to use a parametrization of the bedforms that occur during bedload transport. For the final stage of a sand closure, which is the most critical phase due to high flow velocities, high degree of turbulence and time restriction, it is advised to use a three-dimensional model with a pick-up equation that takes the influence of turbulence on the grains into account, such as the pick-up formula of Okayasu et al...|$|E

This paper evaluates uncertainties in these measurements with a single instrument, by comparing the independent results from nine different institutes during the international GRAMINAE integrated field experiment over agricultural grassland near Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, Germany. The paper discusses uncertainties in measuring friction velocity, sensible and latent heat fluxes, canopy temperature and investigates the energy balance closure at this site. Although individual 15 -min flux calculations show a large variability between the instruments, when averaged over the campaign, fluxes agree within 2 % for momentum and 11 % for sensible heat. However, the spread in estimates of latent heat flux (?E) is larger, with standard deviations of averages of 18 %.

40|$|This final thesis report {{describes}} {{the results of}} the feasibility analysis to the closure of the Gulf of Khambhat done by Erik Broos and Kees Wiersema, from Delft University of Technology. The study started with site visits to both Gujarat and La Rance where interviews were held to obtain insight in the desires of concerned parties as the Government and private investors, followed by a design study to the innovative methods of closure. The closure of the Gulf of Khambhat in the state of Gujarat, India, is the largest closure of a tidal estuary in the world so far. It is part of the multi-purpose Kalpasar project. This project solves the two main problems in Gujarat: the shortage of (irrigation) water and the shortage of electricity. The closed Gulf will be divided into two reservoirs: a fresh water basin for irrigational purposes and a tidal basin for generation of electricity. Secondary aspects of the Kalpasar project are a shorter road connection and the possibilities of port development and land reclamation. The dam alignment runs south of the Narmada river, to ensure inflow of fresh water into the basin. The total dam length is about 60 km, 30 km through deep water, 30 km through shallow water. Constructing a dam in this Gulf is very difficult, as the tidal difference is extremely large. The average difference between high and low water is about 8 meters, while during spring tide the difference can be more than 10 meters. Together with a water depth of sometimes more than 30 meters below Mean Sea Level and a 30 km wide <b>closure</b> <b>gap,</b> it is clear that this is a project unlike any other. A dam of 30 km closed off the Zuiderzee in the Netherlands, and the Tidal Power Station in La Rance (France) has a tidal difference of 13 meters at spring tide, but the Gulf of Khambhat combines these two problems. Although several designs have been made, it has become clear that, to become feasible in India, the design should be 'cheap', fast to build and using local material as much as possible. To reduce the scale of the problem without losing total overview, the closure dam is split into smaller components. These components each have similar design problems, but on a smaller scale. Integrating these in a total design while making use of each alternative's advantages creates an innovative design where problems of one component are reduced by the advantages of another. Interviews during the visit to India learned that a tidal power facility {{was one of the most}} desired components. The main components are the tidal power facility (TPF), the spillway of the reservoir (Narmada spillway), the final <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> and the secondarydamsections. During an early stage the idea was born to incorporate the tidal power facility in the closure process. The tidal power facility requires a large orifice to fill and empty the tidal basin. This orifice proved to be very useful to reduce current velocities during final closure (from 8 rn/s to 6 rn/s). In fact, the tidal power plant is used as a sluice. It is consists of 45 concrete caissons, which are constructed in a construction dock and floated into position. This same concept is used for the Narmada spillway that is needed to regulate the reservoir level. As this placing takes place in an early phase of the project, the current velocities are low. For the closure of the final gap, between the tidal power facility and the Narmada Spillway, two alternatives have been developed. The first is a temporary railway bridge from where rock is dumped. The second is using sand-filled geotextile Superbags. Their analysis showed that the second one should be chosen. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The Penman-Monteith (PM) {{equation}} is a state-of-the-art modelling approach to simulate evapotranspiration (ET) at site and local scale. However, its practical application is often restricted by {{the availability and}} quality of required parameters. One of these parameters is the canopy conductance. Long term measurements of evapotranspiration by the eddy-covariance method provide an improved data basis to determine this parameter by inverse modelling. Because this approach may also include evaporation from the soil, not only the ‘actual’ canopy conductance but the whole surface conductance (gc) is addressed. Two full cycles of crop rotation with five different crop types (winter barley, winter rape seed, winter wheat, silage maize, and spring barley) have been continuously monitored for 10 years. These data {{form the basis for}} this study. As estimates of gc are obtained on basis of measurements, we investigated the impact of measurements uncertainties on obtained values of gc. Here, two different foci were inspected more in detail. Firstly, the effect of the energy balance <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> (EBCG) on obtained values of gc was analysed. Secondly, the common hydrological practice to use vegetation height (hc) to determine the period of highest plant activity (i. e., times with maximum gc concerning CO 2 -exchange and transpiration) was critically reviewed. The results showed that hc and gc do only agree {{at the beginning of the}} growing season but increasingly differ during the rest of the growing season. Thus, the utilisation of hc as a proxy to assess maximum gc (gc,max) can lead to inaccurate estimates of gc,max which in turn can cause serious shortcomings in simulated ET. The light use efficiency (LUE) is superior to hc as a proxy to determine periods with maximum gc. Based on this proxy, crop specific estimates of gc,maxcould be determined for the first (and the second) cycle of crop rotation: winter barley, 19. 2 [*]mm[*]s− 1 (16. 0 [*]mm[*]s− 1); winter rape seed, 12. 3 [*]mm[*]s− 1 (13. 1 [*]mm[*]s− 1); winter wheat, 16. 5 [*]mm[*]s− 1 (11. 2 [*]mm[*]s− 1); silage maize, 7. 4 [*]mm[*]s− 1 (8. 5 [*]mm[*]s− 1); and spring barley, 7. 0 [*]mm[*]s− 1 (6. 2 [*]mm[*]s− 1) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{area around}} Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces {{flooding}} and salt intrusion problems. Flooding problems {{are caused by}} intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and {{an investigation into the}} closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly semi-diurnal) mixed tide. Waves are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and discharge sluices will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations {{in the vicinity of the}} dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak subsoil is present, drainage in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the discharge sluices and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, cranes operating from pontoons or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of vertical and horizontal closure will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL - 5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the <b>closure</b> <b>gap.</b> The final dam profile in the <b>closure</b> <b>gap</b> will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3. 1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate. Student report for a Master Project.

40|$|Meeting {{the dual}} {{objectives}} of food security and ecosystem protection {{is a major}} challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To this end agricultural intensification is considered desirable, yet, there remain uncertainties regarding the impact of climate change on opportunities for agricultural intensification and the adequacy of intensification options given the rapid population growth. We quantify trade-offs between levels of yield <b>gap</b> <b>closure,</b> food availability and forest and woodland conservation under different scenarios. Each scenario {{is made up of}} a combination of variants of four parameters i. e. (1) climate change based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs); (2) population growth based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs); (3) cropland expansion with varying degrees of deforestation; and (4) different degrees of yield <b>gap</b> <b>closure.</b> We carry out these analyses for three major food crops, i. e. maize, cassava and yam, in Benin. Our analyses show that in most of the scenarios, the required levels of yield <b>gap</b> <b>closures</b> required to maintain the current levels of food availability can be achieved by 2050 by maintaining the average rate of yield increases recorded over the past two and half decades in addition to the current cropping intensity. However, yields will have to increase at a faster rate than has been recorded over the past two and half decades in order to achieve the required levels of yield <b>gap</b> <b>closures</b> by 2100. Our analyses also show that without the stated levels of yield <b>gap</b> <b>closure,</b> the areas under maize, cassava and yam cultivation will have to increase by 95 %, 102 % and 250 % respectively {{in order to maintain the}} current levels of per capita food availability. Our study shows that food security outcomes and forest and woodland conservation goals in Benin and likely the larger SSA region are inextricably linked together and require holistic management strategies that considers trade-offs and co-benefits. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} crimping techniques in stapes surgery for otosclerosis patients measured by hearing outcomes on pure-tone audiometry. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. METHODS A systematic search was conducted. Studies comparing the effect of different crimping methods on pure-tone audiometric results in patients undergoing stapes surgery for otosclerosis were included. Relevance and risk of bias were assessed. Absolute risks and risk differences, means and mean differences, and 95 % confidence intervals were extracted or calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes, which were air-bone <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> to 10 dB or less, mean postoperative air-bone gap, and postoperative sensorineural hearing loss. RESULTS Twenty-two studies with moderate or high risk of bias were included for data extraction. Air-bone <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> to 10 dB or less was assessed in 17 studies and mean postoperative air-bone gap in 20 studies. The hearing outcomes did not consistently favor one crimping method. However, the differences that were statistically significant were consistently in favor of heat crimping over manual and no crimping (difference in air-bone <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> to 10 dB or less ranged between 22 % and 42 % in these studies and difference in mean postoperative air-bone gap between 2. 8 dB and 7. 4 dB) and in favor of manual crimping over no crimping (30 % difference in air-bone <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> to 10 dB or less and difference in mean postoperative air-bone gap between 2. 6 dB and 6. 0 dB).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To prospectively {{evaluate}} hearing {{outcomes in}} patients with osteogenesis imperfecta undergoing primary stapes surgery and to isolate prognostic factors for success. STUDY DESIGN: A nonrandomized, open, prospective case series. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-five consecutive patients who underwent 32 primary stapedotomies for osteogenesis imperfecta with evidence of stapes fixation and available postoperative pure-tone audiometry. INTERVENTION: Primary stapedotomy with vein graft interposition and reconstruction with a regular Teflon piston or bucket handle-type piston. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluation using conventional 4 -frequency (0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) audiometry. Air-conduction thresholds, bone-conduction thresholds, and air-bone gap were measured. The overall audiometric results {{as well as the}} results of audiometric evaluation at 3 months and at least 1 year after surgery were used. RESULTS: Overall, postoperative air-bone <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> to within 10 dB was achieved in 88 % of cases. Mean (standard deviation) gain in air-conduction threshold was 22 (9. 4) dB for the entire case series, and mean (standard deviation) air-bone <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> was 22 (9. 0) dB. Backward multivariate logistic regression showed that a model with preoperative air-bone <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> and intraoperatively established incus length accurately predicts success after primary stapes surgery.

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the stability of the}} thumb carpometacarpal joint following either complete removal of the trapezium(TR) or partial removal of the trapezium and of the base of the first metacarpal (PTR). We utilized local capsular tissue for interposition graft in both cases. Methods: Right and left fresh frozen cadaveric hands from the same donor were randomized so that TR or PTR repair was performed randomly on the right or left hand of each pair. In the TR group we removed the entire trapezium. In the PTR group we removed 2 mm of distal trapezium and 2 mm of thumb metacarpal base. For both repairs, we interposed a capsular tissue graft. The cadaveric hands were stabilized in a jig designed to apply load across six thumb tendons. We measured <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> distances prior to and following surgery and examined the joints by radiograph. Distances were measured using the Hough Transform model for measurement of abstract shapes. In order to detect a difference in gap distances between groups of 2 mm with an alpha error of 0. 05 and a beta error of 0. 20, 18 hands were required. Results: The designated surgery was successfully performed on all hands. At baseline, mean gap differences did not vary between groups under load, while after surgery the TR group had greater mean <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> when compared to the PTR group (4. 44 mm± 1. 70 vs 2. 42 mm± 1. 92, P<. 001). No bone on bone contact was noted in any of the operated joints. Discussion: We found that PTR of the thumb basal joint leads to less <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> of the joint when placed under simulated physiological load when compared to the complete removal of the trapezium. Clinical Relevance: Decreased <b>gap</b> <b>closure</b> under load may lead to preservation of thumb length and stability.

40|$|Suppression of gap-junctional {{communication}} {{by various}} protein kinases, growth factors, and oncogenes frequently correlates with enhanced mitogenesis. The oncogene v-src appears to cause acute <b>closure</b> of <b>gap</b> junction channels. Tyr 265 in the COOH-terminal tail of connexin 43 (Cx 43) has been implicated {{as a potential}} target of v-src, although v-src action has also been associated with changes in serine phosphorylation. We have investigated the mechanism of this acute regulation through mutagenesis of Cx 43 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocyte pairs. Truncations of the COOH-terminal domain led to an almost complete loss of response of Cx 43 to v-src, but this was restored by coexpression of the independent COOH-terminal polypeptide. This suggests a ball and chain gating mechanism, similar to the mechanism proposed for pH gating of Cx 43, and K+ channel inactivation. Surprisingly, we found that v-src mediated gating of Cx 43 did not require the tyrosine site, but did seem {{to depend on the}} presence of two potential SH 3 binding domains and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation sites within them. Further point mutagenesis and pharmacological studies in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells implicated MAP kinase in the gating response to v-src, while the stable binding of v-src to Cx 43 (in part mediated by SH 3 domains) did not correlate with its ability to mediate channel closure. This suggests a common link between <b>closure</b> of <b>gap</b> junctions by v-src and other mitogens, such as EGF and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) ...|$|R
