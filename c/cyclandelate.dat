50|$|<b>Cyclandelate</b> is a {{vasodilator}} used in {{the treatment}} of claudication, arteriosclerosis and Raynaud's disease. It is also used to treat nighttime leg cramps, and has been investigated for its effect against migraine. It is orally administered.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of <b>cyclandelate</b> on the {{abnormal}} permeability of the blood-retinal barrier which occurs in diabetic patients before any other lesions are apparent in the retina a well-controlled, double blind, and paired trial {{was carried out in}} 22 patients. The treatments were randomised. The permeability of the blood-retinal barrier was assessed by vitreous fluorophotometry. Each patient was examined before being involved in the trial and then another 3 times with 1 month's interval. The total duration of treatment was 3 months. The results showed that the breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier as evidenced by the degree of abnormal fluorescein penetration into the vitreous suffered a significant decrease in the diabetic patients treated with <b>cyclandelate</b> when compared to the patients submitted to placebo administration, and this effect is particularly apparent in the third month of treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} trimethylcyclohexanol (TMC) {{is closely}} related to menthol, the major component of a terpene preparation with known choleretic and cholelitholytic activity. Its effects on hepatic cholesterol synthesis and bile secretion were examined in the rat. In both acute and long-term dosing experiments TMC significantly inhibited hepatic S- 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. TMC was a potent choleretic, with detectable effects on bile flow at low doses, which also reduced coupling of cholesterol secretion to bile salt secretion. Single large doses tended to lower biliary cholesterol output and caused significant reduction in cholesterol saturation index after biliary diversion for 1 h. TMC and its widely prescribed ester <b>cyclandelate,</b> which is rapidly degraded to TMC after ingestion, should be investigated further as potential cholelitholytic treatments in man...|$|E
