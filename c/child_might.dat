5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first to stress the {{potential}} effect of loss of the mother on the developing child, but his concern was less with the actual experience of maternal care than with the anxiety the <b>child</b> <b>might</b> feel about the loss of the nourishing breast. As little of Freud's theory was based on actual observations of infants, little effort was made to consider the effects of real experiences of loss.|$|E
5|$|An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no {{pleasant}} {{assemblage of}} shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a <b>child</b> <b>might</b> {{play for a}} whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} {{is one of the}} most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a <b>child</b> <b>might</b> memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E

5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a <b>child</b> <b>might</b> see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E

25|$|Pier Angeli talked {{only once}} about the {{relationship}} in her later life in an interview, giving vivid descriptions of romantic meetings at the beach. Dean biographer John Howlett said these read like wishful fantasies, as Bast claims them to be. Joe Hyams, in his 1992 biography of Dean, claims that he visited Dean just as Angeli, then married to Damone, was leaving his home. Dean was crying and allegedly told Hyams she was pregnant, with Hyams concluding that Dean believed the <b>child</b> <b>might</b> be his.|$|E
25|$|Horney {{believed}} these stimuli {{to be less}} important, {{except for}} influences during childhood. Rather, she placed significant emphasis on parental indifference towards the child, believing that a child's perception of events, {{as opposed to the}} parent's intentions, is the key to understanding a person's neurosis. For instance, a <b>child</b> <b>might</b> feel a lack of warmth and affection should a parent make fun of the child's feelings. The parent may also casually neglect to fulfill promises, which in turn could have a detrimental effect on the child's mental state.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, a Swedish {{pharmaceutical}} company, Kabi, contracted {{with a number}} of hospitals in Europe to buy pituitary glands for the first commercial GH product, Crescormon. Although an additional source of GH was welcomed, Crescormon was greeted with ambivalence by pediatric endocrinologists in the United States. The first concern was that Kabi would begin to purchase pituitaries in the U.S., which would quickly undermine the NPA, which relied on a donation system like blood transfusion. As the number of autopsies continued to shrink, would pathologists sell pituitaries to a higher bidder? The second offense was Kabi-Pharmacia’s marketing campaign, which was directed at primary care physicians under the slogan, “Now, you determine the need,” implying that the services of a specialist were not needed for growth hormone treatment anymore and that any short <b>child</b> <b>might</b> be a candidate for treatment. Although the Crescormon controversy in the U.S. is long forgotten, Kabi’s pituitary purchase program continued to generate scandal in Europe as recently as 2000.|$|E

25|$|A Japanese school {{opened in}} Hawaii in 1893 and other Japanese schools for {{temporary}} settlers in North America followed. In the {{years prior to}} World War II, many second generation Japanese American attended the American school by day and the Japanese school in the evening to keep up their Japanese skill as well as English. Other first generation Japanese American parents were worried that their <b>child</b> <b>might</b> {{go through the same}} discrimination when going to school so they gave them the choice to either go back to Japan to be educated, or to stay in America with their parents and study both languages. Anti-Japanese sentiment during World War I resulted in public efforts to close Japanese-language schools. The 1927 Supreme Court case Farrington v. Tokushige protected the Japanese American community's right to have Japanese language private institutions. During the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II many Japanese schools were closed. After the war many Japanese schools reopened.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 September 2007, a brand-new gym bag was left {{in front of a}} shop lot in PJS 1/48, Petaling Jaya, {{discovered}} by the shop owner. It contained an unidentified child's naked body which was stuffed in a fetal position; police believed that she had been dead for more than six hours before the discovery. A cucumber and a brinjal was found stuffed inside her genitals and had caused her rectum to rupture. It was determined that bacterial infection had contributed to her death. At the time, Nurin Jazlin's parents were not able to identify the body as their daughter's due to the changes in her physical features; it was even suggested that the <b>child</b> <b>might</b> be a foreigner, as she lacked a scar which would be caused by the mandatory BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Her parents initially maintained hope that their daughter might be alive and were the victims of several prank calls from people claiming that Nurin was under their care. Later DNA tests conducted confirmed the body as Nurin Jazlin's.|$|E

Princess Victoria was then married to the Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, who was, at the time, fourth in line for the British throne. Lehzen and the entire household were moved to England in 1817 so that the new Duchess of Kent's <b>child</b> <b>might</b> be born there, strengthening the child's claim to the throne. The baby was a girl, christened [...] "Alexandrina Victoria" [...] after her mother and her godfather, Alexander I of Russia; she would grow up to be Queen Victoria.|$|E

500|$|Moffat was {{inspired}} by a crack in his son's bedroom wall and developed the idea into the main story arc for the fifth series. He thought that a <b>child</b> <b>might</b> think that something interesting lived inside such a crack. The hidden room in Amelia's house was based on Moffat's recurring childhood dream of a nonexistent hidden room in his grandmother's house. Moffat was keen to give the monster a giant eyeball, and commented that the Atraxi's design— a giant eyeball on a star— was easy for children to draw, as he used to draw Doctor Who monsters as a child. These aspects reflect Doctor Who [...] "domestically-scaled menace" [...] principle. Moffat wrote a scene that explained Prisoner Zero's crime, but cut it because he figured no one would care.|$|E
500|$|Until the Periclean law of {{citizenship}} in 451–50, any child with an Athenian father {{was considered an}} Athenian citizen. [...] Blok suggests that in this period it was also legally possible {{for a child to}} be considered an Athenian citizen through an Athenian mother, even with a non-citizen father, though she concedes that this would have been exceptional. [...] However, other historians disagree – K. R. Walters, for instance, explicitly dismisses the possibility, arguing that without a citizen father a child had no way of gaining entry into a deme or phratry. [...] Blok suggests that the <b>child</b> <b>might</b> have instead been enrolled in the deme and phratry of the maternal grandfather. [...] After the passage of Pericles' citizenship law, the importance of Athenian women seems to have increased, although they gained no legal rights.|$|E
500|$|While a 1905 {{article in}} the American Journal of Education {{recommended}} the story for children aged 8–10, [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] was not uniformly well received by critics. Toksvig wrote in 1934, [...] " [...] seems to the reviewer not only indelicate but indefensible, {{in so far as}} the <b>child</b> <b>might</b> absorb the false idea that great ladies must always be so terribly thin-skinned." [...] Tatar notes that the princess's sensitivity has been interpreted as poor manners rather than a manifestation of noble birth, a view said to be based on [...] "the cultural association between women's physical sensitivity and emotional sensitivity, specifically, the link between a woman reporting her physical experience of touch and negative images of women who are hypersensitive to physical conditions, who complain about trivialities, and who demand special treatment".|$|E
40|$|Given the {{restrictions}} on the subjects and objects that any given verb may take, {{it seems likely that}} <b>children</b> <b>might</b> learn verbs partly by exploiting statistical regularities in cooccurrences between verbs and noun phrases. Pronouns are the most common NPs in the speech that children hear. We demonstrate that pronouns systematically partition several important classes of verbs, and that a simple statistical learner can exploit these regularities to narrow the range of possible verbs that are consistent with an incomplete utterance. Taken together, these results suggest that <b>children</b> <b>might</b> use regularities in pronoun/verb co-occurrences to help learn verbs, though whether this is actually so remains a topic for further research. ...|$|R

500|$|During the 90s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto {{sought to}} write a {{one-shot}} chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version {{never made it to}} print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto [...] "simple and stupid", Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead conceiving of him as naïve with a dark side resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a <b>child</b> <b>might</b> do. Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: [...] "It's rather awkward to talk about what makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but I think his being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." [...] He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto not to feel defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a manga artist.|$|E
