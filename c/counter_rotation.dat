50|$|The three {{rotor blades}} were {{mounted on a}} ring {{assembly}} supported by bearings, allowing free rotation around the fuselage. At {{the end of each}} was a ramjet. To start the rotors spinning, simple rockets would have been used. As the speed increased, the flow of air would have been sufficient for the ramjets to work and the rockets would expire. The pitch of the blades could be varied with the effect of changing the speed and the lift produced. There was no reaction torque to cause a <b>counter</b> <b>rotation</b> of the fuselage, since the rotor blades were driven at their tips by the ramjets. Fuel was carried in the fuselage tanks, and was piped through the centre support ring and along the rotors to the jets.|$|E

5000|$|When used as {{an astronomical}} {{telescope}} mount, the biggest advantage of an alt-azimuth mount is the simplicity of its mechanical design. The primary disadvantage is its inability to follow astronomical objects {{in the night sky}} as the Earth spins on its axis. On the other hand, an equatorial mount only needs to be rotated about a single axis, at a constant rate, to follow the rotation of the night sky (diurnal motion). Altazimuth mounts need to be rotated about both axes at variable rates, achieved via microprocessor based two-axis drive systems, to track equatorial motion. This imparts an uneven rotation to the field of view that also has to be corrected via a microprocessor based <b>counter</b> <b>rotation</b> system. On smaller telescopes an equatorial platform is sometimes used to add a third [...] "polar axis" [...] to overcome these problems, providing an hour or more of motion in the direction of right ascension to allow for astronomical tracking. The design also does not allow for the use of mechanical setting circles to locate astronomical objects although modern digital setting circles have removed this shortcoming.|$|E

40|$|Dedicated {{experiments}} on TF ripple {{effects on the}} performance of tokamak plasmas have been carried out at JET. The TF ripple was found to {{have a profound effect on}} the plasma rotation. The central Mach number, M, defined as the ratio of the rotation velocity and the thermal velocity, was found to drop as a function of TF ripple amplitude (3) from an average value of M = 0. 40 - 0. 55 for operations at the standard JET ripple of 6 = 0. 08 % to M = 0. 25 - 0. 40 for 6 = 0. 5 % and M = 0. 1 - 0. 3 for delta = 1 %. TF ripple effects should be considered when estimating the plasma rotation in ITER. With standard co-current injection of neutral beam injection (NBI), plasmas were found to rotate in the co-current direction. However, for higher TF ripple amplitudes (delta similar to 1 %) an area of <b>counter</b> <b>rotation</b> developed at the edge of the plasma, while the core kept its co-rotation. The edge <b>counter</b> <b>rotation</b> was found to depend, besides on the TF ripple amplitude, on the edge temperature. The observed reduction of toroidal plasma rotation with increasing TF ripple could partly be explained by TF ripple induced losses of energetic ions, injected by NBI.

40|$|There is some {{evidence}} to support the notion that those with a history of tibial stress injuries exhibit a different loading pattern compared to an uninjured population [1]. Dynamic foot function during loading may be important in determining injury risk. At the rearfoot, greater peak eversion has been reported in female runners with a history of tibial stress fracture, compared to runners without previous bony injury [2]. However, a link between peak rearfoot eversion and risk of stress fracture was not found during a prospective study on military recruits [3]. Given these contrasting findings, peak rearfoot eversion is worthy of further investigation in injured populations. Forefoot motions during gait have not been investigated previously in those with a history of tibial stress injury. Significant motion occurs between the forefoot and rearfoot during early stance [4]. The foot has been suggested to act as a twisted plate model which produces <b>counter</b> <b>rotations</b> of the forefoot with respect to the rearfoot [5]. Rearfoot eversion is accompanied by both forefoot inversion [5] and forefoot abduction [6]. These motions result in separation at the joints of the midfoot.

Therefore, peak joint angles and velocities might be important in determining the loading response of the foot...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{have made}} two {{significant}} discoveries in our {{recent studies of}} quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) plasmas in DIII-D. First, {{we have found that}} we can control the edge pedestal density and pressure by altering the edge particle transport through changes in the edge toroidal rotation. This allows us to adjust the edge operating point to be close to, but below the ELM stability boundary, maintaining the ELM-free state while allowing up to a factor of two increase in edge pressure. The ELM boundary is significantly higher in more strongly shaped plasmas, which broadens the operating space available for QH-mode and leads to improved core performance. Second, {{for the first time on}} any tokamak, we have created QH-mode plasmas with strong edge co-rotation; previous QH-modes in all tokamaks had edge <b>counter</b> <b>rotation.</b> This result demonstrates that counter NBI and edge <b>counter</b> <b>rotation</b> are not essential conditions for QH-mode. Both these investigations benefited from the edge stability predictions based on peeling-ballooning mode theory. The broadening of the ELM-stable region with plasma shaping is predicted by that theory. The theory has also been extended to provide a model for the edge harmonic oscillation (EHO) that regulates edge transport in the QH-mode. Many of the features of that theory agree with the experimental results reported either previously or in the present paper. One notable example is the prediction that co-rotating QH-mode is possible provided sufficient shear in the edge rotation can be created. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} angular-momentum (AM) buildup in high-z massive galaxies using {{high-resolution}} cosmological simulations. The AM originates in co-planar streams of cold gas and merging galaxies tracing cosmic-web filaments, and it undergoes four phases of evolution. (I) Outside the halo virial radius (R_ v∼ 100 kpc), the elongated streams gain AM by tidal torques {{with a specific}} AM (sAM) ∼ 1. 7 times the dark-matter (DM) spin due to the gas' higher quadrupole moment. This AM is expressed as stream impact parameters, from ∼ 0. 3 R_ v to <b>counter</b> <b>rotation.</b> (II) In the outer halo, while the incoming DM mixes with the existing halo of lower sAM to a spin λ_ dm∼ 0. 04, the cold streams transport the AM to the inner halo such that their spin in the halo is ∼ 3 λ_ dm. (III) Near pericenter, the streams dissipate into an irregular rotating ring extending to ∼ 0. 3 R_ v and tilted relative to the inner disc. Torques exerted partly by the disc make the ring gas lose AM, spiral in, and settle into the disc within one orbit. The ring is observable with 30 % probability as a damped Lyman-α absorber. (IV) Within the disc, < 0. 1 R_ v, torques associated with violent disc instability drive AM out and baryons into a central bulge, while outflows remove low-spin gas, introducing certain sensitivity to feedback strength.
