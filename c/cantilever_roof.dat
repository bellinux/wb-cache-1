5|$|The {{replacement}} Main Stand, {{built in}} the early 1950s, used a propped <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof</b> design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' view of the pitch. Floodlights were installed, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in October 1956. By the early 1960s, a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, a new roof erected over the Kop, and the Tilton Road end covered for the first time. A scoreboard and clock were installed at the City end of the ground in memory of Birmingham and England player Jeff Hall, who died of polio during the 1958–59 season. In the 1970s, the Asda chain proposed to share {{the cost of a}} new stand as part of a supermarket development on land behind the Kop made vacant by slum clearance; in the face of opposition from commercial rivals, the proposal fell through.|$|E
5|$|With every {{subsequent}} improvement made to {{the ground}} since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the Taylor Report recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to all-seaters. This meant that £3–5million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof</b> to link {{with the rest of}} the ground had to be drastically altered. This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the front of the other three stands, not only increased the cost to around £10million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to an all-time low of around 44,000. In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive £1.4million of a possible £2million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Open ended <b>cantilevered</b> <b>roof</b> is {{different}} from enclosed roof, because its change of wind pressure distribution is complex, and the wind directions have great influence on it. Up to now, for {{the characteristics of the}} structure are very complicated, there is no appropriate wind load model can be used in design, especially under typhoon, a specific wind field. So it is necessary to study the characteristics of wind load on open ended <b>cantilevered</b> <b>roofs</b> of typhoon. Using FLUENT and Computational Fluid Dynamics technology, based on the conventional, Tianpu’s and Shiyuan’s turbulence intensity of the typhoon scenario, a numerical simulation of wind flow around a large-span <b>cantilevered</b> <b>roof</b> was carried out. Analyzed different wind angles of the wind pressure distribution regularities on large-span <b>cantilevered</b> <b>roof.</b> The paper determined the distribution of the surface wind pressure coefficient for the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>roofs,</b> as well as the wind-sensitive parts of structures...|$|R

5|$|The East Stand at Old Trafford was {{the second}} to be {{converted}} to a <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof,</b> following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the Leazes Park plan, the club proposed expansion of St James' Park to over 52,000 capacity, through major construction of a second tier over the Milburn Stand, Leazes End and adjoining corner, adding to a structure that was itself just four years old. After a refusal by the Secretary of State to take the application to an enquiry, permission was obtained in July 1998. For minimal disruption to seating capacity during construction, the project required 3-day shutdowns of work on home match days. 750 seats were lost during construction. During this expansion, executive boxes in the East Stand were demolished and replaced by seating blocks from pitch level up to the existing rows, in a mirror image of the Milburn Stand. The executive boxes were transferred to the new Milburn/Leazes complex, with more added to the Gallowgate End. During development, the additional stand and roof was constructed while leaving the existing <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof</b> intact until the last possible moment These developments increased capacity to approximately 52,143. The construction was completed in July 2000 at a cost of £42 million. Ironically, after opposition from local residents to the relocation plan, the expansion of the current ground at the Leazes End has further reduced the view of Leazes Park from Leazes Terrace, although this is now student accommodation.|$|E
500|$|... 1973 saw the {{completion}} of the roof around the circumference of the stadium, along with the addition of 5,500 seats to the Scoreboard End and the replacement of the old manual scoreboard with an electronic one in the north-east corner. Then, in 1975, a £3million expansion was begun, starting with the addition of the Executive Suite to the Main Stand. The suite's restaurant overlooked the pitch, but the view was still obstructed by the roof pillars. Therefore, in kind with the roofs of the United Road Stand and the Scoreboard End, the Main Stand roof was replaced with a cantilever design. The Executive Suite and <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof</b> were then extended to the full length of the stand, allowing for the relocation of the club offices from the south-east corner to the Main Stand. The south-east quadrant was then removed and replaced in 1985 with a seated section bringing the total seating capacity of the stadium to 25,686 (56,385 overall). The completion of the <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof</b> around three sides of the stadium allowed for the replacement of the old floodlight pylons, and the attachment of a row of floodlights around the inner rim of the roof in 1987.|$|E
500|$|The Cobbold Stand was {{constructed}} in 1971, and originally known as the Portman Stand.

500|$|The club's {{resurgence}} in success and increase in {{popularity in the}} early 1990s ensured that further development would have to occur. In 1995, the 30-year-old North Stand was demolished and work quickly began on a new stand, to be ready in time for Old Trafford to host three group games, a quarter-final and a semi-final at Euro 96. The club purchased the Trafford Park trading estate, a [...] site on the other site of United Road, for £9.2million in March 1995. Construction began in June 1995 and was completed by May 1996, with the first {{two of the three}} phases of the stand opening during the season. Designed by Atherden Fuller, with Hilstone Laurie as project and construction managers and Campbell Reith Hill as structural engineers, the new three-tiered stand cost a total of £18.65million to build and had a capacity of about 25,500, raising the capacity of the entire ground to more than 55,000. The <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof</b> would also be the largest in Europe, measuring [...] from the back wall to the front edge. Further success {{over the next few years}} guaranteed yet more development. First, a second tier was added to the East Stand. Opened in January 2000, the stadium's capacity was temporarily increased to about 61,000 until the opening of the West Stand's second tier, which added yet another 7,000seats, bringing the capacity to 68,217. It was now not only the biggest club stadium in England but the biggest in all of the United Kingdom. Old Trafford hosted its first major European final three years later, playing host to the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final between Milan and Juventus.|$|E
2500|$|Demolition of the North Stand {{began in}} 1960 and work began {{on a new}} £150,000 stand. The new stand, {{designed}} by local firm Husband & Co, was [...] in length. It was only the second stand in the country, after one at Scunthorpe United's Old Showground, to be built with a <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof</b> {{and the first to}} run the full length of the pitch. It was opened on 23 August 1961 by Stanley Rous, secretary of the Football Association. The 10,008 capacity all-seater stand almost doubled the seating capacity of Hillsborough from 9,000 to 16,000.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} North Stand {{was built}} between 1899 and 1903. It was unique at the time, {{as it had}} facilities {{for both men and}} women, and a slight semicircle which gave {{a good view of the}} pitch at any angle (though the supporting pillars did cause some obstruction). The area at the front of the stand was a grass bank until the early 1900s when it was made into a terrace. The stand was joined to the original North West Terrace until the late 1950s when the club decided to build a brand new stand. The current North Stand was opened in 1961. It is only the second football stand in Britain to have a <b>cantilever</b> <b>roof.</b> Hence some fans know it as [...] "the cantilever". It was the first stand in the country to run the entire length of the pitch. The first cantilever stand in English football at Scunthorpe United's Old Show Ground only covered the centre of the pitch. Following the formal opening of the stand in August 1961, a celebration match was played on 22 October 1961 when Wednesday met Santos of Brazil with their new star Pele in the team. Pele's goal helped Santos to a 4–2 win. When opened, the stand held 10,000 but the capacity has been reduced more recently to make room for spectators with disabilities and also to widen the exit aisles for safety.|$|E
