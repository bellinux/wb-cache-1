40|$|The {{increase}} in <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> such as radio transmitters and microprocessors in substations {{has led some}} utilities, including ours, {{to take a closer}} look at the sizing of the stationary batteries that operate those stations when commercial power is lost. Critical functions, such as tripping circuit breakers and conununicating information to dispatch centers, are placed on DC power. When station power is present, that DC power for the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> is supplied by the charger. When conunercial power is lost, however, the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> are carried by the batteries, which must also have the capacity to operate tripping mechanisms. IEEE Standard 485 I is widely accepted as the guideline for sizing of stationary batteries, and its application is discussed. Once a battery is placed in service, its maintenance, monitoring and periodic testing protocols are the next issues that the utility considers. Those practiced by this utility are discussed, including monitoring of the presence of DC power at certain critical points by SCADA equipment. The COIIlIOOnvoltages in electric utility substations are 48 and 120. 48 volt systems are more common, and are the preferred choice when allowable because of their smaller physical size and ease of maintenance. In some stations, however, the physical size of the station requires the higher voltage in order to lower the current and thus the voltage drop. Changes in equipment over the last twenty years have caused an {{increase in}} the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> placed on substation batteries. In the 1970 s, the <b>continuous</b> <b>loads</b> were generally these 2 : indicator lights on circuit breakers indicator lights on annunciator panel 0. 3 amps 0. 1 amp 0. 4 amp total The desire for remote control and monitoring of events in the substation, however, has caused additional equipment to be added to the load on the DC system.

5000|$|A [...] "farm radio" [...] {{modification}} (usually done at {{the point}} of sale) allowed an AA5 to run off 32 volt DC, commonly generated by farm windmills. With a relatively simple rewiring, the tube heaters could be put in series-parallel to run off 32 volts, with the three twelve-volt heaters in series and a 25L6, 35L6 or 43 in parallel; the tubes would still function with the heater voltage somewhat out of specification. If run from a 32-volt supply the radio had a substantially reduced performance because the B+ voltage would only be 32 volts compared with 160-170 volts when operated from AC. With 32 volts on the plate, the radio tended to be insensitive. Sometimes only the tube heater power was derived from a windmill, and dry batteries were retained for the plate voltage supply. The advantage was that the heaters were a high and <b>continuous</b> <b>load</b> on the battery, whereas the plate voltage battery drain was smaller and intermittent. Often a wet-cell rechargeable battery was used for tube heaters, recharged by a local garage or by exchanging with a vehicle battery.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} continuous Sisyphus cooling {{combined with}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>loading</b> mechanism used to efficiently slow down and accumulate atoms from a guided beam. While the loading itself {{is based on a}} single slowing step, applying a radio frequency field forces the atoms to repeat this step many times resulting in a so-called Sisyphus cooling.

We study the interplay of the <b>continuous</b> <b>loading</b> and simultaneous Sisyphus cooling in different density regimes. In the case of a low density flux we observe a relative gain in phase-space density of nine orders of magnitude.

The aim {{was to understand the}} evolution with time of power output under different duty cycles, in conditions close to practical implementation. Inexpensive ceramic membranes were compared to cation exchange membranes, under continuous flow and with a pre-digester connected. Results show that at the minute-scale, all the duty cycles investigated, produced 78 % higher power bursts from the MFCs (500 ÂµW) than when under <b>continuous</b> <b>loading</b> (280 ÂµW). These results were recorded from MFCs employing ceramic membranes, whereas the difference in performance for MFCs employing commercially available cation-exchange-membranes was insignificant.

The solution requires the downwash equation {{to be in}} the form of Cauchy integrals which can be interpreted as a vortex lattice with the positions of the vortices and control points dictated by the finite sum used to approximate the integrals involved. Lan's <b>continuous</b> <b>loading</b> method is employed for the chordwise integral since it properly accounts for the leading-edge singularity, Cauchy singularity, and Kutta condition. Unlike Lan, the spanwise <b>loading</b> is also <b>continuous</b> and the Cauchy singularity in the spanwise integral is also properly accounted for by using the midpoint trapezoidal rule and the theory of Chebyshev polynomials. This technique yields the exact classical solution to Prandtl's lifting-line equation.
