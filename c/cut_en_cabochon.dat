2500|$|A star {{sapphire}} {{is a type}} of sapphire that {{exhibits a}} star-like phenomenon known as asterism; red stones are known as [...] "star rubies". Star sapphires contain intersecting needle-like inclusions following the underlying crystal structure that causes the appearance of a six-rayed [...] "star"-shaped pattern when viewed with a single overhead light source. The inclusion is often the mineral rutile, a mineral composed primarily of titanium dioxide. The stones are <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> <b>cabochon,</b> typically with the center of the star {{near the top of the}} dome. Occasionally, twelve-rayed stars are found, typically because two different sets of inclusions are found within the same stone, such as a combination of fine needles of rutile with small platelets of hematite; the first results in a whitish star and the second results in a golden-colored star. During crystallisation, the two types of inclusions become preferentially oriented in different directions within the crystal, thereby forming two six-rayed stars that are superimposed upon each other to form a twelve-rayed star. Misshapen stars or 12-rayed stars may also form as a result of twinning.|$|E

5000|$|A cabochon (...) , {{from the}} Middle French word caboche (meaning [...] "head"), is a {{gemstone}} {{which has been}} shaped and polished as opposed to faceted. The resulting form is usually a convex (rounded) obverse with a flat reverse. <b>Cutting</b> <b>en</b> <b>cabochon</b> (French: [...] "in {{the manner of a}} cabochon") is usually applied to opaque gems, while faceting is usually applied to transparent stones. Hardness is also taken into account as softer gemstones with a hardness lower than 7 on the Mohs hardness scale are easily scratched, mainly by silicon dioxide in dust and grit. This would quickly make translucent gems unattractive—instead they are polished as cabochons, making the scratches less evident.|$|R
50|$|Almandine , {{also known}} {{incorrectly}} as almandite, is {{a species of}} mineral belonging to the garnet group. The name is a corruption of alabandicus, which is the name applied by Pliny the Elder to a stone found or worked at Alabanda, a town in Caria in Asia Minor. Almandine is an iron alumina garnet, of deep red color, inclining to purple. It is frequently cut with a convex face, or <b>en</b> <b>cabochon,</b> and is then known as carbuncle. Viewed through the spectroscope in a strong light, it generally shows three characteristic absorption bands.|$|R
5000|$|After jewelled {{bookbinding}} enjoyed its renaissance, {{the practice}} waned until it experienced a revival near {{the turn of}} the twentieth century in England. Highly influential in the revival of this style were Francis Sangorski and George Sutcliffe of the Sangorski & Sutcliffe bindery. Their bindings were not large uncut gems as in Mediaeval times, but semi-precious stones <b>en</b> <b>cabochon</b> set into beautifully designed bindings with multi-coloured leather inlays and elaborate gilt tooling. The craftsmanship of these bindings was unsurpassable; only their competitors Riviere produced work of similar quality. The most famous of these bindings is [...] "The Great Omar" [...] (1909) on a large copy of FitzGerald's Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, which included good tooling, inlays of coloured leather, and 1050 jewels in a peacock design scheme. It went down with the Titanic in 1912. Today, a third reproduction of this binding is the only one to survive, after the second one, reproduced to Sutcliffe’s design by his nephew Stanley Bray, was damaged in the Blitz during World War II. Bray’s second attempt at recreating the design, the third version that survives, was placed in the British Library in 1989.|$|R
50|$|Women then wore a round head-dress which encircled the face. Emperors and empresses wore a large, low crown, wide at the top, ornamented with {{precious}} stones <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> <b>cabochon,</b> and jeweled pendants falling {{down to the}} shoulders, such as {{may be seen in}} the mosaics of S. Vitalis at Ravenna and a large number of diptychs. The hair of patriarchs and bishops was of medium length and was surmounted by a closed crown or a double tiara.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect can}} be likened to the sheen off a spool of silk: The {{luminous}} streak of reflected light is always perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} fibres. For a gemstone to show this effect best it must be <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> <b>cabochon,</b> with the fibers or fibrous structures parallel {{to the base of the}} finished gem. The best finished specimens show a single sharply defined band of light that moves across the stone when it is rotated. Chatoyant stones of lesser quality display a banded effect as is typical with cat's-eye varieties of quartz. Faceted stones do not show the effect well.|$|E

50|$|Also {{called a}} morning gown, robe de chambre or nightgown, the banyan was a loose, T-shaped or kimono-like cotton, linen, or silk gown worn {{at home as}} a sort of {{dressing}} gown or informal coat over the shirt and breeches. The typical banyan was <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> chemise, with the sleeves and body cut as one piece. It was usually paired with a soft, turban-like cap worn in place of the formal periwig. An alternative style of banyan was cut like a coat, fitted, with set-in sleeves, and was closed with buttons and buttonholes.|$|R

This young man had a commission for an allegorical figure of Truth (draped, of course) for his State Capitol, and he needed help. Ewart had returned with his hair <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> brosse and with his costume completely translated into French.

5000|$|Asterism (from ἀστήρ star), or star stone, {{is a name}} {{applied to}} the {{phenomenon}} of gemstones exhibiting a luminous star-like shape when <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> <b>cabochon</b> (shaped and polished rather than faceted). The typical asteria is the star sapphire, generally a bluish-grey corundum, milky or opalescent, with a star of six rays. In red corundum the stellate reflection is less common, and hence the star-ruby occasionally found with the star-sapphire in Sri Lanka {{is among the most}} valued of [...] "fancy stones". Asterisms are also found in star-topaz. Cymophane, the chatoyant chrysoberyl known as cat's eye, may also be asteriated. In all these cases the asterism is due to the reflection of light from twin-lamellae or from extremely fine needle shaped acicular inclusions oriented to the stone's crystal structure. Oriented sub-microscopic rutile crystals are a common inclusion in asterism gemstones. The astrion of Pliny the Elder {{is believed to have been}} a moonstone, since it is described as a colourless stone from India having within it the appearance of a star shining with the light of the moon. Star-stones were formerly regarded with much superstition.|$|E

40|$|Background: As {{endoscopic}} endonasal sinus {{surgery is}} now commonly applied, low-invasive surgery via an intranasal approach has become actively employed {{for the treatment}} of medial wall fracture of the orbit, but various issues remain unresolved, such as surgical indications and methods. To reliably reduce and reconstruct fractured regions, we developed an osteotomic procedure in which the maxillary and lacrimal bones are <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> bloc. Methods: In establishing the osteotomy line, the upper end was set to a site lower than the frontomaxillary suture, the lower end to the fossa of the lacrimal sac, the anterior end to a site more posterior than the nasomaxillary suture, and the posterior end to a site posterior to the ridge of the lacrimal sac. Results: Eleven patients with orbital medial wall fracture underwent osteotomy of the maxillary and lacrimal bones en bloc. The maxillary and lacrimal bones were excised en bloc, through which the entire fractured region was exposed. Since the fractured region could be observed well, bone transplantation to the defective region was straigtforward, and effective reduction of the orbital content and reconstruction of the defective bone region could be performed. Conclusion: A sufficient visual field was secured by osteotomy, enabling us to atraumatically perform surgery. This may be a useful treatment method for cases with marked deviation of the bulbar content and incarceration of the medial rectus muscle...|$|R

40|$|In the UK’s {{austerity}} regime, {{government spending}} has been slashed, while audit regimes tie up officers of charitable organisations in bureaucracy rather than leaving them free {{to attend to}} the substance of their jobs. These funding-cuts-masquerading-as-market-based-restructuring have drastically affected the provision of advice to welfare dependents. But advisers, and the organisations they work for, piece together new patchworks of funds, devise new forms of face-to-face advice, and rework the boundaries of the law. Local authority funds are invested to yield returns from centrally-funded sources. People are helped to honour their tax commitments while challenging debts incurred from the incorrect award and reclaim of benefits, and to pay their council tax and rent. For advisers, austerity is more a matter of seeking new resource flows, inventing novel interventions, and creating new spaces where justice may be sought and found, than of passively accepting funding <b>cuts.</b> <b>En</b> el Reino Unido, las políticas de recortes de fondos maquilladas como restructuraciones basadas en el mercado han afectado drásticamente la provisión a los dependientes de la asistencia social. Pero los asesores y las organizaciones para las que trabajan forman nuevos tejidos de fondos financieros, ingenian nuevas formas de ayudar en persona y reconfiguran los límites de la ley. Los fondos financieros de los gobiernos locales se invierten para obtener réditos de fuentes de financiación centralizada. Se ayuda a la gente a cumplir con sus obligaciones fiscales y, al mismo tiempo, a recortar las deudas generadas por una incorrecta concesión y reclamación de prestaciones, y a pagar sus tasas municipales y sus alquileres.

40|$|The Arch Mountain area {{of northwestern}} Mohave County, Arizona, is typified by rocks {{that range from}} Precambrian to Quatemary in age. Arch {{mountain}} is a north-trending horst bounded on the west by the Petroglyph Wash graben and on the east by the Virgin Basin. A low-angle normal fault, herein named the Arch Mountain detachment fault, is exposed for 6 km along strike just below the ridge crest of Arch Mountain, and it is typified by a 2 - 20 cm thick zone of hematite-impregnated breccia and cataclasite. The detachment fault places an upper plate of Precambrian gneiss, Paleozoic quartzite, shale and dolomite, and Tertiary intrusive rock on a lower plate composed of quartz monzonite that is geochemically similar to quartz monzonite of the Wilson Ridge pluton. The western margin of the horst is <b>cut</b> by <b>en</b> echelon, west-dipping, high-angle normal faults that step the detachment fault {{to the west and}} rotate it to the east. The Ransome fault forms the western boundary of the horst and separates Arch Mountain from Precambrian gneiss and Tertiary volcanics. The eastern margin of the horst is <b>cut</b> by <b>en</b> echelon, east-dipping, highangle normal faults that step the detachment fault to the east and rotate it to the west. The Boulder Wash fault forms the eastern boundary of the horst and separates Arch Mountain from Tertiary Muddy Creek sediments in the Virgin Basin-Detrital Wash area. The Ransome and Boulder Wash faults may be genetically related to and may have formed synchronously with the left-lateral Lake Mead fault system at approximately 12 Ma. Crosscutting relationships indicate that the Arch Mountain detachment fault is older than the Lake Mead fault system. The Arch Mountain detachment fault is possibly related {{to the development of the}} Las Vegas Valley shear zone, and it is interpreted to be correlative with the Saddle Island detachment fault. I propose that the Arch mountain detachment fault represents the brittlely deformed, upper crustal part of a regional detachment fault system that has a breakaway zone adjacent to the Grand Wash Cliffs...|$|R

5000|$|Overall {{command of}} the British cavalry resided with Lieutenant General George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan. Cardigan and Lucan were brothers-in-law who disliked each other intensely. Lucan {{received}} an order from the army commander Lord Raglan stating: [...] "Lord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front, follow the enemy, and try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns. Troop horse artillery may accompany. French cavalry is on your left. Immediate." [...] Raglan wanted the light cavalry to prevent the Russians from successfully withdrawing the naval guns from the redoubts they had captured on the reverse side of the Causeway Heights, the hill forming {{the south side of}} the valley. This was an optimum task for the Light Brigade, as their superior speed would ensure the Russians would be forced to either quickly abandon the cumbersome guns or be <b>cut</b> down <b>en</b> masse while they attempted to flee with them.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the caravan}} {{continued}} its course down the broad smooth Wady Ruways, on whose left side {{was a large}} atelier, with broken walls and spalled quartz of the Negro variety. Here we found, for the first time, the handmills made of the hardest grey granite, so beautifully worked further south; they explained the fine and carefully polished tube which {{had been brought to}} the first Expedition at Zibá.[EN#10] Several of these articles were all but whole, an exception in this land of [...] "clasts." [...] We then struck over the stony divide to the left, towards a fine landmark--a Khitm, or [...] "block," [...] shaped like a seal <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> cabochon: its name is the barbarous sounding Khurm el-Badaríyyah. During the ascent, which was easy, we passed a second strew and scatter of the white stone broken into small pieces. From the Col, reached at 9.45 a.m., a descent, vile for camels not for mules, presently landed us in the Wady Umm Ámil. The left bank of the hideous narrow gorge showed a line of wells or water-pits, made, said Furayj, by the Mutakaddimín (veteres),--the Ancients who were probably Mediævals. Crossing the torrent-gully we left on its right bank the ruins of large works, especially the upper parallelogram. After a thirteen miles' ride we halted at 10.40 a.m. under a rock on the left side, opposite three couthless heaps of water-rolled stones surrounded by fine quartz. By far the poorest thing we had yet seen, this [...] "town" [...] had been grandiosely described to the first Expedition at Zibá. Many blessings were heaped upon the head of Ámil and his mother: the name, however, as the Sayyid suggested, is evidently a corruption of Mu'ámil--"the workman, the employee."[EN#11] I would conjecture that here the slave-miners were stationed, Old Zibá being the master's abode: our caravan entitled it El-Lomán--"the bagnio, the prison for galériens." [...] On the coast-town I procured some specimens of heavy red copper which had been dug out of a ruined furnace; the metal is admirable, and it retrieves to a certain extent the lost reputation of Umm Ámil.|$|R

50|$|In the {{earliest}} times the Greeks wore their hair kome (long), and thus they are constantly called in Homer karekomoontes. This ancient practice was preserved by the Spartans for many centuries. The Spartan boys always had their hair <b>cut</b> quite short (<b>en</b> chroi keirontes); {{but as soon}} as they reached the age of puberty, they let it grow long. They prided themselves upon their hair, calling it the cheapest of ornaments (kosmon adapanotatos), and before going to battle they combed and dressed it with especial care, in which act Leonidas and his followers were discovered by the Persian spy before the battle of Thermopylae. It seems that both Spartan men and women tied their hair in a knot over the crown of the head. At a later time the Spartans abandoned this ancient custom, and wore their hair short, and hence some writers erroneously attribute this practice to an earlier period.|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of nano-zycosil, nano-zycofil, acid catalyzed lacquer and {{nitrocellulose}} lacquer and polyester on improving the water absorption and contact angle of wood was investigated.

After drying process, the water absorption of the samples was measured after 2, 24, 72, 168 h immersion. The contact angle of samples was measured after 1 and 10 seconds. The results revealed that the pattern of water absorption for the paints and nanoparticles is different. The samples coated with combined acid catalyzed lacquers and nitrocellulose lacquers and those coated with nanozycosil had the highest resistance to water absorption. The greatest contact angle was observed for the samples coated by nanozycosil...|$|R
5000|$|It {{should be}} {{stated that the}} Great Mogul has seven {{magnificent}} thrones, one wholly covered with diamonds, the others with rubies, emeralds, or pearls.The principal throne, which {{is placed in the}} hall of the first court, is nearly of the form and size of our camp-beds; that is to say, it is about [...] long and [...] wide. Upon the four feet, which are very massive and from [...] to [...] high, are fixed the four bars which support the base of the throne, and upon these bars are ranged twelve columns, which sustain the canopy on three sides, there not being any on that which faces the court. Both the feet and the bars, which are more than 18 inches long, are covered with gold inlaid and enriched with numerous diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.In the middle of each bar there is a large balass ruby, <b>cut</b> <b>en</b> cabuchon, with four emeralds round it, which form a square cross. Next in succession, {{from one side to the}} other along the length of the bars there are similar crosses, arranged so that in one the ruby is in the middle of four emeralds, and in another the emerald is in the middle and four balass rubies surround it. The emeralds are table-cut, and the intervals between the rubies and emeralds are covered with diamonds, the largest of which do not exceed 10 to 12 carats in weight, all being showy stones, but very flat.There are also in some parts pearls set in gold, and upon one of the longer sides of the throne there are four steps to ascend it. Of the three cushions or pillows which are upon the throne, that which is placed behind the King's back is large and round like one of our bolsters, and the two others that are placed at his sides are flat. There is to be seen, moreover, a sword suspended from this throne, a mace, a round shield, a bow and quiver with arrows; and all these weapons, as also the cushion and steps, both of this throne and the other six, are covered over with stones which match those with which each of the thrones is respectively enriched.I counted the large balass rubies on the great throne, and there are about 108, all cabuchons, the least of which weighs 100 carats, but there are some which weigh apparently 200 and more. As for the emeralds, there are plenty of good colour, but they have many flaws; the largest may weigh 60 carats and the least 30 carats. I counted about 116; thus there are more emeralds than rubies.The underside of the canopy is covered with diamonds and pearls, with a fringe of pearls all round, and above the canopy, which is a quadrangular-shaped dome, there is to be seen a peacock with elevated tail made of blue sapphires and other coloured stones, the body being of gold inlaid with precious stones, having a large ruby in front of the breast, from whence hangs a pear-shaped pearl of 50 carats or thereabouts, and of a somewhat yellow water. On both sides of the peacock there is a large bouquet of the same height as the bird, and consisting of many kinds of flowers made of gold inlaid with precious stones. On the side of the throne which is opposite the court there is to be seen a jewel consisting of a diamond of from 80 to 90 carats weight, with rubies and emeralds round it, and when the King is seated he has this jewel in full view.But that which in my opinion is the most costly thing about this magnificent throne is, that the twelve columns supporting the canopy are surrounded with beautiful rows of pearls, which are round and of fine water, and weigh from 6 to 10 carats each. At 4 feet distance from the throne there are fixed, on either side, two umbrellas, the sticks of which for 7 or 8 feet in height are covered with diamonds, rubies, and pearls. The umbrellas are of red velvet, and are embroidered and fringed all round with pearls.This is what I have been able to observe regarding this famous throne, commenced by Tamerlane and completed by Shāhjahān; and those who keep the accounts of the King’s jewels, and of the cost of this great work, have assured me that it amounts to 107,000 lakhs of rupees, which amount to 160,500,000 livres of our money.|$|R
