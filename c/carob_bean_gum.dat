In addition, the rheological properties of binary polysaccharide mixtures {{were related to}} the microstructure as observed using transmission electron microscopy. Viscoelastic measurements showed that addition of locust <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> to xanthan or. kappa. -carrageenan strongly influences the viscoelastic properties of the mixture. The effect of locust <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> on the viscoelastic properties of the mixture was dependent on the degree of side-chain substitution of the galactomannan, ionic environment, temperature and the composition of the mixture. Locust <b>bean</b> <b>gums,</b> with mannose to galactose ratios of ~ 3 (lbg 3) and ~ 5 (lbg 5), have been evaluated. For the mixture of xanthan-locust <b>bean</b> <b>gum,</b> viscoelastic measurements showed that, when the polymers were mixed at room temperature, a gel is formed. Heat treatment of the mixture led to an increase in G' for mixtures containing lbg 5.

The synergism observed for mixtures of. kappa. -carrageenan-locust <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> showed a dependence on the ionic environment.

40|$|Carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is a {{perennial}} leguminous evergreen tree {{native to the}} coastal regions of the Mediterranean basin and {{is considered to be}} an important component of vegetation for economic and environmental reasons. Two constituents of the pod, pulp and seeds, can be used as feed or in food production. In this study, drying characteristics, texture and microstructure of carob pods were studied. Three different carob samples were prepared: whole carob pod, carob pod parts and carob seed. The drying experiments and the modelling showed that carob seeds had the highest drying rate, followed by pod parts and the whole, intact carob fruit. Texture studies showed that the maximum compression force depended on the area of the carob fruit on which compression tests were performed. The seeds showed the highest compression force, followed by the stem zone, the tip and the centre of the fruit. Differences in drying behaviour and texture of carob pods can successfully be interpreted by the micromorphology of the carob pods and seeds. Determining the drying rate, maximum compressive force and micromorphological traits is of great importance for further carob processing (e. g. milling, sieving, <b>carob</b> <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> production or usage in food or feed products) ...|$|E

Following these studies for gum tragacanth and C. M. C., now the similar studis for locust bean mucilage (gum), also known as <b>carob</b> <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> were carried out using Stormer type rotational viscosimeter. Furthermore, instead of the previous measurements on the viscosity of ca. 3 % aqueous solution with the viscosimeter of the falling ball type, the present measurements on that of ca. 1. 5 % aqueous gum tragacanth solution with rotational viscosimeter are also canied out. The results obtained may be summarized in the following: (I) Effects of 5 sorts of polyphosphates such as sodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripoly phosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and their mixtures on the about 1. 0 [...] 1. 5 % aqueous solution of locust bean gum as one of plant mucilage and on the about 3 % aqueous solution of gum tragacanth as one of plant gum are studied and the considerable increase of their viscosity are observed. (II) In both cases, each curve relating the viscosity-quantities added has maximum and the orders for the increassing effect with these polyphosphates resembled each other. (III) It appears that this increasing of the viscosity will be partly ascribed to the increased formation of aggregation of the linear negative ions and may be partly based on the untwisting of somewhat kinked linear macromolecule having many hydroxyl groups probably caused by the adsorption of these polyphosphate ions kindred with that group. 浅岡が従来行って来ている重合燐酸塩の利用に関連した多くの研究のうちで発表済のものは若千に過ぎない。しかしその中に高分子物質水溶液の粘度に対する添加物の影響の研究としてトラガントゴム水溶液についての報告があるので，ゴム類ではないが或意味ではこれと類似とも云える植物粘質物であるローカストゴムについて同様の実験を行ったものである。このローカストゴムは食品，化粧品，繊維加工，製紙，医薬用ゼリーなどの方面の用途が知られているので，これに対する添加物効果はその利用面からも主要である。更に既報ではトラガントゴム水溶液の粘度測定が落球式であったので，今回はローカストゴム水溶液と同じく回転粘度計によって測定可能の粘度まで低下させるために，前の約半分の濃度である約 3 %にして同種の実験を行ったものである...|$|E

40|$|Thickening of formula feedings {{is part of}} the {{therapeutic}} approach for gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in infants. However, its mechanism of action, especially regarding the occurrence of nonacid (pH > 4) GER, has not yet been clearly described. The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled crossover {{study was to examine the}} influence of formula thickened with carob (St. John's bread) bean gum on acid and nonacid GER. METHODS: Infants with recurrent regurgitation and without other symptoms were fed alternately (A-B-A-B-A-B) with thickened (A) and nonthickened (B) but otherwise identical formula. Documentation of GER episodes during the study was performed by simultaneous intraesophageal impedance measurement (intraluminal electrical impedance,IMP) and pH monitoring. The IMP technique is able to detect bolus movements inside a luminal organ. The use of multiple measuring segments on a single catheter allowed the analysis of direction, height, and duration of the bolus transport. Continuous videorecording and visual surveillance of regurgitation frequency and amount resulted in a severity score. RESULTS: Fourteen infants (42 +/- 32 days old) were examined during 6 feeding intervals each. A total of 1130 GER episodes and 83 episodes of regurgitation were registered. Regurgitation frequency (17 vs 66 episodes) and amount were significantly lower after feedings with thickened formula. The difference regarding the occurrence of GER documented by IMP was also pronounced. Although not statistically significant, maximal height reached by the refluxate in the esophagus was decreased after thickened feedings. Mean GER duration and the frequency of acid (pH 4) GER episodes, but also because of a decrease of mean reflux height reached in the esophagus. However, the occurrence of acid GER is not reduced.

40|$|Galactomannan {{samples of}} {{different}} origins (guar, tara, locust <b>bean</b> <b>gums)</b> have been characterized. They exhibited strong differences {{with respect to}} their molecular weight and their fine chemical structure. It could also be noticed that the different locust <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> samples differed significatively with this respect from each other. The rheological behavior of the mixtures of these galactomannans with Kappa-carrageenan (k-car), with and without addition of KC 1, the total polymer concentration being kept constant at 1 g/dL, has been investigated. The viscoelastic properties of the mixed gels with tara <b>gum</b> and locust <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> showed a synergistic maximum at the 4 : 1 k-car/galactomannan ratio. The location of this maximum did not depend upon the KC 1 content. Guar gum was the only galactomannan which did not exhibit synergism upon mixing with k-car. The extent of the synergism, as extimated from the storage modulus at the maximum (G'max), was linearly related to the product (M/G) " 2 (#eta#). This relation means that the synergism is ruled not only by the smooth regions of the mannan backbone of the galactomannan but also by its molecular weight. Two types of sol-gel phase diagrams of the mixed system k-car/locust <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> were estabilished: a) In the sol-gel phase diagram of the mixed system k-car/locust <b>bean</b> <b>gum</b> at the 4 : 1 ratio, relating the total potassium concentration in the mixed system with the gelation and melting temperatures, a sharp sol-gel transition was evidenced {{as a function of the}} temperature.
