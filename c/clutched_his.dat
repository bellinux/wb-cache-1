25|$|Warrior died on April 8, 2014 in Scottsdale, Arizona. He {{had been}} {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, and made his first Raw appearance in almost 18 years on April 7, the day before his death. According to reports, Warrior <b>clutched</b> <b>his</b> chest and collapsed at 5:50p.m. while walking to his car with his wife outside of their hotel in Arizona. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital where he was pronounced dead at age 54. Warrior's colleagues said Warrior appeared frail during WrestleMania weekend, and said that he was sweating profusely and breathing heavily backstage.|$|E

In the show, he entered from the dark in a white suit and black tie, and walked across a conveyor belt in beat to [...] "Climax". As the song's tempo increased, he <b>clutched</b> <b>his</b> stomach as a gunshot fired and blood spread across his torso. Usher appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 12, 2012, to perform [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Climax".|$|E
500|$|Fitzsimmons {{dominated}} Sharkey {{throughout the}} fight, {{and in the}} eighth round, he hit Sharkey with his famed [...] "solar plexus punch", an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. Fitzsimmons' next punch apparently caught Sharkey below the belt and Sharkey dropped, <b>clutched</b> <b>his</b> groin, and rolled on the canvas, screaming foul. Wyatt stopped the bout, ruling that Fitzsimmons had hit Sharkey below the belt, but virtually no one witnessed the punch. Earp awarded the fight to Sharkey, whom attendants carried out as [...] "limp as a rag". The 15,000 fans in attendance greeted his decision with loud boos and catcalls. It was widely believed that no foul had occurred and Earp had bet on Sharkey. While several doctors verified afterward that Sharkey had been hit hard below the belt, the public had bet heavily on Fitzsimmons and they were livid at the outcome.|$|E

2500|$|Such play-acting can {{be carried}} to extremes. GM Nikolai Krogius writes that Najdorf, in his game against Gligorić at the 1952 Helsinki Olympiad, [...] "left a pawn [...] in time trouble, and then desperately <b>clutched</b> <b>his</b> head and reached out as if wanting to take the pawn back. ... Gligorić took the pawn, and soon {{thereafter}} lost the game. It transpired that Najdorf had staged the whole pantomime to blunt his opponent's watchfulness. This can hardly be called ethical." ...|$|E
2500|$|After vacating the Middleweight title, Fitzsimmons began campaigning at heavyweight (the light heavyweight {{division}} did {{not exist}} at that time). On 2 December 1896, the San Francisco Athletic Club sponsored a fight at the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco between Fitzsimmons and Tom Sharkey. Unable to find a referee, they called on former lawman Wyatt Earp. He had officiated 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry rules. The fight {{may have been the}} most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favoured to win, and bets flowed heavily his way. Earp entered the ring still armed with his customary Colt [...]45 and drew a lot of attention when he had to be disarmed. He later said he forgot he was wearing it. Fitzsimmons was taller and quicker than Sharkey and dominated the fight from the opening bell. In the eighth round, Fitzsimmons hit Sharkey with his famed [...] "solar plexus punch," [...] an uppercut under the heart that could render a man temporarily helpless. The punch caught Sharkey, Earp, and most of the crowd by surprise, and Sharkey dropped, <b>clutched</b> <b>his</b> groin, and rolled on the canvas, screamed foul.|$|E
