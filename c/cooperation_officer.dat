40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to give insights to the security-development nexus from an autoethnographic perspective. It is thus empirically based on my own experiences as a Civil Military <b>Cooperation</b> <b>Officer</b> in Helmand, Afghanistan 2008 - 2009, and it aims to reveal how the security-development nexus plays out on the ground. Accordingly, it will look into the challenges and tensions between security and development while answering the following problem formulation: How do soldiers who are involved and emplaced in the security-development nexus experience and deal with the tensions inherent between security and development? It reaches the conclusion that there is a necessity for the security of both developer and developee in order to create conditions for development. In addition, it reveals that security plays out differently in time and space in the warscape in Helmand and moreover; it reveals how multiple development tasks are carried out by security forces in the Danish comprehensive approach, lastly pointing to the challenges of translating development policies into tactical terms...|$|E
40|$|The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice {{opened its}} {{investigation}} of the Ferguson Police Department (“FPD”) on September 4, 2014. This investigation was initiated under the pattern-or-practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U. S. C. § 14141, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 42 U. S. C. § 3789 d (“Safe Streets Act”), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. § 2000 d (“Title VI”). This investigation has revealed a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within the Ferguson Police Department that violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and federal statutory law. Over {{the course of the}} investigation, we interviewed City officials, including City Manager John Shaw, Mayor James Knowles, Chief of Police Thomas Jackson, Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer, the Municipal Court Clerk, Ferguson’s Finance Director, half of FPD’s sworn officers, and others. We spent, collectively, approximately 100 person-days onsite in Ferguson. We participated in ride-alongs with on-duty officers, reviewed over 35, 000 pages of police records as well as thousands of emails and other electronic materials provided by the police department. Enlisting the assistance of statistical experts, we analyzed FPD’s data on stops, searches, citations, and arrests, as well as data collected by the municipal court. We observed four separate sessions of Ferguson Municipal Court, interviewing dozens of people charged with local offenses, and we reviewed third-party studies regarding municipal court practices in Ferguson and St. Louis County more broadly. As in all of our investigations, we sought to engage the local community, conducting hundreds of in-person and telephone interviews of individuals who reside in Ferguson or who have had interactions with the police department. We contacted ten neighborhood associations and met with each group that responded to us, as well as several other community groups and advocacy organizations. Throughout the investigation, we relied on two police chiefs who accompanied us to Ferguson and who themselves interviewed City and police officials, spoke with community members, and reviewed FPD policies and incident reports. We thank the City officials and the rank-and-file officers who have cooperated with this investigation and provided us with insights into the operation of the police department, including the municipal court. Notwithstanding our findings about Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement and the policing culture it creates, we found many Ferguson police officers and other City employees to be dedicated public servants striving each day to perform their duties lawfully and with respect for all members of the Ferguson community. The importance of their often-selfless work cannot be overstated. We are also grateful to the many members of the Ferguson community who have met with us to share their experiences. It became clear during our many conversations with Ferguson residents from throughout the City that many residents, black and white, genuinely embrace Ferguson’s diversity and want to reemerge from the events of recent months a truly inclusive, united community. This Report is intended to strengthen those efforts by recognizing the harms caused by Ferguson’s law enforcement practices so that those harms can be better understood and overcome. 2 Ferguson’s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City’s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs. This emphasis on revenue has compromised the institutional character of Ferguson’s police department, contributing to a pattern of unconstitutional policing, and has also shaped its municipal court, leading to procedures that raise due process concerns and inflict unnecessary harm on members of the Ferguson community. Further, Ferguson’s police and municipal court practices both reflect and exacerbate existing racial bias, including racial stereotypes. Ferguson’s own data establish clear racial disparities that adversely impact African Americans. The evidence shows that discriminatory intent {{is part of the reason}} for these disparities. Over time, Ferguson’s police and municipal court practices have sown deep mistrust between parts of the community and the police department, undermining law enforcement legitimacy among African Americans in particular. Focus on Generating Revenue The City budgets for sizeable increases in municipal fines and fees each year, exhorts police and court staff to deliver those revenue increases, and closely monitors whether those increases are achieved. City officials routinely urge Chief Jackson to generate more revenue through enforcement. In March 2010, for instance, the City Finance Director wrote to Chief Jackson that “unless ticket writing ramps up significantly before the end of the year, it will be hard to significantly raise collections next year.... Given that we are looking at a substantial sales tax shortfall, it’s not an insignificant issue. ” Similarly, in March 2013, the Finance Director wrote to the City Manager: “Court fees are anticipated to rise about 7. 5 %. I did ask the Chief if he thought the PD could deliver 10 % increase. He indicated they could try. ” The importance of focusing on revenue generation is communicated to FPD officers. Ferguson police officers from all ranks told us that revenue generation is stressed heavily within the police department, and that the message comes from City leadership. The evidence we reviewed supports this perception. Police Practices The City’s emphasis on revenue generation has a profound effect on FPD’s approach to law enforcement. Patrol assignments and schedules are geared toward aggressive enforcement of Ferguson’s municipal code, with insufficient thought given to whether enforcement strategies promote public safety or unnecessarily undermine community trust and <b>cooperation.</b> <b>Officer</b> evaluations and promotions depend to an inordinate degree on “productivity,” meaning the number of citations issued. Partly as a consequence of City and FPD priorities, many officers appear to see some residents, especially those who live in Ferguson’s predominantly AfricanAmerican neighborhoods, less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue. This culture within FPD influences officer activities in all areas of policing, beyond just ticketing. Officers expect and demand compliance even when they lack legal authority. They are inclined to interpret the exercise of free-speech rights as unlawful disobedience, innocent movements as physical threats, indications of mental or physical illness as belligerence. Police supervisors and leadership do too little to ensure that officers act in accordance with law and policy, and rarely respond meaningfully to civilian complaints of officer misconduct. The result is a pattern of stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment; infringement on free expression, as well as retaliation for protected 3 expression, in violation of the First Amendment; and excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Even relatively routine misconduct by Ferguson police officers can have significant consequences for the people whose rights are violated. For example, in the summer of 2012, a 32 -year-old African-American man sat in his car cooling off after playing basketball in a Ferguson public park. An officer pulled up behind the man’s car, blocking him in, and demanded the man’s Social Security number and identification. Without any cause, the officer accused the man of being a pedophile, referring to the presence of children in the park, and ordered the man out of his car for a pat-down, although the officer had no reason to believe the man was armed. The officer also asked to search the man’s car. The man objected, citing his constitutional rights. In response, the officer arrested the man, reportedly at gunpoint, charging him with eight violations of Ferguson’s municipal code. One charge, Making a False Declaration, was for initially providing the short form of his first name (e. g., “Mike” instead of “Michael”), and an address which, although legitimate, was different from the one on his driver’s license. Another charge was for not wearing a seat belt, even though he was seated in a parked car. The officer also charged the man both with having an expired operator’s license, and with having no operator’s license in his possession. The man told us that, because of these charges, he lost his job as a contractor with the federal government that he had held for years. Municipal Court Practices Ferguson has allowed its focus on revenue generation to fundamentally compromise the role of Ferguson’s municipal court. The municipal court does not act as a neutral arbiter of the law or a check on unlawful police conduct. Instead, the court primarily uses its judicial authority as the means to compel the payment of fines and fees that advance the City’s financial interests. This has led to court practices that violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process and equal protection requirements. The court’s practices also impose unnecessary harm, overwhelmingly on African-American individuals, and run counter to public safety. Most strikingly, the court issues municipal arrest warrants not on the basis of public safety needs, but rather as a routine response to missed court appearances and required fine payments. In 2013 alone, the court issued over 9, 000 warrants on cases stemming in large part from minor violations such as parking infractions, traffic tickets, or housing code violations. Jail time would be considered far too harsh a penalty for the great majority of these code violations, yet Ferguson’s municipal court routinely issues warrants for people to be arrested and incarcerated for failing to timely pay related fines and fees. Under state law, a failure to appear in municipal court on a traffic charge involving a moving violation also results in a license suspension. Ferguson has made this penalty even more onerous by only allowing the suspension to be lifted after payment of an owed fine is made in full. Further, until recently, Ferguson also added charges, fines, and fees for each missed appearance and payment. Many pending cases still include such charges that were imposed before the court recently eliminated them, making it as difficult as before for people to resolve these cases. The court imposes these severe penalties for missed appearances and payments even as several of the court’s practices create unnecessary barriers to resolving a municipal violation. The court often fails to provide clear and accurate information regarding a person’s charges or court obligations. And the court’s fine assessment procedures do not adequately provide for a defendant to seek a fine reduction on account of financial incapacity or to seek alternatives to 4 payment such as community service. City and court officials have adhered to these court practices despite acknowledging their needlessly harmful consequences. In August 2013, for example, one City Councilmember wrote to the City Manager, the Mayor, and other City officials lamenting the lack of a community service option and noted the benefits of such a program, including that it would “keep those people that simply don’t have the money to pay their fines from constantly being arrested and going to jail, only to be released and do it all over again. ” Together, these court practices exacerbate the harm of Ferguson’s unconstitutional police practices. They impose a particular hardship upon Ferguson’s most vulnerable residents, especially upon those living in or near poverty. Minor offenses can generate crippling debts, result in jail time because of an inability to pay, and result in the loss of a driver’s license, employment, or housing. We spoke, for example, with an African-American woman who has a still-pending case stemming from 2007, when, on a single occasion, she parked her car illegally. She received two citations and a $ 151 fine, plus fees. The woman, who experienced financial difficulties and periods of homelessness over several years, was charged with seven Failure to Appear offenses for missing court dates or fine payments on her parking tickets between 2007 and 2010. For each Failure to Appear, the court issued an arrest warrant and imposed new fines and fees. From 2007 to 2014, the woman was arrested twice, spent six days in jail, and paid $ 550 to the court for the events stemming from this single instance of illegal parking. Court records show that she twice attempted to make partial payments of $ 25 and $ 50, but the court returned those payments, refusing to accept anything less than payment in full. One of those payments was later accepted, but only after the court’s letter rejecting payment by money order was returned as undeliverable. This woman is now making regular payments on the fine. As of December 2014, over seven years later, despite initially owing a $ 151 fine and having already paid $ 550, she still owed $ 541. Racial Bias Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement both reflects and reinforces racial bias, including stereotyping. The harms of Ferguson’s police and court practices are borne disproportionately by African Americans, and there is evidence that this is due in part to intentional discrimination on the basis of race. Ferguson’s law enforcement practices overwhelmingly impact African Americans. Data collected by the Ferguson Police Department from 2012 to 2014 shows that African Americans account for 85 % of vehicle stops, 90 % of citations, and 93 % of arrests made by FPD officers, despite comprising only 67 % of Ferguson’s population. African Americans are more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops even after controlling for non-race based variables such as the reason the vehicle stop was initiated, but are found in possession of contraband 26 % less often than white drivers, suggesting officers are impermissibly considering race as a factor when determining whether to search. African Americans are more likely to be cited and arrested following a stop regardless of why the stop was initiated and are more likely to receive multiple citations during a single incident. From 2012 to 2014, FPD issued four or more citations to African Americans on 73 occasions, but issued four or more citations to non-African Americans only twice. FPD appears to bring certain offenses almost exclusively against African Americans. For example, from 2011 to 2013, African Americans accounted for 95 % of Manner of Walking in Roadway charges, and 94 % of all Failure to Comply charges. Notably, with 5 respect to speeding charges brought by FPD, the evidence shows not only that African Americans are represented at disproportionately high rates overall, but also that the disparate impact of FPD’s enforcement practices on African Americans is 48 % larger when citations are issued not on the basis of radar or laser, but by some other method, such as the officer’s own visual assessment. These disparities are also present in FPD’s use of force. Nearly 90 % of documented force used by FPD officers was used against African Americans. In every canine bite incident for which racial information is available, the person bitten was African American. Municipal court practices likewise cause disproportionate harm to African Americans. African Americans are 68 % less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by the court, and are more likely to have their cases last longer and result in more required court encounters. African Americans are at least 50 % more likely to have their cases lead to an arrest warrant, and accounted for 92 % of cases in which an arrest warrant was issued by the Ferguson Municipal Court in 2013. Available data show that, of those actually arrested by FPD only because of an outstanding municipal warrant, 96 % are African American. Our investigation indicates that this disproportionate burden on African Americans ca...|$|E

The aim of this project is to decrease trans-boundary criminality and improve day-today <b>cooperation</b> between border <b>officers</b> in the Baltic Sea region. This study analyses this collaborative project and especially the operative joint activities conducted during the implementation of project Turnstone. What is unique about the Turnstone model of working is {{the implementation of the}} operative action week where officers have the chance of exchanging, sharing, and cooperating with immediate action in the same office using their own channels of information. The purpose of the study is to map and analyse how the staff of the different organizations experience, understand, and define successful cooperation and collaboration obstacles encountered during cooperation with neighbouring organizations. The study is qualitative and based on ethnographically gathered material such as field observations at the different border agencies and qualitative interviews. 73 interviews were conducted with border police officers, police officers, border guards, and coast guard officers from the participating organizations. The findings suggest that interviewed officers see Project Turnstone as a rare opportunity for close, personal <b>cooperation</b> where <b>officers</b> can build strong police, border, and coast guard networks and increase and strengthen previous cooperating practices. This is due to colocation and interpersonal interaction where officers can learn about each other’s organizational practices, establish trust, and achieve the same goals. On the other hand, collaboration obstacles were also raised, such as language and communication difficulties, differences in national legislations, and fear that the opportunities for joint action weeks and close cooperation will diminish after the termination of project Turnstone.

Design/methodology/approach – A systematic implementation evaluation of the first randomised controlled SE (IPS) trial in Sweden was conducted in August 2008 and August 2009. Data were collected on a regular basis from SE employment specialists, process heads, clients and representatives from mental health care units and vocational services (social insurance and public employment offices) using interviews, non-participant observations and document analysis. Findings – SE employment specialists reported that existing regulations for social insurance and employment regulations presented major obstacles to implementation. Difficulties were reported in <b>cooperation</b> with handling <b>officers</b> at the vocational services. Scepticism towards persons with mental illness was common and employers expected to receive subsidies if they hired a person with mental illness. SE participants expressed fear of losing their social benefits. Originality/value – The results illuminate a collision between an innovative evidence-based practice and the existing systems for social benefits and work rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{cooperation}} projects {{between countries}} in the Middle East are expected to provide benefits to all parties involved but their feasibility is subject to social, economic and political constraints. This article uses a database of planned projects {{in the last decade}} and tries to detect types of projects that are less sensitive to the constraints. A typology of projects shows the prevalence of two main groups. A first group of projects avoids constraints by focusing on relatively high micro-economic viability but with low intensity of cooperation: these are economic-business projects and some infrastructure projects that are based on mere coordination between countries and mostly implemented separately in a single country. A second group of projects are infrastructure and public services projects that involve a number of countries, and implementation through joint planning and management. We conclude that the response to the constraints for regional cooperation is found in the concentration in projects that do not require any intensive continuous contact between the populations, by choosing business projects that are implemented separately in each country, or public projects that are jointly implemented, but on the basis of <b>cooperation</b> between public <b>officers,</b> not necessarily the population. ...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the Probation and Mediation Service in the Czech Republic, its {{importance}} and awareness of this service in society. The Probation and Mediation Service is a state organization that works {{in the field of}} criminal policy. Its main goal is to resolve the conflicts associated with criminal activities effectively and in favour of society. But this is not the only aim of the organization. It also strives for efficient and dignified execution of alternative punishments and measures. Probation and Mediation Service is based on a concept of restorative justice which is increasingly developing in the Czech Republic. It stresses the integration of offender, participation of victim and protection of society. The probation officers have to face many problems that make their work difficult. Key issue is a low awareness of the Probation and Mediation Service in society which is caused by insufficient PR strategy. The consequence of inadequate promotion is a limited <b>cooperation</b> between probation <b>officers</b> and offenders or victims. The low awareness is proved by the results of questionnaire surveys that were conducted among general public in the Czech Republic and clients of the Probation and Mediation Service centre in Prague. Czech experts - probation officers suggest taking certain measures [...] ...|$|R

Its prevention and detection constitutes the most important challenge dealing with the criminal investigation organs, where the underlying investigative process at any time should remain the utmost respect for human rights, particularly care to crime victims. The process of crime prevention should be more efficient, first there must be a spirit of close <b>cooperation</b> between police <b>officers,</b> prosecution authorities and community in order to guarantee the rule of security for citizens.

Besides civic reaction, criminal legislation provides for the rights and duties to citizens to denounce criminal acts. Under the criminal code, every citizen is obliged to speak of a crime that is being committed or has been committed, the bodies of prosecution, court, law enforcement bodies, government or administration, otherwise the risk is connected with a sanction of a fine or imprisonment up to three years.   1 To better understand the problems of non testifying crime and discrepancy it is important to analyze the criminal Offense of non testifying crime and Characteristics of the Offense under the Albanian criminal code...|$|R
50|$|The Swedish forces {{blocked the}} road to Mikkeli at a narrow watercrossing with a bridge near the bight of Porrassalmi. There they faced Russian infantrymen led by Ivan Ivanovich Michelson and Georg Magnus Sprengtporten a Swedish officer who had entered the Russian service and {{received}} the command of the Russian army corps directed against Finland. Sprengtporten persuaded the Russians that Finnish troops were disloyal to the Swedish Crown and not going to fight, but his column was met with gunfire. Only infantry units participated in the fighting. The Russians were moving in a too-close formation and, despite numerous charges against the outnumbered Swedes, could not break through the defence and pulled back, covered by mounted Cossacks and Bashkirs. The Russians lost 425 men killed and wounded, including their commander, General Georg Magnus Sprengtporten, who was seriously wounded, while the Swedes claimed to have killed and wounded 900. The Swedes lost in total 203 men dead or wounded. The battle brought to prominence Major Georg Carl von Döbeln, whose iconic black silk bandanna was worn over a wound suffered in the battle. Sprengtporten claimed that his defeat was {{due to a lack}} of <b>cooperation</b> between his <b>officers</b> and that the decision to leave the battlefield was unsound and taken without his consideration. He personally led a charge that succeeded in capturing a Swedish battery. Russian staff officer Ivan Sazonov, who also participated in the fighting, was said to have publicly praised the enemy's valour after the battle, although adding that it was only the enemy's advantageous defensive position that determined the outcome of the battle.|$|R

One of the outer islands of Indonesia is Enggano located in Bengkulu province which is directly adjacent to the Indian ocean. The fish there is very potential, consequently it must be used responsibly to secure and it can benefit the future generation interests as well. To direct the actors to do responsible fisheries and comply to the governing laws, surveillance plays a substantial role. A field survey showed that apart from local fishers, there were also foreign-flagged fishing vessel in Enggano waters. As IUU fishing happens frequently in Indonesian waters, {{it is important to know}} how the fisheries surveillance carried out in the island, therefore this research aims to get to know the legality of fishing conducted by foreign-flagged vessels; the constraints faced and solutions envisaged. This is a normative legal research. Interviews were conducted to legal officers involved directly to fisheries surveillance to complement the existing primary data. The results showed that the surveillance on Enggano waters cannot be performed optimally due to shortage of human resources in both quantity and quality (lack of legal knowledge of the inspectors), facilities (poor condition of surveillance vessels, supplies of fuel), the weather. To address these problems, there should be an enhancement of legal knowledge of the <b>officers,</b> <b>cooperation</b> and coherence among related institutions and involvement of community.

The purpose of the project is to improve day-to-day <b>cooperation</b> between border <b>officers</b> in the Baltic Sea region, decrease trans-boundary criminality, and increase security for passengers in the Baltic Sea area without compromising freedom of movement. Within the framework of Project Turnstone, {{the purpose of this study}} is to map and analyse how travellers experience, interpret, and define freedom of movement in the northern part of the Baltic Sea region. This qualitative study is based on empirically gathered material, including field interviews and fieldwork observations at Stockholm’s Arlanda airport in Sweden, a Tallink Silja Line ferry between Stockholm and Riga in Latvia, and a Tallink Silja Line ferry between Stockholm and Tallinn in Estonia. The findings of this study suggest that many passengers are positive regarding the idea of freedom of movement in Europe but are scared of threats from outside of Europe. Several interviewees viewed Sweden and the northern parts of Europe as safe and mostly identified threats as coming from outside of Europe. Passengers generally identified political and collective threats, such as terrorism and cross-border criminality, but did not mention airplane or ferry accidents as possible risks. Freedom of movement is described as a potential risk for society and passengers, thereby placing risk in a larger societal context. Nevertheless, all but three of 200 interviewed passengers claimed that they felt safe during their travels, though many also added that they might feel safer if there were consistent passport controls regarding all travellers. The respondents in this study construct safety by distinguishing themselves from others outside of Europe. Passengers emphasized that freedom of movement is positive for personal gain because it is easier for EU citizens to travel in Europe, but at the same time it is regarded as facilitating the entry of potential threats into the EU...|$|R

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyThe Tsunami tidal wave struck Sri Lanka on 26 1 December 2004 causing heavy damages to the enterprises located in the coastal belt. Two thirds of the Coastal Zone of Sri Lanka was adversely affected by the Tsunami, in which reportedly 31 000 lives were lost. About 6 300 persons are still missing and 15 000 injured. About 443 000 persons were displaced. Around 3500 business enterprises were affected in Galle district due to Tsunami. Out of 4. 389 industrial enterprises affected around the country. 929 units in Galle district had been engaged in providing services and manufacturing of products. Micro and SMEs {{play an important role}} in economic growth, reducing unemployment, poverty reduction, regional development, equitable distribution of income and national innovation. This sector is said to be the backbone of the economy of Sri Lanka being a developing country. Since Tsunami destroyed many micro and SMEs around the coastal areas of the country, considerable support should be given to rebuild them for the development of the area. This study was designed to identify the main issues encountered by the Tsunami affected micro and SMEs in Galle district and to identify how they have recovered. Finally, policies and strategies were recommended to develop those Tsunami affected micro and SMEs in the Galle district. Data collection was through personal interviews of fifty entrepreneurs, in the Tsunami affected industries in the Galle district. According to the survey analysis the key issues that affected the business organizations were loss and damage to the plant and machinery and inventory. Their business income also has been reduced drastically due to the Tsunami. Most of the buildings of the organizations were also damaged considerably. Even though Tsunami caused drastic destruction to lives of the people in the coastal belt, this research amongst a sample of affected industries in Galle District confirmed that the damage to employees was minimal, compared to other damages. Further, this survey results confirm that a very low level of outside support had been received by Tsunami affected business organizations to rebuild their businesses and around 32 % of the business organizations surveyed did not receive any form of assistance. Few of the micro and SMEs did not receive any support from Tsunami aid agencies, due to 100 meter buffer zone restriction and the government should modify the 100 meter buffer zone regulation taking into consideration the necessities of the resources of those affected industries. This research findings show that the average percentage of business activity level compared to pre-Tsunami period is 64. 8 %. As per findings of this research one of the key requirements of the affected entrepreneurs are loans at low interest rates. Therefore, the government should consider this request for the development of Tsunami affected business organizations. Most of the aid agencies provided giants and loans to the development of the business. Comparatively limited amounts of grants had been extended to cover damaged plant and machineries and inventories, even where those were heavily damaged. According to the survey results, the main problems had been delays in receiving benefits, procedural difficulties and lack of <b>cooperation</b> from the <b>officers</b> of Tsunami aid relief agencies. Around 88 % of business organizations were sole proprietorship businesses according to the survey conducted. Therefore, polices of Tsunami aid relief agencies should adequately address the needs of sole proprietorship business requirements. Further research can be carried out by covering at least, a larger sample size, say 350. business organizations for the population of 3. 350 businesses organizations in dalle district. This research can also be extended to cover other districts, which were damaged by the Tsunami. Thereby, it may assist in verifying and substantiating the findings of this research as well as enable the aid agencies to address the issues faced by Tsunami affected business more effectively...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY POLICY QUESTION (Page 7) 	The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine whether or not the North Carolina Department of Corrections should adopt a coerced abstinence model of probation modification similar to the Hawaii Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) program that was piloted in Honolulu in 2004. HOPE appears to be phenomenally successful at reducing recidivism among drug-involved probationers. Reducing new crimes and probation violations among this sub-set of high-risk probationers in North Carolina could have substantial impacts on public safety and corrections spending. BACKGROUND (Page 7) 	The probation system in America, widely used as a cheaper and less severe alternative to incarceration for qualifying criminal offenders, is also widely considered to be ineffective at preventing new crimes. Probationers frequently re-offend which fails to meet the goals of probation, as defined by the American Probation and Parole Association: “to protect society and promote law-abiding behavior. ” 	Some characteristics of the probation system may contribute to the high rate of recidivism. Because resources are often strained and probation officers are often over-burdened with caseloads, it becomes virtually impossible to sanction every probation violation. When probationers are sanctioned, for violations such as missed appointments or failed drug tests, punishments are often delayed and come after the accumulation of multiple violations. This being the case, offenders likely perceive the risks of violating probation as very low. A low risk perception, coupled with the tendency for crime to attract impulsive and reckless individuals, often leads to the choice to violate the terms of probation. 	Crime, as well as reckless, impulsive behavior, is also strongly linked to drug use. This link is backed up by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which reports that about 30 % of probationers in the United States are “current” drug users, compared to only 8. 3 % of the general population of American adults. Individuals using drugs are more likely to engage in crime either while under the influence of drugs, or for the purpose of getting money to buy drugs. As such, it stands to reason that reducing drug use will lead to a reduction in crime. 	Several programs in the United States have recently sought to address these shortcomings in the probation system and alter the underlying behavioral tendencies that lead to continued drug use and other probation violations. These programs focus around “swift and certain” sanctions for each probation violation. Rather than having a low risk of a severe sanction, they offer a high risk of a moderate sanction per violation. 	Examples of programs that address the link between drug use, impulsiveness, and crime include Intensive Supervision Probation, 24 / 7 Sobriety, drug courts, and coerced abstinence—typified by the HOPE program. This paper examines what might happen in North Carolina if the Department of Corrections adopted a coerced abstinence, HOPE-style program. DATA AND MEASUREMENT (Page 15) 	Data used to predict the impact that coerced abstinence might have in North Carolina come from published reports on the evaluation of HOPE in Hawaii and from the North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission. HOPE data come from a randomized controlled trial of the program done in 2007 that followed 493 probationers over a 12 -month span of time starting in 2007. The North Carolina Sentencing Commission followed all 60, 824 offenders released from prison or placed on probation in FY 2005 / 2006. This included 41, 091 probationers, 12, 622 of whom were labeled by the courts as being somehow “drug-involved. ” 	Both datasets report on outcomes of interest, such as the probation revocation rate, re-arrest rate, incarceration, and continued drug use. They also report on background information that is useful for drawing comparisons between probationers in Hawaii and North Carolina, such as age, gender, race, prior criminal history, and risk assessment. PREDICTING THE IMPACT IN NORTH CAROLINA (Page 21) 	There are numerous limitations to attempting to predict the impacts of a HOPE-style program in North Carolina. Among these are latent background differences between the probationer populations in Hawaii and North Carolina, such as age, race, and criminal background. Additionally, the geographic, political, cultural, and other differences between states impact how such a program might work in different jurisdictions. Also, there are differences in how researchers tracked data between states. For example, Hawaii and North Carolina use different assessments to determine the risk of recidivism, and the available measures of prior criminal history, drug use, and other factors are tracked differently between states. 	Acknowledging the limitations in making predictions, it is possible to make tentative estimates of the potential impact of a coerced abstinence program on drug-involved offenders in North Carolina. Outcomes potentially include: •	A 50 % drop in technical probation revocations over 12 months. •	A 55 % reduction in the re-arrest rate of probationers over 12 months. •	Up to a 91 % reduction in drug crimes committed by drug-involved probationers in the first year of probation, or a 38 % reduction in drug-offenses over all probationers. •	Substantially fewer jail days served and reduced rates of incarceration among the treatment population. •	Improved public safety. POLICY ANALYSIS (Page 28) 	 	Even though preliminary research suggests that coerced abstinence programs are successful at reducing recidivism and drug use among probationers, such a policy may face many obstacles. First, coerced abstinence is founded on principles of behavioral economics and cognitive psychology, which may make it difficult to explain to policy makers and the public. This lack of understanding may breed skepticism of the program. 	Coerced abstinence might also offend two important groups of people: drug treatment advocates and probation officers. HOPE and similar programs seem to suggest that simple incentives can lead to dramatic reductions in substance abuse without any therapeutic medical treatment. Thus, it may be viewed as ‘competition’ to traditional, medical methods of addiction treatment. Also, if coerced abstinence does not achieve the total buy-in of probation officers, they are unlikely to cooperate with the implementation of such a program. Unless sanctions are applied to each and every probation violation, a coerced abstinence system cannot work. Getting probation officers on board with such a program may be difficult, however, because of the perceived workload. The primary reason so many probation violations currently go unpunished is because of severe resource strains on probation departments. It would simply be too time consuming to sanction every violation. This problem must be addressed in order to achieve the <b>cooperation</b> of probation <b>officers.</b> Additionally, there is the question of how well a coerced abstinence program works in the long-term. Existing research on the topic is favorable, but limited in scope. It may be difficult to win popular support for a program with unknown long-term consequences. HOPE and other ongoing coerced abstinence program evaluations need to be watched carefully in the coming years in order to determine how well they work over longer periods of time. IMPLEMENTATION (Page 29) 	Successful implementation of a HOPE-style program in North Carolina requires certain program elements, broad-based stakeholder buy-in, and effective leadership. Fortunately, the RCT of HOPE included a process evaluation that addressed how each of these objectives was achieved in Honolulu. 	The necessary program elements, according to researchers include monitoring, guaranteed sanctions, a clear set of rules, an initial warning hearing, prompt hearings, drug treatment for those who continue to fail drug tests, and the capacity to pursue those who fail to appear for probation meetings. These program elements, combined with a visible public champion or leader to maintain support for such a program, are essential to successful implementation. 	Myriad stakeholders are also necessary to ensure success. Probation officers, judges, prosecutors, public defenders, court staff, sheriffs, and probationers themselves must all agree to cooperate with the terms of a coerced abstinence program in order for it to work. Any inconsistency will erode the perception of guaranteed sanctions...|$|R
