40|$|Normal fault {{zones in}} sand - clay {{sequences}} {{play an important}} role in fluid flow of hydrocarbonand water in layered porous media on geological and production time scales. Therefore, theevolution of the hydro-mechanical parameters of these fault zones is of scientific and appliedimportance. The clay incorporated into the fault zone is called <b>Clay</b> <b>Gouge</b> or Clay-Smear. Thiswork addresses mechanical and kinematic aspects of these processes by physical modelling andfield studies, focusing on the analysis of the structure and continuity of <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> in 3 D. In an experimental setup, fully water-saturated sequences of sand and clay were sheared above arigid basement fault. Sequential photographs of the 2 D side view are processed by digital image correlation (Particle Imaging Velocimetry, PIV) to calculate the 2 D velocity field. This allowsstudy of the kinematic and structural evolution of the shear zone in detail. A method was developed to excavate the sheared clay layer at the end of deformation, providing insights into thethree-dimensional structure of the shear zones. Results show that side wall friction causes minor boundary effects. First order structural observations on the sides of the models are very similar to those observed inside of the models, however differences, especially in gouge thickness, continuity and composition are evident. Results show an inherent heterogeneity in structure and composition of the <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> in strike direction. The thickness of the gouge strongly varies in single experiments and clay can be absentin parts of the shear zone. In experiments with ductile clay the <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> can contain holes thatmake up about 0. 5 - 10 % of the sheared clay. The mixing of sand and clay at the top and bottom of the shear clay layer results in a strongly heterogeneous composition of the <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> and in athickness that can exceed that expected from simple shearing of the clay. Finally, the method to excavate the sheared clay was enhanced so that 3 D geomodels of the gouge volume could be obtained from laser scans, which for the first time allowed measurement of <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> thickness and its variability in 3 D. These newly developed methods can be used in the future to quantify the relationship between gouge thickness distribution and continuity and the mechanical and geometrical boundary conditions, so that existing methods to predict a <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> in thesubsurface can be enhanced improved. In a field study of normal fault zones in Miri, Sarawak (Borneo), the internal structure of a fault with <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> and about 25 m offset has been documented and mapped and the observations compared to sandbox experiments. Although the overall geometry of the natural prototype is much more complex than that of the experimental structures, structural similarities are many,these are discussed in relation to the structural evolution of <b>clay</b> <b>gouge.</b> In order to compare the experimental results with the structure and composition of clay-gouge in natural prototype fault zones, normal faults in siliciclastic sequences of clay-stone and sandstone VI have been documented and their structure has been interpreted. The field observations ofstructural and compositional heterogeneity are in good agreement with the results of the laboratory experiments. Like in the experiments, structure and composition of the clay-gouge varyin strike direction as well as in dip direction, with a local discontinuous gouge. The techniques presented in this work contributed to our understanding of <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> processesand its controlling factors and highlighted the importance of the third dimension, i. e. spatial variability and an apparently non-deterministic character of <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> processes...|$|E
40|$|The flow {{of water}} along discontinuities, such as {{fractures}} or faults, {{is of paramount importance}} in understanding the hydrogeology of many geological settings. An experimental study was undertaken comprising two experiments on a 30 ° slip-plane filled with kaolinite or Ball <b>Clay</b> <b>gouge</b> using a bespoke Angled Shear Rig (ASR). The gouge was initially loaded in equal step changes in vertical stress, followed by unloading of the sample in similar equal steps. This was followed by reloading to a new maximum stress, followed by unloading; the test history was therefore load-unload-reload-unload (LURU). The transmissivity of the kaolinite and Ball <b>Clay</b> <b>gouge</b> showed a power-law relationship with vertical stress. The LURU history showed considerable hysteresis, with flow effectively unchanged during unloading, even when vertical stress was close to zero. Reloading resulted in flow similar to that seen during unloading suggesting that the unloading-reloading path is similar to the rebound-reconsolidation line in classic soil mechanics. These observations show the importance of stress history on fracture flow; consideration of just the current stress acting upon a fracture may result in inaccuracies of predicted hydraulic flow. Once a new stress maximum was achieved the transmissivity of the fracture continued to reduce. No significant variation was seen in the flow response of kaolinite and Ball <b>Clay</b> <b>gouge</b> suggesting that the inclusion of illite and quartz did not have a significant influence on the form of the relationship between stress and flow, i. e. both described by a power-law...|$|E

30|$|The smectite-rich {{sediment}} {{with a total}} {{clay content}} of approximately 90 wt.% is comparable to pelagic mud in the décollement zone that was obtained at a drilling site close to the trench axis (Ujiie et al. 2013). At {{the base of the}} accretionary wedge, the main thrust fault penetrates the horst-and-graben structure of the subducting oceanic plate (Tsuji et al. 2011). Hence, not only pelagic sediments but also trench materials with various clay contents are involved in the main thrust zone. The frictional strength of the thrust fault at the depth of point a varies in the range of 6 to 50 MPa. The weakest material of smectite gradually transforms to illite at elevated temperatures and it almost disappears within the temperature range of 100 °C to 150 °C (Kimura et al. 2012; Saffer and Tobin 2011), which corresponds to segment b-c on the plate interface (see Figure 6 b).

40|$|To {{determine}} the correct fault rheology of the Transverse Ranges area of California, a new finite element to represent faults and a mangle drag element are introduced into {{a set of}} 63 simulation models of anelastic crustal strain. It is shown that a slip rate weakening rheology for faults is not valid in California. Assuming that mantle drag effects on the crust's base are minimal, the optimal coefficient of friction in the seismogenic portion of the fault zones is 0. 4 - 0. 6 (less than Byerly's law assumed to apply elsewhere). Depending on how the southern California upper mantle seismic velocity anomaly is interpreted, model results are improved or degraded. It is found that {{the location of the}} mantle plate boundary is the most important secondary parameter, and that the best model is either a low-stress model (fault friction = 0. 3) or a high-stress model (fault friction = 0. 85), each of which has strong mantel drag. It is concluded that at least the fastest moving faults in southern California have a low friction coefficient (approximtely 0. 3) because they contain low strength hydrated <b>clay</b> <b>gouges</b> throughout the low-temperature seismogenic zone...|$|R
30|$|Areas where {{circulation}} {{was lost}} during drilling and drilling breaks, {{both of which}} are typically noted on mud logs, are reliable indicators of major fractures and faults that may serve as geothermal fluid flow zones. Some large losses of circulation result in intermittent losses during the remainder of drilling. In this case, deep losses may actually be associated with loss zones at shallow levels. It is important, therefore, to interpret loss zone data along with geologic evidence for faulting, such as sections of shearing, <b>clay</b> <b>gouge,</b> or slickenlines identified in core or well cuttings, and the interpreted locations of faults from geophysical data. This ensures that the resultant structural model is consistent with all available data.|$|E

Microstructures show evidence for dominantly cataclastic and minor crystal plastic mechanisms (intergranular, transgranular, intragranular cracking, grain rotation, clay particle bending) down to the nanometre scale.

40|$|The {{numerous}} CO 2 reservoirs in the Colorado Plateau {{region of}} the United States are natural analogues for potential geologic CO 2 sequestration repositories. To better understand the risk of leakage from reservoirs used for long-term underground CO 2 storage, we examine evidence for CO 2 migration along two normal faults from a reservoir in east-central Utah. CO 2 -charged springs, geysers, and a hydrocarbon seep are localised along these faults. These include natural springs that have been active {{for long periods of}} time, and springs that were induced by recent drilling. The CO 2 -charged spring waters have deposited travertine mounds and carbonate veins. The faults cut siltstones, shales, and sandstones and the fault rocks are fine-grained, clay-rich gouge, generally thought to be barriers to fluid flow. The geologic and geochemical data are consistent with these faults being conduits for CO 2 to the surface. Consequently, the injection of CO 2 into faulted geologic reservoirs, including faults with <b>clay</b> <b>gouge,</b> must be carefully designed and monitored to avoid slow seepage or fast rupture to the biosphere...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{injection}} of CO 2 into a depleted reservoir will alter the pore pressure, which if sufficiently perturbed {{could result in}} fault reactivation. This paper presents an experimental study of fault reactivation potential in fully saturated kaolinite and Ball <b>Clay</b> fault <b>gouges.</b> Clear differences were observed in fault reactivation pressure when water was injected, {{with the addition of}} mica/illite in Ball Clay seen to reduce the pressure necessary for reactivation. Slip occurred once pore-pressure within the gouge was sufficient to overcome the normal stress acting on the fault. During gas injection localised dilatant pathways are formed with approximately only 15 % of the fault observing an elevated gas pressure. This localisation is insufficient to overcome normal stress and so reactivation is not initiated. Therefore faults are more likely to conduct gas than to reactivate. The Mohr approach of assessing fault reactivity potential gave mixed results. Hydro-mechanical coupling, saturation state, mineralogical composition and time-dependent features of the clay require inclusion in this approach otherwise experiments that are predicted to be stable result in fault reactivation...|$|R
40|$|The Dalradian Supergroup and its {{basement}} rocks, {{together with}} younger plutons, underpin {{most of the}} Grampian Highlands and the islands of the Inner Hebrides between the Highland Boundary and Great Glen faults. The Dalradian is a mid-Neoproterozoic to early-Ordovician sequence of largely clastic metasedimentary rocks, with some volcanic units, which were deformed and metamorphosed to varying degrees during the Early Palaeozoic Caledonian Orogeny. Sedimentation of the lower parts of the Dalradian Supergroup, possibly commencing about 730 million years ago, took place initially in fault-bounded rift basins, within the supercontinent of Rodinia and adjacent to sectors of continental crust that were later to become the foundations of North America, Greenland and Scandinavia. Later sedimentation reflected increased instability, culminating between 600 and 570 million years ago in continental rupture, volcanicity {{and the development of}} the Iapetus Ocean. This left the crustal foundations of Scotland, together with those of North America and Greenland, on a laterally extensive passive margin to the new continent of Laurentia, where turbiditic sedimentation continued for about 85 million years. Later plate movements led to closure of the Iapetus Ocean and the multi-event Caledonian Orogeny. Most of the deformation and metamorphism of the Dalradian strata peaked at about 470 million years ago, during the mid-Ordovician Grampian Event, which has been attributed to the collision of an oceanic arc with Laurentia. The later, mid-Silurian Scandian Event, attributed to the collision of the continent of Baltica with Laurentia and the final closure of the Iapetus Ocean, apparently had little effect on the Dalradian rocks but marked the start of late-orogenic uplift and extensive magmatism in the Grampian Highlands that continued until Early Devonian times. The Dalradian rocks thus record a wide range of sedimentary environments (alluvial, tidal, deltaic, shallow marine, turbiditic, debris flow) and a complex structural and metamorphic history. In areas of low strain, original sedimentary and volcanic structures are well preserved, even at relatively high metamorphic grades. There is convincing evidence for glacial episodes of worldwide importance and economic deposits of stratiform barium minerals are unique. The Grampian Highlands include two of the World's type-areas for metamorphic zonation, Barrovian and Buchan, with spectacular examples of the key metamorphic minerals, and various stages of migmatite development. Polyphase folding is widespread on all scales and gives rise to a range of associated cleavages and lineations.

40|$|International {{audience}} 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of syn-kinematic white mica (phengite) and biotite is used {{to constrain}} the age of shear zones within the granodiorites of the Grimsel Pass area (Aar Massif, Central Alps). Three sets of steeply dipping shear zones have been mapped. Stage 1 shear zones are very broad (200 m wide) zones of biotite-bearing rocks, with a progressive increase in intensity of ductile deformation from rim to core, and have dip-slip kinematics. Subsequent Stage 2 shear zones are narrower, contain phengite-rich mylonites, and show a gradual change from dextral strike-slip to dip-slip kinematics across strike. Strain localisation during the formation of Stage 2 shear zones is interpreted to have been aided by reaction-weakening during extensive fluid–rock interaction. Brittle precursors of Stage 2 shear zones are marked by biotite-rich cataclasites preserved along the northern contact of the overprinting main Stage 2 shear zone. Biotite from a Stage 1 shear zone yields an age of 21. 1 ± 0. 2 Ma. Phengites in Stage 2 mylonites in the Grimsel Pass area have a very narrow age range (13. 8 – 12. 2 Ma), which is interpreted to bracket the duration of ductile deformation during Stage 2 deformation at mid-crustal levels. However, the biotite-rich cataclasites at the margin of a Stage 2 shear zone may have localised fluid flow up to 2 Ma prior to the onset of main Stage 2 ductile deformation. Stage 3 shear zones are brittle strike-slip faults containing cataclasites, breccias and <b>clay</b> fault <b>gouges.</b> Earlier studies have established that these late faults formed at < 9 Ma and were active until at least 3 Ma...|$|R

30|$|Clay minerals, {{which are}} a main product of {{hydrothermal}} alteration (e.g., Meunier [2005]; Velde [1995]), sometimes have very low friction coefficients of approximately 0.3 (e.g., Morrow et al.

Therefore, {{it is not easy}} to estimate the frictional properties of clay-filled faults (Moore and Lockner [2007]). Many studies have been conducted on the relationship between the nature of fracture fillings and fault mechanics. Zoback et al. ([2012]) and Kohli and Zoback ([2013]) investigated the relationship between clay content and the mechanical friction of shale gas reservoir samples under wet conditions. They observed a linear decrease of the friction coefficient with increasing clay content (Figure 1 a) from 0.8 with 10 wt.% clay to 0.4 at approximately 50 wt.% clay. Similar results have been obtained by Tembe et al. ([2010]) for artificial <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> samples of quartz and illite and for natural soil samples tested by Akayuli et al. ([2013]).

For standard membrane seal analysis, seal capacity is estimated by quantifying capillary pressure-related measurements and calibrating them with a large observational database of hydrocarbon column heights and measured buoyancy pressures. The seal capacity estimation process has historically been adjusted to account for a number of different generic trapping geometries. We define the characteristics of these geometries from a hydrodynamics viewpoint in order to fine-tune the seal capacity calibration process. From theoretical analyses of several simplified trapping geometries, it can be concluded that generally, the high pressure side of the seal should be used as the water pressure gradient with which to calculate buoyancy pressure. Secondly, trap geometries where hydrocarbon is reservoired on both sides of a fault are not useful for estimating across fault seal capacity...|$|R
30|$|Because our {{methodology}} {{is focused}} on structurally controlled geothermal systems, we assume that all fault zones in the 3 D geologic map {{have the potential to}} act as fluid upwelling zones and that all areas outside of fault zones have no potential to act as fluid upwelling zones. Both of these assumptions are inherently flawed. Many geologic formations can have abundant matrix or fracture permeability and may serve as stratigraphic reservoirs. Additionally, fluid upwelling in geothermal fields is generally spatially discrete (e.g., Caine et al. 1996, 2010; Caine and Forster 1999; Fairley et al. 2003; Fairley and Hinds 2004; Mitchell and Faulkner 2012; Meller and Kohl 2014), which means that most segments along faults are impermeable to upflow. This may be a function of the generation of <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> during faulting or hydrothermal mineralization, both of which can seal faults. However, in the structurally controlled geothermal systems evaluated here, the most prominent geothermal upwellings occur along fault zones (e.g., Richards and Blackwell 2002). By assuming that only faults conduct fluid upwelling and that the whole fault system has the potential to host upflow, we can evaluate which geologic factors are most highly coincident with known upwelling zones. The calculated potential for upwelling within each fault segment can be enhanced relative to other fault segments by any or all of the three following proxies for permeability: (1) the stress state of the fault, (2) location of that fault relative to structural discontinuities, and (3) host rock lithology.|$|E

Detailed geologic and fracture scanline mapping coupled with structural analyses in the Pinebrook subdivision, one site within the Snyderville basin demonstrating abrupt hydrogeologic changes, provide {{a clearer picture of}} the local hydrogeologic setting. The dominant map-scale structure is the Twomile Canyon anticline. Several macroscopic faults cut this fold, including the Toll Canyon fault, a backthrust off the Mount Raymond thrust. Fracture orientations and densities vary within meters across the Twomile Canyon anticline as a function of lithology and position relative to macroscopic faults. Exposures of the Toll Canyon fault show that the width and lithologic composition of the fault core and related damaged zone are a function of lithology, and the fault strongly controls fracture permeability.

Analysis of core from two holes drilled through the fault zone, combined with geologic mapping and detailed investigation from three outcrops, define the fault geometry and physical {{properties of the}} Chelungpu fault in its northern and southern regions. In the northern region the fault dips 45 °– 60 ° east, parallel to bedding in both the hanging wall and footwall, and consists of a narrow (1 – 20 cm) core of dark gray, sheared <b>clay</b> <b>gouge.</b> The gouge {{is located at the}} base of a 30 - to 50 -m zone of increased fracture density confined asymmetrically to the hanging wall. Microstructural analysis of the fault gouge indicates the presence of extremely narrow clay zones (50 – 300 µm thick) that are interpreted as the fault rupture surfaces. Few shear indicators are observed outside of the fault gouge, implying that slip was localized within the gouge zone. Slip localization along a bed-parallel surface resulted in a narrow gouge zone that produced less high-frequency ground motion and larger displacements (average 8 m) during the earthquake than in the southern region. Displacement in the southern region averaged only 2 m, but ground shaking consisted of large amounts of high-frequency ground motion. The fault in the southern region dips 20 °– 30 ° at the surface and consists of a wide (20 – 70 m thick) zone of sheared, foliated shale with numerous gouge zones.

40|$|Natural faults produce {{granular}} wear material, {{known as}} gouge or cataclasite, {{as a function}} of shear and grinding along the slipping surfaces. The characteristics of fault gouge have been studied extensively in the field, laboratory, and numerical simulations in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of fault mechanics (e. g., Marone and Scholz, 1989). However, observations of natural fault gouges in active fault zones can still provide precious information about fault activity and mechanical processes acting during fault evolution. Here, we report detailed microstructural observations (optical and electronic microscopy) on natural fault rocks from the scarp of an active fault in carbonate rocks: the Tre Monti fault, in the Lazio-Abruzzi Apennines. This area is one of the most seismic regions in the Mediterranean area (e. g., L’Aquila Earthquake, Mw 6. 3, 2009). We revealed, for the first time in this area, the occurrence of very comminute localization zones enriched with exotic material mostly composed of clays of the smectite group, minor biotite/muscovite, quartz, feldspar and other minerals. Clay minerals completely enwrap carbonate particles (< 10 μm) and thick clay rich zones show fluid-like structures, carrying small carbonate particles in them. Previous studies in this area considered fault cataclasites to be composed only of carbonate wear material, smeared from pure limestones exposed in the footwall of the faults (Agosta and Kirschner, 2003). Chemical analysis confirmed that allogenic material derives from smearing and infiltration from clay-rich sedimentary sequences (Orbulina Marls Fm. and Flysch deposits.), within the fault zone. Moreover geophysical and geological studies revealed that Orbulina Marls and Flysch deposits occur in the hangingwall of the Tre Monti fault, buried beneath Plio-Pleistocene continental deposits (Cavinato et al., 2002), this evidence confirms our observations. Using field and microstructural data is possible to reconstruct the long-term evolution of a fault. Lithological juxtaposition during time, along a fault plane, can change the mechanical properties and fault strength by mixing of different lithologies progressively involved during fault activity. This mixing could control different deformation mechanism and earthquake potential, both in terms of nucleation and propagation.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{processes of}} localization during incipient faulting in mudrocks at about 1. 5 km depth, episodic fluid flow and resealing, {{and the formation}} of slickensided surfaces, scaly <b>clay</b> and <b>gouge</b> in deformed Opalinus clay. To understand the microstructural evolution of deformed clay is crucial in earthquake research,hydrocarbon and water exploration and in the evaluation of clay formations as long-term underground repositories for radioactive waste. Microtectonic analysis contributes significantly to comprehend sealing capacities and deformation behavior of clay-rich rocks. This thesis provides detailed descriptive investigations of deformed microstructures in over‑consolidated Opalinus Clay from the Mont Terri URL, where the suitability of this formationto host radioactive waste is examined. The lithological and environmental controls on fault rock microstructure and rheology are fairly well known from numerous studies at this location. The investigated samples were taken from the so-called Main Fault, a low offset (10 m) thrust in the Opalinus clay in the Mont Terri anticline. They are exceptionally well preserved, and unaffected by weathering or coring-induced damage. A combination of methods were integrated in a multiscale analysis, from m-scale outcrop mapping, ultra-thin section microscopy to transmission electron microscopy. In particular, Broad-Ion-Beam milling was used to create flat, undamaged, mm² large cross-sections for SEM investigations. Five major structural features were found and described: (1) slickensides, which are in crosssectional view associated to (2) a μm thin zone of slickenside-parallel oriented particles, (3) gouge, (4) calcite and celestite veins and (5) scaly clay. We found a significant loss of porosity in gouge, veins and the thin shear zone compared to the protolith. From the descriptive results of tectonically deformed Opalinus clay, several deformation mechanisms were inferred. There are strong indicators for cataclasis and (local) diffuse mass transfer via pressure solution-precipitation. However, signs for neoformation of clay particles and intracrystalline plasticity are also present. Samples from laboratory deformation tests also show brittle failure of OPA along thin shear zones. Microstructural analysis confirms that synthetic and tectonic slickensides show strong similarities, however differences lie in the occurrence of calcite vein patches, in the slickenside roughness and in the abundance of inter-granular fractures. Indicators for non-brittle deformation mechanisms, such as calcite patches at slickenside risers indicate a deformation rate sensitive evolution of fault rocks from the Main Fault. Hence a more viscous-frictional (i. e. more static) behavior can be expected for tectonic deformation, differing to rock mechanical behavior gained from (rapid) laboratory experiments. Delocalized strain in scaly clay, with local brittle shear in thin shear zones indicates frictional sliding with extreme strain partitioning. Gouge shows a strong fabric intensity and a strict P-orientation of particles, which indicates aductile deformation of the gouge in the mm-μm range. Gouge is interpreted to form by a combination of two geometric processes: First, progressive deformation of scaly clay leads to an increased density of thin shear zones which develop an anastomosing network. In this network, the size distribution is power law, implying that there is {{a very large number of}} small microlithons. When the size of the microlithons becomes comparable to the thickness of the thin shear zones (3 μm), the thin shear zones start to coalesce, forming gouge. With furtherdeformation, the gouge boundaries are eroded by a reactive abrasion-dissolution process, where particle size reduction and calcite dissolution generate a sharp, moving boundary of darker gouge into brighter wall rock. There are two types of gouge, with differences in fabric intensity, foliation orientation, color, grain and host rock clast abundance and internal thin shear zones. The gouge types are interpreted as early (low strain) and mature (high strain) gouge. This interpretation of the formation of the gouge by progressive deformation of the scaly clay is comparable with the development of a mylonite into an ultramylonite...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} reports on {{elemental}} and Sr isotopic analyses of calcite and associated celestite infillings of various microtectonic features collected {{mostly in the}} Main Fault of the Opalinus Clay from Mont Terri rock laboratory. Based on a detailed microstructural description of veins, slickensides, scaly <b>clay</b> aggregates and <b>gouges,</b> the geochemical signatures of the infillings were compared {{to those of the}} leachates from undeformed Opalinus Clay, and to the calcite from veins crosscutting Hauptrogenstein, Passwang and Staffelegg Formations above and below the Opalinus Clay. Vein calcite and celestite from Main Fault yield identical 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios that are also close to those recorded in the Opalinus Claymatrix inside the Main Fault, but {{different from those of the}} diffuse Opalinus Clay calcite outside the fault. These varied 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the diffuse calcite evidence a lack of interaction among the associated connate waters and the flowing fluids characterized by a homogeneous Sr signature. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr homogeneity at 0. 70774 ± 0. 00001 (2 r) for the infillings of most microstructures in the Main Fault, as well as of veins from nearby limestonelayer and sediments around the Opalinus Clay, claims for an ‘‘infinite’’ homogeneous marine supply, whereas the gouge infillings apparently interacted with a fluid chemically more complex. According to the known regional paleogeographic evolution, two seawater supplies were inferred and documented in the Dele´mont Basin: either during the Priabonian (38 – 34 Ma ago) from western Bresse graben, and/or during the Rupelian (34 – 28 Ma ago) from northern Rhine Graben. The Rupelian seawater that yields a mean 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signature significantly higher than those of the microstructural infillings seems not to be the appropriate source. Alternatively, Priabonian seawater yields a mean 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio precisely matching that of the leachates from diffuse calcite of the Opalinus Clay inside the Main Fault, as well as that of its microstructures and the same features of the sediments above and below. To envision a Priabonian seawater supply, there is a need for its storage without a significant evolution in its Sr isotopic composition until the final deformation of the area. The paleo-hydrogeological context calls for a possible infiltration of the seawater into a limestone karst located above the Opalinus Clay that could have acted as the storage reservoir. The karstic nature of this reservoir also explains why the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of the fluids was not modified significantly until expulsion. An alternative storage could have been provided by the regional faultingsystem that developed during the contemporary regional rifting of the Rhine Graben. The fluid expulsion started along these extensional faults during the further Upper Eocene–Lower Oligocene rifting phase. Later, the thin skinned deformation of the Jura Belt affected the Mont Terri region in the form of the Main Fault, probably between approximately 9 and 4 Ma on the basis of preliminary K–Ar ages of nanometer-sized authigenic illite crystals recovered from gouge samples...|$|R
40|$|Clays are {{a common}} {{component}} of fault gouge, but their genesis and importance in fault evolution is poorly understood. We present preliminary evidence that clays participate in extensive mineral reactions and microfabric changes during faulting. Rather than thinking of clay reactions {{as a consequence of}} mechanical processes or fault localization following diagenetically altered horizons, we see the interplay between clay mineral reactions and mechanical processes as a single, integrated process. Furthermore, faulting may lower kinetic barriers to low-temperature (01008 C) mineral reactions that are common in sedimentary rocks. Our most striking example of fault diagenesis-deformation is a profile of %illite in mixed-layer illite/smectite in shales beneath the Lewis Thrust, Canada. Whereas burial diagenesis caused minimal smectite-to-illite reaction, shales within meters of the thrust are almost completely converted to illite. The consequences of these changes are manifested in geochemical, geochronologic and microfabric characteristics of <b>clay</b> <b>gouge.</b> In this example, faulting has helped overcome a kinetic barrier in the smectite-to-illite reaction without appreciable addition of heat. In another example we infer that dissolution–precipitation reactions continue during faulting even when smectite has already been completely transformed to illite. If mineral reactions intimately interact with mechanical processes in shallow-crustal faults, then our current understanding of the mechanical and hydraulic properties of fault zones may be incomplete. Syndeformational mineral reactions and associated fabric changes could make faults much weaker than would be expected from evaluation of the static mineral assemblage of gouge and single crystal properties. Syndeformational mineral reactions may promote fault slip (aecting earthquake activity) in gouge-bearing faults under stress conditions considerably lower than predicted from static mineral properties. In addition, fault-induced dissolution-precipitation reactions may contribute to fault localization. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to identifying the source and age of paleofluids associated with low‐temperature deformation in the brittle crust, using hydrogen isotopic compositions (δD) and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology of authigenic illite in clay gouge‐bearing fault zones. The procedure involves grain‐size separation, polytype modeling, and isotopic analysis, creating a mixing line that is used to extrapolate to δD and age of pure authigenic and detrital material. We use this method on samples collected along the surface trace of today's North Anatolian Fault (NAF). δD values of the authigenic illite population, obtained by extrapolation, are − 89 [*]±[*] 3 ‰, − 90 [*]±[*] 2 ‰, and − 97 [*]±[*] 2 ‰ (VSMOW) for samples KSL, RES 4 ‐ 1, and G 1 G 2, respectively. These correspond to δD fluid values of − 62 ‰ to − 85 ‰ for the temperature range of 125 °C[*]±[*] 25 °, indistinguishable from present‐day precipitation values. δD values of the detrital illite population are − 45 [*]±[*] 13 ‰, − 60 [*]±[*] 6 ‰, and − 64 [*]±[*] 6 ‰ for samples KSL, G 1 G 2, and RES 4 ‐ 1, respectively. Corresponding δD fluid values at 300 °C are − 26 ‰ to − 45 ‰ and match values from adjacent metamorphic terranes. Corresponding <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> ages are 41. 4 [*]±[*] 3. 4 Ma (authigenic) and 95. 8 [*]±[*] 7. 7 Ma (detrital) for sample G 2 and 24. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 6 Ma (authigenic) and 96. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 8 Ma (detrital) for sample RES 4 ‐ 1, demonstrating a long history of meteoric fluid infiltration in the area. We conclude that today's NAF incorporated preexisting, weak clay‐rich rocks that represent earlier mineralizing fluid events. The samples preserve at least three fluid flow pulses since the Eocene and indicate that meteoric fluid has been circulating in the upper crust in the North Anatolian Keirogen since that time.

40|$|The late Miocene Cedar Springs fault {{system is}} a high-angle transpressional system in the Silverwood Lake area, western San Bernardino Mountains, {{southern}} California. This thesis presents the study of oblique-slip faults with modest amounts of slip, which represent {{the early stages of}} fault development by using slip as a proxy for maturity. A structural and geochemical characterization is provided for six fault zones ranging from 39 m of slip to 3. 5 km of offset in order to develop a model of fault zone geometry and composition. Basic geometric and kinematic results are provided for an additional 29 small-displacement (cm- to m-scale) faults. The main faults of this study can be divided into the fault core composed of sheared <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> and micro breccia, the primary damage zone made up of chemically altered rock with microstructural damage and grain-size reduction, and the secondary damage zone, which is characterized by an increased fracture density relative to the host rock. Although {{there appears to be a}} general increase in fault core thickness with increasing slip, the correlation is insignificant when analyzing all faults. Both the primary and secondary damage zones appear to thicken with increased slip on the main fault. Overall, the structure and composition of the faults studied here are similar to those of larger strike-slip and reverse faults. This indicates that the fault core develops early in a fault 2 ̆ 7 s history. Subsequent slip appears to be focused along these narrow zones, with some deformation accumulating in the damage zone. Whole-rock geochemical analyses typically show a reduction in the abundance of Na, Al, K, and Ca in the fault core and primary damage zone relative to the host rock. This indicates enhanced fluid-rock interactions in these zones. Calculations of the energy consumed to produce the chemical alteration in the fault core indicate that a considerable amount of the total earthquake energy may be lost to alteration. This thesis concludes that fault processes are similar throughout the different stages of development, and the study of relatively small-displacement faults can therefore be used to understand fault evolution through time and the processes of larger faults in the brittle crust...|$|E

Abstract: Laser ablation 40 Ar/ 39 Ar step-heating analyses for encapsulated and unencapsulated pseudotachylytes from a Neoproterozoic normal fault belonging to the St. Lawrence rift system (Canada) preserve the absolute timing of rifting and initial opening of the Iapetus Ocean. The total gas and retention ages for encapsulated pseudotachylytes from the Montmorency fault (Quebec City) are 610. 3 ± 4. 6 Ma and 619. 0 ± 2. 5 Ma. Ten unencapsulated analyses from two pseudotachylyte veins with varying matrix/clast ratios yield total gas ages of 634. 7 ± 1. 6 – 663. 9 ± 1. 8 Ma. These ages show an excellent linear relationship with the proportion of clast inclusions, resulting in lower intercept ages (i. e., no host rock) of 613. 3 and 614. 2 Ma. These statistically indistinguishable ages constrain major seismic faulting along the St. Lawrence rift system and signifi cantly improve prior estimates for late Neoproterozoic rifting of Iapetus. The upper intercepts, refl ecting host-rock ages, match cooling ages of Grenville basement in the area. We conclude that the time of major continental rifting along the northern Laurentian margin and initiation of the Iapetus Ocean occurred at 613 – 614 Ma, coeval with emplacement of the 615 Ma Long Range dikes of Labrador. This study also demonstrates that Ar geochronology of pseudotachylytes using varying clast/matrix ratios is a robust method to date ancient faulting. Crystallization and resetting of low-temperature muscovite; 1 Fault and cleavage dating along the Champlain Thrust (VT), Northern Appalachians Abstract: 40 Ar/ 39 Ar step-heating analyses were performed on fine-grained muscovite separates from low-grade (anchizonal) mylonites and slates to test a new approch in interpreting 40 Ar/ 39 Ar results for fine-grained <b>clays</b> in fault <b>gouge.</b> The Champlain fault in northwestern Vermont is an ideal site to study 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology and thermochronology of fine-grained illite in phyllonites and slates. Being among the first descriptions of a thrust fault, the temporal history and geochronologic age of the Champlain thrust has never been determinedremained enigmatic. We present an illite characterization and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar step-heating study of phyllonites from the Champlain thrust and slates from the footwall Ordovician Iberville Formation. Laser ablation 40 Ar/ 39 Ar step-heating analyses were conducted on two samples from a 2 - 3 m thick phyllonite (center and contact with hanging wall) and a thinly cleaved slate containing micron to submicron illite grains. Illite crystallinity and microstructural observations show that the phyllonites and slates experienced anchizonal metamorphism (~ 200 - 300 °C). X-ray polytype quantification and TEM imaging show that the samples contain a mixture of detrital and authigenic 2 M 1 and digenetic 1 Md illite. Sample collected {{at the center of}} the phyllonite, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar analyses of the two finer grain-size fractions yield retention ages of 338 Ma, while a third coarser fraction produces a retention age of 376 Ma. For the hanging-wall contact sample, all three grain-size fractions yield 40 Ar/ 39 Ar retention ages around 260 Ma. Linear mixing modeling of total gas and retention 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages from illite separates from the Iberville Formation yielded an age of 350. 6 ± 1. 2 Ma for the timing of slaty cleavage formation. These results suggest that, following initial Middle to Late Ordovician emplacement, the Champlain thrust experienced two pulses of late Paleozoic metamorphism and deformation. Silurian – E. Mississippian, Acadian-Neoacadian tectonism caused clay mineral transformations and isotopic loss of 40 Ar by diffusion in illite in the Champlain Thrust and Iberville Formation. The second pulse caused thermal resetting and overprinting of Acadian-Neoacadian illite that is localized along the boundary with the hanging wall during the L. Mississippian – Permian Alleghanian Orogeny. Regionally, our results show that thermal effects associated with the Acadian- Neoacadian and Alleghanian orogenies caused low-grade clay transformations as far away as northwestern Vermont...|$|R

40|$|The Main Fault in the shaly facies of Opalinus Clay {{is a small}} {{reverse fault}} formed in {{slightly}} overconsolidated claystone at around 1  km depth. The fault zone is up to 6  m wide, with micron-thick shear zones, calcite and celestite veins, scaly clay and <b>clay</b> <b>gouge.</b> Scaly clay occurs in up to 1. 5  m wide lenses, providing hand specimens for this study. We mapped the scaly clay fabric at 1  m– 10  nm scale, examining scaly clay {{for the first time}} using broad-ion beam polishing combined with scanning electron microscopy (BIB-SEM). Results show a network of thin shear zones and microveins, separating angular to lensoid microlithons between 10  cm and 10  µm in diameter, with slickensided surfaces. Our results show that microlithons are only weakly deformed and that strain is accumulated by fragmentation of microlithons by newly formed shear zones, by shearing in the micron-thick zones and by rearrangement of the microlithons. The scaly clay aggregates can be easily disintegrated into individual microlithons because of the very low tensile strength of the thin shear zones. Analyses of the microlithon size by sieving indicate a power-law distribution model with exponents just above 2. From this, we estimate that only 1  vol % of the scaly clay aggregate is in the shear zones. After a literature review of the hypotheses for scaly clay generation, we present a new model to explain the progressive formation of a self-similar network of anastomosing thin shear zones in a fault relay. The relay provides the necessary boundary conditions for macroscopically continuous deformation. Localization of strain in thin shear zones which are locally dilatant, and precipitation of calcite veins in dilatant shear fractures, evolve into complex microscale re-partitioning of shear, forming new shear zones while the microlithons remain much less deformed internally and the volume proportion of the µm-thick shear zones slowly increases. Grain-scale deformation mechanisms are microfracturing, boudinage and rotation of mica grains, pressure solution of carbonate fossils and pore collapse during ductile flow of the clay matrix.

Analysis of core from two holes drilled through the fault zone, combined with geologic mapping and detailed investigation from three outcrops, define the fault geometry and physical {{properties of the}} Chelungpu fault in its northern and southern regions. In the northern region, the fault dips 45 - 60 ° east parallel to bedding and consists of a narrow (1 - 20 cm) core of dark-gray, sheared <b>clay</b> <b>gouge</b> {{at the base of}} a 30 - 50 m zone of increased fracture density that is confined asymmetrically to the hanging wall. Microstructural analysis of the fault gouge indicates the presence of extremely narrow clay zones (50 - 300 μm thick) that are interpreted as the fault rupture surfaces. Few shear indicators are observed outside of the fault gouge, which implies that slip was localized in the gouge in the northern region. Slip localization along a bed-parallel surface resulted in less high-frequency ground motion and larger displacements during the earthquake than in the southern region. Observations from the southern region indicate that the fault dips 20 - 30 ° at the surface and consists of a wide (20 - 70 m-thick) zone of sheared, foliated shale with numerous gouge zones. A footwall-ramp geometry juxtaposes 2000 - 3000 m of flat-lying Quaternary Toukoshan Formation in the footwall with Pliocene and Miocene, east-dipping siltstone and muds tone in the hanging wall. The wide, diffuse fault zone contributed to the lower displacement and higher frequency ground motion in the southern region during the 1999 earthquake. The structure in the northern region is the result of the fault being a very young (3 ̆c 50 3 ̆eka) fault segment in the hanging wall of an older segment of the Chelungpu fault, buried in the Taichung basin. The fault in the southern region is located on an older (1 Ma) fault trace.

The well was drilled by Noramex Corp, a Nevada company, with funding support from the US Department of Energy, under the DOE’s GRED II Program. Deep Blue No. 2 was drilled as a ‘step-out’ hole from Deep Blue No. 1, to further evaluate the commercial potential of the geothermal resource. Deep Blue No. 2 {{was designed as a}} vertical, slim observation test hole to a nominal target depth of 1000 meters (nominal 3400 feet). The well tests an area of projected high temperatures at depth, from temperature gradients measured in a group of shallow drill holes located approximately one kilometer to the northeast of observation hole Deep Blue No. 1. The well is not intended for, or designed as, a commercial well or a production well. Deep Blue No. 2 was spudded on March 25, 2004 and completed to a total depth of 1127. 76 m (3700 ft) on April 28, 2004. The well was drilled using conventional rotary drilling techniques to a depth of 201. 17 m (660 ft), and continuously cored from 201. 17 m (660 ft) to 1127. 76 m (3700 ft). A brief rig-on flow-test was conducted at completion to determine basic reservoir parameters and obtain fluid samples. A permeable fracture zone with measured temperatures of 150 to 167 °C (302 to 333 °F) occurs between 500 to 750 m (1640 to 2461 ft). The well was left un-lined in anticipation of the Phase III - Flow and Injection Testing. A further Kuster temperature survey was attempted after the well had been shut in for almost 3 weeks. The well appears to have bridged off at 439 m (1440 ft) as the Kuster tool was unable to descend past this point. Several attempts to dislodge the obstruction using tube jars were unsuccessful. Deep Blue No. 2 encountered variably fractured and veined, fine-grained rocks of the Singas Formation, and intruded by minor strongly altered fine-grained felsic dikes, and less altered fineto medium-grained felsic to intermediate dikes. Widespread open fractures and extensive of quartz veining in many intervals of the core indicate a high degree of fracturing and flow of silica-bearing fluids, almost certainly hotter than 200 °C (392 °F), at some time, but these fractures are now partially sealed. Intervals of soft shaly mudstone, common <b>clay</b> <b>gouge,</b> and rocks with generally low permeability (few veins and fractures) may also form a seal or ‘cap’ above the main high temperature reservoir at Blue Mountain.

40|$|This project {{examines}} the composition, structure, and geophysical properties of rocks sampled within the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) borehole drilling experiment near Parkfield, California. Cuttings, sidewall cores, spot-core, and whole-rock core are examined from the meso- to micro-scale {{to characterize the}} nearfault environment at shallow crustal levels (0 - 4 km) along the central segment of the San Andreas fault. The central segment deforms by contiuous aseismic creep and microseismicity. An integrated approach utilizing core-logging, detailed structural core mapping, petrology, microstructural analyses, whole-rock geochemistry, borehole geophysics, and analog field studies is followed. At SAFOD, fractured granitic rocks and arkosic sediments are identified west of the San Andreas fault zone on the Pacific Plate; whereas sheared fine-grained sediments, ultrafine black fault-related rocks, and serpentinite-bearing fault gouge are present within and northeast of the fault zone on the North American Plate. Here, the fault consists of a broad zone of variably damaged rock containing localized zones of highly concentrated shear that often juxtapose distinct rock-types. Two zones of serpentinite-bearing <b>clay</b> <b>gouge,</b> each meters-thick are found in two locations where active aseismic creep was identified in the borehole. The gouge is composed of Mg-rich clays, serpentinite (lizardite ± chrysotile) with notable increases in magnetite, and Fe-, Ni-, and Cr-oxides/hydroxides and Fe-sulfides relative to the surrounding host rock. Organic carbon is locally high within fractures and bounding slip surfaces. The rocks adjacent to and within the two gouge zones display a range of deformation including intensely fractured regions, blockin- matrix fabrics, and foliated cataclasite structure. The blocks and clasts predominately consist of competent sandstone and siltstone embedded in a clay-rich matrix that displays a penetrative scaly fabric. Mineral alteration, veins, fracture-surface coatings, and slickelined surfaces are present throughout the core, and reflect {{a long history of}} syndeformation and fluid-rock reaction that contributes to the low-strength and creep in the meters-thick gouge zones. Evaluation of borehole geophysical data and elastic modulii for the lithologic and structural units identified in the SAFOD Phase 3 core reveal a correlation between composition and textures and the structural and/or permeability architecture of the SAF at SAFOD. Highly reduced velocity and elastic modulii surround the two serpentinitev bearing gouge zones, the Buzzard Canyon fault to the southwest, and another bounding fault to the northeast. Velocity and elastic moduli values on the Pacific Plate or southeast of the active fault trace intersected by SAFOD are much higher relative to the values measured on the North American Plate, or northeast of the fault trace. Within and adjacent to the two active gouge zones, the rock properties are highly variable over short distances, however, they are significantly lower relative to material outside of the fault zones. This research contributes critical evidence for rock properties and slip behavior within an active plate boundary fault. Results from this research and the SAFOD experiment help to constrain numerous hypotheses related to fault zone behavior and earthquake generation within central California...|$|E

The Little Grand Wash fault has 260 m of throw and the stratigraphic separation across the Salt Wash Graben is 50 m. The fault rocks in the damage zone show hundreds of fractures, which decrease in density {{farther away from the}} faults. In specific areas, fractures with the presence of calcite mineralization indicate fluid migration and bleach zones from a few millimeters to 30 cm. This is evidence of past fluid migration directly associated with the fault zone. Calcite mineralization fills these fractures and is also deposited in a variety of other bed forms. Foliated fault gouge, 5 to 20 cm thick, forms clay smear structures with a scaly shear fabric in a zone l 0 to 15 cm thick is seen in the fault core. The leakage is constrained to the footwalls of the northernmost faults throughout the area. Clay-rich gouge structures should be effective barriers to cross-fault flow. Well log, surface geologic, and geochemical data indicate that the CO 2 reservoirs have been cut by the faults at depth, providing a conduit for the vertical migration of CO 2 to the surface, but not for horizontal flow across the fault plane. Even though lateral cross-fault migration may be impeded, this study clearly indicates that there are possible migration pathways for the escape of CO 2 from faulted subsurface aquifers, including aquifers faulted by 2 ̆ 2 low-permeability 2 ̆ 2 faults with <b>clay</b> <b>gouge.</b> Three-dimensional flow models show how the fault 2 ̆ 7 s maximum permeability in the damage zone is parallel to the faults, and the leakage though the damage zone is localized near the fold axis of the regional anticline. Direct dating of the clay in the fault gouge was done by ExxonMobil with 40 Ar/ 39 Ar methods, indicating that fault movement occurred between the middle Eocene {{and the end of the}} Miocene. During this time, the Colorado Plateau is interpreted to have been experiencing rapid uplift. The middle Jurassic, upper Jurassic, and Cretaceous rocks at the surface have been uplifted approximately 1. 8 km since the end of the Eocene. This uplift may have influenced fault movement in the Colorado Plateau and along the Little Grand Wash fault, and Salt Wash and Ten Mile Graben. In evaluating these deep aquifers for CO 2 sequestration, careful design and monitoring of the geological structure and stress regimes must be considered to avoid leakage...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} aspects of brittle {{deformation}} in cohesive lithologies. The pursued concept involves multiscale observations {{carried out on}} case studies ranging from satellite images and field outcrops down to the scale of microstructural work to describe and isolate feedback characteristics of brittle failure. Although the collection of observations on fracture geometry and properties is largely static, attempts are made to highlight the evolution of selected properties for the formulation of simple models. Based on theoretical considerations and scaled physical models, the governing parameters of selected feedback systems are analyzed and discussed. The examples shown in this thesis highlight that the evolution of fracture systems shows massive changes in geometry and transport properties over time and {{emphasizes the importance of}} negative and positive feedback characteristics. CHAPTER 2 illustrates the development of fault zones in normal faults in overconsolidated claystones of the Variscan Fault- and Thrustbelt. Based on purely mechanical fragmentation, four lithotypes can be identified among normal fault systems that were active during the late stage of exhumation. Although the four lithotypes show a progressive increase in damage, the transport properties – as revealed by SEM analyses and Hg-porosimetry – suggest first a massive increase of permeability, followed by a significant drop with the formation of a tight <b>clay</b> <b>gouge.</b> Although the four lithotypes display successive stages, the heterogeneous occurrences of the different types within the fault zone complicate fault property predictions. This shows that the properties of the fault system can change significantly in space and time. CHAPTER 3 describes the structural inventory and evolutionary stages of an exhumed high-pressure cell in carbonate lithology at Jabal Shams/Oman. The multistage deformation is described by crosscutting relationships of cemented veins and faults. The formation of vein and fault systems is characterized by re-sealing of the fractures by calcite cementation. Although restoring the systems strength to large parts, the successive fracturing events show signs for mechanical interaction, leading to enhanced fragmentation among the fault strands. This well-described example illustrates the importance of mechanical feed-back in a system of constantly restoring strength. The rather isolated field observations of Chapter 3 are extended by a synoptic interpretation of remote sensing data in CHAPTER 4. The interpretation of the fault and fracture network on high-resolution data sets shows that the density of the vein network is not changing significantly with proximity to faults. The density of the fractures is a function of lithological parameters and shows similar densities throughout individual beds. However the densities of individual directional sets yield a patchy distribution. This suggests that a lateral extrapolation of fracture distributions over a large distance is not generally valid as the fractures of individual vein sets in this system may have formed in local events. CHAPTER 5 focuses on a special form of vein texture found in the study area at Jabal Shams. A supersaturated fracture network produces decimeter sized patches of calcite veins within dark carbonate and shows evidence for numerous repeated crack-seal events. As the cement yields a slightly higher strength as the matrix, newly formed fractures form adjacent to pre-existing veins resulting in an anastomosing vein pattern with extremely high fracture densities. Within this framework we discuss the effects of mechanical strength of the matrix, the cement and the interface on fracture localization. CHAPTER 6 discusses the evolution of dilatant fracture volume in a normal fault system of an analogue model. This purely mechanical system is analyzed in 4 D with a computer tomograph to obtain visual information on the geometry of the evolving fracture network and to allow statistical analyses on the population of the open-mode volumes over time. It is shown that in a system with natural material heterogeneity the distribution of dilatant jogs yields complex patterns. The first self-similar percolating volume in the experiment illustrates the potential of 3 D connectivity of dilatant jogs. The experiment further more shows the interplay of mechanical and geometrical governed systems. As the fractures form in response to the stress field, a discrepancy between the orientation of the fractures and the kinematic framework of the system leads to deformation cycles in which the system is required to constantly adapt. This is reflected by non-linear changes in the fracture volume growth rate and fracture population. Non-linear cycles of rupture and fault growth are in our experiment linked purely to mechanical feedback without the need for additional complexity such as forced-fluid infiltration or chemical alteration due to dissolution and cementation...|$|E
