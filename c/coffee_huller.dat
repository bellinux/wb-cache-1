40|$|For many years, coffee {{has been}} a major source of income to many Ugandans. Traditionally, Uganda coffee farmers have sold their coffee in unhulled form as dried {{cherries}} (Kiboko) through governmental parastatals. Structural changes in the agricultural sector arising from policy reforms that Uganda embraced since 1990 (notably liberalisation, privatisation and decentralization) removed the monopoly of governmental parastatals in agricultural marketing and pricing which was a disincentive to improvement of quality and quantity of output. Because of liberalisation, coffee quality and exports declined as the traders were more concerned about quantity rather than quality, which led to low prices and consequently low farm incomes. In response to this, value addition through hulling prior to marketing by farmers was suggested as one of the remedies. However, the rate of adoption of this strategy remains disappointingly low. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the factors underlying the adoption of <b>coffee</b> <b>hulling</b> by farmers, and to estimate the price elasticities for <b>hulled</b> and unhulled <b>coffee</b> sold. 300 farmers were randomly selected and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize and highlight differences between farmers who sell <b>hulled</b> and unhulled <b>coffee.</b> The censored Tobit model was used to analyse the factors that influence the sale of <b>hulled</b> <b>coffee.</b> Two OLS models for the marketed supply of unhulled and <b>hulled</b> <b>coffee</b> were estimated and their corresponding elasticities determined. The results indicate that higher market prices of <b>hulled</b> <b>coffee</b> positively and significantly (p< 0. 01) enhance the proportion of <b>hulled</b> <b>coffee</b> sold, while distance from the farmer’s home to the coffee processing factory and drought conditions during the season significantly (p< 0. 05) reduce the proportion of <b>hulled</b> <b>coffee</b> sold. Membership in farmer associations has a positive and significant influence on the amount of <b>hulled</b> <b>coffee</b> sold because it enables farmers to transport and sell together thereby reducing the transaction costs borne by each farmer. The sale of <b>hulled</b> <b>coffee</b> was found to be more price responsive than the sale of unhulled coffee both in the short and long run. Based on these findings the study recommends supporting the development of farmer institutions as a way of promoting the uptake of <b>coffee</b> <b>hulling</b> and value addition to improve farmers’ incomes. In addition, the bulking of coffee among farmers should be encouraged and accompanied by provision of market information to farmers for both <b>hulled</b> and unhulled <b>coffee</b> to help them to make informed decisions on where and what form of coffee to sell.

30|$|Coffee husk {{characteristics}} {{vary with}} the method of coffee processing. When the coffee is processed by the “wet” method, the coffee fruits are separated into three different groups: cherry coffee, green coffee, and buoy coffee. Cherry coffee is the newly mature coffee fruit, while buoy coffee is coffee fruit that has dried on the coffee tree before harvest and floats during the wet processing method. Green coffee is non-ripened coffee fruit. Further processing of cherry coffee produces residues known as <b>coffee</b> <b>hull</b> (parchment) and <b>coffee</b> pulp. For green and buoy coffee, the residue produced is known as “green coffee husk” and “buoy coffee husk,” respectively. When a combination of cherry, buoy, and green coffee fruits are processed by the “dry” method, the residue is known as “common” coffee husk (Matiello 1991; Bartholo et al. 1989).|$|R

As variáveis foram analisadas em esquema fatorial 2 x 5, em delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, com três repetições. O processamento e a inclusão de casca de café aumentaram os teores de MS das silagens, observando-se que a inclusão de casca inteira, em comparação à casca moída, proporcionou maior teor de MS. O processamento e os níveis de casca de café não influenciaram os teores de PB das silagens. Os níveis de casca de café tiveram efeito linear sobre os teores de FDN e FDA, ocasionando decréscimo de FDN e aumento de FDA. O processamento e os níveis de inclusão influenciaram os teores de lignina. Os níveis de casca de café, não o processamento, tiveram efeito quadrático sobre os teores de nitrogênio insolúvel em detergente neutro e ácido. Houve efeito da interação processamento ´ nível de inclusão sobre o pH, que sofreu efeito quadrático dos níveis de inclusão nos dois processamentos. Verificou-se efeito linear dos níveis de casca de café sobre os valores de nitrogênio amoniacal, que diminuíram conforme aumentaram os níveis de inclusão, sendo menores para a casca moída. A DIVMS sofreu efeito quadrático dos níveis de inclusão, sendo inferior na silagem com casca inteira em comparação à casca moída. A casca de café foi eficiente como aditivo absorvente nas silagens e, apesar de não ter melhorado as características bromatológicas das silagens, pode ser utilizada inteira ou moída, em proporções de até 12 %, para melhorar as características fermentativas da silagem. The experiment aimed {{to evaluate the}} effects of processing (whole or ground) and the inclusion level of <b>coffee</b> <b>hulls,</b> (0; 6; 12; 18 and 24 %; fresh matter basis) on the chemical-bromatological composition, fermentation characteristic and in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) of the elephantgrass silages. The variables were analyzed as a 2 x 5 factorial arrangement (processing and level of inclusion), distributed in a complete randomized experimental design with three replications. Processing and level of inclusion increased DM concentration and did not influence the crude protein concentration of silages. Linear effect of the inclusions level on NDF and ADF was observed, with decrease of NDF and increase of ADF. Processing and level of inclusions influenced the lignin concentration. Quadratic effect of inclusions level was observed for neutral and acid detergent insoluble nitrogen concentration. There was an interaction between processing and level of inclusions on pH. A quadratic effect of the inclusion level on the two processing forms was observed. Linear reduction of the ammoniacal nitrogen was observed {{with the level of}} inclusion, with higher values for ground hulls. For IVDMD, a quadratic effect was observed {{as a function of the}} inclusion level, with IVDMD of whole hulls being lower compared to the ground <b>hulls.</b> The <b>coffee</b> <b>hull</b> was efficient as an additive to reduce humidity of the silages. <b>Coffee</b> <b>hull</b> addition did not improve silage bromatological characteristics but it did improve fermentative characteristics.

Inclusion of 150 g/kg of SCH decreased the crude protein digestibility. Lower values of NDF digestibility were also observed when cows were fed with 100 g/kg and 150 g/kg of SCH. The digestibility of NDT was lower in the control and 150 g/kg of SCH diets. Milk production and composition did not differ among the treatments. Inclusion of SCH increased the total polyphenols and flavonoids in the milk and reducing power as well. Soybean oil and SCH supplementation increased the LDL and total cholesterol concentration in the plasma. Milk fatty acid profile was barely altered by the treatments.

The {{influence of the}} pyrolysis method and temperature on the product yields and {{on the characteristics of}} the pyrolysis products is discussed. It was found that the pyrolysis of this particular residue gives rise to a larger yield of the gas fraction compared to the other fractions, even at relatively low temperatures. A comparison of microwave-assisted pyrolysis and conventional pyrolysis showed that microwave treatment produces more gas and less oil than conventional pyrolysis. In addition, the gas from the microwave has much higher H 2 and syngas (H 2 + CO) contents (up to 40 and 72 vol. %, respectively) than those obtained by conventional pyrolysis (up to 30 and 53 vol. %, respectively), in an electric furnace, at similar temperatures.

Samples weighed 200 ± 5 mg, put into a 100 ml syringe glass, added 30 ml buffalo rumen liquor with bicarbonate buffer medium, then incubated in the water bath at 39 ° C for 48 hours. Neway software and random block design with 4 blocks are used to calculate the value of fitted gas and to analyze the variance. The variables measured were gas production 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, organic material degradable, gas production potential (a+b), gas production rate (k).

40|$|Composting {{is widely}} used to {{transform}} waste materials into valuable agricultural products. In the tropics, large quantities of agricultural wastes could be potentially useful in agriculture after composting. However, while microbiological processes of composts in general are well established, relatively {{little is known about}} microbial communities that may be unique to these in tropical systems, particularly nitrifiers. The recent discovery of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) has changed the paradigm of nitrification being initiated solely by ammonia oxidizing bacteria. In the present study, AOA abundance and diversity was examined in composts produced from combinations of plant waste materials common in tropical agriculture (rice straw, sugar cane bagasse, <b>coffee</b> <b>hulls),</b> which were mixed with either cow- or sheep-manure. The objective was to determine how AOA abundance and diversity varied as a function of compost system and time, the latter being a contrast between the start of the compost process (mesophilic phase) and the finished product (mature phase). The results showed that AOA were relatively abundant in composts of tropical agricultural wastes, and significantly more so than were the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Furthermore, while the AOA communities in the composts were predominatly group I. 1 b, the communities were diverse and exhibited structures that diverged between compost types and phases. These patterns could be taken as indicators of the ecophysiological diversity in the soil AOA (groub I. 1 b), in that significantly different AOA communties developed when exposed to varying physico-chemical environments. Nitrification patterns and levels differed in the composts which, for the mature material, could have signifcant effects on its performanc as a plant growth medium. Thus, it will also be important to determine the association of AOA (and diversity in their communities) with nitrification in these systems...|$|R

The intakes of DM, OM, TDN, TC, NSC, CP and EE of the total diet were not affected by treatments, while the intakes of NDF and ADF decreased with the increase of poultry litter level in the diet. The digestibility coefficients of TC, NSC and EE increased from 59. 7 to 64. 6 %, 88. 5 to 93. 2 % and 1. 5 to 30. 2 %, respectively, with the increase of poultry litter level from 0 to 60 % of the diet. The digestibility coefficients of DM and OM did not change, with mean values of 55. 8 and 61. 9 %, and those of NDF and CP decreased from 52. 0 to 39. 4 % and 77. 5 to 58. 0 %, respectively, with the increase of poultry litter level from 0 to 60 % of the diet. The nitrogen balance changed from negative to slightly positive with the increase of poultry litter, although high urinary excretions of nitrogen were observed in all treatments. The 40 and 60 % of poultry litter in the diet increased the supply of crude protein and magnesium, compared to the forage, and supplied more than 100 % of the requirements of Ca, P, Na and K to the animals. However, the apparent availabilities of Ca and P were low and negative, respectively...|$|R
