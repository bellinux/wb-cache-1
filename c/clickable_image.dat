5000|$|A {{series of}} {{unsuccessful}} negotiations were commenced between the NFB and Target Corporation in May 2005, which continued until January 2006. In May 2005, the NFB wrote to Target, {{asking for it}} to make its website accessible {{to people who are}} blind. The NFB requested that Target optimize its website accessibility for the blind by adopting standards promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines or the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board's Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 standards, specifically encouraging Target to adopt the alt attribute for <b>clickable</b> <b>images</b> featured on the website. In its petition, NFB alleged that in one instance, when a blind user visiting this website selected an image of a Dyson vacuum cleaner using his or her tab key, the voice synthesizer on the computer would say [...] "Link GP browse dot html reference zero six zero six one eight nine six three eight one eight zero seven two nine seven three five 12 million 957 thousand 121" [...] instead of a useful description of the image. [...] The NFB also claimed that the site lacked image maps and other accommodations, which prevented legally blind individuals from navigating through the website, and that the design of the online checkout pages prevented users with visual disabilities from being able to determine where the mouse pointer was on the screen.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{not always}} clear how best to {{represent}} integrated data sets, and which application and database features allow a scientist to take best advantage of data coming from various information sources. To improve the use of integrated data visualisation in candidate gene finding, we carried out a user study comparing an existing general-purpose genetics visualisation and query system, Ensembl, to our new application, VisGenome. We report on experiments verifying the correctness of visual querying in VisGenome, {{and take advantage of}} software assessment techniques which are still uncommon in bioinformatics, including asking the users to perform a set of tasks, fill in a questionnaire and participate in an interview. As VisGenome offers smooth zooming and panning driven by mouse actions and a small number of search and view adjustment menus, and Ensembl offers a large amount of data in query interfaces and <b>clickable</b> <b>images,</b> we hypothesised that a simplified interface supported by smooth zooming will help the user in their work. The user study confirmed our expectations, as more users correctly completed data finding tasks in VisGenome than in Ensembl. This shows that improved interactivity and a novel comparative genome representation showing data at various levels of detail support correct data analysis in the context of cross-species QTL and candidate gene finding. Further, we found that a user study gave us new insights and showed new challenges in producing tools that support complex data analysis scenarios in the life sciences. Key words: visualisation of large data sets, genome maps, genome visualisation, user study, QTL, comparative and functional genomics...|$|R
40|$|We present aperture-matched PSF-corrected BVi'z'JH {{photometry}} and Bayesian photometric redshifts (BPZ) for objects {{detected in}} the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), 8, 042 of which are detected at the 10 -sigma level (e. g., i'< 29. 01 or z'< 28. 43). Most of our objects are defined identically {{to those in the}} public STScI catalogs, enabling straightforward object-by-object comparison. We have combined detections from i', z', J+H, and B+V+i'+z' images into a single comprehensive segmentation map. Using a new program called SExSeg we are able to force this segmentation map into SExtractor for photometric analysis. The resulting photometry is corrected for the wider NIC 3 PSFs using our ColorPro software. We also correct for the ACS z'-band PSF halo. The NIC 3 magnitudes are found to be too faint relative to the ACS fluxes. Based on BPZ SED fits to objects of know spectroscopic redshift, we derived corrections of - 0. 30 +/- 0. 03 mag in J and - 0. 18 +/- 0. 04 mag in H. The offsets appear to be supported by a recent recalibration of the UDF NIC 3 images combined with non-linearity measured in NICMOS itself. The UDF reveals a large population of faint blue galaxies (presumably young starbursts), bluer than those observed in the original Hubble Deep Fields (HDF). To accommodate these galaxies, we have added two new starburst templates to the SED library used in previous BPZ papers. The resulting photometric redshifts are accurate to within 0. 04 * 1 +z_spec out to z < 6. Finally, we measure galaxy morphology, including Sersic index and asymmetry.

40|$|Hyperlinks, or {{more simply}} links, {{represent}} a fundamental instrument for programmers to build websites and for users {{to navigate the}} web. The internet, {{as we know it}} today, is a complex and interrelated net of contents at the disposal of surfers: in this scenario, hyperlinks represent the wires through which this net is weaved. Indeed, thanks to links, websites interrelate to one another making it possible for users to gather, with a simple click, information scattered around several locations on the web. Moreover, linking has become today a crucial tool for the provision of old as well as new services. Think about search engines of all kinds whose functioning is based on links leading users to the webpages containing information that matches the keywords inserted in the query. Last but not least, linking has become an ordinary communication practice in social platforms where users post all kinds of digital content they wish to share with friends through the technique of so-called ‘‘inline’’ links. While the crucial role of linking within the structure and functioning of the internet is beyond doubt, linking practices have immediately attracted lawyers’ attention for their intrinsic capability of infringing third parties’ intellectual property rights of various kinds. As far as copyright is concerned, linking may present liability issues in several instances. On the one hand, liability could be found when the link itself is infringing: for example, when the link (i. e. the pointer) contains a set of words that together can be protected by copyright (for example, headline news) or when the pointer is represented by a <b>clickable</b> thumbnail <b>image</b> protected by copyright. On the other hand, liability issues may arise when the link is used as an instrument to point users to certain digital content which has not been released on the web with the author’s consent or it has not been released by the author at all. For the purpose of this paper, we will restrict this analysis {{to the question of whether}} the act of hyperlinking can amount to a direct infringement of copyright on the internet, specifically by violating the making available right introduced by Art. 3 of the Information Society Directive, a question recently referred to the Court of Justice of the EU by several national judges. The answer to this question is of paramount importance to the development of new online services for the benefit of internauts, but also to the protection of the freedom of expression which has always characterized the internet as we know it today...|$|R
