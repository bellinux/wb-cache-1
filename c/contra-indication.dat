Of 251 patients consecutively admitted to hospital with suspected acute myocardial infarction, absolute <b>contra-indications</b> to thrombolysis were found in 9 (4 %) patients and relative <b>contra-indications</b> in a further 82 (31 %) patients.

50|$|There {{are a few}} {{adverse effects}} of {{ertapenem}} like confusion and headache, which may worsen to convulsions and seizures. The only absolute <b>contra-indication</b> is a previous anaphylactic reaction to ertapenem or other β-lactam antibiotic. There are no studies done in pregnant women, so the manufacturers cannot comment on its safety in pregnancy. In 2006, Ertapenem became approved for pediatric use in certain infections. Ertapenem is not recommended for children under 3 months of age and children with meningitis.|$|E
50|$|Indications include voice {{rehabilitation}} {{for patients who}} are undergoing a total laryngectomy (primary puncture) or patients {{who have had a}} total laryngectomy in the past (secondary puncture).Contra-indications are mainly related {{to the use of the}} voice prosthesis and not the puncture procedure itself. It is important to have healthy tissue at the puncture site. This will help ensure the voice prosthesis is properly supported. Poor tissue condition at the puncture site can be a <b>contra-indication</b> for TE puncture. It is also important that the patient candidacy be taken into account. Patients must be able to understand and manage proper prosthesis maintenance and monitor for complications or device problems. Bleeding disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, poor vision and poor manual dexterity are all factors that may negatively interfere with successful voice restoration using tracheoesophageal techniques and should be discussed further with an appropriate healthcare provider who is knowledgeable in this topic.|$|E
30|$|Some {{contra-indications}} {{should be}} considered before performing vNOTES. In patients with a massive hemoperitoneum, the endoscopic view will get disturbed [15]. If Pouch of Douglas adhesions can be expected, a thorough pelvic examination should be performed prior to surgery, and in case of unexpected Pouch of Douglas obliteration, conversion to transabdominal laparoscopy {{should be considered}}. Virginity is another <b>contra-indication</b> for vNOTES. On the other hand, nulliparity nor absence of history of vaginal delivery should be a reason not to perform vNOTES. In our case series, the highest BMI was 28.7. We did not, however, consider obesity (BMI =/> 30) a <b>contra-indication.</b> If a good Trendelenburg position can be achieved, the bowel and mesentary can be lifted out of the pelvis and will not impair visualisation.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundEuropean Guidelines for the {{treatment}} of CHF 2008 underline that there is no absolute level of creatinine which precludes the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs). AimsThe IMPACT-RECO program III analysed the impact of NYHA class and of comorbidities on therapeutic management of French outpatients with stable CHF and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). MethodsThis survey was carried on 2007 among randomly selected French private cardiologists. 1574 patients with CHF and LVEF 220 μmol/L or 25 mg/dL was found in 173 patients. In the 467 patients not receiving ACEIs, reasons for non prescription were firstly <b>contra-indication</b> in 69 patients (14. 8 %) mostly because of renal dysfunction in 54 patients (78. 3 %), secondly side effects in 365 patients (78. 2 %) with renal insufficiency found in 25 patients (6. 85 %). In 1033 patients, ARBs was also not prescribed because of <b>contra-indication</b> for renal dysfunction in 79 patients (90. 8 %), or intolerance with renal insufficiency in 40 patients (32. 8 %). Thus, despite a mean creatinine clearance of 33. 3 ± 15. 1 mL/kg/min in 173 patients with renal dysfunction, ACEIs/ARB were not prescribed in 133 patients considering renal dysfunction as a <b>contra-indication.</b> ConclusionRenal dysfunction remains the main reason for not prescribing ACEIs/ARBs in CHF despite the possibility to easily adapt their dose to creatinine clearance. Improvement is still necessary so that ACEIs/ARBs should not be denied to CHF patients with concomitant renal dysfunction...|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, in {{this large}} {{prospective}} cohort intra-operative and severe (Dindo III and IV), early postoperative complications occurred in 3.6 and 2.3 %, respectively.

Therefore, we conclude that LSCP appears to be well-tolerated and safe in elderly women with level I defects and without <b>contra-indication</b> for general anesthesia.|$|E

40|$|The {{immunisation}} {{records of}} 584 {{children who were}} born between 1978 and 1982, in a general practice of average social class distribution, were examined: 3. 5 % of the children would have been excluded from starting a course of vaccination including pertussis using <b>contra-indications</b> established by the Department of Health and Social Security. A further 3. 5 % had reactions to immunisation that were judged severe enough to prevent completing the course of vaccination. In 1981 and 1982 13 % of parents refused pertussis vaccination, considerably fewer than from 1978 to 80. Concomitantly, immunisation against pertussis rose from 51 % to 84 % over the five year period.

40|$|In this {{clinical}} trial, we {{aimed to}} compare three means of performing chronic hemodialysis {{in patients with}} <b>contra-indication</b> to systemic heparinization. This open-label monocentric randomized « n-of-one » trial, conducted in a single tertiary care center, recruited chronic hemodialysis patients with a <b>contra-indication</b> to systemic heparinization for at least 3 consecutive sessions. All patients underwent hemodialysis with an AN 69 ST dialyzer, and were administered three alternative dialysis procedures in a random sequence: intermittent saline flushes, constant saline infusion, or pre-dialysis heparin coating of the membrane. The primary outcome was the need to interrupt the dialysis session because of clotting events due to either (i) a complete coagulation of the circuit; (ii) a partial coagulation of the circuit; (iii) a> 50 % rise over baseline in the venous pressure. At {{the end of the}} inclusion period (May, 2007 to December, 2008), the number of patients to include (n= 75) was not reached: only 46 patients were included and underwent randomization. The study was terminated, and statistical analysis took into account 224 hemodialysis sessions performed in 44 patients with analyzable data. Heparin adsorption was associated with a significant reduction of the need to interrupt the dialysis session because of clotting events: odds ratio 0. 3 (CI 95 % 0. 2 to 0. 6; p 3 h dialysis sessions and for having complete blood restitution. There were no significant effects of the dialysis procedure on weight loss, online ionic dialysance, and adverse events. Heparin-coated AN 69 ST dialysis membrane is a safe and effective method to avoid or delay per-dialytic clotting events in patients with <b>contra-indication</b> to systemic anticoagulation. However, results are not generalizable safely to patients with active bleeding, since weak heparinemia, not assessed in this study, may occur. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 00473109...|$|E
30|$|Conclusion In {{this large}} cohort of brain damaged {{patients}} with LSTW decision, we observed {{that a high}} proportion of patients would not have been eligible for a DCDMIIII process. Even in those without <b>contra-indication,</b> the delay between LSTW implementation and the final circulatory arrest was not compatible with French national guidelines. Low values for arterial pressure and oxygenation persisted during a substantial part of time before final circulatory arrest. This information may help in refining the management of the DCDMIII process in this population.|$|E
