5|$|During {{an autopsy}} on Susan Snow, Assistant Medical Examiner Janet Miller {{detected}} {{the scent of}} bitter almonds, an odor distinctive to <b>cyanide.</b> Tests verified that Snow had died of acute <b>cyanide</b> poisoning. Investigators examined {{the contents of the}} Snow-Webking household and discovered the source of the cyanide: the bottle of Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules that both Snow and Webking had used the morning of Snow's death. Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60-capsule bottle were found to be laced with <b>cyanide</b> in toxic quantities.|$|E

40|$|Gadung (Dioscorea hispida Dennst.) {{has been}} {{considered}} as one of staple foods in Indonesia. However, its high <b>cyanides</b> content has limited its utilisation for commercial food production. This work is aimed to investigate the removal of <b>cyanides</b> content from gadung tuber chips through two consecutive treatments, i. e. leaching and steaming and to propose mathematics model for the leaching process. The results showed that processing water flow rate and leaching time affected the efficiency of <b>cyanides</b> removal in the leaching process. The proposed mathematical model was able to represent the removal of <b>cyanides</b> through leaching process very well. The <b>cyanides</b> content removal was also found {{to be affected by}} steaming time. Best processing condition was at leaching using 5. 00  10 - 5 m 3. s- 1 for 3, 600 s, followed by steaming for 3, 600 s to obtain <b>cyanides</b> content of 29. 9 mgkg- 1. While the yielded gadung tuber chips are considered as safe for consumption, further research on physicochemical characteristic of the gadung tuber flour is necessary for its utilisation consideration...|$|R

5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), <b>cyanide</b> and <b>cyanide</b> precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. <b>Cyanide</b> prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The <b>cyanide</b> component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the heme group no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen <b>cyanide.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Cyanides</b> are {{produced}} by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found {{in a number of}} plants. <b>Cyanides</b> are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches. In plants, <b>cyanides</b> are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.|$|R
5000|$|Direct versus {{conjugate}} addition {{depends on}} a number of factors. The structure of the carbonyl compound is important, as β-substitution and nearby angular substituents sterically disfavor 1,4-addition. The nature of the cyanating reagent also plays a role—when dialkylaluminum <b>cyanides</b> are used, the development of a six-membered transition state with s-cis enones may favor 1,4-addition. [...] "Bare" [...] cyanating reagents such as alkali metal <b>cyanides</b> and cyanoaluminates tend to add in a 1,4 fashion, whereas Lewis acidic <b>cyanides,</b> such as TMSCN, favor 1,2-addition.|$|R

5|$|The {{seeds of}} apples contain {{small amounts of}} amygdalin, a sugar and <b>cyanide</b> {{compound}} known as a cyanogenic glycoside.

The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.|$|E

5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no <b>cyanide</b> residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to <b>cyanide</b> is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as negative controls). They found <b>cyanide</b> residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen <b>cyanide,</b> {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile <b>cyanide</b> compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen <b>cyanide.</b> The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E
