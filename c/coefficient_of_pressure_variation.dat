40|$|An {{analysis}} <b>of</b> the <b>pressure</b> <b>variation</b> over an aerofoil with integrated Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wire is reported. A {{computational model}} based on finite elements and potential flow computation is proposed {{to obtain the}} deflections of the upper and the lower skins of the aerofoil subjected to aerodynamic pressure and hysteretic deformation of the SMA wire. The computational model couples a one-dimensional phenomenological constitutive model of SMA wire with the laminar incompressible aerodynamic <b>pressure</b> induced deformation <b>of</b> the aerofoil skins. The SMA wires are actuated by thermoelectric control system with auxiliary compensator feeding the piezoelectric stack actuators to adjust the hysteretic dynamics of the SMA wire.

Panel method based on incompressible and inviscid flow is employed for this purpose. The aerodynamic lift is then obtained from the pressure distributions.

The third {{rule of thumb}} proposed by Craig (1971) was applied to investigate possible wettability changes. Therefore, Krw (Sor) was normalized by Kro (Swi) at all pore pressures. For 0.1, 2, and 5  MPa the normalized floodout Krw (Sor) were 0.1924, 0.2238, and 0.2341, respectively. However, at 10  MPa pore pressure, the normalized floodout Krw (Sor) was 0.4723. According to Craig (1971), a floodout Krw (Sor) less than 0.3 is water wet and that greater than 0.5 is oil wet. It is obvious that, following this rule of thumb, at 0.1, 2, and 5  MPa pore pressures, the samples were water wet and thus exhibited consistent behavior with pore <b>pressure</b> <b>variation.</b> At 10  MPa pore pressure, however, the sample tend to approach oil-wet characteristics.
