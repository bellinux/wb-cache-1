5000|$|Fish stringer: Used {{to store}} speared fish while diving. Usually {{a length of}} <b>cable,</b> <b>cord,</b> string or {{monofilament}} terminated by a loop (and sometimes a swivel) {{at one end and}} a large stainless steel pin/spike at the other. The pin is typically 15-30 cm long, 4-8mm diameter, with a sharp point at one end, and with the cable threaded through a hole, usually in the middle, so the spike functions as a toggle once threaded. The pin can optionally be used as an iki jime spike, to dispatch speared fish. It can alternatively be a large, shaped loop of stainless steel. The stringer is usually attached to the dive float or around the waist of the diver.|$|E
50|$|Now in 2013, Sahir (Aamir Khan) {{has still}} not {{forgotten}} the high-handedness of the bank and swears revenge. He robs various branches of Western Bank of Chicago, leaving behind a message in Hindi and a clown mask. During the chase, he runs from top {{to the bottom of}} the Western Bank of Chicago building. As the Chicago Police Department comes to the scene, he runs into a van as they begin to surround the vehicle. Sahir jumps out in a BMW K1300R after a little explosion. On the chase, he slides under a truck and pops out to continue. He further kicks a police officer off his patrol motorcycle causing the officer to lose control and crash into a newspaper stand. While beyond that, Sahir continually tries to escape his pursuers and goes into a public parking garage. Then out of nowhere, he uses a steel <b>cable</b> <b>cord</b> like an attachment and rides his bike on it and is nearly knocked down by a train. despite all efforts of law enforcement, the robbery isn't foiled and he successfully gets away.|$|E
40|$|The strain {{state of}} the superconducting Nb 3 Sn strands in {{multi-stage}} twisted ITER Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICCs) strongly determines the transport properties. For an accurate prediction of the performance and a proper understanding of the underlying phenomena, {{a detailed analysis of}} the stress and strain distribution along all individual strands is imperative. Also during the cabling process, the axial stress of the individual strands must be well controlled to avoid kinks, in particular when mixing different strands, e. g., Nb 3 Sn and copper strands. A mechanical model for a superconducting <b>cable</b> (<b>CORD)</b> was developed, which can predict the strain and stress states of all single strands including interstrand contact force and the associated deformation. The simulation results are not only important for analysis but can be used for optimization of cable manufacturing and conductor design optimization. We discuss the influence of the sequential cable twist pitches and the inclusion of copper strands on the mechanical properties. ...|$|E

40|$|To cut {{or not to}} cut? This is the {{question}} that many viewers are asking themselves nowadays. The cord-cutting phenomenon concerns those newfound watching behaviours that induce certain viewers to snip their <b>cable</b> <b>cord,</b> dropping pay-TV services, and seeking for alternative ways of accessing television content such as over-the-top television providers, free over-the-air television, and more or less legal online platforms for streaming and downloading a personalized television menu. These viewers attempt to circumvent the established television system and its calcified institutional and legal norms that are constraining their televisual experience, whereas the television industry tries to stop this leakage and contain its possible disruptive effects. Marginal but worrisome, this phenomenon is emerging {{in the midst of}} our digital convergent culture, and it can actually be considered as symptomatic of today’s larger redefinition of television and the relative shifts in audience practices. Within this scenario, my work culturally and theoretically frames this current and fast-developing trend, conceptualizing it as a burgeoning counterpublic whose symbolic power is affecting both the notion of television, as well as, the political-economic dynamics of the television industry. Indeed, on the one hand the symbolic power of the cord-cutting counterpublic is re-shaping the cultural and social construction of television, and legitimating newfound viewing behaviours that revolutionize the classical idea of ‘TV. ’ On the other hand, the cutters are entering and altering the power interplay of the television distribution industry. In particular, from a critical analysis of the dynamics of resistance and resilience between cutters and the television distribution platforms, a mutually transforming effect is emerging that is fundamental for the future developments of our ‘post-television world. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 {{years we have}} seen some {{tremendous}} improvement in the transmission performance for both cables and connecting hardware {{from the early days}} of Category 5. With the publication of the Category 6 standard by TIA, we see at least double the bandwidth (usable frequency range) compared with Category 5 / 5 e cabling. In addition to baseline Category 6 products, there are some cabling systems on the market today that go well beyond Category 6 standard. Systems, such as the Belden IBDN System 4800 LX, provide even more impressive performance and available bandwidth. If Gigabit Ethernet runs on Category 5 e, then why does the end user need the extra performance? The answer lies in convergence. There are several benefits for a converged network through improved cabling performance. Cabling Performance We can understand cabling performance by looking at “channel”.

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one such example of this, comprising a vast region of the North Pacific Ocean rich with anthropogenic wastes.

For example, when the Malaysian Flight MH370, disappeared in 2014, satellites were scanning the oceans surface for any sign of it, and instead of finding debris from the plane they came across floating garbage. [...] The gyre contains approximately six pounds of plastic for every pound of plankton. The oceans may contain as much as one hundred million tons of plastic.
