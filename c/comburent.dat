40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{studying}} {{the role of}} the microporous layer (MPL) in electrodes prepared for High Temperature PBI-based PEMFC. The two main components of this layer are carbon black and a polymeric binder (Teflon). This work addresses the effect of the MPL carbon amount on the performance of a High Temperature PEMFC. Thus, gas diffusion layers (GDL) containing MPL with different carbon contents (from 0. 5 to 4 mg cm- 2) were prepared. Firstly, they were physically characterized by Hg-Porosimetry measuring pore size distribution, porosity, tortuosity and mean pore size. Permeability measurements were also performed. The higher the carbon content was the lower both porosity and permeability were. Afterwards, electrodes were prepared with these GDLs and were electrochemically characterized. Electrochemical surface area (ESA) was determined and fuel cell performance was evaluated under different fuel and <b>comburent</b> stoichiometries, supporting these results with impedance spectra. This made possible to see the benefits of the MPL inclusion in the electrode structure, with {{a significant increase in the}} fuel cell performance and ESA. Once the goodness of the MPL was confirmed, result analysis led to an optimum MPL composition of 2 mg cm- 2 of carbon for both electrodes, anode and cathode...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} microstructure, sliding wear {{behavior}} and corrosion resistance of high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) -sprayed FeVCrC-based coatings. Various process parameters were tested {{to evaluate their}} effects on the coating properties, which were also compared to those of HVOF-sprayed NiCrBSi and Stellite- 6 coatings. The Fe alloy coatings are composed of flattened splats, originating from molten droplets and consisting of a super-saturated solid solution, together with rounded particles, coming from partially unmolten material and containing V- and Fe-based carbide precipitates. All process parameters, apart from “extreme” settings with excess <b>comburent</b> in the flame, produce dense coatings, indicating that the feedstock powder is quite easily processable by HVOF. These coatings, with a microhardness of 650 - 750 HV 0. 3, exhibit wear rates of ≈ 2  ×  10 − 6  mm 3 /(Nm) in ball-on-disk tests against sintered Al 2 O 3 spheres. They perform far better than the reference coatings, and better than other Fe- and Ni-based alloy coatings tested in previous research. On the other hand, the corrosion resistance of the coating material (tested by electrochemical polarization in 0. 1  M HCl solution) is quite low. Even {{in the absence of}} interconnected porosity, this results in extensive, selective damage to the Fe-based matrix. This coating material is therefore unadvisable for severely corrosive environments...|$|E

40|$|A {{direct result}} of the growing number of {{municipal}} wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) has been an increase in the generation of large amounts of sewage sludge that requires environmentally acceptable final destination. To decrease the volume of sludge, a common technique is drying the sludge at a low temperature in rotary kilns. The result of this process is a granulated material consisting of dehydrated sludge pellets. After this treatment, this pelletized material becomes easier to manipulate, but it also becomes a more toxic waste, containing dangerous substances, mostly of the lipid type. At its final stage, this material is usually incinerated, used as a <b>comburent</b> material, used as an agricultural fertilizer, or used in the cement industry. Each application has its own problems and requires remediation measures from the safety and environmental viewpoints. In this study, we looked beyond these possible applications and analyzed the transformation of sewage sludge through a ceramization process into a material similar to expanded clays; we subsequently explored its uses in the building industry or in the agriculture industry, among others. Both the properties of the product material and the production method were characterized, and an environmental analysis was conducted. The new, lightweight material had a microstructure with open porosity and low thermal conductivity. Environmental characterization such as the leaching test revealed that undetectable amounts of hazardous metals from the sludge were present in the leachate after the sludge went through a thermal treatment, despite their initial presence (with the exception of vanadium, which could pose some restrictions on some of the proposed uses for the final product). Toxicity tests also showed negative results. The study of gaseous emissions during production revealed emissions factors similar to those during the production of conventional clay ceramics, although with higher organic emissions. As for conventional clay ceramics, industrial production would require the implementation of some type of air-depuration system. The results showed that the ceramization of sludge pellets is a promising valorization technique worth considering from both the economic and technological perspectives.

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} presentada en el Departamento de Química, Física y Analítica de la Universidad de Oviedo, 2017 [EN] The {{growing demand}} for energy has led to increasing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) resulting in significant climate changes with implications at global scale. Within the energy sector, CO 2 from coal combustion is {{the main cause of}} total GHG emissions. Of the available options for reducing CO 2 emissions, carbon capture and storage after oxy-fuel combustion processes, have gained ground as a promising alternative to conventional combustion in air. Oxy-coal combustion technologies ensure a relatively high level of development and exhibit a high versatility when they are implemented in existing facilities. Nevertheless, oxy-fuel processes must still overcome relevant environmental and technological challenges before their operation comes into effect at industrial scale. Of these challenges, a lack of knowledge of the behavior of mercury species during the CO 2 capture and purification stages {{is one of the most}} notable. The change of the flue gas composition from oxy-coal combustion, as a result of the partial recycling of the stream and the injection of oxygen as <b>comburent</b> may affect the mercury speciation which in turn could have a negative effect on the mercury retention efficiency of the gas cleaning systems. Although from a qualitative point of view, environmental problems originating from the presence of mercury in the flue gas and combustion by-products in oxy-fuel facilities are similar to those produced in a conventional air combustion plant, the presence of trace amounts of elemental mercury (Hg 0) causes significant operational problems during the compression of CO 2 in that it can accumulate in quantities sufficient to cause a severe attack on and failure of the cryogenic aluminium heat exchangers. In view of the complexity and importance of mercury in these processes, the aim of the present work has been, on the one hand, to study and assess the behavior of mercury in the main gas cleaning systems of coal-fired power plants, and, on the other hand, to evaluate the possibility of retaining persistent Hg 0 at the end of the cycle of oxy-combustion using a regenerable sorbent. In addition, the effect of mercury on the CO 2 retention capacity of some solid sorbents used specifically for the retention of CO 2 is analyzed. For this purpose, experimental devices at lab scale were set up by means of which mercury oxidation and retention could be evaluated under the simulated oxy-coal flue gas composition and operational conditions typical of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems, Particle Control devices and Wet Flue Gas Desulfuration systems (WFGD). Furthermore, an additional experimental device was set up to evaluate the retention of Hg 0 in a regenerable carbonaceous sorbent impregnated with gold and to analyze the influence of mercury on the CO 2 retention capacity of different solid sorbents used to CO 2 capture. The results showed that flue gas composition had a significant influence on the speciation of mercury. The homogeneous oxidation of mercury was affected by the presence of NO and NO 2, whose capacity to oxidize mercury depended on the concentration of CO 2. The presence of a high amount of H 2 O, which is characteristic of oxy-coal atmospheres, also influenced mercury oxidation. Assessment of the mercury retention capacity of SCR systems showed there was a high degree of oxidation when an enriched-CO 2 stream was employed. As regards mercury retention by the catalysts, a high concentration of H 2 O and CO 2 was found to decrease the number of active sites available for Hg adsorption. Under oxycombustion conditions, fly ashes favored mercury oxidation though its retention predominantly depended on the amount of unburned carbon in the fly ashes. The main mercury species identified in fly ashes were mercury bound to organic matter (Hg-OM) and HgS, whose stability in water confirmed their low degree of lixiviation. The capture of mercury in the WFDG device was significantly affected by the composition of the flue gas. High concentrations of CO 2 produced in the oxy-coal combustion processes reduced the pH of the gypsum slurry, thereby decreasing the transformation of oxidized mercury (Hg 2 +) to Hg 0. Mercury retention occurred mainly in the liquid fraction as Hg 2 +, although the characteristics and composition of the limestones may modify the partitioning of mercury in the by-products of the scrubber. A new sorbent based on a carbonaceous support impregnated with gold nanoparticles demonstrated a 100...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{stabilization}} of coal demand in developed countries, the role of coal in the next decades energy mix is still essential. Particularly relevant {{will be in the}} great developing economies, such as India or China, where this fuel is abundant and avoid external energy dependences. In parallel, the international community needs to drive its efforts towards politics that commit fossil fuels energetic companies to drop their CO 2 emissions drastically for 2015. In this regard, great advances have been made towards gaining plant efficiency and therefore, reducing the tones of CO 2 per produced kWh. Still, emissions need a more drastic reduction if we want to avoid an increment of atmosphere temperature higher than 2 ºC. Here, the CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies will have the potential of reducing up to 25 % of CO 2 from stationary sources as soon as they will be commercially available. Among the CO 2 capture technologies, grouped in pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion, this last one is receiving outstanding support by the national and European authorities. The possibility of implementing oxy-fuel combustion into circulating fluidized bed technology, contributes to approaching the concept of clean-coal technology. Fluidized bed combustors have the outstanding feature of offering the possibility of burning a wide variety of fuels They have the possibility to capture SO 2 emissions, adding in-bed limestone. Their working temperature is lower than in pulverized fuel boilers, which avoids thermal NOx formation. Additionally to these characteristics, already exploited under air-firing, applying oxy-fuel combustion technology and being able to capture the CO 2 emissions from the coal combustion, or even from blends of coal and other fuels, makes oxy-fuel combustion in fluidized bed a great opportunity to turn the coal sustainable in the future power plant designs. About the implications derived of applying oxy-fuel technology to a commercial scale CFB boiler, scarce literature exits, especially when considering high O 2 concentrations at inlet. A one dimensional model has been developed. The overall modeling strategy, in which the model has been based on, is explained {{in the first part of}} Chapter 2. It is based on the already known and validated air-firing semi-empirical expressions. The model has been divided into three sub-models interacting with each other: fluid-dynamics, combustion and energy balance of plant. For attributing reliability to the developed model, the scarce public experimental measurements of real air-firing boilers have been compared with the model results. Additionally, three studies regarding the modeling of large oxy-fuel CFB boilers have also been used for comparing the model predictions. In spite of having insufficient information about the published models details, the model developed in this work fairly fits the predictions in the literature. This has allowed making the sensibility analysis, trying to draw the main consequences of oxy-fuel deployment in CFB boilers. For retrofitting purposes, i. e. with no changes on an air-firing boiler configuration, the adequate O 2 proportion of oxygen at entrance should be around 30 %. Higher O 2 concentrations lead to smaller cross sectional areas of the boiler. For a given fuel power required in a boiler, feeding 45 % O 2 in the <b>comburent,</b> would reduce the cross sectional area down to 54 % of the original one. This involves a reduction of heat transfer surface along the boiler walls of 23 % approximately. The immediate consequence is the need of resorting to external heat transfer surfaces, i. e., external heat exchangers (EHE). This device would need to remove almost 50 % of the total heat of combustion in the case of feeding <b>comburent</b> with 60 % O 2 content. The importance of the EHE resides not only in compensating the reduction of heat transfer surface in the riser, but in managing higher amount of elutriated solids. The simulations have shown that higher solids densities in the boiler will enhance heat transfer coefficients to the riser walls. For certain boiler geometry, if increasing boiler load, higher recycled solids rate will be required. Feeding 60 % of O 2 at inlet, fuel input can be increased from 600 to 800 MW if elutriated solids increase from 25 to 40 kg/m 2 s. This refers us again to the higher solids crossing the EHE. An increase of 10 % of heat removal will be required in this device for said changing load. Applying EHEs to conventional boilers was not essential during air-firing operation. But for oxy-fuel combustion it was here demonstrated to be crucial for accomplishing the boiler energy balance. However, several operational and design uncertainties will need to be solved, before deploying first demonstration oxy-CFB boiler. The design of the future EHE will imply two relevant distinguishing features of oxy-firing operation: the influence of gas composition on the determination of the heat transfer coefficients and the greater amount of elutriated solids, cooled down in the EHE. The CIRCE bubbling fluidized bed pilot plant presents the adequate bubbling working regime to obtain results of heat transfer coefficient for a wide range of oxy-fuel conditions and extracting further conclusions on possible effects of gas composition on heat transfer coefficients. The range of O 2 concentration at inlet reached values as high as 60 %. Such a high concentration was scarcely achieved in pilot plants due, in most cases, to the limiting bed cooling capacity. Measurements of heat transfer coefficients were taken when cooling was needed to control the combustion temperature. Water could circulate through one or more of the four cooling jackets, depending on the cooling requirements. Heat transfer coefficients were indirectly measured by energy balance with the water mass flow and temperatures. There are no previous results on heat transfer measurements under oxy-fuel combustion, up to date. The pilot plant is characterized by two important performance parameters: the fluidizing velocity and the bed temperature. These two parameters are common for all the fluidized bed plants working on combustion. Particularly for characterizing oxy-fuel combustion, the composition of the oxidant gas is the other key parameter in the plant operation. These three factors have been analyzed and their influence on heat transfer was examined. The three of them are, however, interrelated. O 2 concentration and bed temperature varied the gas density and thus, the fluidizing velocity. At the same time, the fluidizing velocity will affect the heat transfer coefficients and consequently, bed temperature would be influenced. For accounting for this kind of dependences, non-dimensional numbers have been used for comparison. It was detected no dominant effect of non-dimensional numbers on the heat transfer. This is mainly offset by the different fluidization velocities in AF and OF operation. In the former, uf was kept over 1 m/s, whereas OF required lower velocities, around 0. 9 m/s. It was then determined the adequate semi-empirical correlations for the effective thermal conductivity and the residence time of particles at the heat transfer surface. Hence, a semi-empirical mechanistic approach is recommended for a good agreement with the experimental heat transfer coefficients obtained during oxy-fuel operation. It was demonstrated the relevance of the gaseous film resistance in the oxy-fuel tests, and a new empirical coefficient was deduced for both modes. As examined in Chapter 3, section 3. 5, the recommended expressions to predict heat transfer coefficients during oxy-fuel combustion modified the thermal film resistance, fitting the empirical parameter M with experimental data. Where: M= 6. 51 for oxy-firing and M= 11. 33 for air-firing The larger amount of solids arriving at the EHE will influence the values and distribution of the average and local heat transfer coefficients, respectively. A review of the difficulties associated with the estimation of heat transfer to the tubes of a heat exchanger has been examined. By the use of a scaled-down EHE, it was possible to experimentally confirm the influence of heat transfer coefficients when horizontal movement of solids took place. The increase of solids rate stressed the inequalities of the local heat transfer coefficient, whereas the longer residence time taken by particles to travel through the EHE allows higher average heat transfer coefficient. The contribution of this parameter to the average heat transfer coefficient was correlated by means of a new expression, as developed in Chapter 4, section 4. 4. This expression allows modifying the heat transfer coefficient previously deduced for stationary conditions, and therefore, accounting for the enhancement of heat transfer when recirculation of solids takes place. A real design of an EHE was then simulated and integrated in the existing CFB model previously developed. This is the first time that such a model is developed to predict the heat transfer area required in oxy-fuel operation. The EHE sub-model must fulfill the energy balance requirements previously set for the CFB model. The temperature, at which solids must be recycled back into the boiler, in order to keep the desired boiler temperature, is accomplished with this sub-model. The expressions for the heat transfer coefficient and the enhancement due to recycled mass flow of solids were included in the EHE sub-model. Hence, it was possible to determine the increase on the heat transfer surface, for different O 2 concentration in the oxidant stream, and two ranges of boiler temperature required. It was then recognized that, in spite of doubling the heat transfer surface requirements, when O 2 concentration increased 10 %, the heat transfer surface increases less than expected if solids flow influence were not included in the heat transfer evaluation. This thesis demonstrates that heat transfer surface design, arrangement and allocation, will differ in future oxy-fuel CFB boilers. Particularly, the heat transfer in the EHE will need address the influence of fluidizing gas composition and recycled solids, for an adequate and efficient heat exchanger configuration...|$|E
