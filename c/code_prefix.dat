25|$|The first {{generation}} was a project begun by General Motors as the M-car. When {{they realized that}} the project {{was not going to}} be profitable enough, the entire unfinished design was sold to Suzuki in return for a five per cent stake in the company. Suzuki completed the design and development work and put the car on sale from October 1983 in the Japanese market, as the Cultus. This is also why the car's design was such a natural fit in the General Motors lineup, with a clear GM corporate look. The model was also exported worldwide by Suzuki and assembled by a number of General Motors franchises, often undergoing badge engineering. The first-generation Swifts all share the SA model <b>code</b> <b>prefix</b> and was Suzuki's first earnest entry into a class of car with larger dimensions and engines than of the kei class Suzuki Fronte. Three- and four-cylinder versions of the G engine family were available, although some secondary markets installed Suzuki's one-liter four-cylinder F10A engine in a model which carries the SA410 chassis code.|$|E

[...] It featured enlarged intake and smaller exhaust ports on the two Cosworth cast aluminium alloy ALSi7mg cylinder heads, two parallel BorgWarner K04-series turbochargers, two larger side-mounted intercoolers (SMICs), dished piston crowns, stronger connecting rods, larger intake ducting, enlarged exhaust system, and a re-calibrated engine management system. [...] The modifications increased the engine's output from [...] and [...] of torque in S4 form to [...] at 7,000revolutions per minute (rpm) and [...] at 6,000rpm. [...] The engine was controlled by a Bosch Motronic ME7.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), using a Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic drive by wire throttle. [...] The engine had multipoint sequential fuel injection, a MAF, six individual single-spark coils and NGK longlife spark plugs. [...] The engine oil was cooled by a dual oil:water cooler and an oil:air cooler.|$|E
