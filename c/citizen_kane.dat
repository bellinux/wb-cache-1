5|$|Despite Hearst's {{attempts}} {{to destroy the}} film, since 1941 references to his life and career have usually included a reference to <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane,</b> such as the headline 'Son of <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> Dies' for the obituary of Hearst's son. In 2012 the Hearst estate agreed to screen the film at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, breaking Hearst's ban on the film.|$|E

5|$|On February 18, 1999, the United States Postal Service honored <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> by {{including}} {{it in its}} Celebrate the Century series. The film was honored again February 25, 2003, {{in a series of}} U.S. postage stamps marking the 75th anniversary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Art director Perry Ferguson represents the behind-the-scenes craftsmen of filmmaking in the series; he is depicted completing a sketch for <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure that}} <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kanes</b> {{influence}} from Hearst's {{life was a}} secret, Welles limited access to dailies and managed the film's publicity. A December 1940 feature story in Stage magazine compared the film's narrative to Faust and {{made no mention of}} Hearst.|$|R
5000|$|According to a {{description}} by Penelope Green in the New York Times, Palazzo Chupi is [...] "cinematic and lovely inside, and the condo-palazzos float like <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane's</b> Xanadu {{high above the}} remains of the West Village. But Green dismissed the building as a [...] "brand extension for the omnivorous Mr. Schnabel." ...|$|R
500|$|<b>Citizen</b> <b>Kanes</b> {{sound was}} {{recorded}} by Bailey Fesler and re-recorded in post-production by audio engineer James G. Stewart, {{both of whom}} had worked in radio. Stewart said that Hollywood films never deviated from a basic pattern of how sound could be recorded or used, but with Welles [...] "deviation from the pattern was possible because he demanded it." [...] Although the film {{is known for its}} complex soundtrack, much of the audio is heard as it was recorded by Fesler and without manipulation.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild {{published}} {{a list of}} the 75 best-edited films of all time based on a survey of its membership. <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> was listed second.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, a {{collection}} of approximately 235 <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> stills and production photos {{that had belonged to}} Welles was sold at auction for $7,812.|$|E
5|$|When Kathryn Trosper Popper died on March 6, 2016, {{at the age}} of 100 she was {{reported}} to be the last surviving actor to appear in <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane.</b> Jean Forward, a soprano who dubbed the singing voice of Susan Alexander, was the last surviving performer from the film before her death in 2016. Warrick was the last surviving member of the principal cast {{at the time of her}} death in 2005. Sonny Bupp, who played Kane's young son, was the last surviving credited cast member of <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> when he died in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Anthony Barclay is a British {{actor who}} has {{appeared}} in productions including Judge John Deed, Common as Muck and New Tricks, all for the BBC. He played Anthony Berg in Shaun Severi's film <b>Citizen</b> versus <b>Kane</b> which won the Canal+ Award at Clermont Ferrand International Film Festival and which earned Barclay a Best Actor nomination.|$|R
500|$|Its cinematography, lighting, and {{flashback}} structure influenced such film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s as The Killers, Keeper of the Flame, Caught, The Great Man and This Gun for Hire. David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson {{have written}} that [...] "For {{over a decade}} thereafter American films displayed exaggerated foregrounds and somber lighting, enhanced by long takes and exaggerated camera movements." [...] However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and Cinéma vérité movements favored [...] "flatter, more shallow images with softer focus" [...] and <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kanes</b> style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and telephoto shots all at once. Its use of long takes influenced films such as The Asphalt Jungle, and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced Gun Crazy, The Whip Hand, The Devil's General and Justice Is Done. The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced La commare secca and Man of Marble.|$|R
5000|$|MTV and Randy Jackson were sued by {{entertainer}} {{and activist}} Dwight McGhee, publicly known as rapper <b>Citizen</b> Charlie <b>Kane,</b> in 2010. Kane had pitched the show concept to MTV in 2004 and MTV [...] "passed" [...] on the concept. When Charlie Kane saw a commercial that depicted the 1970s Warriors' movie that {{looked exactly like}} his pitch demo DVD, he filed the suit. Many production elements between the show and Kane's 2003 copyright registration of a [...] "break-dancing league" [...] were identical. TMZ and NYPost were a couple among the many major media organizations to run the story. Viacom/MTV and Charlie Kane came to a mutual settlement in 2011.|$|R
5|$|<b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> {{received}} the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Picture. The National Board of Review voted it Best Film of 1941, and recognized Welles and Coulouris for their performances.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, RKO {{sold the}} American {{television}} rights to its film library, including <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane,</b> to C Television Corp. In 1960, television {{rights to the}} pre-1956 RKO library were acquired by United Artists. RKO kept the non-broadcast television rights to its library.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{structure}} {{influenced the}} biographical films Lawrence of Arabia and —which {{begin with the}} subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller Mr. Arkadin. Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to Mr. Arkadin, {{as well as the}} theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> and including The Magnificent Ambersons, Mr. Arkadin and Chimes at Midnight. Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's Reds. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane.</b>|$|E
500|$|André Bazin, {{a little-known}} film critic working for Sartre's Les Temps modernes, {{was asked to}} give an impromptu speech about the film after a {{screening}} at the Colisée Theatre {{in the autumn of}} 1946 and changed the opinion of much of the audience. This speech led to Bazin's 1947 article [...] "The Technique of Citizen Kane", which directly influenced public opinion about the film. Carringer wrote that Bazin was [...] "the one who did the most to enhance the film's reputation." [...] Both Bazin's critique of the film and his theories about cinema itself centered around his strong belief in mise en scène. These theories were diametrically opposed to both the popular Soviet montage theory and the politically Marxist and anti-Hollywood beliefs of most French film critics at that time. Bazin believed that a film should depict reality without the filmmaker imposing their [...] "will" [...] on the spectator, which the Soviet theory supported. Bazin wrote that <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kanes</b> mise en scène created a [...] "new conception of filmmaking" [...] and that the freedom given to the audience from the deep focus shots was innovative by changing the entire concept of the cinematic image. Bazin wrote extensively about the mise en scène in the scene where Susan Alexander attempts suicide, which was one long take while other films would have used four or five shots in the scene. Bazin wrote that the film's mise en scène [...] "forces the spectator to participate in the meaning of the film" [...] and creates [...] "a psychological realism which brings the spectator back to the real conditions of perception." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rivette's films explore themes such as {{conspiracy}} theories and theatricality in daily life. His frequent combination of conspiratorial crime stories and carefree characters has {{led him to}} be compared to Louis Feuillade, Howard Hawks, and Jean Renoir. Rivette is also lauded for his complex female characters, leading some of his films {{to be regarded as}} forefathers of the female buddy film. Critic David Thomson famously called Celine and Julie Go Boating [...] "the most innovative film since <b>Citizen</b> Kane...whereas <b>Kane</b> was the first film to suggest that the world of the imagination was as powerful as reality, Celine and Julie is the first film in which everything is invented." [...] Other scholars who have written extensively about Rivette include Jonathan Rosenbaum and Hélène Frappat.|$|R
5|$|The {{technique}} of using flashbacks {{had been used}} in earlier films—most notably in The Power and the Glory (1933)—but no film was as immersed in this technique as <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane.</b> The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane,</b> that mysterious, dark, and {{infinitely}} deep world {{of space and}} memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{directed}} by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the theatrical trailer for <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> differs from other trailers in {{that it did not}} feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-documentary piece on the film's production. Filmed {{at the same time as}} <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character. The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of Everett Sloane appearing at first to be running into the camera, which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.|$|E
5|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} the film would win {{most of its}} Oscar nominations, but it received only the award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Welles and Mankiewicz. Variety reported that block voting by screen extras deprived <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were {{likely to have been}} responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.|$|E
5|$|Mark Robson, a Canadian {{editor who}} had worked as an {{assistant}} on <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane,</b> was signed to direct the film, his directorial debut. It was shot over 24 days at RKO's Gower Street studio in Los Angeles, California, beginning on May 5, 1943, and concluding on May 29. The opening scene at the boarding school used the set featured in RKO's The Magnificent Ambersons, released the year before.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the long-standing}} controversies about <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> {{has been the}} authorship of the screenplay. Welles {{conceived}} the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for Welles's CBS Radio series, The Campbell Playhouse. Mankiewicz based the original outline {{on the life of}} William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.|$|E
5|$|Seiderman told Gambill {{that after}} <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> was released, Welles {{was invited to}} a White House dinner where Frances Perkins was among the guests. Welles {{told her about the}} Russian {{immigrant}} who did the make-up for his film but could not join the union. Seiderman said the head of the union received a call from the Labor Department the next day, and in November 1941 he was a full union member.|$|E
5|$|The British {{magazine}} Sight & Sound {{has produced}} a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952, and is {{regarded as one of}} the most respected barometers of critical taste. <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> was a runner up to the top 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll, retaining the top spot in every subsequent poll until 2012, when Vertigo displaced it.|$|E
5|$|The composited camera {{negative}} of <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> {{was destroyed}} in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were derived from a master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution. Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6 million in North America.|$|E
5|$|While a {{critical}} success, <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> failed to recoup its costs {{at the box}} office. The film faded from view after its release but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as André Bazin and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on Blu-ray on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.|$|E
5|$|Ebert {{provided}} DVD audio commentaries {{for several}} films, including <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane,</b> Casablanca, Dark City, Floating Weeds, Crumb, and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (for which Ebert also wrote the screenplay, {{based on a}} story that he co-wrote with Russ Meyer). Ebert was also interviewed by Central Park Media for an extra feature on the DVD release of the anime film Grave of the Fireflies. Ebert appeared as a guest star multiple times on Sesame Street. A bio-documentary about Ebert, called Life Itself, was released in 2014 to universal acclaim.|$|E
5|$|One of the first-produced {{episodes of}} the season, {{it is known}} for {{showcasing}} early designs and different characterizations for {{several members of the}} show's cast. The episode is inspired by the comedy of Laurel and Hardy and features cultural references to films such as <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> and Freaks as well as the Batman and Twilight Zone television series. In November 1996, The BBC chose it as the first episode to be aired, when they started showing the series, later being beat in the ratings by Sabrina.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane,</b> in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E
5|$|Notable films {{topping the}} American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> (1941), which is {{frequently}} {{cited as the}} greatest film of all time, Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950). The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929, and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} between April 16, 1991 and September 27, 1991, using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage. The production suffered {{from a lack of}} available set space because of shortages; the Starfleet Headquarters set was actually built a few blocks away from Paramount Pictures at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Meyer copied a technique used during filming of <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane,</b> where the filmmakers let the set fall into darkness to save money on construction. The film was shot in Super 35 instead of anamorphic format, because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.|$|E
5|$|Radio City Music Hall's {{management}} {{refused to}} screen <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that The American Weekly would run a defamatory {{story on the}} grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller. Other exhibitors feared being sued for libel by Hearst and refused to show the film. In March Welles threatened the RKO board of governors with a lawsuit {{if they did not}} release the film. Schaefer stood by Welles and opposed the board of governors. When RKO still delayed the film's release Welles offered to buy the film for $1 million and the studio finally agreed to release the film on May 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by Florey's own experiences in Hollywood, {{as well as the}} George Gershwin composition Rhapsody in Blue. It {{was one of the first}} films shot by Gregg Toland, who later received acclaim for his work on such films as The Grapes of Wrath (1939) and <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> (1941). The film serves as a satire of the social conditions, dominant practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, as well as the film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Douglas Fairbanks assisted with the development of the film, and Charlie Chaplin and Joseph M. Schenck helped promote it.|$|E
5|$|Turner Broadcasting System {{acquired}} broadcast television {{rights to}} the RKO library in 1986 and the full worldwide {{rights to the}} library in 1987. The RKO Home Video unit was reorganized into Turner Home Entertainment that year. In 1991 Turner released a 50th Anniversary Edition on VHS and as a collector's edition that includes the film, the documentary Reflections On <b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane,</b> Harlan Lebo's 50th anniversary album, a poster {{and a copy of}} the original script. In 1996, Time Warner acquired Turner and Warner Home Video absorbed Turner Home Entertainment. Today, Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit has distribution rights for the film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Citizen</b> <b>Kane</b> eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
