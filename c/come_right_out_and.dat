So we went into the studio and we cut the album ourselves. We’d go up and play a show here or there every weekend if possible to help fund it.

5000|$|The Haighlei {{simultaneously}} abhor change, {{and also}} adore it. In Haighlei culture, change comes {{only when the}} gods wish it, and then, only when the gods are so desirous of it that they <b>come</b> <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> say it; or, when there occurs the Eclipse Ceremony, which is held once every twenty years, and only in conjunction with an eclipse which happens once every similar number of years, and then, only so much change as is proportionate {{to the amount of}} the sun covered by the eclipse, can be allowed to be implemented into their culture and society. It is stated that this is how it has been for untold centuries prior, and that the kestra’chern who appear in the Haighlei society, are the kestra’chern of two centuries ago, or more: the most pampered members of the very elite nobility, and never, ever seen by the peasantry. It is also clarified that at some point the holy writings, which forbid change in strictest terms, were changed to include the Eclipse Ceremony, because someone, somewhere at some point in an unknown number of years before, realized that cultures can stagnate, and the society bearing that culture can rot from within, without some degree of change. The Haighlei are an extremely literal people: they will tell you exactly what they mean to do, not a bit more, and not a bit less, but this is also subject to the modification of how one feels about the person - if one were to ask a Haighlei citizen who is indifferent toward the person to guard their pet, he would guard their pet, but ignore the thief stealing their purse.|$|E

5000|$|Sinatra was {{not known}} for openly complimenting his musicians (drummer Irv Cottler once said, [...] "Frank will never <b>come</b> <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{tell you that you}} swung your ass off”). However, he {{publicly}} acknowledged DeRosa’s excellence. In Sinatra: The Chairman, author James Kaplan discusses DeRosa with Milt Bernhart, a trombonist who had played with both Sinatra and DeRosa on many occasions: [...] "Another time, Bernhart remembered, Sinatra praised French horn player Vince DeRosa on executing a difficult passage by telling the band, 'I wish you guys could have heard Vince DeRosa last night—I could have hit him in the mouth!' We all knew what he meant—he had loved it!” Bernhart said. “And believe me, he reserved comments like that only for special occasions."Another reason DeRosa is closely associated with Sinatra is that an exchange between DeRosa and Sinatra was featured in the article “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold” for Esquire by Gay Talese in 1966. The article {{became one of the most}} famous pieces of magazine journalism ever written, and is often considered not only the greatest profile of Frank Sinatra but one of the greatest celebrity profiles ever written. In his piece, Talese documents the following touching conversation between Sinatra and DeRosa:When a French- horn player, a short Italian named Vincent DeRosa, who has played with Sinatra since The Lucky Strike [...] "Hit Parade" [...] days on radio, strolled by, Sinatra reached out to hold him for a second."Vicenzo," [...] Sinatra said, [...] "how's your little girl?" [...] "She's fine, Frank.""Oh, she's not a little girl anymore," [...] Sinatra corrected himself, [...] "she's a big girl now.""Yes, she goes to college now.

[...] "Good-night, Vicenzo."The exchange was given renewed exposure by Pullitzer Prize-winning music critic Alex Ross in his book Listen to This. In the chapter [...] "Edges of Pop," [...]  Ross highlights the famous article and calls the exchange between DeRosa and Sinatra “The sweetest moment in Gay Talese’s classic Esquire profile.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Soon after {{returning}} to New York City, Cohn began constructing the melody for his Memphis song on his guitar: [...] "I started playing an arpeggiated figure that I liked, but it didn’t take long for me to realize that I couldn’t play it very well on guitar. So I went to the piano, where that kind of rolling rhythm was {{easier for me to}} play. Then I added that first line to the piano riff and I was off to the races. The music for 'Walking in Memphis', except for the bridge, is really just {{the same thing over and}} over again. It’s an attempt to keep things simple so that the narrative is what the listener focuses on. The story keeps changing; it goes from one scenario to another, all following the thread of my elation, described in the lyric 'Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale'. What’s being expressed is my love of music and the spiritual transformation I’ve always felt through it. The line: 'Tell me are you a Christian child, and I said 'Ma’am I am tonight' - even in the moment I wrote it down, I knew I was getting closer to finding my songwriting voice. To this day, people still ask me if I am a Christian. While I have to admit that I enjoy the confusion the lyric brings, the thing that makes that line work is the fact that I’m a Jew. So many great artists over the years needed to hide the fact that they were Jewish to protect themselves and their families from anti-Semitism, so I’m proud of the fact that I could <b>come</b> <b>right</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> practically announce my religion on the first song I ever released." [...] Cohn wrote numerous drafts before he had a set of lyrics which satisfied him: [...] "When I finished the song, I felt like I had completed a jigsaw puzzle. I wasn’t sure if it was a hit, because I was still years away from being signed to Atlantic Records. Six months later 1986, after I wrote many of the songs that would later comprise my album 'Marc Cohn', I went back to the Hollywood Café to play them all for Muriel. After I finished, Muriel said to me: 'You know the one where you mention me at the end? That’s the best one you got!'"

Indeed, pretend play, a subcategory {{of play in}} which actions, objects, and persons are transformed or treated nonliterally (Haight & Miller, 1993), has long been recognized as pivotal in facilitating early social and emotional development.

Children’s pretend play also allows adults to learn about children.
