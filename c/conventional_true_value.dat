Six services participated in this first national intercomparison in the Netherlands, all using TLD systems. In addition, one service also participated with a film badge system. The dosemeters were irradiated with photons on the surface of a 30 cm diameter sphere of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The range of the mean photon energy was 48 keV to 1250 keV. The range of the doses was 0. 055 mSv to 12. 3 mSv. All services were able to reproduce doses larger than 0. 2 mSv within - 33 % and + 50 %. For doses smaller than 0. 2 mSv all services using TLD systems were able to reproduce the <b>conventional</b> <b>true</b> <b>value</b> within +- 100 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Cachaça is the Brazilian {{most popular}} {{spirit and the}} quality of {{analytical}} results is essential for protection of consumers and to expand the international acceptance of the product. The first round of the proficiency-testing scheme (interlaboratory study), Brazilian cachaça, was carried out between November 2004 and March 2005. The blended sample was prepared for this round containing several components, including copper, methanol and ethyl carbamate. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the laboratory performance on the determination of the copper concentration in Brazilian cachaça. Eleven laboratories reported results for copper; these results were compared to the reference value attributed by Inmetro in partnership with The Laboratory of the Government Chemist – LGC from the United Kingdom and with the consensus value. A comparison between these values was made to determine which approach could guarantee better reliability to the conclusions taken from the PT scheme. The samples used have shown good homogeneity and stability, the reference value attributed by Inmetro and LGC is SI traceable and showed to be more appropriate to be used as the <b>conventional</b> <b>true</b> <b>value</b> than the consensus value calculated with the participants ’ results...|$|E

We sought to determine the ability of eight surgeons to position an acetabular component placed using an anterior-lateral minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach with conventional instruments or computer navigation using an optical imageless protocol compared with <b>conventional</b> <b>true</b> <b>values</b> determined by computed tomography (CT). We introduce a new approach, the Six Sigma process capability index, to assess outliers. Using the Six Sigma process capability index (Cp >  1. 3) and the criteria of Lewinnek et al. of ±  10 ° for adequate precision, three-dimensional (3 D) CT was capable for inclination and anteversion. Computer navigation and visual cues with conventional instrumentation were precise for anteversion but not for inclination. We conclude image-free computer navigation was not better than conventional instrumentation with the surgeons’ visual cues for acetabular cup placement. Six Sigma analysis allows comparison of various methods of referencing with literature controls, and our data suggest CT referencing is the most precise method...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{results of}} an inter-laboratory {{comparison}} of silica analysis of seven water samples (coded as IIE 19 -IIE 25) are presented. The first six samples (IIE 19 -IIE 24) were prepared by diluting {{a certain amount of}} silicon (Si) standard 1000 ± 0. 1 % ppm, HYCEL, Mexico, in distilled water, while the seventh sample IIE 25 is natural geothermal water. The <b>conventional</b> <b>true</b> <b>values</b> for the silica (SiO 2) concentration of IIE 19 -IIE 24 are 61. 1, 213. 9, 366. 7, 520, 825, and 978 ppm, respectively. The present analysis database consists of 27 datasets, analyzed by colorimetry (13 sets), atomic absorption spectrometry (7 sets) and inductively coupled plasma (7 sets) techniques. The analyses were performed with two procedures: (i) individual laboratory procedure (or conventional procedure) and (ii) dilution of samples in the range 50 - 200 ppm SiO 2. The mean (View the MathML sourcex¯) and standard deviation (s) calculation after eliminating extreme values (outliers) with View the MathML sourcex¯± 2 s method was used for the statistical data treatment. Presently, the overall error in the analysis is at least ± 10 %. A comparison of analytical error and uncertainty for individual analytical technique suggests that the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and colorimetry are relatively better techniques for the analysis of SiO 2 in geothermal waters; however, there are some statistical artifacts on the colorimetric results because their number of measurements was double that of atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and ICP. The analysis quality (i. e., precision and accuracy) may be improved by using the data control procedure with some high quality standard (e. g., NIST standards). One of the factors of systematic error is associated with the preparation of laboratory standards...|$|R
40|$|Methods {{validation}} {{is mandatory}} {{in order to}} assess the fitness of purpose of the developed analytical method. Of core importance {{at the end of the}} validation is the evaluation of the reliability of the individual results that will be generated during the routine application of the method. Regulatory guidelines provide a general framework to assess the validity of a method, but none address the issue of results reliability. In this study, a Bayesian approach is proposed to address this concern. Results reliability is defined here as "the probability (π) of an analytical method to provide analytical results (X) within predefined acceptance limits (±λ) around their reference or <b>conventional</b> <b>true</b> concentration <b>values</b> (μ(T)) over a defined concentration range and under given environmental and operating conditions. " By providing the minimum reliability probability (π(min)) needed for the subsequent routine application of the method, as well as specifications or acceptance limits (±λ), the proposed Bayesian approach provides the effective probability of obtaining reliable future analytical results over the whole concentration range investigated. This is summarised in a single graph: the reliability profile. This Bayesian reliability profile is also compared to two frequentist approaches, the first one derived from the work of Dewé et al. [W. Dewé, B. Govaerts, B. Boulanger, E. Rozet, P. Chiap, Ph. Hubert, Chemometr. Intell. Lab. Syst. 85 (2007) 262 - 268] and the second proposed by Govaerts et al. [B. Govaerts, W. Dewé, M. Maumy, B. Boulanger, Qual. Reliab. Eng. Int. 24 (2008) 667 - 680]. Furthermore, to illustrate the applicability of the Bayesian reliability profile, this approach is also applied here to a bioanalytical method dedicated to the determination of ketoglutaric acid (KG) and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in human plasma by SPE-HPLC-UV...|$|R
