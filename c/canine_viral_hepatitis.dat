40|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is one {{of major}} global health {{challenges}} with increasing disease burden worldwide. Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections are major causes of chronic liver diseases. They can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death in significant portion of affected people. Transmission of hepatitis B virus can be blocked by vaccination. Progression of hepatitis B virus-related liver diseases can be prevented by long-term viral suppression with effective drugs. Although vaccine for hepatitis C virus is currently unavailable, hepatitis C virus infection can be eradicated by oral direct antiviral agents. To eliminate <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to develop national goals and targets through reducing 90 % of new infections and providing universal access to key treatment services up to 80 %. This can lead to 65 % reduction of viral hepatitis-related mortality.

ResultsThe annual deaths (mortality) in patients with <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> showed a decreasing trend. The deaths (mortality) from hepatitis B showed a slight declining trend, accounting for a great proportion (over 70 %) of the deaths (mortality) from viral hepatitis; the deaths (mortality) from hepatitis C had shown a slight downward trend since 2007; the deaths (mortality) from hepatitis A and unclassified hepatitis decreased to different extents; the deaths (mortality) from hepatitis E remained at a relatively low level.

In 49 patients with chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (38 with chronic hepatitis B, 11 with chronic hepatitis C, 31 male, 18 female; age range 1 to 17 years),and in 51 healthy controls (25 male, 26 female; age range 4 to 16 years), the total perihepatic lymph node volume was assessed using transabdominal ultrasonographyas previously described in adult patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Liver {{function}} tests (LFTs) {{are ordered}} {{in large numbers}} in primary care, and the Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study {{was set up to}} assess their usefulness in patients with no pre-existing or self-evident liver disease. All patients were tested for chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> thereby providing an opportunity to compare various strategies for detection of this serious treatable disease. Methods This study uses data from the BALLETS cohort to compare various testing strategies for <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in patients who had received an abnormal LFT result. The aim was to inform a strategy for identification of patients with chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> We used a cost-minimisation analysis to define a base case and then calculated the incremental cost per case detected to inform a strategy that could guide testing for chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Results Of the 1, 236 study patients with an abnormal LFT, 13 had chronic <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (nine hepatitis B and four hepatitis C). The strategy advocated by the current guidelines (repeating the LFT with a view to testing for specific disease if it remained abnormal) was less efficient (more expensive per case detected) than a simple policy of testing all patients for <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> without repeating LFTs. A more selective strategy of viral testing all patients for <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> if they were born in countries where <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was prevalent provided high efficiency with little loss of sensitivity. A notably high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (greater than twice the upper limit of normal) on the initial ALT test had high predictive value, but was insensitive, missing half the cases of viral infection. Conclusions Based on this analysis and on widely accepted clinical principles, a "fast and frugal" heuristic was produced to guide general practitioners with respect to diagnosing cases of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in asymptomatic patients with abnormal LFTs. It recommends testing all patients where a clear clinical indication of infection is present (e. g. evidence of intravenous drug use), followed by testing all patients who originated from countries where <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is prevalent, and finally testing those who have a notably raised ALT level (more than twice the upper limit of normal).

40|$|Background With recent {{improvements}} in vaccines and treatments against <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> an improved {{understanding of the}} burden of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is needed to inform global intervention strategies. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to estimate morbidity and mortality for acute <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and for cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> by age, sex, and country from 1990 to 2013. Methods We estimated mortality using natural history models for acute hepatitis infections and GBD's cause-of-death ensemble model for cirrhosis and liver cancer. We used meta-regression to estimate total cirrhosis and total liver cancer prevalence, as well as the proportion of cirrhosis and liver cancer attributable to each cause. We then estimated cause-specific prevalence as the product of the total prevalence and the proportion attributable to a specific cause. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). Findings Between 1990 and 2013, global <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> deaths increased from 0. 89 million (95 % uncertainty interval [UI] 0. 86 - 0. 94) to 1. 45 million (1. 38 - 1. 54); YLLs from 31. 0 million (29. 6 - 32. 6) to 41. 6 million (39. 1 - 44. 7); YLDs from 0. 65 million (0. 45 - 0. 89) to 0. 87 million (0. 61 - 1. 18); and DALYs from 31. 7 million (30. 2 - 33. 3) to 42. 5 million (39. 9 - 45. 6). In 2013, <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was the seventh (95 % UI seventh to eighth) leading cause of death worldwide, compared with tenth (tenth to 12 th) in 1990. Interpretation <b>Viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Unlike most communicable diseases, the absolute burden and relative rank of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> increased between 1990 and 2013. The enormous health loss attributable to <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and the availability of effective vaccines and treatments, suggests an important opportunity to improve public health...|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} associations between diseases traditionally considered non- infectious with infectious agents. These include peptic ulcer, coronary heart disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, haematological disorders and malignancies. Out of infectious diseases, <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is {{also associated with}} many extra hepatic complications, with articular, renal, neurologic, cutaneous and haemapoietic system involvement. Several autoimmune phenomena {{can be observed in}} the course of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> including cryoglobulinemia, glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematoses and arthritis.

40|$|Background: With recent {{improvements}} in vaccines and treatments against <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> {{a better understanding}} of the burden of <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is needed to inform global intervention strategies. We present estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study of morbidity and mortality for acute <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and for cirrhosis and liver cancer due to <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> by age, sex and country for 1990 through 2013. Methods: Mortality was estimated using natural history models for acute hepatitis and GBD’s cause-of-death ensemble model for cirrhosis and liver cancer. We estimated disease prevalence, and liver cancer and cirrhosis aetiologies via meta-regression. Disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). Findings: Between 1990 and 2013, <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> deaths increased from 0 · 90 million (95 % uncertainty interval 0 · 86 – 0 · 94) to 1 · 45 million (1 · 38 – 1 · 54); YLLs increased from 31 · 0 million (29 · 6 – 32 · 6) to 41 · 6 million (39 · 1 – 44 · 7); YLDs, from 0 · 65 million (0 · 45 – 0 · 89) to 0 · 87 million (0 · 61 – 1 · 18); and DALYs, from 31 · 7 million (30 · 2 – 33 · 3) to 42 · 5 million (39 · 9 – 45 · 6). In 2013, <b>viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> was the 7 th leading cause of death globally. Interpretation: <b>Viral</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
