25|$|Milbrook arrived off Berlenga Grande Island in the Burlings on 24 March 1808 and anchored. While she was {{changing}} {{to a better}} position a squall struck her and drove her onto a reef. Her crew hauled her off and into clear water where she rode out the night. However, at 8a.m. the next morning, her <b>cable</b> <b>fasteners</b> gave way and she was again driven on the rocks, where she bilged. She quickly fell on her side and was lost. The crew was saved.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a first experimental {{identification of the}} effects of electric cables on the damping of a satellite structure. The dissipation due to both the curvature of the cables and the slippage of the <b>cables</b> in their <b>fasteners</b> was taken into account based on classical plate kinematics. In order to validate a damping model for the cables, we developed tests to quantify the influence of the amplitude of the movement on the energy dissipated. Two cable sizes and three <b>cable</b> <b>fastener</b> heights were tested using a specific setup which made the curvature uniform along the whole length of the cables. The results show that while the dissipation {{is a function of the}} curvature the specific damping capacity is almost constant. However, the dissipation differs depending on the type of cable. Very small cables do not dissipate at all, but large cables can induce significant damping depending on the mode of vibration concerned...|$|R

50|$|Stay rods {{are used}} for {{relieving}} weights on a higher elevation. These systems are particularly useful to control movements caused by wind or tree growth, however they are the used less often, due to the natural limits of the systems. Higher elevation and more branches tailing off decreases capacity and increases wind sensibility.As building materials for hanging are used ropes, wire <b>cables,</b> tension <b>fasteners,</b> springs etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{one-piece}} aluminium {{frame and}} handlebars conceal <b>cables</b> and <b>fasteners</b> {{in an effort}} to protect them from vandalism, damage and inclement weather. The heavy-duty tyres are designed to be puncture-resistant and are filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. A row of 5 LEDs on front of the luggage rack and twin LED rear lights are integrated into the robust frame, which weighs approximately 23 kg (51 lb).|$|R

The heavy-duty tires are designed to be puncture-resistant and are filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. Twin LED rear lights are integrated into the robust frame, which weighs approximately 18 kg. The bikes are designed by industrial designer Michel Dallaire and built in the Saguenay, Quebec region by Cycles Devinci, with aluminum provided by Rio Tinto Alcan.|$|R
50|$|The Gametrak uses a {{patented}} {{mechanical system}} for tracking position of physical elements in three-dimensional space in real time. The base unit features two identical mechanisms, {{each of which}} can determine the three-dimensional coordinates of an associated element relative to the mechanism. Each mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a ball joint such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. At {{the end of the}} <b>cable</b> is a <b>fastener</b> for connecting to the tracked element.|$|R
500|$|The {{bicycles}} are utility bicycles with a unisex step-through frame, which weigh about [...] each. Their one-piece {{aluminum frame}} and handlebars conceal <b>cables</b> and <b>fasteners</b> {{in an effort}} to protect them from vandalism and bad weather; the handlebars are located above the seat, allowing riders to sit upright and thereby maintain balance. They are equipped with a Shimano Nexus three-speed, twist-shifter-operated internal geared hub, full mudguards/fenders and chainguard. The heavy-duty tires are puncture-resistant and filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. The tires are also wider, leading to increased stability. Twin LED rear lights of a pre-2015 design are integrated into the frame, whose bright-blue color increases the bikes' visibility. The bikes are designed by industrial designer Michel Dallaire and built in the Saguenay, Quebec, region by Cycles Devinci, with aluminum provided by Rio Tinto Alcan. Citi Bikes are slower than most utility bicycles, averaging only [...] as opposed to regular bicycles' average speed of , which increases safety due to a lowered risk of a high-speed collision. The bikes are assembled in Detroit.|$|R
