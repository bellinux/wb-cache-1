From our {{experience}} with several organizations that employ software product families, {{we have learned}} that deriving individual products from shared software artifacts is a time-consuming and expensive activity. In the research <b>community,</b> <b>product</b> derivation methodologies are rather scarce, however. By studying product derivation, we believe we will be better able to provide and validate industrially practicable solutions for application engineering. In this paper, we present a framework of terminology and concepts regarding product derivation that serves as basis for further discussion. We exemplify this framework with two industrial case studies, i. e. Thales Nederland B. V. and Robert Bosch GmbH. ...|$|E

40|$|Joint Applied ProjectThe Abrams tank {{has had an}} Operational Requirements Document (ORD) {{requirement}} for embedded training (ET) since 1994 and has successfully demonstrated the capability as early as 2001. The most challenging aspect of implementing ET has been to get the Abrams combat development community (User) and materiel development <b>community</b> (<b>Product</b> Manager) to equally consider the need for ET among competing combat capability. The need and priority for embedded training has not been effectively conveyed. Due to the interpretations of embedded training requirements, the direction to PM Abrams to implement embedded training has been weak at best, while the perceived User need for ET continues to grow. Since the technology has been demonstrated, the combat developer has begun to understand the capability and more effectively define the desired state (how he would use it and its benefits). Furthermore, the Army's style of fighting has changed; therefore, the Army's method of training must also change. Embedded training should be recognized by the materiel developer as an essential training tool necessary to keep Soldiers' skills sharp in the changing training environment...|$|E

The present study was performed to investigate the fermentation of Phyllanthus emblica fruit by Lactobacillus paracasei HII 01 with respect to carbon sources, polyphenols, and antioxidant properties. The physical changes, for instance, color, odor, taste, turbidity and gas formation, throughout the fermentation process was manually monitored. The fermented product was rich in polyphenolic content. The acid content and pH of the product were under the norms of Thai <b>community</b> <b>product</b> standards. Antioxidant properties of the fermented product were proved using ABTS, and FRAP assays. Chelation based study suggested that fermented P. emblica fruit juices are healthy enough to stabilize the oxidized form of the metal ion. The optimum fermentation period was 15 days.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program is to reassess the way we define and measure performance, programmability, portability, robustness and ultimately productivity in the High Performance Computing (HPC) domain. This article describes the Scalable Synthetic Compact Applications (SSCA) benchmark suite, a <b>community</b> <b>product</b> delivered under support of the DARPA HPCS program. The SSCA benchmark suite consists of six benchmarks. The first three SSCA benchmarks are specified and described in this article. The last three are to be developed and will relate to simulation. SSCA # 1 Bioinformatics Optimal Pattern Matching stresses integer and character operations (no floating point required) and is compute-limited; SSCA # 2 Graph Analysis stresses memory access, uses integer operations, is compute-intensive, and is hard to parallelize on most modern systems; and SSCA # 3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Application is computationally taxing, seeks a high rate at which answers are generated, and contains a significant file I/O component. These SSCA benchmarks are envisioned to emerge as complements to current scalable micro-benchmarks and complex real applications to measure high-end productivity and system performance. They are also described in sufficient detail to drive novel HPC programming paradigms, as well as architecture development and testing. The benchmark written and executable specifications are available from www. highproductivity. org. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the recent phenomenon called homonationalism, through the angle of activism. By doing fieldwork with the association ACT UP, Paris, I intended to understand how activists have perceived homonationalism. I chose ACT UP because they participated {{in the construction of the}} LGBT community but also created coalitions with other marginalized groups so as to better struggle against AIDS. I analyzed whether the post- colonial approach of the association can help to avoid falling into the pitfall of homonationalism. First, I argue that the LGBT <b>community,</b> <b>product</b> of the history of the LGBT movement, has been embedded since its inception in a national framework that they cannot escape. Moreover, the LGBT community is informed by its own nationalism, which forms the basis from which they organize their struggle. As a result, homonationalism was not perceived as new but as something that always existed within the LGBT movement. Moreover, considering the recent development of French state politics, by taking into account the processes of exclusion against certain minorities, most notably Muslim people, but also the issue of imperialism, I argue that the issue of homonationalism is deeply linked to the relation that the LGBT community has with state politics. My analysis of the potential of ACT UP to displace the LGBT community is part of a larger ambition to counter homonationalism in its various and complex forms...|$|E
40|$|Implementing a new {{information}} technology (IT) system often requires an enterprise to adopt many changes {{in order to}} exploit the full set of capabilities generated by the new system. However, the new IT system itself can often act {{as a barrier to}} change rather than as an enabler. The challenge in making sure that the new IT system serves as an enabler, rather than a barrier, to change requires the concurrent performance of three sets of activities with the aim of exploiting the synergies among them: redesign processes, develop and implement the system through a mix of internal talent and external suppliers, and involve the user <b>community.</b> <b>Product</b> Data Management (PDM) technology represents {{a substantial portion of the}} rather sizeable investment by industry in IT systems over the last decade. The selection, development, and deployment of PDM solutions were studied in the context of the aerospace industry, wherein data management (DM) is critical due to high product complexity and long system life cycles. A study of current PDM-related implementation experiences in nine different aerospace company sites highlights the difficulty in reaching PDM technology's full potential to deliver customer value. The timing of system implementation, the creation and composition of the team, and a willingness to overcome organizational inertia are the three most important factors in developing a solution that meets an organization’s needs. All three factors and the interactions across them are highlighted in the two case studies focusing on two companies designated as Aero Company and Space Company, respectively...|$|E
