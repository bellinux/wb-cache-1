25|$|The {{run-up to}} the concert itself still did not go smoothly. Rain poured down on Houston {{a couple of days}} before the concert, {{destroying}} much of the equipment on stage (which was repaired by the day of the concert), breaking wires and ruining instruments. Furthermore, there had been a very strong wind blowing all week, which ended up splitting open the giant projection screen (which was made from several small canvas panels) and causing it to <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> down.|$|E

An uninvited British resident in Ava was a daily reminder of the humiliating defeat.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Sci Fi Channel {{sponsored}} a {{scientific study of}} the area and related records by the Coalition for Freedom of Information. The most significant finding of the scientific team was a line of damaged trees broken at the top leading to the site where some eyewitnesses said they saw the object embedded in the soil along with associated fresh tree damage. Furthermore, tree core samples dated the damage to 1965. This provided physical evidence that something airborne may have <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> through the trees and landed in the woods. (However, one of the scientists instead suggested ice damage to the trees.) Minor soil disturbance was also found at the alleged landing site. Another witness reported hearing a pair of loud, horrific screams {{as members of the}} military approached the object on foot.|$|E
25|$|Just how {{significant}} the strike's implications were becomes apparent {{when considering the}} miner's place in Communist myth-making: he represented an “archetypal proletarian”, a “new man” whose symbolic aura was conferred by his Stakhanovite determination. The idea of the new man particularly caught on in areas dominated by a single industry, like the Jiu Valley, where the working masses could easily be controlled by the party. The uneducated miners, drawn largely from poor rural or socially disadvantaged layers of society, believed in the Communist ideology and discourse, which rang true to them, and awaited {{the arrival of a}} classless society. The miserable conditions in which they actually lived did not match the propaganda, and the disillusioned miners responded forcefully. After the strike, Ceaușescu took to posing as an “honorary miner” or as a national leader flanked by Securitate members dressed up as miners. He had been genuinely shocked that the representatives par excellence of the new man had unexpectedly revolted against the system that had so carefully crafted them. The image of the model miner had <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> down, and for that reason the strikers were terrorized—they had destroyed a myth that had served not only them and other “new men”, but also Ceaușescu himself.|$|E

500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story, asserting that [...] "the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears ready to <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E
500|$|In {{a preview}} of the record, Jeff Benjamin from Fuse {{acknowledged}} the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and noted that [...] "hard rock guitars and percussion <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> in on the chorus." [...] Sarah O' Hara, while reviewing Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams for Lowdown, compared the song to [...] "Kings and Queens", a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus. In an interview with Loudwire, Leto described [...] "City of Angels" [...] as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, [...] "It's the story of my brother and I going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land." [...] Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams. Mary Ouellette, writing for Loudwire, felt that the song [...] "tells a passionate tale of finding comfort in calling the city of Los Angeles home." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Capitol also {{houses the}} National Statuary Hall Collection, {{comprising}} two statues donated {{by each of}} the fifty states to honor persons notable in their histories.

The statue's extraordinary weight of [...] raised concerns that it might <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> through the floor, so it was moved to Emancipation Hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center. The 100th, and last statue for the collection, that of Po'pay from the state of New Mexico, was added on September 22, 2005. It was the first statue moved into the Emancipation Hall.|$|E

2500|$|Rundstedt, {{like most}} German officers, had favoured {{the policy of}} good {{relations}} with the Soviets followed by the Reichswehr commander General Hans von Seekt during the Weimar Republic years, when the Soviet connection was seen as a counter to the threat from Poland. He was also apprehensive about launching a new war in the east while Britain was undefeated. If so, he did nothing to oppose them, and in this he was in company even with officers who disliked and opposed Hitler's regime, such as Halder, who threw themselves into planning the invasion, and believed it would succeed. Even the most experienced officers shared Hitler's contempt for the Soviet state and army.

2500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage likens [...] "Journey’s End" [...] to [...] "one {{big house}} of cards... will <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> down" [...] if thought about too much. However, {{he had no}} problem with the {{resolution}} of [...] "The Stolen Earth"'s cliffhanger and is critical of those who complain about feeling cheated by the lack of a regeneration. Though he expresses that he saw little need for Mickey and Jackie in this episode, he asserts that Donna had [...] "the saddest end for a companion ever" [...] and praises Davies for just managing to keep the plot together. He argues that as Davies [...] "writes the emotions and big themes so well...blow logic and rational plot moments if they get in the way!" [...] He compares Davies's writing style to [...] "PT Barnum showmanship" [...] and praises both the dark and light elements of the episode. He concludes that, if not overthought, the episode remains [...] "an audacious, big, silly, often poignant season finale".|$|E
2500|$|Fantino {{was criticized}} by lawyer Peter Rosenthal {{during the trial}} of {{aboriginal}} activist Shawn Brant. Fantino was criticized for ordering wiretaps of Brant's phone without proper authority and for making provocative comments to Brant during negotiations to end a blockade of the rail line west of Kingston. By way of those illegal wiretaps, Fantino was recorded saying to Brant [...] "You are going to force me to do everything I can; within your community and everywhere else; to destroy your reputation" [...] and [...] "your whole {{world is going to}} <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> down" [...] NDP MPP Peter Kormos called for Fantino's resignation accusing him of using [...] "pugnacious and bellicose" [...] rhetoric and for engaging in [...] "Rambo-style policing." [...] In the face of defence motions for the police to disclose more evidence about their conduct the Crown agreed to drop the most serious charges against Brant in exchange for a plea bargain resulting in a light sentence. Fantino was also criticized {{for his role in the}} Caledonia land dispute after he was accused of sending e-mails to local politicians accusing them of encouraging anti-police rallies by non-Natives.|$|E

2500|$|Work {{was begun}} on [...] "The Great Stone Church" [...] (the only chapel {{building}} in Alta California not constructed out of adobe) on February 2, 1797. It {{was laid out}} {{in the shape of a}} cross, measuring [...] long by [...] wide with [...] high walls, and included a [...] tall campanile (bell tower) located adjacent to the main entrance. Local legend has it that the tower could be seen for ten miles (16km) or more, and that the bells could be heard from even farther away. The sandstone building sat on a foundation seven feet thick. Construction efforts required the participation of the entire [...] population. Stones were quarried from gullies and creek beds up to six miles (10km) away and transported in carts (carretas) drawn by oxen, carried by hand, and even dragged to the building site. Limestone was crushed into a powder on the Mission grounds to create a mortar that was more erosion-resistant than the actual stones. On the afternoon of November 22, 1800, tremors from the 6.5-magnitude San Diego earthquake cracked the walls of the rising edifice, necessitating that repair work be performed. Unfortunately, Señor Aguilár died six years into the project; his work was carried on by the priests and their charges, who made their best attempts to emulate the existing construction. Lacking the skills of a master mason, however, led to irregular walls and necessitated the addition of a seventh roof dome. The church was finally completed in 1806, and blessed by Fray Estévan Tapís on the evening of September 7; a two-day-long fiesta followed. The sanctuary floors were paved with diamond-shaped tiles, and brick-lined niches displayed the statues of various saints. It was by all accounts the most magnificent in all of California and a three-day feast was held in celebration of this monumental achievement. Tragedy struck the settlement when on the morning of December 8, 1812, the [...] "Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin", a series of large earthquakes shook Southern California during the first Sunday service. The 7.5-magnitude San Juan Capistrano earthquake racked the doors to the church, pinning them shut. When the ground finally stopped shaking, the bulk of the nave had <b>come</b> <b>crashing</b> down, and the bell tower was completely obliterated. Forty native worshipers who were attending Mass and two boys who had been ringing the bells in the tower were buried under the rubble and lost their lives, and were subsequently interred in the Mission cemetery. This was the second major setback the outpost had suffered, and followed severe storms and flooding that had damaged Mission buildings and ruined crops earlier in the year.|$|E
