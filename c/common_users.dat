5000|$|While only trace {{amounts of}} lead are {{ingested}} from lipstick, lead accumulates in the body, {{which can lead}} to lead poisoning. The most <b>common</b> <b>users</b> of lipstick are teens and adult women. A study done by the University of California - Berkley found that women applied lipstick anywhere from two to fourteen times a day. This translates to up to 87 milligrams of product ingestion per day. [...] Lead ingestion is particularly concerning for pregnant women because lead can enter the fetus from the mother.|$|E
50|$|Music piracy {{was very}} limited {{in the decades}} prior to the {{invention}} of the internet and digital media. With the invention of newer technology that allowed for the piracy process to become less complicated, it became much more <b>common.</b> <b>Users</b> of the web began adding media files to the internet, and prior potential risks and difficulties to pirating music, such as the physicality of the process, were eliminated. It was much easier for people with little to no knowledge of technology and old piracy methods to gather media files.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century {{information}} systems initially developed from isolated islands of computing. Through progressive changes, these individual systems became connected by <b>common</b> <b>users</b> and common information needs. Late 20th century these systems were well on the way to migrating toward computing environments that consist of distributed, heterogeneous, networked applications, databases, and hardware. The concept emerged of a federal computing environment, that is built on an infrastructure defined by open, consensus-based standards which serve as de facto means of organizing these systems. The NIST developed such an infrastructure, and named it Open System Environment (OSE).|$|E

50|$|SDS' {{campaign}} {{management system}} is a platform through which operators manage their promotions and incentive campaigns, mostly for their retailers. The SDS campaign system can design campaigns to provide incentives to the retailers and resellers of a service provider to promote a certain product or service. This platform allows the service provider to create and manage campaigns based on time, value, place, target and other parameters. Sales and Marketing teams of service providers are the <b>common</b> <b>users</b> of this system to incentivize the retailers and distributors to sell more and get rewards and commissions for that.|$|E
50|$|User analysis: This {{process is}} based around {{designing}} for {{the attributes of}} the intended user or operator, establishing the characteristics that define them, creating a persona for the user. Best done {{at the outset of}} the design process, a user analysis will attempt to predict the most <b>common</b> <b>users,</b> and the characteristics that they would be assumed to have in common. This can be problematic if the design concept does not match the actual user, or if the identified are too vague to make clear design decisions from. This process is, however, usually quite inexpensive, and commonly used.|$|E
50|$|Some online {{applications}} {{that allow the}} user to zoom into an area often include locator maps to assist in navigating the main map or image.

These locators often feature a movable box that assists the user with navigating the main map.Other applications using locator software allow people to generate their own location maps by entering some basic information about where they are. This generates a map showing places within a specified radius of that point that meet the user's criteria.
