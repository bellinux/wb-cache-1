5|$|The hall has {{a number}} of student run organisations {{associated}} with it, the largest of which is the Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> which all current undergraduates residents are members of, with an elected committee of representatives being responsible for organising social events throughout the year. In addition to the Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> residents are supported pastorally by a team of Senior Residents who, along with a number of honorary members, make up the Senior <b>Common</b> <b>Room.</b>|$|E
5|$|Accommodation is {{provided}} for all undergraduates, {{and for some}} graduates, though some accommodation is off-site. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one informal and one formal, except on Saturdays, where there is only an informal sitting. The Bar, situated underneath the Hall, serves food from mid-morning and drinks in the evening. There is both a Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> (JCR), between Second and Third quad, and a Middle <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> (MCR), on the Island Site.|$|E
5000|$|Reflecting {{the collegiate}} {{nature of the}} University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an {{association}} of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Rooms</b> (JCRs), Middle <b>Common</b> <b>Rooms</b> (MCRs), Graduate <b>Common</b> <b>Rooms</b> (GCRs), and other affiliated organisations that represent all undergraduate and graduate students at the University's forty-four [...] and Permanent Private Halls.|$|R

5|$|All current {{undergraduate}} {{residents are}} members of the hall's Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> with a Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> Committee being elected annually {{at the beginning of the}} Summer Term from amongst the residents and is responsible for organising many of the social and recreational activities in the hall, including the Freshers’ Welcome at the start of the academic year, sporting activities, hall 'formals' (dinner followed by various entertainments), and the annual garden party.|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> (the oldest dining club in Oxford) {{was founded}} at Brasenose in 1782, and {{certainly}} in place by 1786. It came to have a uniform, code of practice, and extensive wine cellar. It also took part {{of the role of}} the modern Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> in respect of social activities – although membership was limited to 12, it was elected on rotation.|$|E
5|$|The Old Members' Building, which {{contains}} a music room, 24 study-bedrooms and some lecture rooms, was built between 1969 and 1971. It was built after a fundraising appeal to Old Members {{to mark the}} college's quatercentenary, and was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1971. The Fellows' Garden is between the Old Members' Building and {{the rear of the}} rooms {{on the west side of}} the second quadrangle. In 2002, a two-year project to rebuild the property above the college-owned shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> (JCR), to replace the <b>common</b> <b>room</b> in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students.|$|E
50|$|JCR Presidents and External Officers in Cambridge are {{ex officio}} council {{members of the}} Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU). Before CUSU was established, {{individual}} JCRs were direct members of the NUS. This meant that Churchill JCR was able to lead the NUS in its campaign for student representation. Unlike most universities, CUSU serves the <b>common</b> <b>rooms</b> and <b>common</b> <b>rooms</b> may choose to disaffiliate. CUSU is funded by the <b>common</b> <b>rooms</b> rather than funding them.|$|R

5|$|The {{graduate}} {{community at}} Castle forms the Middle <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> (MCR), {{which is based}} in the Maurice Tucker (previously William de St-Calais) Room. However, due to size restrictions, no members of the MCR are currently able to live in the college grounds. The MCR, like the JCR, organises a number of social events and activities, such as the college's entry into the inter-collegiate University Challenge competition, which acts as trials for the University's team. The Senior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> (SCR), is an organisation of academics and tutors connected to the college. The SCR also organises formal meals with guest speakers.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room,</b> for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle <b>Common</b> <b>Room,</b> for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It {{is worth noting that}} JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E

5|$|At New College, he {{was popular}} with his peers, and was elected Steward of the Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> by them. He played cricket and rugby {{for the college}} team, and was the winner of both double and single fives at the {{university}} in 1877. In a seniors' cricket match in 1880, he bowled out William Patterson, who later captained Kent County Cricket Club.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{a two-year}} project {{to rebuild the}} {{property}} above the shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, {{carried out by the}} architects Maguire & Co., the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> (JCR), to replace the <b>common</b> <b>room</b> in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students. The new JCR, about twice the size of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms. The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms, and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> the hall has several student societies established exclusively for its residents including a Music and Drama Society, Debating Society, Club Bar, Christian Union and Charity Committee, the latter being involve in year round fundraising activities {{for a number of}} charities to which the hall has a close association.|$|E

5|$|The student bar of University College {{is called}} the Undercroft Bar (known colloquially as The Undie), due to its {{location}} in an 11th-century Undercroft.

It is currently run by the Food and Beverage Services Manager {{with the help of}} several JCR members.|$|E
5|$|The {{undergraduate}} {{student body}} (Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room</b> or JCR) {{is governed by}} an elected Executive Committee headed by the Senior Man (even when a female student holds the role) and supported by several other officers.

There are several other elected non-executive officers such as Returning Officer, Fresher Rep and Sports Captain who organise other important college functions. The Senior Man meets regularly with college and university authorities to represent the JCR.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Morales {{returned}} to her birthplace of Santiago. While few knew of her actions during the war, the men she served alongside remembered her well. When she appeared at the unveiling of the monument to the common Chilean roto at the Plaza Yungay, she received some of the most enthusiastic applause. After years of illness, she died in anonymity in the <b>common</b> <b>room</b> of a Santiago hospital on 25 August 1890, aged only 25. For her, widespread recognition came only after her death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} survive and are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior <b>Common</b> <b>Room.</b> Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, {{can be seen to}} have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E
