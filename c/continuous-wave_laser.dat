25|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb is a laser source whose spectrum {{consists of a}} series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines. Frequency combs can be generated by a number of mechanisms, including periodic modulation (in amplitude and/or phase) of a <b>continuous-wave</b> <b>laser,</b> four-wave mixing in nonlinear media or stabilization of the pulse train generated by a mode-locked laser. Much work has been devoted to the latter mechanism, which was developed {{around the turn of the}} 21st century and ultimately led to one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics being shared by John L.

50|$|Self-pulsation is a {{transient}} phenomenon in <b>continuous-wave</b> <b>lasers.</b> Self-pulsation {{takes place at}} the beginning of laser action. As the pump is switched on, the gain in the active medium rises and exceeds the steady-state value.

The laser pulsates; the output power at the peaks can be orders of magnitude larger than that between pulses. After several strong peaks, the amplitude of pulsation reduces, and the system behaves as a linear oscillator with damping.
