40|$|Murine {{erythroleukemia}} {{cells are}} induced to differentiate by 0. 5 - 5 ng of actinomycin D per ml. Murine erythroleukemia cells cultured with actinomycin D prolong cell doubling time but {{achieve the same}} density after 5 days as cells without inducer. Actinomycin D causes over 95 % of the cells to become benzidine-reactive. [3 H]Actinomycin D uptake into DNA can be detected within 2 hr and reaches a maximum (approximately 0. 1 pmol/ 106 cells) by 10 - 12 hr. It is estimated that {{about one out of}} 105 dG·dC pairs is bound to actinomycin D. Commitment to differentiation, assayed by transfer of cells to culture without inducer, was detected as early as 5 hr. Unlike Me 2 SO, which causes a transient prolongation in G 1 at about 15 - 20 hr, cells cultured with actinomycin D show a more sustained increase in the proportion of the cells in G 1. Globin mRNA accumulation was detectable by 19 hr in <b>culture.</b> <b>Alteration</b> in DNA stability in alkaline sucrose gradients was detected by 19 hr. Actinomycin D induces synthesis of Hbmaj and Hbmin in approximately equal amounts. A decrease in rates of synthesis of RNA, DNA, and total protein occurs in cells cultured with actinomycin D, as well as in cells cultured with Me 2 SO. No evidence for an early action of actinomycin D at the plasma membrane was obtained by measurement of changes in cell volume or 86 RbCl uptake. Taken together, the present results indicate that actinomycin D is a potent inducer of differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells and suggest that the target of its effect may be at the level of DNA...|$|E

40|$|Purpose—To link MMP- 13 {{activity}} and ECM remodeling to alterations in regulatory factors {{leading to a}} disruption in chondrocyte homeostasis. Methods—Matrix-metalloproteinase- 13 (MMP- 13) expression was ablated in primary human chondrocytes by stable retrotransduction of short-hairpin RNAs. The effects of MMP- 13 KD on key regulators of chondrocyte differentiation (Sox 9, Runx 2 and β-catenin), and angiogenesis (VEGF) were scored at the protein (immunohistochemistry or western blot) and RNA (real time PCR) levels in high density monolayer and micromass cultures under mineralizing conditions. Effects on cellular viability in conjunction with chondrocyte progression towards a hypertrophiclike state were assessed in micromass <b>cultures.</b> <b>Alterations</b> in Sox 9 subcellular distribution were assessed by confocal microscopy in micromass cultures and also in OA cartilage. Results—Differentiation of control chondrocyte micromasses progressed up to a terminal phase, with calcium deposition in conjunction with reduced cell viability and scant ECM. MMP- 13 knock-down (KD) impaired ECM remodeling and suppressed differentiation in conjunction with reduced levels of Runx 2, β-catenin and VEGF. MMP- 13 levels in vitro and ECM remodeling in vitro and in vivo were linked to changes in Sox 9 sub-cellular localization. Sox 9 was largely excluded from the nuclei of chondrocytes with MMP- 13 remodeled or degraded ECM, and exhibited an intranuclear staining pattern in chondrocytes with impaired MMP- 13 activity in vitro or with more intact ECM in vivo. Conclusions—MMP- 13 loss leads to a break-down in primary human articular chondrocyte differentiation by altering the expression of multiple regulatory factors...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} {{the use of a}} chemostat system to investigate the impact of changes in the specific growth rate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CABI 039916 on cellular amino acid profiles and total protein content. This experimental system allowed the unambiguous examination of the link between changes in dilution rate and the culture response, which would have been difficult in batch or fed-batch <b>cultures.</b> <b>Alteration</b> of the specific growth rate (via manipulation of the dilution rate) within a carbon and energy-limited chemostat has {{a significant impact on the}} physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Low dilution rates (0. 2 h(- 1)) led to respirofermentative metabolism, where the cellular protein content was minimal (similar to 40 %). The content of nearly all amino acids in the yeast protein pool fell significantly as dilution rate increased in parallel with the decline in cell protein content. By contrast, the concentration of two related key food/feed amino acids in the cell protein pool-glutamic acid and arginine could be increased within the cellular protein by 5 % (increasing the dilution rate from 0. 05 h(- 1) to 0. 25 h(- 1)) and 1. 5 % respectively (decreasing the dilution rate from 0. 05 h(- 1) to 0. 2 h(- 1)). Despite previous studies showing that metabolic change was associated with major changes in free amino acid levels, {{the present study}} indicates that the total cellular yeast protein amino acid composition is largely invariant despite profound metabolic changes, with one or two key exceptions...|$|R
40|$|Recent evidences {{show that}} the {{localization}} of different plasma membrane Ca 2 + ATPases (PMCAs) is regulated in various complex, cell type-specific ways. Here we show that in low-density epithelial and endothelial cells PMCA 4 b localized mostly in intracellular compartments and its plasma membrane localization was enhanced upon increasing density of cells. In good correlation with the enhanced plasma membrane localization a significantly more efficient Ca 2 + clearance was observed in confluent versus non-confluent HeLa cell cultures expressing mCherry-PMCA 4 b. We analyzed the subcellular localization and function of various C-terminally truncated PMCA 4 b variants and found that a truncated mutant PMCA 4 b-ct 24 was mostly intracellular while another mutant, PMCA 4 b-ct 48, localized more to the plasma membrane, indicating that a protein sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 1158 – 1181 contained a signal responsible for the intracellular retention of PMCA 4 b in non-confluent <b>cultures.</b> <b>Alteration</b> of three leucines to alanines at positions 1167 – 1169 resulted in enhanced cell surface expression and an appropriate Ca 2 + transport activity of both wild type and truncated pumps, suggesting that the di-leucine-like motif 1167 LLL was crucial in targeting PMCA 4 b. Furthermore, upon loss of cell–cell contact by extracellular Ca 2 + removal, the wild-type pump was translocated to the early endosomal compartment. Targeting PMCA 4 b to early endosomes was diminished by the L 1167 – 69 A mutation, and the mutant pump accumulated in long tubular cytosolic structures. In summary, we report a di-leucine-like internalization signal at the C-tail of PMCA 4 b and suggest an internalization-mediated loss of function of the pump upon low degree of cell–cell contact...|$|R
40|$|Scald is {{the most}} common form of burn in young children, {{accounting}} for over 50 % of all paediatric burn admissions in Western Australia (WA). Interventions implemented over the past few years focussed on prevention, first aid, and improved services postinjury (Department of Health Western Australia, 2009). The population of children in WA is rising and an epidemiological study was undertaken to assess changes in the profile of scald injury among WA children and to assess priorities for future action. Data were collected from all acute inpatient admissions presenting with scald injury for 1998 and 2008. These data were compared with state-wide admission data, local presentation data, population growth and shift within WA. Comparisons of types and severity of injury, treatments, healing, infection, remote and rural patients, first aid administered and by whom, and scar management were analysed. The incidence of scald injury was not reduced, but numbers of admissions were, possibly due to changes in patient management. The admitted wounds were larger, but did not require more surgery in 2008. An important group to target for preventive strategies were the 1 - 2 year olds who were scalded by hot drinks. The amount of first aid given by carers had not improved, and inappropriate substances were applied to wounds by carers as first aid treatments in both years, often influenced by <b>culture.</b> <b>Alterations</b> in analgesic drugs and administration routes meant less intramuscular injections for all children.

40|$|Although human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESC) {{have been shown to}} present a stable diploid karyotype 1, many studies have reported that depending on culture conditions they become prone to acquire chromosomal anomalies such as addition of whole or parts of chromosomes.

40|$|As social {{readjustment}} {{and recovery}} efforts among military populations suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) continue to perplex researchers, mental health professionals, and veterans, dynamics of social stigma are increasingly problematized and targeted as sites of intervention {{in public health}} campaigns and inter-disciplinary research inquiries. In response to these problems and attributions of stigma, this research investigates historical, theoretical, and institutional sources of stigmatization in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} psychiatric casualties suffering from the condition now known as PTSD. Through archaeological analysis of this history, the research identifies pivotal scientific controversies, competing theoretical perspectives, and shifts in psychiatric treatment that display on-going tensions characterizing psychiatric science in relation to changes in socio-political sensitivities implicating dynamics of social stigmatization. Close analytic attention is directed towards examining the politics and practices involved in the instantiation of a Therapeutic Community experimental model of post-combat treatment in a U. S. Naval Hospital conducted by Dr. Harry A. Wilmer with Korean War Veterans in 1955 designed explicitly to intervene in stigmatizing institutional configurations and socio-cultural attitudes. Research findings reveal that discourses highlighting the role of psychological trauma, overwhelming stress, and sexual or physical domination emerged as counter-discourses that challenged dominant neuro-psychiatric theories which purported neurological inferiority, genetic susceptibility, and moral weakness as conventional explanations of post-traumatic reactions. These reductive explanations are further argued to predispose psychiatric diagnostic discourse to stigmatize survivors of trauma through the instantiation of discursive suspicion in association with malingering and interiorized pre-conditions that politically diffract attention away from the concrete events productive of traumatic injury. Analysis also reveals a lineage of counter-theories that underscore the role that interpersonal, doctor-patient, and public communication has for not only in producing self stigma and identity altering interactions, but also in sustaining and recovering from post-traumatic reactions. Findings demonstrate how interventions in systemic cycles of stigmatization and patterns of pathological communication in treatment contexts can be facilitated by organization <b>culture</b> <b>alterations</b> encouraging staff discursive reflexivity of transference communication, and patient social support encouraging narrative reconstructions of self and others through utilization of meta-communicative techniques...|$|R
40|$|Improving the congruity of {{preclinical}} {{models with}} cancer {{as it is}} manifested in humans is a potential way to mitigate the high attrition rate of new cancer therapies in the clinic. In this regard, three-dimensional (3 D) tumor cultures in vitro have recently regained interest {{as they have been}} acclaimed to have higher similarity to tumors in vivo than to cells grown in monolayers (2 D). To identify cancer functions that are active in 3 D rather than in 2 D cultures, we compared the transcriptional profiles (TPs) of two non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, NCI-H 1650 and EBC- 1 grown in both conditions to the TP of xenografted tumors. Because confluence, diameter or volume can hypothetically alter TPs, we made intra- and inter-culture comparisons using samples with defined dimensions. As projected by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), a limited number of signal transduction pathways operational in vivo were better represented by 3 D than by 2 D cultures in vitro. Growth of 2 D and 3 D cultures as well as xenografts induced major changes in the TPs of these 3 modes of <b>culturing.</b> <b>Alterations</b> of transcriptional network activation that were predicted to evolve similarly during progression of 3 D cultures and xenografts involved the following functions: hypoxia, proliferation, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and interleukin activation. Direct comparison of TPs of 3 D cultures and xenografts to monolayer cultures yielded up-regulation of networks involved in hypoxia, TGF and Wnt signaling as well as regulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Differences in TP of 2 D and 3 D cancer cell cultures are subject to progression of the cultures. The emulation of the predicted cell functions in vivo is therefore not only determined by the type of culture in vitro but also by the confluence or diameter of the 2 D or 3 D cultures, respectively. Consequently, the successful implementation of 3 D models will require phenotypic characterization to verify the relevance of applying these models for drug development...|$|R
40|$|To {{listen to}} music {{just a few hundred}} years ago would require {{hundreds}} of miles of travel, tons of wood and metal and ivory and copper strings, construction of a stage and audience platforms, human capital to perform the music of course, and lots of money. All of these variables would combine to produce an auditory experience of approximately 45 minutes total. Today, a single musician can produce the sound of dozens with just a laptop, and it can be consumed relatively cheaply with the click of a button. Digital services such as iTunes or Spotify give listeners access to enough music to last 140, 000 years in an intangible format. As incredible as this metamorphosis is, it does beg the question: is all change a good thing? With music being one of the central pillars of <b>culture,</b> <b>alterations</b> to the music industry often have acute social effects and are manifested in day‐to-­day life. Music radio, per se, made music the standard audio choice in car rides. The Walkman radio radicalized the portability of music and the design of headphones.

Now, his once impenetrable fortress of music access is being threatened by taste-­prediction capable, on demand streaming services, such as Spotify. Americans listen to an average of 4 hours of music per day and it is an arms race of who gets the profit from that daily consumption. Although consumers reap the benefits of this competition, it is putting the longevity of the industry in a precarious situation. Alarmingly, the revenue of the music industry has been in nearly constant decline since 2006, perhaps due to these rapid changes in methods of music consumption.

Instead, polymerization of host-derived actin at the bacterial cell surface extends the non-dividing elongation period and compresses the division period.

Thus, there is a positive-feedback loop between the Lm cell division cycle and a physical interaction with the host cytoskeleton...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY-The rate of glucose uptake and the {{formation}} of lactic acid and C 02 were studied in normal and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chick-embryo fibroblasts cultured at low and high cell densities. In normal cells the ratio of lactic acid produced to C 02 evolved increased with in-creasing cell density. These changes were not due to variations in the pool sizes or breakdown of glycogen but indicated high cell-density cultures preferred use of the glycolytic pathway over aerobic pathways. The ph os-phogluconate pathway also became more prominent as cells became relatively dense. However, population density per se and not the growth rate appeared responsible for the changes in pattern of carbon flow. Trans-formed cultures were similarly affected by population density. Moreover, under comparable conditions of growth rate and population density, the rate of lactic acid production and the ratio of lactate/C 02 were higher in transformed than in normal cultures.

The capacity to inhibit B cell proliferation was independent of and distinct from its capacity to inhibit B cell differentiation, since IgSRK inhibited the differentiation of a B cell differentiation factor (BCDF) -sensitive line by BCDF (which contains no BCPF activity). IgSRK inhibited PWM-induced generation of cytoplasmic Ig+ cells but had no effect on Ig secretion from mature Ig-secreting cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that IgSRK (which contains the IgG fraction from pooled plasma from 2, 000 healthy donors) can inhibit T cell-dependent or T cell factor-dependent B cell proliferation and B cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory {{thinning}} {{disorder of}} the corneal stroma. Recently, {{we showed that}} these corneas contain inducible nitric oxide synthase and an accumulation of nitrotyrosine, representing oxidative damage from peroxynitrite. Previously, we suggested that keratoconus corneas and their cell <b>cultures</b> have <b>alterations</b> in a gelatinase system with increased matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) activity and decreased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1 (TIMP- 1). This study examines whether a peroxynitrite donor (3 -morpholinosydomine N-ethylcarbamide, SIN- 1) or nitric oxide donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP) could alter TIMP- 1 and/or MMP- 2 in vitro. Normal stromal fibroblasts were cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of either SIN- 1 or SNAP for varying times. These cultures were analyzed by western and northern blot analyses, gelatin zymography, and a quantitative gelatinase/MMP assay. In vitro, SIN- 1 treatment led to protein nitration, increased RNA levels of TIMP- 1 and MMP- 2, and loss of TIMP- 1 immunostaining, but did not diminish gelatinase activity. SNAP treatment led to activation of MMP- 2 and significantly increased gelatinase/MMP activity, without a change in TIMP- 1 levels. Our data show that peroxynitrite or nitric oxide can decrease TIMP- 1 and increase gelatinase activity, respectively. This demonstrates a relationship between elements of oxidative stress and tissue degradation in human corneal fibroblasts. This effect may play a significant role in the stromal thinning that occurs in keratoconus...|$|R
40|$|British pillboxes and the {{defensive}} structures of Pointe du Hoc were both constructed {{around the time}} of the Second World War. While they may share physical similarities, the ways that they have been treated both during and after the Second World War differs greatly. Structures that were designed to defend areas and the soldiers who resided inside have taken on new uses and meanings. This thesis is to show these structures lives. This has been done through using the idea of an object biography, which can show the creation, use and possible disuse of an object or architecture. Pillboxes have been surveyed from the counties of Lancashire and Cumbria as well as the Pointe du Hoc site being the only Normandy coast site. By conducting field research along with historical and oral records I will show the object biography of these structures. Furthermore research will show the changes of biography, drawing comparisons between the British pillbox and {{the defensive}} structures at Pointe du Hoc. The work places great emphasis on what is found at each individual structure. These ‘physical indicators’ (graffiti, damage, material <b>culture</b> and <b>alterations)</b> are the biography. The physical indicators show evidence of pillbox use during its life. We can use them to ascertain what the biography of a structure is and how it has changed through time...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{determined}} the expression and activation of p 38 MAPK in matured porcine oocytes subjected to heat shock (HS). When MII oocytes were heated, only the phosphorylated p 38 levels {{relative to the}} total p 38 levels decreased (P < 0. 01) after HS, but no clear relationship with HS treatments was observed in the ERK, JNK and p 90 (rsk) expressions of matured oocytes. To confirm p 38 activation in matured oocytes, immunocytochemical staining was performed to localize its expression and distribution in the ooplasm, {{and the results were}} largely consistent with previous Western blot analyses. Moreover, when matured oocytes were co-cultured with a P 38 MAPK inhibitor, SB 203580, for 4 h at 41. 5 C, the activation of its immediate downstream substrate MAPKAPK- 2 was not inhibited within any of the treatment groups. It appears that the MAPKAPK 2 levels increased only under prolonged culture (HS 4 h and C 4 h) compared with the control group. In conclusion, p 38 activity in porcine oocytes was decreased after exposure to HS and prolonged <b>culture.</b> These <b>alterations</b> of p 38 and activation of MAPKAPK 2 may be associated with porcine oocyte viability under HS conditions, and a potential cross-talk between p 38 MAPK and other signaling cascades may exist, which warrants additional investigation...|$|R

The labelng patterns of galactosyl and N-acetyl galactosaminyl residues on the cell surface were altered in comparing scraped vs. unscraped and buffer vs. media-soaked cells treated with galactose oxidase. From these preliminary studies, the procedure {{to be used in}} most of the asbestos treatment studies was to treat cells in tu, in buffer with galactose oxidase, and then to label treated scraped cells with NaB 3 H 4. After 20 hr interaction between chrysotile asbestos and Syrian hamster cell <b>cultures,</b> an <b>alteration</b> in surface labeling of glycolipids and glycoproteins was observed. Tritiated disialogangliosides (GDia) and the higher molecular weight labeled glycoproteins were significantly reduced by asbestos treatment. Similar chrysotile asbestos-treated cultures were grown in monolayers in MEM (Eagles) with 10 %o fetal bovine serum for 2, 24, 48, and 72 hr and then surface-labeled with galactose oxidase-. NaB 3 H 4 in phosphate buffer. Little or no difference was observed between surface-labeled lipid or protein distribution in untreated cells and those treated with asbestos for 2 hr. Asbestos-induced polar and neutral glycolipid pattern changes were observed at 24, 48, and 72 hr. Disialo- and trisialogangliosides (the more complex gangliosides) were decreased 85 %, whereas gobodde GL 4 was decreased by 60 %o at 72 hr. An overal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use of Vero {{cells for}} rabies vaccine {{production}} was recommended from the WHO in 2005. A controlled production process {{is necessary to}} reduce the risk of contaminants in the product. One step towards this is to turn away from animal-derived components (e. g. serum, trypsin, bovine serum albumin) and face a production process in animal component-free medium. In this study, a proteomic approach was applied, using 2 -D differential gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to compare rabies virus propagation in Vero cells under different cultivation conditions in microcarrier <b>culture.</b> Protein <b>alterations</b> were investigated for uninfected and infected Vero cells over a time span from 1 to 8  days post-infection in two different types of media (serum-free versus serum-containing media). For mock-infected cells, proteins involved in stress response, redox status, protease activity or glycolysis, and protein components in the endoplasmic reticulum were found to be differentially expressed comparing both cultivation media at all sampling points. For virus-infected cells, additionally changes in protein expression involved in general cell regulation and in calcium homeostasis were identified under both cultivation conditions. The fact that neither of these additional proteins was identified for cells during mock infection, but similar protein expression changes were found for both systems during virus propagation, indicates for a specific response of the Vero cell proteome on rabies virus infection...|$|R
