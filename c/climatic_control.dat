40|$|Net primary {{productivity}} (NPP) represents the greatest annual carbon flux {{from the atmosphere}} to the biosphere, {{is an important component}} of seasonal fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, and is the most critical biotic component of the global carbon cycle. NPP measures products of major economic and social importance, such as crop yield and forest production. Given that global NPP can not be measured directly, model simulations must provide understanding of its global spatial and temporal dynamics. In this study, we used the biogeochemical model BIOME-BGC to simulate global terrestrial NPP and assessed relative importance of <b>climatic</b> <b>controls</b> (temperature, water availability, and radiation) in limiting NPP in the array of climatic combinations found globally. The degree of limitation on NPP by <b>climatic</b> <b>controls</b> was defined by using an empirical membership function.

Nevertheless, there were areas of the globe (12 %) where none of the climatic factors appeared to limit NPP.

40|$|Understanding and {{modeling}} ecosystem responses to their <b>climatic</b> <b>controls</b> {{is one of}} the major challenges for predicting the effects of global change. Usually, the responses are implemented in models as parameterized functional relationships of a fixed type. In contrast, the inductive approach presented here based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) allows the relationships to be extracted directly from the data. It has been developed to explore large, fragmentary, noisy, and multidimensional datasets, such as the carbon fluxes measured at the ecosystem level with the eddy covariance technique. To illustrate this, our approach has been systematically applied to the daytime carbon flux dataset of the deciduous broadleaf forest Hainich in Germany. The total explainable variability of the half-hourly carbon fluxes from the driving climatic variables was 93. 1 %, showing the excellent data mining capability of the ANNs. Total photosynthetic photon flux density was identified as the dominant control of the daytime response, followed by the diffuse radiation. The vapor pressure deficit was the most important nonradiative control. From the ANNs, we were also able to deduce and visualize the dependencies and sensitivities of the response to its <b>climatic</b> <b>controls.</b> With respect to diffuse radiation, the daytime carbon response showed no saturation and the light use efficiency was three times greater for diffuse compared with direct radiation. However, with less potential radiation reaching the forest, the overall effect of diffuse radiation was slightly negative. The optimum uptake of carbon occurred at diffuse fractions between 30 % and 40 %. By identifying the hierarchy of the <b>climatic</b> <b>controls</b> of the ecosystem response as well as their multidimensional functional relationships, our inductive approach offers a direct interface to the data.

50|$|The {{elevation}} of the Tibetan Plateau during the Tertiary period was {{an important factor in}} the genesis of the south-west monsoon, which is the dominant <b>climatic</b> <b>control</b> influencing the hydrology of the Mekong Basin. Understanding the nature and timing of the {{elevation of}} Tibet (and the Central Highlands of Vietnam) therefore helps explain the provenance of sediment reaching the delta and the Tonle Sap Great Lake today. Studies of the provenance of sediments in the Mekong delta reveal a major switch in the source of sediments about eight million years ago (Ma). From 36 to 8 Ma the bulk (76 percent) of the sediments deposited in the delta came from erosion of the bedrock in the Three Rivers Area. From 8 Ma to the present, however, the contribution from the Three Rivers Area fell to 40 percent, while that from the Central Highlands rose from 11 to 51 percent. One of the most striking conclusions of provenance studies is the small contribution of sediment from the other parts of the Mekong basin, notably the Khorat Plateau, the uplands of northern Laos and northern Thailand, and the mountain ranges south of the Three Rivers area.|$|E

40|$|Aims and background: Species {{range shift}} {{is among the}} most {{well-documented}} responses to climate change. As a result, a growing number of studies model species climatic niches to predict how species ranges may displace in space and time (SDM studies). These studies are criticised because they do not include reproduction in their predictions. Other studies use empirical data to assess <b>climatic</b> <b>control</b> on reproductive life-stages. However, the climatic niche of reproductive life-stages may not determine the climatic niche of species, limiting the ability of both types of studies to assess the effect of climate change. In this synthesis, I compare the results of a SDM study (Paper I) with the results of two empirical studies focussing on flowering performance (Paper II) and seedling emergence (Paper III). The research focuses on the leading and rear altitudinal edges of lowland and alpine species ranges, respectively, as those are the two delimiting fronts that are expected to be specifically vulnerable to climate change. Reproduction response to climate is a complex process because it involves several sub-stages that can be affected by climate in several ways. Therefore, the results included in this synthesis integrate several direct and size-dependent climatic effects on flowering performance and report on the importance of both the climate conditions occurring at the recruitment sites and those experienced by the source populations for seedling emergence. Study area and species: This thesis makes use of the sub-alpine and alpine landscapes of western Norway to investigate <b>climatic</b> <b>control</b> on species occurrence and reproduction. This study area was chosen because it includes the leading altitudinal edge of lowland species’ ranges and the rear altitudinal edge of alpine species’ ranges. The research uses Viola biflora (alpine), Viola palustris (lowland), Veronica alpina (alpine), and Veronica officinalis (lowland) as study cases because these species are common in the study area and the study sites, and are representative of the alpine and lowland communities occurring at the studied sites. Results and discussion: The <b>climatic</b> <b>control</b> on flowering performances and seedling emergence did not reflect the climatic niches of three out of four species, suggesting ontogenetic niche shift. These mismatches challenge the predictive ability of both SDMs and empirical studies focusing on reproductive life-stages. Papers II and III highlight the complexity of <b>climatic</b> <b>control</b> on reproduction and show species-specific results. Flowering was both climate- and size-dependent for three species, but the way size-dependency was expressed differed between species. Seedling emergence was less species-specific although one species (Veronica officinalis) was found to be affected by the climate experienced by its source populations while the three other species were only responding to the climate of their sowing sites. This illustrates the importance of accounting for the complexity of reproduction to improve climate-change predictions on plant reproduction. Finally, Papers I and II suggest a high importance of biotic interactions from the lowland flora for the two alpine species, stressing the importance of understanding plant-plant interactions to forecast climate-change impacts. Further research and conclusions: Structured population models can resolve some of the problems reported in this synthesis but further methodological developments are necessary to integrate local adaptation patterns and to accurately project the outputs of such models in space. Dispersal has been largely ignored in climate-change studies. Further research should also aim to improve knowledge on dispersal because quantifying dispersal and recruitment rates is required to predict accurately climate-change impacts on plant populations and potential range displacements. Individualistic responses to climate suggest drastic changes in plant communities over the coming years. Given the high importance of biotic interactions, increasing knowledge on species interactions will be an important step to better understand and predict the potential climate-change impacts. Since the <b>climatic</b> <b>control</b> of a given species may not relate to the <b>climatic</b> <b>control</b> of another species, more effort should be given to key and/or endangered species that may have specific value for conservation...|$|E

Cross-correlation spectral analyses have been performed on both clay mineral and d 18 O planktonic records. Detrital clay minerals display strong signals which are coherent with the d 18 O record, within the three main Milankovitch frequency bands (eccentricity, obliquity, and precession). The <b>climatic</b> <b>control</b> on clay mineral sedimentation largely depends on the latitudinal location of the sediment cores.

In this study, we quantified the regional soil N storage, spatial and vertical density distributions, and related <b>climatic</b> <b>controls</b> using 183 soil profiles sampled from 61 sites across the Northeast Tibetan Plateau shrublands during the period of 2011 – 2013. Our analysis revealed a soil N storage value of 132. 40 Tg at a depth of 100 cm, with an average density of 1. 21 kg m− 2. Soil N density was distributed at greater levels in alpine shrublands, compared with desert shrublands. Spatially, soil N densities decreased from south to north and from east to west, and, vertically, the soil N in the upper 30 and 50 cm accounted for 42 % and 64 % of the total soil N stocks in the Tibetan Plateau. However, compared with desert shrublands, the surface layers in alpine shrublands exhibited a larger distribution of soil N stocks. Overall, the soil N density in the top 30 cm increased significantly with the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and tended to decrease with the mean annual temperature (MAT), although the dominant <b>climatic</b> <b>controls</b> differed among shrubland types. Specifically, MAP in alpine shrublands, and MAT in desert shrubland, had a weak effect on N density. Soil pH can significant affect soil N density in the Tibetan Plateau shrublands.

In addition, future conditions (especially altered precipitation regimes and warming) are expected to result in changes in vegetation composition, and accordingly in litter species and chemical composition, but {{it is unclear how}} such changes could potentially alter litter decomposition. Litter transplantation experiments were carried out across six European sites (four forests and two grasslands) spanning a large geographical and climatic gradient (5. 6 – 11. 4 °C in annual temperature 511 – 878 mm in precipitation) to gain insight into the <b>climatic</b> <b>controls</b> on litter decomposition as well as the effect of litter origin and species.

Surprisingly, this study demonstrates that <b>climatic</b> <b>controls</b> on litter decomposition are quantitatively more important than species or site of origin.
