5|$|Loggers felled {{massive amounts}} of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. Reforestation efforts began in the 1940s because natural {{regeneration}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> pace with the rate of logging. In 1962, the Columbus Day Storm knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, old-growth forest covers only about {{five percent of the}} watershed.|$|E
5|$|Pitch darkness. Every now and then, an {{explosion}} in the night. They had orders to fire on any who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up. Their fingers on the triggers, they did not deprive themselves of this pleasure. If one of us had stopped for a second, a sharp shot finished off another filthy son of a bitch.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are so kind {{in asking}} me and I 'm {{not afraid of}} them," [...] {{explained}} Polly, prancing, simply because she <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>keep</b> still.|$|R
6000|$|... "I came yesterday, {{and have}} been getting my nest in order; but I <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>keep</b> away any longer, so I ran up to say 'How do you do?'" [...] {{answered}} Polly, in the cheery voice that did one's heart good to hear.|$|R
60|$|That is a {{great mystery}} and a great glory: but that alone <b>could</b> <b>not</b> make man good, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> even <b>keep</b> him alive.|$|R
5|$|Del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup Final, with the title {{on the line and}} looking to fulfill his {{childhood}} dream. He lost in the second rubber to David Ferrer, despite being two sets to one up, eventually losing in a pulsating five-set contest in a match lasting over five hours. With his country down 2–1, del Potro needed to beat Rafael Nadal in the reverse singles to keep the tie going. Del Potro dominated the first set, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> his level up and lost in four sets. For the third time in six years, Argentina lost in the finals of the Davis Cup World Group, this time 3–1.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were {{defeated}} by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942. The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany {{and in an}} effort to destroy German morale many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets. Soon German aircraft production <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> pace with losses and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating. By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.|$|E
5|$|Lampard {{then put}} Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} {{things up with}} a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> it out. Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly; I {{liked it}} as well as I said," [...] Gloriani {{declared}} in answer to Rowland's anxious query; [...] "or rather I liked it a great deal better. I did n't say how much, for fear of making your friend angry. But one can leave him alone now, for he 's coming round. I told you he <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> <b>keep</b> up the transcendental style, and he has already broken down. Don't you see it yourself, man?" ...|$|R

5|$|Nagato was {{selected}} to participate as a target ship in Operation Crossroads, a series of U.S. nuclear weapon tests held at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946. In mid-March, Nagato departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok, but her hull had not been repaired from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up. The ship had a list of seven degrees to port by the time tugboats from Eniwetok arrived. She reached the atoll on 4 April and Bikini in May.|$|E
5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of the North Koreans at the Pusan Perimeter were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than the North Koreans, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line. At the same time, the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and the North Koreans <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up the strength of their attacks. Most of the front saw only probing actions {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jordan mounted two counter-attacks. The {{first was}} over Beit Susin. The Legionnaires took several Israeli guard posts but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> {{them more than}} a few hours. The fighting took lives and some 20 injuries on the Israeli side. The second was at Kibbutz Gezer from where the diversion attacks had been launched. A force the strength of a battalion, made up of Legionnaires and irregulars and supported by a dozen armoured vehicles, attacked the kibbutz in the morning. It was defended by 68 soldiers of the Haganah (including 13 women).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Edmonstone {{would be}} a very {{unreasonable}} guardian, indeed, to be displeased,' said his friend, smiling. You say you stopped the purchase of the horse. Why so? <b>Could</b> you <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> him till you are more sure of yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what was}} she, I'd like to know, {{when you went}} away, Mr. Moses?" [...] said Sally, who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> long <b>keep</b> out of a conversation. [...] "She was {{handsome}} when you were only a great ugly boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I {{think it}} is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why <b>could</b> he <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} year the band recorded their last album with Richie, Halfway to Sanity. Richie left in August 1987, upset that {{after being in}} the band for five years, the other members would still not give him {{a share of the}} money they made selling T-shirts. Richie was replaced by Clem Burke from Blondie, which was disbanded at the time. According to Johnny, the performances with Burke—who adopted the name Elvis Ramone—were a disaster. He was fired after two performances (August 28 & 29, 1987) because his drumming <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up {{with the rest of the}} band. In September, Marky, now clean and sober, returned to the band.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} initial {{problems}} with the system. During Operation Commando Hunt I, for example, {{there were so many}} aircraft piling up in the air space over southern Laos that the air controllers and FACs <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> track of them. Pilots, many of whom were veterans of Rolling Thunder, tended to arrive over the area in large waves instead of spacing out their arrivals over time. One technical failure, however, would have huge ramifications for the entire program. The anti-personnel system, which was based on the dispersal of wide-area Gravel mines (the explosions of which would activate acoustic sensors) failed completely. The mines deteriorated too rapidly in the heat and humidity of Laos, thereby negating the system.|$|E
5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E
50|$|Although he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> quite <b>keep</b> up this standard, Malik {{finished}} {{the season with}} 24 first-class wickets at 32.54 and 19 in List A cricket, and although he missed Worcestershire's early games in 2005, by June he was firmly established in the first team as the county's fourth seamer.|$|R
60|$|What more, indeed, Lady Scatcherd, can {{any of us}} want, if only {{we could}} keep our tempers and {{feelings}} a little in abeyance? Dr Fillgrave, however, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> so <b>keep</b> his; and, therefore, he did want something more, though at the present moment he could have hardly said what.|$|R
5000|$|Daring {{joined the}} two-deckers Albion, Vanguard, Superb, Rodney and Canopus {{on the third}} cruise of the 1845 Experimental Squadron, the only brig to do so. They were joined on 21 October by the wooden steam sloop HMS Rattler. [...] The Times {{reported}} that Daring <b>could</b> often <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up with the larger ships: ...|$|R
5|$|Despite their advances, the Bone Wars {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact {{not only on the}} two scientists but also on their peers and the entire field. The public animosity between Cope and Marsh harmed the reputation of American paleontology in Europe for decades. Furthermore, the reported use of dynamite and sabotage by employees of both men may have destroyed or buried hundreds of potentially critical fossil remains. Joseph Leidy abandoned his more methodical excavations in the West, finding he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up with Cope's and Marsh's reckless searching for bones. Leidy also grew tired of the constant squabbling between the two men, with the result that his withdrawal from the field marginalized his own legacy; after his death, Osborn found not a single mention of the man in either of the rivals' works. In their haste to outdo each other, Cope and Marsh haphazardly assembled the bones of their own discoveries. Their descriptions of new species, based on their reconstructions, led to confusion and misconceptions that lasted for decades after their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{bounced back}} in the 200m {{backstroke}} and won his heat to qualify third-fastest, before claiming bronze {{in a time of}} 2m 3.14s behind the Hungarian duo of Sándor Wladár and Zoltán Verrasztó. He edged out the Soviet Union's Vladimir Shemetov by 0.34s, becoming the first Australian to win a medal in an individual backstroke event since David Theile in 1960. In the 4200m freestyle relay, he combined with Tonelli, Graeme Brewer and Ron McKeon as Australia came seventh after qualifying fourth. The Australians were sixth at the halfway point when Kerry jumped in for the third leg. Kerry moved Australia into fifth {{by the end of his}} leg, just 0.78s from the bronze medal position, after posting a split time of 1m 52.64s, the 18th fastest split in the race. However, McKeon <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> pace with the opposition anchor swimmers, and Australia finished seventh, 1.52s outside the medals.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Williams capped a {{brilliant}} {{first season with}} a record-setting game, running for two touchdowns and 117 yards to become Virginia Tech’s single-season rushing leader with 1,655 yards. Williams had long runs of 21 and 32 yards in the drive before setting the record on a 6-yard run to the 3. Williams also set Atlantic Coast Conference records with 21 rushing touchdowns and 22 total touchdowns this season breaking North Carolina’s Don McCauley ACC marks of 19 rushing touchdowns and 21 total in 1970. Tennessee’s star running back, Montario Hardesty, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up with Williams as the Volunteers’ senior had 18 carries for 39 yards and a touchdown. The Hokies outrushed Tennessee 229-5. Taylor completed 10 of 17 passes for 201 yards with an interception. Crompton completed 15 of 26 passes for 235 yards with a touchdown and an interception.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, {{he began}} to walk along {{at the foot of}} the precipice, {{examining}} every recess among the rocks, and all the nooks and corners which seemed to promise well, as places of encampment. Malleville <b>could</b> <b>not</b> quite <b>keep</b> up with him on account of the roughnesses and inequalities of the way.|$|R
50|$|Kuqi {{left the}} club {{following}} the expiry {{of his contract}} on 1 July 2012 as the club <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford to <b>keep</b> him for the 2012-13 campaign.|$|R
60|$|Ken <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{manage to}} <b>keep</b> a {{straight}} face as they went in, so he hid it and rushed up-stairs. He bumped into Raymond, knocking him flat.|$|R
5|$|The {{elections}} were originally planned for December 1956 {{but due to}} significant political changes in the government, resulting from Gomułka's ascension to power, they were delayed until early 1957. Among the various promises made by First Secretary Gomułka, during the Polish October peaceful revolution, to the restless Polish population was that of free elections. He {{knew that this was}} a promise that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> without seeing his party defeated. In the January 1957 elections the new 'democratic' aspect was the reintroduction of the secret ballot, and more importantly, there were more candidates than available seats in the parliament; in the 1952 elections the number of candidates equaled the number of seats in the Sejm. Another liberalizing factor was that unlike in previous elections, intimidation by the secret police (Służba Bezpieczeństwa) and the government against the opposition was limited.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the GameCube {{failed to}} reinvigorate {{flagging}} support from third parties, a trend continued from the Nintendo 64 through its successor, the Wii. The Wii had mostly relied on first-party titles to sell systems until 2009 when in-house development <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> up with demand for new material. This caused sales to drop and prompted a shift toward more aggressive courting of third-party developers. Despite this, the Wii {{would go on}} {{to become one of the}} most commercially successful home video game consoles of all time. For the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo has attempted to recruit outside developers early on to avoid a repeat of what happened to the Wii and reclaim the third-party support it enjoyed in the NES and SNES eras, though its success in this regard has been mixed.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{came close}} to {{qualifying}} for the 1986 FIFA World Cup despite losing their opening qualifying games away to Iceland and Spain. Wales then beat Iceland at Ninian Park, before recording a surprise 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park with a single Ian Rush goal. A 3–0 win over Spain at the Racecourse Ground meant that Wales could secure qualification by beating Scotland in their final qualification game at Ninian Park, though a draw would not be enough. The game ended in a 1–1 draw after a late Davie Cooper penalty cancelled out Mark Hughes's opener; Southall got a hand to the penalty, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>keep</b> it out. However, {{the result of the}} game was put into perspective when Scotland manager Jock Stein suffered a heart attack {{at the end of the}} game and died shortly afterwards.|$|E
50|$|However, the wet sediments <b>could</b> <b>not</b> just <b>keep</b> piling up. After 50 million years, {{there was}} simply too much rock and a 'log jam' in the process was formed. The rocks were {{squeezed}} together as they broke and crumpled up. As the compression intensified, the strata were slowly pushed up, creating new land.|$|R
5000|$|Jaudon {{was noted}} as a skilled [...] "financial diplomat" [...] {{who managed to}} keep European capital flowing to the Bank amid the Panic of 1837, his efforts to abet U.S. cotton speculation, and dubious bond sales, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{ultimately}} <b>keep</b> the bank afloat. It suspended payments in late 1839, and closed in 1841.|$|R
6000|$|Alexina did {{not make}} a fuss. Even at that horrible moment she remembered the {{importance}} of making a favourable impression. But she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> quite <b>keep</b> the alarm and excitement out of her voice as she called Stephen, and Stephen knew that something had gone wrong as he came quickly through the hall. [...] "Is the turkey burned, Lexy?" [...] he cried.|$|R
