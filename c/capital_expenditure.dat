5|$|The {{three levels}} of Brazilian {{government}} assured the free provision {{of a range of}} services to the bid, including security, medical services, customs, transport, immigration, and other governmental services and support. Rio de Janeiro also approved funding of US$240 billion from the Program for Growth Acceleration (PAC) of the federal government. Other revenue-generating activities include sponsorship sales, ticketing program, licensing and merchandising. These revenues will be supplemented by IOC-secured commercial and broadcast contributions. <b>Capital</b> <b>expenditure</b> on infrastructure by the government or the private sector includes already committed and ongoing investments of US$3.9 billion on projects such as airport and subway expansions and construction of the metropolitan road arc. The OCOG budget does not assume any capital contributions to the construction of permanent or legacy venues, other than for Games overlay, including the construction of temporary venues. The balance of OCOG expenditures will be funded by the public sector, involving a combination of government commitments from Federal, State and Municipal levels. The OCOG budget and operating expenses are projected at US$2.8 billion, with its Olympic-related budget, including capital investments in transportation, sports venues and incremental costs being US$11.6 billion. The government submitted guarantees to cover any potential shortfall. The bid expenses for both Applicant and Candidature phases were of R$85,792 million, as released during the official closing of the campaign on November 11, 2009.|$|E

A Reexamination of the Incremental Information Content of <b>Capital</b> <b>Expenditures</b> Abstract: Under generally accepted accounting principles, firms must postpone recognition of the earnings effects of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> until they realize the resulting revenues and expenses. However, if <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> change the profile of future profits, we expect share prices to impound that revision in profitability prior to its recognition under GAAP. This suggests that changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> should have information content beyond current-period unexpected earnings. Prior research considered annual changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> and detected incremental information only in restricted samples. However, we examine more general samples and observe that quarterly as well as annual changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> are informative beyond unexpected earnings. Furthermore, we predict greater incremental information content for fiscal fourth quarter changes in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> when considering all fiscal quarters simultaneously, because the effect of the earnings recognition delay under GAAP should be magnified for <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> made late in the fiscal year. Our results are consistent with this prediction and inconsistent with the prediction that changes in fiscal fourth quarter <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> reflect lower profitability that result from an inefficient bunching of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the fiscal fourth quarter.

40|$|Abstract: Under GAAP, {{recognition}} of the earnings impact of <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> is postponed until the resulting revenues and expenses are realized. However, if current-period <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> change in the profile of profits, an efficient capital market will impound the revision in current-period share prices. This suggests that unanticipated <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> have information content beyond current-period unexpected earnings. Kerstein and Kim (1995) document this effect for annual <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> when using different abnormal return accumulation periods for large and small firms. We observe such incremental information content in a more general setting on an annual basis, and we also detect the effect on a quarterly basis. Moreover, we find that fiscal fourth quarter unanticipated <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> have greater incremental information content than those of earlier quarters when all fiscal quarters are considered simultaneously using an annual event window. We document that more <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{are made in the}} fiscal fourth quarter by our sample firms than in other quarters, which is consistent with anecdotal evidence about managers "bunching " <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> near year-end. However, further analysis indicates that the greater fiscal fourth quarter incremental information content of unanticipated <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> is not due to such "bunching"; rather, it is due to accounting recognition rules.

40|$|Noteworthy {{growth in}} {{free cash flow}} has been well {{reported}} {{over the past few}} years as company management, financial analysts, and investors increasingly focus on cash flow to validate reported earnings. Unfortunately, the calculation of free cash flow has limitations, just like earnings. For example, as <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> decrease, free cash flow increases by the same amount, and vice versa. Thus, a temporary reduction in <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> could cause reported free cash flow to increase in an unsustainable way. This study examines growth in adjusted operating cash flow (operating cash flow adjusted for nonoperating and nonrecurring items), adjusted free cash flow (similarly adjusted), and <b>capital</b> <b>expenditures</b> for the non-financial firms of the S&P 100 for the years 2000 through 2003.
