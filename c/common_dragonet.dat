50|$|In a {{study of}} the marine fauna of the Celtic Sea based on 61 beam trawl catches, the <b>common</b> <b>dragonet</b> and the hermit crab Pagurus prideaux were the most {{ubiquitous}} species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>{{dragonet}}</b> (Callionymus lyra), is {{a species}} of dragonet widespread in the Eastern Atlantic from southern Iceland and Norway south to Mauritania, including the northern Mediterranean Sea, Gibraltar, and Algeria, western Black Sea, Aegean and Adriatic Sea, Azores and the Canary Islands. It {{can be found at}} depths of from 5 to 430 m, though mostly found no deeper than 30 m. This species is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries and can be found displayed in public aquariums. Males of this species grows to a length of 30 cm TL, while the females can reach a length of 25 cm TL.|$|E
50|$|Draconetta xenica, the <b>Common</b> Slope <b>Dragonet</b> is {{a species}} of slope {{dragonet}} native to the Indo-Pacific region {{where it can be}} found from Africa to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a benthic fish, occurring on sandy bottoms {{at the edges of the}} continental shelves at depths of from 138 to 367 m. This species grows to a length of 9 cm SL. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|R
50|$|Callionymus pusillus, the Sailfin dragonet, is {{a species}} of <b>dragonet</b> <b>common</b> in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea: Portuguese coast to {{as far north as}} Lisbon; also known from the {{northern}} Mediterranean including the Adriatic, Aegean and Black seas as well as Lebanon and Israel. Males of this species grows to a length of 14 cm TL while females reach a length of 10 cm TL.|$|R
40|$|The first {{red water}} {{appeared}} in the south-western coast of Omura Bay from middle July to early August, and the second one spread all over {{the southern part of}} the Bay from latter August to middle September 1965. Both bloomings were due to Gymnodinium sp. This paper mainly deals with the second one. This blooming was accompanied by the phenomenon that dissolved oxygen in the bottom water-mass dwindled into zero, and also by the mass-mortality of fishesâ€•goby, blenny, globefish, <b>common</b> eel, octopus, <b>dragonet,</b> anchovy, gray mullet, conger eel, etc. Nevertheless the distribution of blooming was limited to the southern part and the water-mass without dissolved oxygen and the mass-mortality extended all over the bay. What has caused this mass-mortality ? From the status of the red water, the dissolved oxygen content in the bottom water-mass and the progress of decomposition above the ark shell, it was assumed that the mass-mortality of fishes and invertebrates was not caused by the red water, but primarily by the depletion of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water-mass all over the Bay...|$|R
