50|$|The Magdalena Ridge Optical Interferometer (MROI) is {{an optical}} and near {{infrared}} interferometer under construction at MRO. When the MROI is completed, {{it will have}} ten 1.4 m telescopes located on three 340 m arms. Each arm will have nine stations where the telescopes can be positioned, and one telescope can be positioned at the center. The telescopes and their enclosures will be moved with a customized <b>crane.</b> <b>Light</b> from the telescopes' primary mirrors will be directed along the arms to the Beam Combining Facility (BCF). These pipes will be evacuated of all air {{in order to reduce}} distortions. Inside the BCF, the light will first travel through extensions of the pipes in the Delay Line Area, which will bring the light beams into phase. Then light will exit the vacuum pipes in the Beam Combining Area (BCA), where the light will be directed into one of three permanent sensors, or to a temporary instrument on a fourth table. The light will strike a total of eleven mirrors before entering a sensor.|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of its construction, there were no roads to the area and all {{building}} materials and supplies arrived by water and lifted {{to the top of the}} cliff by <b>crane.</b> The <b>light</b> was first lit on July 31, 1910. Thanks to its dramatic location, the lighthouse soon became a tourist attraction for sailors and excursion boats. So much so, that in 1924 a road (now Minnesota State Highway 61) was built to allow land access.|$|R

The current carpeting is a reproduction of Wright's original design.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{overhead}} crane use {{is in the}} steel industry. At {{every step of the}} manufacturing process, until it leaves a factory as a finished product, steel is handled by an overhead crane. Raw materials are poured into a furnace by crane, hot steel is stored for cooling by an overhead crane, the finished coils are lifted and loaded onto trucks and trains by overhead crane, and the fabricator or stamper uses an overhead crane to handle the steel in his factory. The automobile industry uses overhead cranes for handling of raw materials. Smaller workstation <b>cranes</b> handle <b>lighter</b> loads in a work-area, such as CNC mill or saw.|$|R
50|$|LOT-EK’s ongoing {{research}} has focused on man-made objects and systems and the way they proliferate, accumulate, overlap and interfere with the built, and natural, environment around the globe. The manufactured objects that interest them include: air-conditioners, airplanes, antennas, billboards, highways, jetways, and tunnels; boats, booths, boxes, coils, <b>cranes,</b> ducts, lifts, <b>lights,</b> strips, scraps, stacks, shacks, sheds, and trucks; packaging, parking, plumbing, scaffolding, shipping containers and tanks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1897, {{author and}} {{journalist}} Stephen Crane {{was en route}} to cover a brewing revolt against Spanish rule in Cuba, when the ship he was on, the SS Commodore, sank {{off the coast of}} Florida. Crane escaped in a small dinghy with several crewmen, and they eventually sighted and steered for the Mosquito Inlet <b>Light.</b> <b>Crane</b> used this experience in his short story [...] "The Open Boat".|$|R
5000|$|Vincent Crane put {{together}} the music {{for a number of}} plays and musicals in England between 1976 and 1977, including two of Peter Green's radio broadcasts. In 1978, Crane teamed up with Arthur Brown once again, and in 1979 they released the album Faster Than the Speed of <b>Light.</b> <b>Crane</b> and Brown would also perform a rendition of [...] "Green Door", dressed in top hat and tails.|$|R
500|$|Extreme {{isolation}} from society and community is also apparent in Crane's work. [...] During {{the most intense}} battle scenes in The Red Badge of Courage, for example, the story's focus is mainly [...] "on the inner responses of a self unaware of others". In [...] "The Open Boat", [...] "An Experiment in Misery" [...] and other stories, <b>Crane</b> uses <b>light,</b> motion and color to express degrees of epistemological uncertainty. Similar to other Naturalistic writers, Crane scrutinizes the position of man, who has been isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. [...] "The Open Boat", for example, distances itself from Romantic optimism and affirmation of man's {{place in the world}} by concentrating on the characters' isolation.|$|R
50|$|Overhead cranes are {{commonly}} used in the refinement of steel and other metals such as copper and aluminium. At {{every step of the}} manufacturing process, until it leaves a factory as a finished product, metal is handled by an overhead crane. Raw materials are poured into a furnace by crane, hot metal is then rolled to specific thickness and tempered or annealed, and then stored by an overhead crane for cooling, the finished coils are lifted and loaded onto trucks and trains by overhead crane, and the fabricator or stamper uses an overhead crane to handle the steel in his factory. The automobile industry uses overhead cranes to handle raw materials. Smaller workstation cranes, such as jib cranes or gantry <b>cranes,</b> handle <b>lighter</b> loads in a work area, such as CNC mill or saw.|$|R
40|$|Photoperiod {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with greater sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis tabida) from 1969 to 1972 and from 1982 to 1987 at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Maryland. When housed indoors and exposed to long photoperiods, males produced semen during winter. When exposed to artificially extended photoperiods during spring in outdoor pens, females apparently laid {{earlier in the year}} and laid more eggs than they would have without the added <b>light.</b> <b>Cranes</b> did not exhibit any signs of photo refractory response to extended photo periods...|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the dock}} {{equipment}} was operated by electricity, supplied at 440V from the Hull Corporation, including electric coal conveyors, <b>cranes,</b> and dock <b>lighting,</b> as well as powering pumps used to supply hydraulic power. Hydraulic equipment (from Hathorn Davey of Leeds) was used for lock and dry dock gates, and for the coal tippers. Cranes were supplied by Royce Limited (Manchester), Craven Brothers, and a floating crane by Werfo Gusto (A.F. Smulders), coal handling equipment was from Head Wrightson. The machinery and mechanism for the lock gates was manufactured by the Hydraulic Engineering Company (Chester); the centrifugal pumps and electric motors for draining the dry docks were made by W.H. Allen (Bedford).|$|R
