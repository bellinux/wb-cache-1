50|$|According to Susan Fiske, {{there are}} two {{underlying}} characteristics of stigmatized groups around the world: the ideas that status predicts perceived competence and that cooperation predicts perceived warmth. Two combinations of competence and warmth produce ambivalent prejudices. The combined perception of groups as warm but incompetent leads to pitied groups, such as traditional women or older people. The combined perception of groups as competent but <b>cold</b> <b>leads</b> to envied groups, such as nontraditional women or minority entrepreneurs. Fiske uses this conception of prejudice to explain ambivalent sexism, heterosexism, racism, anti-immigrant biases, ageism, and classism.|$|R

50|$|The Ludlow {{system uses}} molds, known as {{matrices}} or mats, which are hand-set into a special composing stick. Thus the composing process resembles that used in <b>cold</b> <b>lead</b> type printing. Once a {{line has been}} completed, the composing stick is inserted into the Ludlow machine, which clamps it firmly in place above the mold. Hot linecasting metal (the same alloy used in Linotype and Intertype machines) is then injected through the mold into the matrices, allowed to cool, and then {{the bottom of the}} slug is trimmed just before it is ejected. The operator then replaces the matrices, or mats, back into the typecase by hand. Since the mats are of a consistent height, irrespective of typeface size, they are easier to handle than lead type.|$|E
25|$|Air source {{heat pumps}} are {{relatively}} easy and inexpensive {{to install and}} have therefore historically been {{the most widely used}} heat pump type. However, they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source. The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme <b>cold</b> <b>leads</b> to declining efficiency. In mild weather, COP may be around 4.0, while at temperatures below around 0°C (32°F) an air-source heat pump may still achieve a COP of 2.5. The average COP over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8, with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates.|$|R
50|$|Responses to cold are {{produced}} by cutaneous cold sensitive pathways through the Parabrachial area. Thermoreceptors in the skin detect temperature in the environment relative to body temperature. These afferent neurons project up the spinal cord to the parabrachial area, which innervates several areas of the preoptic area, including the median preoptic nucleus. Exposure to <b>cold</b> <b>leads</b> to disinhibition of the RMR and other regions, which leads to brown adipose thermogenesis. This {{is also known as}} non-shivering thermogenesis, which metabolizes fat but dissipates heat from the proton motive force in mitochondria rather than using oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the thermoelectric current and heat conductance in a chiral Josephson contact on a {{surface of a}} 3 D topological insulator, covered with superconducting and magnetic insulator films. The contact consists of two junctions of Majorana and Dirac channels next to two superconductors. Geometric asymmetry results in a supercurrent without a phase bias. The interference of Dirac fermions causes oscillations of the electric and heat currents with an unconventional period 2 Φ_ 0 =h/e as functions of the Aharonov-Bohm flux. Due to the gapless character of Majorana modes, there is no threshold for the thermoelectric effect and the current-flux relationship is non-sinusoidal. Depending on the magnetic flux, {{the direction of the}} electric current can be both from the hot to <b>cold</b> <b>lead</b> and vice versa.

40|$|Uranium hexafluoride has the {{distinction}} of being the only stable gaseous compound of uranium known up to the present moment. Because of this property it is the only compound {{that can be used for}} processes of isotope separation, such as diffusion, thermal diffusion, centrifuge separation, distillation, and other of a similar nature. Here is a short description of the properties of UF{sub 6 } and is intended for a reader interested only casually in this compound. UF{sub 6 } is a very reactive compound and a very strong fluorinating agent. It is immediately hydrolized by water. In fluorinating reactions it is reduced to the green highly stable UF{sub 4 }. It reacts instantaneously with hydrogen at room temperature. It fluorinates many metals; sodium and mercury are attacked in the <b>cold,</b> <b>lead,</b> zinc, tin and iron on heating; platinum and gold react only above 400 C. With organic compounds like alcohol, ether, benzene or toluene, immediate fluorination takes place with formation of HF and carbon or carbonaceous material. The compound forms colorless, very volatile, beautiful transparent crystals of high refractive index. Melting point = 69. 5 {sup o}; boiling point at 760 mm = 56. 2 {sup o}; D 20 {sup o} = 4. 68.

40|$|Lead-free soldering, {{originally}} {{started as}} an environmental issue, is evolving rapidly into a business survival tool for the worldwide electronic industry. Promising lead-free solder alternatives for surface mount assembly applications include eutectic Sn/Ag, eutectic Sn/Cu, Sn 95 /Sb 5, eutectic Sn/Bi, Sn/Ag/Cu, Sn/Ag/Cu/X, Sn/Bi/Ag/X, Sn/Zn/X, and Sn/In/Ag/(X). However, for wafer level area array solder bump interconnects, most of those options fall short in terms of fatigue resistance. Sn/In/Ag/(X) appears to be superior when compared with Sn 63 /Pb 37, as demonstrated by Sn/In/Ag/Cu. For applications involving high lead solders, no solder alternatives have been developed yet. While the industry is advancing toward being finer, smaller, lighter, and faster, wafer level packages using area array solder interconnects is suffering from the soft error due to alpha emission from {{the lead in the}} solders. Although lead-free solder alternatives for eutectic Sn/Pb are virtually free from alpha emission, the continuous dependence on the use of high-lead solders for C 4 applications indicates that the challenge of alpha emission from lead-containing solders will persist regardless of the lead-free move of the industry. This challenge is getting tougher with the rapid advancement of IC design toward further miniaturization. Low alpha lead can be obtained from <b>cold</b> <b>lead</b> ore, old lead, and laser isotope separation process, with the latter having potential as a long term solution. The price of those low alpha lead is very expensive when compared with the regular lead. Due to the increase in I/O density, requirement on alpha emission level may soon move from LC 2 to LC 3 level.
