5|$|The Democratic nominating {{convention}} {{began on}} June 20, at the Music Hall on Market Street in Louisville. The {{first order of}} business was to nominate a convention chairman. Ollie M. James, a supporter of Stone, nominated Judge David Redwine. When Woodson seconded the nomination, the deal between Stone and Goebel became apparent to all. Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney, but the Stone-Goebel alliance elected Redwine. The membership of several county delegations was challenged; these cases would be decided by the <b>credentials</b> <b>committee.</b> This committee was also stacked against Hardin; his supporters made up just four of the thirteen members. Prolonged deliberations by the <b>credentials</b> <b>committee</b> caused the delegates to become restless, and hundreds of people—both delegates and non-delegates—entered the Music Hall attempting to disrupt the convention. When Redwine summoned Louisville city police to the hall to maintain order, Hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics. The <b>credentials</b> <b>committee</b> finally issued its report on June 23. Of the twenty-eight cases where delegates were contested, twenty-six of them were decided in favor of Goebel or Stone supporters.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale {{announced}} her candidacy for the PC Party leadership on December 30, 2010, and {{was endorsed by}} her entire caucus. While she originally stated she would step down as premier if she {{decided to run for}} the leadership after announcing her candidacy Dunderdale said she will only step down if someone challenges her for the leadership. On January 10, 2011, an hour before nominations were set to close in the leadership election Brad Cabana, a blogger and a former mayor in Saskatchewan, filed his nomination papers becoming Dunderdale's only challenger. The next day however the PC Party's <b>credentials</b> <b>committee</b> announced that Cabana was ineligible to enter the race because he was unable to collect the 50 signatures needed by PC party members to be nominated. Cabana appealed the party's decision but it was announced on January 27, 2011, that the rules committee upheld the previous ruling by the <b>credentials</b> <b>committee.</b> With Cabana being ineligible to run Dunderdale was officially named the leader-designate, she was sworn in as leader at the party's convention on April 2, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{parliamentary}} election after the war, in 1945, Meisdalshagen was re-elected {{for a second}} term in Parliament. It was not clear that he would be nominated for the ballot, as this was not at all usual for those Labour Party members who in the summer of 1940 had agreed to the King's abdication. However, Meisdalshagen's service in Milorg probably tipped the scales in his favour. He {{was a member of the}} Standing Committee on Finance and Customs and secretary of the Preparatory <b>Credentials</b> <b>Committee,</b> and also became a member of the Standing Committee on Justice in December 1946. Meisdalshagen was also board chairman of the Norwegian State Housing Bank from 1946 to 1953.|$|E

5|$|At the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly, {{represent}}atives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country. The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council {{that it was the}} sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people. In response, the UN <b>Credentials</b> <b>Committee</b> decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, {{representatives of}} Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with strong support from China. By January 1980, 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised the legitimacy of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea. At the same time, the Western powers and the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam’s use of force to remove the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
5|$|The Union Greenback {{convention}} had reconvened {{at nearby}} Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. The delegates voted {{to join the}} other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While {{they waited for the}} committees to finish their work, the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including Denis Kearney, a California labor leader, and William Wallace, a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for currency reform. Meanwhile, the <b>Credentials</b> <b>Committee</b> voted narrowly to admit the Union Greenbackers, as well as a delegation from the Socialist Labor Party. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick, a Michigan trade union organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1912 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Roosevelt {{expressed}} {{doubt about}} his prospects for victory, noting that Taft had more delegates {{and control of}} the <b>credentials</b> <b>committee.</b> His only hope was to convince party leaders that the nomination of Taft would hand the election to the Democrats, but party leaders were determined not to cede their leadership to Roosevelt. The <b>credentials</b> <b>committee</b> awarded almost all contested delegates to Taft, and Taft won the nomination on the first ballot. Black delegates from the South played a key role: they voted heavily for Taft and put him over the top. La Follette also helped Taft's candidacy; he hoped that a deadlocked convention would result in his own nomination, and refused to release his delegates to support Roosevelt.|$|E

25|$|The Illinois primary {{required}} {{voters to}} select individual delegates, not presidential candidates. Most Illinois delegation members were uncommitted and were controlled or influenced by Chicago Mayor and Cook County Democratic Party chairman Richard J. Daley. The delegation was challenged by McGovern supporters {{arguing that the}} results of the primary did not create a diverse enough delegation in terms of women and minorities. The <b>credentials</b> <b>committee,</b> headed by Patricia Roberts Harris, rejected the entire elected delegation, including elected women and minorities, and seated an unelected delegation led by Chicago Alderman William S.

25|$|Nonetheless, Gold and 35 other {{delegates from}} New York City {{appeared}} at the convention and demanded to be recognized. The <b>Credentials</b> <b>Committee</b> refused to seat them, even though the Joint Board represented about 85 {{percent of the total}} IFWU membership. AFL President Green—tired of the constant conflict in New York City, believing Shachtman and the leadership of the IFWU were incompetent, and convinced that fighting the Joint Board was a waste of money—persuaded Shachtman to at least let Gold and the other Joint Board delegates speak before the convention to make their case. Gold delivered an impassioned speech in which he denounced the attacks on the political views of the Joint Board's leadership, argued that the union should be spending its money building solidarity and fighting employers, and pushed for strong internal democratic procedures in the IFWU. But despite his pleas, the convention refused to seat the delegates, and then revoked the charters of the locals which comprised the Joint Board.|$|E
25|$|Regardless, {{the plans}} of Wagenknecht, Reed & Co. {{to fight it}} out at the 1919 Emergency National Convention {{continued}} apace. With the most radical state organizations effectively purged by the Regulars (Massachusetts, Minnesota) or unable to participate (Ohio, Michigan), and the Left Wing language federations suspended, a big majority of the hastily elected delegates to the gathering were controlled by the Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and the Regulars. A group of Left Wingers without delegate credentials, including John Reed and his sidekick Benjamin Gitlow, {{made an effort to}} occupy chairs on the convention floor before the gathering was called into order. The incumbents were unable to block the Left Wingers at the door, but soon called the already present police to their aid, and the officers of the law obligingly expelled the boisterous radicals from the hall. With the <b>Credentials</b> <b>Committee</b> firmly {{in the hands of the}} Regulars from the outset, the outcome of the gathering was no longer in doubt and most of the remaining Left Wing delegates departed, to meet with other co-thinkers downstairs in a previously reserved room in a parallel convention. It was this gathering which established itself as the Communist Labor Party on August 31, 1919.|$|E
50|$|The Democrats convened {{again at}} the Front Street Theater (destroyed in the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904) in Baltimore, Maryland on 18 June. The resumed convention's first {{business}} was {{to decide whether to}} re-admit the delegates who had bolted the Charleston session, or to seat replacement delegates who had been named by pro-Douglas Democrats in some states. The <b>credentials</b> <b>committee's</b> majority report recommended re-admitting all delegates except those from Louisiana and Alabama. The minority report recommended re-admitting some of the Louisiana and Alabama delegates as well. The committee's majority report was adopted 150-100½, and the new Louisiana and Alabama delegates were seated. Many additional delegates now withdrew, including most of the remaining Southern delegates, and also a scattering of delegates from northern and far western states.|$|R

25|$|The 7th Annual Washington State Convention {{was held}} May 4–5, 1907 in Seattle. The first test of {{strength}} came {{shortly after the}} 10:10 am opening, when moderate T.E. Latimer and left winger David Burgess stood off in an election for temporary chairman. Latimer was narrowly defeated by Burgess by a count of 25 to 23 — the best show of strength for the moderates of the convention. The <b>Credentials</b> <b>Committee</b> again brought up the case of Walter Thomas Mills, with the majority reporting that Mills should be denied his seat because he was under charges. This {{was followed by a}} resolution by Seattle left wing delegate J.A. McCorkle that the convention officially note that Mills stood under charges preferred by the Socialist Party of Canada for supporting candidates opposed to that party in the recent British Columbia provincial elections. A massive storm of protest erupted, with heated debate occupying the entire afternoon session. In the evening session the question was finally called and the convention voted that Mills was indeed under charges by a vote of 47 to 27. Mills recorded a formal protest and an alternate delegate was seated in his stead. The convention reaffirmed the SPW's strict anti-fusion policies and moved state headquarters from Everett to Tacoma. A new State Executive Committee was elected by referendum vote of the membership following completion of the convention.|$|E

5000|$|The split {{convention}} {{resulted in}} two rival slates of 46 delegates. The national Republican Party accepted the slate submitted by Louisiana Republican Party chairman Roger Villere {{as the official}} slate. In late July, however, Paul's campaign {{announced that it would}} challenge all the Louisiana delegates, asserting that [...] "our rump convention is the legitimate delegation and {{they have a right to}} be seated at the Republican National Convention." [...] In its official challenge to the delegate slate filed in August, Paul's campaign likened Villere to the leader of [...] "a North Korean politburo"; in response, the executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party said that Paul's challenge was [...] "full of personal attacks, hyperbole and unfounded assumption." [...] The dispute was to be adjudicated by the Contest Committee of the national Republican Party, with a possible appeal to the full Republican National Committee and then to the <b>Credential</b> <b>Committee</b> of the convention. However, in late August - one week prior to the convention - the Paul campaign made an agreement with the Republican Party of Louisiana in which Paul would get 17 of the state's 46 delegates, with the rest of the state's delegates supporting then-presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.|$|R
