5|$|Many of {{the same}} agents cause {{gastroenteritis}} in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens,</b> and Salmonella. A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Some weakly beta-hemolytic species cause intense beta {{hemolysis}} when grown {{together with}} a strain of Staphylococcus. This is called the CAMP test. Streptococcus agalactiae displays this property. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> can be identified presumptively with this test. Listeria monocytogenes is also positive on sheep's blood agar.|$|E
25|$|The genes {{encoding}} alpha-toxin (<b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens),</b> Bacillus cereus PLC (BC-PLC), and PLCs from Clostridium bifermentans and Listeria monocytogenes {{have been}} isolated and nucleotides sequenced. There is significant homology of the sequences, approximately 250 residues, from the N-terminus. Alpha-toxin has an additional 120 residues in the C-terminus. The C-terminus of the alpha-toxin {{has been reported}} as a “C2-like” domain, referencing the C2 domain found in eukaryotes {{that are involved in}} signal transduction and present in mammalian phosphoinositide phospholipase C.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterial}} variant <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> type A produces alpha-toxin. The toxin has phospholipase C activity, {{and causes}} hemolysis, lethality, and dermonecrosis. At high concentrations, alpha-toxin induces massive degradation of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, producing diacylglycerol and ceramide, respectively. These molecules then participate in signal transduction pathways. It {{has been reported}} that the toxin activates the arachidonic acid cascade in isolated rat aorta. The toxin-induced contraction was related to generation of thromboxane A2 from arachidonic acid. Thus it is likely the bacterial PLC mimics the actions of endogenous PLC in eukaryotic cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|Clostridial {{enterocolitis}} due {{to infection}} by <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> is most commonly seen in foals under 3 months of age. Clostridial toxins damage the intestine, leading to dehydration and toxemia. Foals usually present with signs of colic, decreased nursing, abdominal distention, and diarrhea which may contain blood. Diagnosis {{is made with}} fecal culture, and while some foals do not require serious intervention, others need IV fluids, antibiotics, and aggressive treatment, and may still die. Other bacterial infections {{that may lead to}} enterocolitis include Salmonella, Klebsiella, Rhodococcus equi, and Bacteriodes fragilis.|$|E
25|$|From about July 1942 {{to about}} September 1943, {{experiments}} {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of sulfonamide, a synthetic antimicrobial agent, were conducted at Ravensbrück. Wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with bacteria such as Streptococcus, <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> (a major causative agent in gas gangrene) and Clostridium tetani, the causative agent in tetanus. Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels {{at both ends of}} the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound. Infection was aggravated by forcing wood shavings and ground glass into the wounds. The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Shown this {{evidence}} by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to inspectors {{that she had}} grown 19,000 litres of botulism toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver cancer; <b>clostridium</b> <b>perfringens,</b> a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. It {{was because of the}} discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the US and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of field collection and laboratory work is conducted by non-NOAA contract laboratories. At least once annually between November and March volunteers at each Mussel Watch site collect {{two groups of}} 50-100 bivalves. The samples must be collected within three weeks of the date the site was first sampled. This means that if a sample was first taken on April 15, 1987, then all future samples in subsequent years must be taken within three weeks of April 15. One group is used for testing organic contaminants while the other group is used for trace elements (metals). Sediment from a site exposed to the same water mass as the corresponding bivalve site {{and no more than}} 2km away is collected concurrently with the bivalves. Sediment criteria measured includes total organic and carbonate carbon, moisture content, particle size, concentration of <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens,</b> and concentration of Coprostanol (this was no longer measured after 1989).|$|E
