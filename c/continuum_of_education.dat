40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{linkages}} between ‘Education ’ and ‘Poverty ’ {{and the possibility}} of poverty reduction through better employment opportunities. The paper proceeds with the understanding that poverty acts as both cause and effect of a lack of education. In particular, the paper examines whether education is contributing to poverty reduction among rural households in Bangladesh, based on a school level survey as well as household survey conducted under the Programme for Research on Chronic Poverty (PRCPB) Phase-II. The study addresses the question regarding the access of poor and non-poor to primary and secondary levels of education by looking at the impact of poverty on the enrolment rates. Links between poverty and the rate of SSC completion and the success rate of SSC are also analyzed. The empirical evidence suggests high differentials between the poor and non-poor groups, the variations increasing along the <b>continuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> levels from primary to secondary to SSC completion. Reduction of such differential requires an understanding of where previous policies have failed in closing these gaps, as well as, a policy approach which will ensure that stipend and other support programmes for education give priority to poorer children. The paper has also addressed questions regarding the quality of education received by poor and non-poor (mainly base...|$|E

30|$|The {{growth of}} non-formal {{education}} is expanding {{teaching and learning}} pathways for the delivery of global education. This growth, {{in concert with the}} expanded use of Open Educational Resources (OERs), is creating a potential synergy between non-formal education and OERs to strengthen the <b>continuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> and training for people who live in underserved and economically disadvantaged regions of the world. The author’s central theme is that OERs provide a valuable educational resource for use in non-formal education that needs to be expanded, researched and refined. OERs are not formal or non-formal resources. Rather, it is how OERs are used in formal and non-formal education settings that define their context and application for teaching and learning. A basic conceptual framework is provided to offer the reader an initial approach for conceptualising the use of OERs in non-formal education. The author suggests that the process for evaluating non-formal educational activities is similar to the basic design principles used in formal education. These include identifying goals, objectives and competency-based outcomes; developing instructional design parameters; analysing the context and culture of instruction; and evaluating and measuring non-formal teaching and learning. Moreover, the author advocates that further research on OER use in non-formal education, in concert with visionary university leadership, will be critical to maximising the potential of using OERs in non-formal education. The final summary highlights the key issues and points of the article.|$|E
40|$|Background: Education and {{training}} build community research capacity and have impact on improvements of health outcomes. Objectives: This manuscript describes {{the training and}} educational approaches to building research capacity that were utilized in a community-based participatory research program serving a Puerto Rican population and identifies barriers and strategies for overcoming them. Methods: A process evaluation identified a multitiered approach to training and education that was critical to reaching the broad community. Results: This approach included four major categories providing a <b>continuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> {{and training}} opportunities: networking, methods training, on-the-job experience, and community education. Participation in these opportunities supported {{the development of a}} registry, the implementation of a survey, and two published manuscripts. Barriers included the lack of a formal evaluation of the education and training components, language challenges that limited involvement of ethnic groups other than Puerto Ricans, and potential biases associated with the familiarity of the data collector and the participant. The CBPR process facilitated relationship development between the university and the community and incorporated the richness of the community experience into research design. Strategies for improvement include incorporating evaluation into every training and educational opportunity and developing measures to quantify research capacity at the individual and community levels.

While interview participants were recruited on a referral basis and are not representative of the entire immigrant population, their personal stories help to humanize the data. Following national urban-to-rural settlement patterns, immigrants {{who participated in this}} study chose Bloomington-Normal over urban migration hubs like Chicago. However, Bloomington-Normal stands out from other downstate Illinois communities because of the profile of employment opportunities, most notably the State Farm Corporate Headquarters in town. Participants cited economic opportunities, family reunification, and political persecution as primary motivations for leaving their countries of origin. They were drawn to Bloomington-Normal because of pre-existing networks and chose to remain because of employment opportunities, the presence of universities, a friendly community, and convenience factors.

Short Communications: Accreditation of the Student and Overseas Doctor: {{abstract}} 7 K/ 6 Conference Theme: The <b>Continuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> in the Healthcare ProfessionsBACKGROUND: The increased globalisation {{of education}} has created opportunities for universities in Australasia. It has been noted that international students are affected by issues of safety, security, and quality of life. SUMMARY OF WORK: 549 medical students early in their clinical training responded to the World Health Organisation Quality of Life questionnaire (BREF version). The target variable was enrolment status (international; domestic). Other variables included: time of investigation (2009; 2011), gender, year of enrolment, age and ethnicity. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: Ratings for the social relationships and environment quality of life domains were lower for international students. Facet scores in both domains indicated that international students underrate their levels of quality of life (in 9 of the 11 facets). CONCLUSIONS: The {{findings of this study}} suggest that the International medical students are likely experiencing problems related to developing social relationships and coping with the environment, indicating a need for more sensitive and competent modes of intercultural communication and improving service delivery. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Focus needs to be applied to the two concerning areas of quality of life identified in this study: social relationships and environment. Given the fiscal and educational advantages associated with enrolling international students, it is imperative that Universities apply pastoral measures to improve their quality of life experiences. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The National Health Service (NHS) National Genetics Education and Development Centre was {{established}} by the Department of Health in 2004 to help drive and co-ordinate genetics education for health professionals working outside specialist genetic services. This paper reviews the experiences and lessons learned to date. At the outset, {{it was clear that}} understanding the learning ethos, preferred delivery methods and attitudes towards genetics of different NHS healthcare groups was vital. We collected evidence by undertaking needs assessments with educators, practitioners and patients. We have determined the genetics knowledge, skills and attitudes which they said were needed and translated these into learning outcomes and workforce competences in a <b>continuum</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> Beginning with core concepts introduced (and examined) pre-registration, the continuum continues with development of concepts post-registration as appropriate for role, leading to practical application and assessment of competences in the workplace. These are supported by a portfolio of resources which draw heavily on patient based scenarios to demonstrate to staff that genetics is relevant to their work, and to convince educators and policy makers that genetic education is likely to result in real clinical benefit. A long term educational policy, inclusive of learners, educationalists and their institutions must be evidence based, flexible and responsive to changes in workforce structure, provision of clinical services and conceptual and financial commitments to education.

One of the technologies generating discussion and excitement among academics and students is the use of “podcasts” to supplement and enhance student learning. The purpose of this project was to develop podcasts of course materials and {{to assess the impact of}} podcasting on student learning. SUMMARY OF WORK: We created podcasts of all course lectures and made them available on-line to students. The lecture podcasts were divided into short 20 - 30 minute sections according to lecture topics. We evaluated students’ actual use of the technology, the impact on their learning, and their perceptions about the technology. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: 70. 2 % of all students accessed the podcasts to review specific parts of the lecture (92. 9 %), to clarify concepts not understood during the lecture (89. 8 %), to prepare for examinations (80. 6 %) and to make up for a missed lecture (63. 2 %). Podcasts enhanced students’ learning (84. 5 %) and the majority of students felt they should be made available for all courses (82. 5 %). CONCLUSIONS: Podcasting course lectures appears to enhance and augment didactic learning. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES: Creating podcasts of lectures and other course sessions may be a valuable tool for students for whom English is not their first language, as is currently the case in many nursing education programs worldwide. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
