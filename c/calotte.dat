6000|$|On {{the evening}} of the 20th December the mounted {{messenger}} returned, after a six hours' hard ride, bringing back unopened the letter addressed by me to the Gerad, and a private message from their sister to the sons of White Ali, advising them not to advance. Ensued terrible palavers. It appeared that the Gerad was upon the point of mounting horse, when his subjects swore him to remain and settle a dispute with the Amir of Harar. Our Abbans, however, withdrew their hired camels, positively refuse to accompany us, and Beuh privily informed the End of Time that I had acquired through the land the evil reputation of killing everything, from an elephant to a bird in the air. One of the younger brethren, indeed, declared that we were forerunners of good, and that if the Gerad harmed a hair of our heads, he would slaughter every Girhi under the sun. We had, however, learned properly to appreciate such vaunts, and the End of Time drily answered that their sayings were honey but their doings myrrh. Being a low-caste and a shameless tribe, they did not reply to our reproaches. At last, a manoeuvre was successful: Beuh and his brethren, who squatted like sulky children in different places, were dismissed with thanks,--we proposed placing ourselves under the safeguard of Gerad Hirsi, the Berteri chief. This would have thrown the protection-price, originally intended for their brother-in-law, into the hands of a rival, and had the effect of altering their resolve. Presently we were visited by two Widad or hedge- priests, Ao Samattar and Ao Nur [38], both half-witted fellows, but active and kindhearted. The former wore a dirty turban, the latter a Zebid cap, a wicker-work <b>calotte,</b> composed of the palm leaf's mid-rib: they carried dressed goatskins, as prayer carpets, over their right shoulders dangled huge wooden ink bottles with Lauh or wooden tablets for writing talismans [39], and from the left hung a greasy bag, containing a tattered copy of the Koran and a small MS. of prayers. They read tolerably, but did not understand Arabic, and I presented them with cheap Bombay lithographs of the Holy Book. The number of these idlers increased as we approached Harar, the Alma Mater of Somali land:--the people seldom listen to their advice, but on this occasion Ao Samattar succeeded in persuading the valiant Beuh that the danger was visionary. Soon afterwards rode up to our kraal three cavaliers, who proved to be sons of Adam, the future Ugaz of the Gudabirsi tribe: this chief had fully recognized the benefits of reopening to commerce a highway closed by their petty feuds, and sent to say that, in consequence of his esteem for the Hajj Sharmarkay, if the sons of White Ali feared to escort us, he in person would do the deed. Thereupon Beuh became a [...] "Gesi" [...] or hero, as the End of Time ironically called him: he sent back his brethren with their horses and camels, and valorously prepared to act as our escort. I tauntingly asked him what he now thought of the danger.

40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} is characterised by strong {{frictional}} forces involving {{an increase of}} the temperature and a tendency to adhesion. Consequently, use of lubricants is essential yet, especially for forming of Aluminium alloys. Furthermore, lubricant reduces tool wear. However, for economical and ecological reasons, dry forming is highly desired. Avoiding the application of lubrication requires a reduction of the coefficient of friction and the tendency for adhesion in dry forming processes. One approach {{is to increase the}} nominal surface pressure by micro structuring the tool. Additionally, different carbon based layers (a]C:H:Si and CVD diamond) are applied on the tool to reduce wear and tendency to adhesion. For using a a]C:H:Si layer, uncoated steel drawing tools are micro structured with <b>calottes</b> by milling. Because of a higher thickness of CVD diamond layers, <b>calottes</b> have to be generated directly in the coating using ablating processes like electrical discharge machining. To emulate the tribological system of a sheet metal forming process and characterise it, strip drawing tests are done. For a]C:H:Si coated drawing tools, the test results show a significant reduction of the coefficient of friction in micro structured, compared to polished drawing tools. To further increase the wear resistance of the tool it is intended to apply CVD diamond layers on steel tools as soon as the process is operational...|$|R
