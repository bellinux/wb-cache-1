40|$|Recently VoIP {{applications}} {{have been}} {{popular due to}} the wide deployment of the wired/wireless Internet. Commer-cial VoIP services typically employ SIP and RTP for signal-ing and media transport protocols. Therefore, the VoIP ser-vice is vulnerable {{to a lot of}} threats because it uses the Inter-net where security is not guaranteed. For example, anomaly traffic cases such as hindering <b>call</b> connections, maliciously <b>canceling</b> <b>calls,</b> and deteriorating quality of voices have al-ready been known. In this paper, we propose an anomaly traffic detection method for VoIP applications based on the flow-monitoring traffic measurement architecture, called IETF IPFIX. Under IPFIX, we present algorithms to detect BYE DDoS and RTP flooding anomaly traffic by defining new IPFIX templates for monitoring SIP and RTP flows...|$|R
