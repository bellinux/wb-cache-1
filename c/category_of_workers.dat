5000|$|The {{issues of}} work, the {{division}} of labor and the refusal of work has been an important issue in post-left anarchy. Bob Black in [...] "The Abolition of Work" [...] calls for the abolition of the producer- and consumer-based society, where, Black contends, all of life is devoted to the production and consumption of commodities. Attacking Marxist state socialism as much as market capitalism, Black argues that the only way for humans to be free is to reclaim their time from jobs and employment, instead turning necessary subsistence tasks into free play done voluntarily - an approach referred to as [...] "ludic". The essay argues that [...] "no-one should ever work", because work - defined as compulsory productive activity enforced by economic or political means - is the source of most of the misery in the world. Most workers, he states, are dissatisfied with work (as evidenced by petty deviance on the job), so that what he says should be uncontroversial; however, it is controversial only because people are too close to the work-system to see its flaws.Play, in contrast, is not necessarily rule-governed, and is performed voluntarily, in complete freedom, as a gift economy. He points out that hunter-gatherer societies are typified by play, a view he backs up with the work of Marshall Sahlins; he recounts the rise of hierarchal societies, through which work is cumulatively imposed, so that the compulsive work of today would seem incomprehensibly oppressive even to ancients and medieval peasants. He responds to the view that [...] "work," [...] if not simply effort or energy, is necessary to get important but unpleasant tasks done, by claiming that first of all, most important tasks can be rendered ludic, or [...] "salvaged" [...] by being turned into game-like and craft-like activities, and secondly {{that the vast majority of}} work does not need doing at all. The latter tasks are unnecessary because they only serve functions of commerce and social control that exist only to maintain the work-system as a whole. As for what is left, he advocates Charles Fourier's approach of arranging activities so that people will want to do them. He is also skeptical but open-minded about the possibility of eliminating work through labour-saving technologies. He feels the left cannot go far enough in its critiques because of its attachment to building its power on the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers,</b> which requires a valorization of work.|$|E
5000|$|The Abolition of Work, Bob Black's {{most widely}} read essay, draws upon {{the ideas of}} Charles Fourier, William Morris, Herbert Marcuse, Paul Goodman, and Marshall Sahlins. In it he argues for the {{abolition}} of the producer- and consumer-based society, where, Black contends, all of life is devoted to the production and consumption of commodities. Attacking Marxist state socialism as much as market capitalism, Black argues that the only way for humans to be free is to reclaim their time from jobs and employment, instead turning necessary subsistence tasks into free play done voluntarily - an approach referred to as [...] "ludic". The essay argues that [...] "no-one should ever work", because work - defined as compulsory productive activity enforced by economic or political means - is the source of most of the misery in the world. Black denounces work for its compulsion, and for the forms it takes - as subordination to a boss, as a [...] "job" [...] which turns a potentially enjoyable task into a meaningless chore, for the degradation imposed by systems of work-discipline, and for the large number of work-related deaths and injuries - which Black typifies as [...] "homicide". He views the subordination enacted in workplaces as [...] "a mockery of freedom", and denounces as hypocrites the various theorists who support freedom while supporting work. Subordination in work, Black alleges, makes people stupid and creates fear of freedom. Because of work, people become accustomed to rigidity and regularity, and do not have the time for friendship or meaningful activity. Most workers, he states, are dissatisfied with work (as evidenced by petty deviance on the job), so that what he says should be uncontroversial; however, it is controversial only because people are too close to the work-system to see its flaws.Play, in contrast, is not necessarily rule-governed, and is performed voluntarily, in complete freedom, as a gift economy.

However, the focus into the study <b>of</b> commitment among <b>workers</b> is often directed towards for-profit organizations with NGOs receiving less attention. This HRM related issue accord several scholars, is said to be an important factor to be considered in order to ensure a successful organization be it for-profit or NGO. The issue <b>of</b> commitment among <b>workers</b> however tend to take several direction {{as the result of the}} multidimensional nature of organizations, hence the varying configurations of commitment mindset (Affective, Normative and Continuance) and the presence of various targets of commitment (e. g. organization, customers etc.) among workers. Aim: The aim of this thesis is to examine the commitment among workers in NGOs, by investigating the various targets of commitment among different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> <b>of</b> NGOs in Sweden. The paper will further investigates whether the targets of commitment among the different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> in NGOs differs and what influences these differences. Through the empirical cases, this thesis will provide appropriate guidance to ensure commitment among categories workers in NGOs and also contribute to previous research with regards to commitment among categories workers in NGOs. Methodology: The qualitative research approach was used in the conducting of this study. A dual case study was undertaken 12 semi-structured interviews with six from each case organization.

Formalizada e, portanto, com cobertura previdenciária, ao sofrer um acidente de trabalho ou adoecer por razões diversas, essa categoria de trabalhadores depara-se com o indeferimento ou com a cessação precoce de benefícios previdenciários aos quais tem direito, por determinações muitas vezes gerencialistas do órgão previdenciário, sem poder retornar à sua ocupação {{habitual}} em razão de uma “incapacidade laboral”, temporária ou definitiva e parcial ou total, atestada por médicos assistencialistas ou por médicos do trabalho de seus empregadores. Impelida a um “vácuo institucional”, e sem qualquer fonte de remuneração, resta a essa categoria de trabalhadores o processo judicial que, em alguns casos, restitui-lhe o direito tardiamente ou é considerado improcedente. O objetivo geral deste estudo foi o de compreender a constituição dessa nova categoria de trabalhadores e analisar possíveis impactos psicossociais que essa condição pode lhes trazer. Tratou-se de uma pesquisa qualitativa, referenciada no método dialético e no materialismo histórico, realizada com três trabalhadores que ingressaram com demandas jurídicas contra o órgão público previdenciário brasileiro pelos motivos aqui considerados. Foram utilizados procedimentos investigativos como a abordagem biográfica, a entrevista qualitativa semi-estruturada, uma anamnese socioeducativa, uma anamnese clínica e a análise documental de processos judiciais, por meio dos quais foram realizadas a coleta e pré-análise dos dados, adotando a confrontação cruzada entre os instrumentos e a análise de conteúdo [...] .

This formally-hired <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> has secured the right to Social Security. However, {{when they have a}} work-related accident or get sick for many different reasons, this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> faces the rejection or early termination of welfare benefits to which they are entitled, usually by a managerial determination of the Welfare Agency, although they are unable to return to the usual occupation due to a temporary or permanent and partial or total work disability, attested by the Welfare Agency doctors or the company on-site doctors.

40|$|Computerization (the {{diffusion}} {{of a combination}} of hardware and software) has accelerated in the last 30 years due to advances in electronic technologies, the advent of the microprocessor and the tremendous development of the software industry. The process of codification has intensified and routine tasks have tended to disappear, changing the architecture of jobs and, therefore, the structure of employment. A number of occupations have become increasingly associated with the computer, and these jobs require highly skilled workers. Using a production function framework, we found that computerization is not labour-saving but is instead labour-using. Despite this general trend, important inter-industrial differences prevail in the association of skills patterns with the computer. By transforming the structure of jobs, the computer has changed the skills requirements: the knowledge, management and data <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>workers</b> is closely {{associated with the use of}} computers while for good workers the relationship is a substitutive one due to expert systems software.
