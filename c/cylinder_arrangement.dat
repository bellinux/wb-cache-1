5|$|Urie {{retired as}} Locomotive Superintendent when the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923. Richard Maunsell {{was given the}} newly created post of CME to the Southern Railway, and decided to revise the <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the locomotive. In doing so, he delayed the {{construction}} of further locomotives until the modifications had been made. When the modifications were trialled in service, it became evident amongst locomotive crews that Maunsell had taken a sound design and made it better, achieving a consistent locomotive capable of undertaking all the tasks {{for which it was}} intended. With the successful implementation of the modifications, permission was given by the management of the Southern Railway for a second batch of locomotives to be constructed.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, a German company, Flug Werk GmbH, began {{manufacturing}} new Fw 190 {{models as}} reproductions. By 2012 almost 20 had been produced, most flyable, a few as static display models, with airworthy examples usually powered by Chinese-manufactured Shvetsov ASh-82 twin-row, 14-cylinder radial powerplants, {{which have a}} displacement of 41.2 litres, close to the BMW 801's 41.8 litres, with the same engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement</b> and number of cylinders.|$|E
25|$|These terms {{refer to}} the {{orientation}} of the engine cylinder. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical cylinder stands vertically with its piston rod operating above (or below) it. A vertical inverted engine is defined as a vertical <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement,</b> with the crankshaft mounted directly below the cylinder(s). With an inclined or horizontal type, the cylinder and piston are positioned at an incline or horizontally. An inclined inverted cylinder is an inverted cylinder operating at an incline. These terms are all generally used in conjunction with the engine types above. Thus, one may have a horizontal direct-acting engine, or an inclined compound double acting engine, etc.|$|E

50|$|The {{desire to}} improve the diesel engine's power-to-weight ratio {{produced}} several novel <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangements</b> to extract more power from a given capacity. The uniflow opposed-piston engine uses two pistons in one cylinder with the combustion cavity {{in the middle and}} gas in- and outlets at the ends. This makes a comparatively light, powerful, swiftly running and economic engine suitable for use in aviation. An example is the Junkers Jumo 204/205. The Napier Deltic engine, with three cylinders arranged in a triangular formation, each containing two opposed pistons, the whole engine having three crankshafts, is one of the better known.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{competent}} engines {{the maintenance}} of the inner cylinders was difficult. In 1941 No. 582 was converted to two <b>cylinder</b> simple <b>arrangement.</b> The last was finished in 1949 and the class remained successful performers thereafter.|$|R
500|$|In 1922 {{modifications}} {{were made}} to No.822 during assembly. This was because production delays at Ashford prevented {{the building of a}} proposed 3-cylinder design drawn-up in 1919. Maunsell and Holcroft revised No.822's <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement</b> to accommodate a third inside cylinder fitted between the frames. The outside cylinders were also reduced to [...] diameter to accommodate the inside cylinder and its associated valve linkages. The differences between No.822 {{and the rest of the}} Nclass meant that this locomotive was re-designated as the 1919 proposal, becoming the prototype of the SR N1class when completed in March 1923.|$|E
500|$|After withdrawal, the [...] "Duke" [...] was {{initially}} {{selected for the}} National Collection, though it was later decided that only the <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement</b> was of interest. One of the outside cylinders was removed for display at the Science Museum; the other was removed to restore balance in readiness for scrapping. The locomotive was purchased by Dai Woodham, though it {{was initially}} sent to the wrong scrapyard. After retrieval, the [...] "Duke" [...] languished {{for many years in}} Woodham Brothers scrapyard at Barry Island, South Wales, before enthusiasts purchased the locomotive in 1974, forming the Duke of Gloucester Steam Locomotive Trust. [...] Restoration began in earnest, though with many components missing, the most expensive of which being the Caprotti valve gear, it took 13 years of {{effort on the part of}} enthusiasts, with assistance in the guise of sponsorships from industry, to return the locomotive to near as-built condition. One of the very few compromises made was replacing the previous steel cylinders with spheroidal graphite iron.|$|E
2500|$|Work {{started on}} the {{conversion}} of the solitary 3-cylinder K1 class No. A890 to a 2-6-0 tender locomotive design at Ashford works in early 1928. The retention of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement</b> and valve gear lowered conversion costs, and meant that the locomotive could readily meet the route availability specification. Because of Holcroft’s [...] position as one of Maunsell’s assistants, the new locomotive displayed many Swindon influences, making them similar to Churchward's 4300 class. The Swindon ideas had also been used on the N, K, N1, U and K1 class designs, which included the Belpaire firebox and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow.|$|E

The flow phenomena around the cylinders were different when its arrangement were located near a wall, especially at small gap. A boundary layer of the wall would effected a flow characteristics around the cylinders. This research was done by numerical method with FLUENT 6. 3. 26 software at L/D = 4. 0 and G/D rasio 0. 1 and 0. 2 and Reynolds number 53000 based on the diameter of a single cylinder.

50|$|Common <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{are from}} 1 to 6 {{cylinders}} in-line or from 2 to 16 cylinders in V-formation. Flat engines - like a V design flattened out - {{are common in}} small airplanes and motorcycles and were a hallmark of Volkswagen automobiles into the 1990s. Flat 6s are still used in many modern Porsches, as well as Subarus. Many flat engines are air-cooled. Less common, but notable in vehicles designed for high speeds is the W formation, similar to having 2 V engines side by side. Alternatives include rotary and radial engines the latter typically have 7 or 9 cylinders in a single ring, or 10 or 14 cylinders in two rings.|$|R

40|$|This {{experimental}} study is about suppression of flow-induced vibration with flexible sheet {{and characteristics of}} flow-induced vibration of elastically supported two circular <b>cylinders</b> in side-by-side <b>arrangement.</b> In particular, the characteristics of flow-induced vibration of the two cylinders are investigated with changing flow speed at each spacing ratio L/D (L: space between two cylinders, D : diameter of cylinder). Flow patterns around the vibrating two cylinders are also investigated by flow visualization with reproducing the state of elastically supported vibration accurately in forced vibration apparatus. It is clarified that characteristics of flow-induced vibration of two cylinders are changed with switching flow passing through the two cylinders. The method to suppress the flow-induced vibration of a single cylinder by attaching flexible sheet(21) is also tested for two <b>cylinders</b> side-by-side <b>arrangement.</b> As a result, suppression effect by attaching the flexible sheet on the two circular <b>cylinders</b> in side-by-side <b>arrangement</b> is confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} high quality and high {{performance}} of an automobile {{internal combustion engine}} is increasing steadily. Thus the shift toward producing multi-cylinder engine and V-type engine has also intensified. In the first report, we have clarified a general analytical method that reduces the exciting moment and determines the suitable bank angle of V-type engine. We have also clarified that the effective <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangements</b> of a V-type 10 -cylinder engine are divided into 24 groups. In this report we calculated numerically the 1 st-order exciting moment and obtained the suitable bank angle for each group. We obtained practical bank angles of V-type 10 -cylinder engine with small pitching and yawing moment using a balance weight. We also describe in details concrete examples and the evaluation of a V-type 10 -cylinder engine...|$|R

Using AFM, SEM, and in situ synchrotron SAXS, we mapped the topological paths and characteristic transient structures into a ternary phase diagram. We focused on the stability region of an ordered pore phase which is relevant for the generation of integral asymmetric isoporous membranes. We could identify several characteristic morphologies, i. e., spinodal networks, sphere percolation networks, ordered pore structures, and disordered and ordered <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangements</b> together with transient structures connecting their stability regions. With given evaporation rates for the pure solvents, we calculated the corresponding composition trajectories in the phase diagram to identify suitable experimental conditions in terms of initial polymer volume fraction, solvent composition, and immersion time to trap the desired pore structure...|$|R

5000|$|The {{effects of}} {{unbalanced}} inertias in a locomotive are briefly shown by describing measurements of locomotive motions {{as well as}} deflections in steel bridges. These measurements show the need for various balancing methods {{as well as other}} design features to reduce vibration amplitudes and damage to the locomotive itself {{as well as to the}} rails and bridges. The example locomotive is a simple, non-compound, type with 2 outside cylinders and valve gear, coupled driving wheels and a separate tender. Only basic balancing is covered with no mention of the effects of different <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangements,</b> crank angles, etc. since balancing methods for 3 and 4 cylinder locomotives can be complicated and diverse. Mathematical treatments can be found in 'further reading'. For example, Dalby's [...] "The Balancing of Engines" [...] covers the treatment of unbalanced forces and couples using polygons. Johnson and Fry both use algebraic calculations.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{vortices}} produced between two 2 d cylinders, {{and the relationship}} between the structures of the vortices produced at both cylinders when one is placed in the wake flow of another. CFD simulations using ANSYS Fluent were used to determine the coefficients of lift and drag, as well as the frequency of vortex shedding and size of vortices at three separate Reynolds numbers of 16000, 32000 and 65000 in different arrangements. Each <b>arrangement</b> of <b>cylinders</b> was compared against controls, which consisted of a single cylinder to determine the alteration of forces produced. Two trip wires at 7 different angles of 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70 degrees were then investigated at a Reynolds number of 65000 which was compared to the smooth cylinder control forces and frequency of vortex shedding. The most optimum angle of trip wires was then combined with linear <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangements</b> also at a Reynolds number of 65000 for comparison with only the upstream cylinder utilizing the trip wires...|$|R

50|$|Drummond {{had settled}} on the 4-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} in anticipation of further increases in speed and length of trains, a concept that had many advantages. A longer, larger boiler could therefore be utilised, therefore generating the steam needed to power a four-cylinder front end, and 6 ft wheels were utilised. In terms of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement,</b> Drummond's first foray into 4-6-0 locomotive design was highly unusual.|$|E
50|$|Although the XP-38 {{was able}} to fly at speeds in excess of 413 mph, it was big and heavy, and was {{therefore}} not as maneuverable as its stablemates. The XP-38 also had a newly introduced liquid-cooled engine, the Allison V-1710. The Allison's in-line vee <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement</b> allowed for a narrow aerodynamic shape that had less drag than the air-cooled radial engine fighters that predominated in America at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{market for}} {{motorcycles}} in 1968 had been changing from time, utilitarian transport to more aggressive sporting motorcycles that disregarded fuel economy and noise, {{in favor of}} quicker quarter mile times, which were prominently advertised by manufacturers. While Kawasaki had an inline-four four-stroke in development, it was not going be ready in time to upstage the 1969 Honda CB750, so instead they moved up the release of their conventional piston port two-stroke triple to [...] "make a real splash". They turned to the N100 Plan, a project begun in June, 1967, whose intent was to design the most powerful production motorcycle engine in the world. They first considered increasing the bore of an existing engine but instead created an all-new engine, experimenting with both inline and L <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangements,</b> with both two and three cylinders. They settled on an inline-three arrangement after testing showed that an inline layout did not adversely affect cooling of the middle cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The du Bousquet design had {{an unusual}} wheel arrangement; both trucks had six driving wheels and two {{carrying}} wheels supporting the cylinders. Unlike many other articulated designs, these carrying wheels were {{toward the center}} of the locomotive, as were the <b>cylinders.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> is expressed in the French classification as 031+130, in the Whyte notation as 0-6-2+2-6-0T, or in the UIC classification as (C1')(1'C)t.|$|R

The 984 has a V-twin (which the Italians {{refer to as}} a [...] "L" [...] twin, given the <b>cylinder</b> <b>arrangement)</b> 2-valve Ducati engine which develops a claimed 90.5 HP. The 985 has a V-twin 4-valve Ducati engine which develops a claimed 150 HP.|$|E
50|$|Another popular {{configuration}} is the backplate and wing arrangement, {{which uses}} a back inflation buoyancy compensator bladder sandwiched between a rigid backplate and the main gas cylinder or <b>cylinders.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> is particularly popular with twin or double cylinder sets, {{and can be used}} to carry larger sets of three or four cylinders and most rebreathers.
