Reliability is not considered an intrinsic, unchanging property of tests because it could change when used under different conditions or {{in a different context}} than where it had been studied before.|$|E

On June 6, 1878, he married Emily Edelin Williamson, the daughter of a Navy surgeon, and left with her on an extended honeymoon in Europe. On his return to duty, Tilley served at the United States Naval Academy and remained there until 1882, either in a <b>classroom</b> <b>or</b> on a training ship. For the next three years, he served on board [...] In 1885, he was promoted to lieutenant commander and returned to teach at the academy. During his tenure there, he was appointed head of the Department of Astronomy, Navigation, and Surveying, and then transferred to become head of the Department of Mechanical Drawing. In September 1889, he moved to the Washington Navy Yard to teach ordnance.|$|E

2500|$|Erections {{during sleep}} or when waking up are {{medically}} known as nocturnal penile tumescence and colloquially {{referred to as}} morning wood. The penis can regularly get erect during sleep and men or boys often wake up with an erection. Once a boy reaches his teenage years, erections occur much more frequently due to puberty. Erections can occur spontaneously {{at any time of}} day, and if clothed may cause a bulge or [...] "hump". This can be disguised or hidden by wearing close-fitting underwear, a long shirt and baggier clothes. Erections are common for male children and infants, and can even occur before birth. Spontaneous erections are also known as involuntary or unwanted erections and are normal. Such erections can be embarrassing if they happen in public, such as a <b>classroom</b> <b>or</b> living room.|$|E

Usually, the Wonder Pets encounter some sort of obstacle before leaving the classroom. The solution is invariably similar to the action they will need to take to save the animal in trouble.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two major}} genres of furūʿ {{literature}} are the mukhtasar (concise summary of law) and the mabsut (extensive commentary). [...] Mukhtasars were short specialized treatises or general overviews {{that could be}} used in a <b>classroom</b> <b>or</b> consulted by judges. A mabsut, which usually provided a commentary on a mukhtasar and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions. The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance. At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions. Other juristic genres include the qawāʿid (succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles) and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, {{experimental}} studies reported {{the detection of}} significant episodic (situational) cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality. Researchers at the Harvard University and SUNY Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in [...] "conventional" [...] and [...] "green" [...] buildings, as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation. Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool, which is a well-validated assessment test for executive decision-making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation. Significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or carbon dioxide, while keeping other factors constant. The highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some <b>classroom</b> <b>or</b> office environments.|$|E
2500|$|In 1859, when Edmonia Lewis {{was about}} 15 years old, her brother Samuel and abolitionists {{sent her to}} Oberlin College, {{one of the first}} U.S. higher-learning {{institutions}} to admit women and people of differing ethnicities. She changed her name to Mary Edmonia Lewis and began to study art. Lewis boarded with Reverend John Keep and his wife from 1859 until she left the college in 1863. Reverend Keep was white, {{a member of the board}} of trustees, an avid abolitionist, and a spokesperson for coeducation. Despite Oberlin's status as the first higher-learning institution to accept black women in a co-educational space with white men, Lewis was still subject to her societal position as a black woman. She, and all female students, was rarely given the opportunity to participate in the <b>classroom</b> <b>or</b> speak at public meetings. [...] During the 1859-60 school year, Lewis enrolled in the Young Ladies' Preparatory Department, which was designed [...] "to give Young Ladies facilities for the thorough mental discipline, and the special training which will qualify them for teaching and other duties of their sphere." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the fall}} of 1986, roughly 100 PBS {{stations}} carried The Mechanical Universe, and by {{the fall of}} 1987, over 600 higher-education institutions had purchased it or licensed the episodes for use. In 1992, Goodstein noted that the series had been broadcast, via PBS, by over 100 stations, [...] "usually at peculiar hours when innocent people were unlikely to tune in accidentally on a differential equation in the act of being solved". He observed that detailed viewership figures were difficult to obtain, but when the show had been broadcast in Miami during Saturday mornings, the producers were able to obtain Nielsen ratings.In fact, it came in second in its time slot, beating the kiddie cartoons on two network stations. There were 18,000 faithful core households in Dade County alone, the median age of the viewers was 18, and half were female. However, we seldom get that kind of detailed information.Goodstein and assistant project director Richard Olenick noted,Anecdotal information in the form of letters and phone calls indicates very considerable enthusiasm among users at all levels from casual viewers to high-school students to research university professors, but there have also been a number of sharp disappointments, particularly when Instructional Television administrators have tried to handle TMU like a conventional telecourse.Similarly, a 1988 review in Physics Today suggested that the programs would not function well on their own as a telecourse, but would work much better as a supplement to a traditional <b>classroom</b> <b>or</b> a more standard distance-learning course such as Open University. The reviewers also found the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] of computer-animated equations too fast to follow: [...] "After a short time, one yearns for a live professor filling the blackboard with equations". Similarly, a review in the American Journal of Physics, while praising the [...] "technical proficiency of the films", wrote of the animated equation manipulations, [...] "As the MIT students say, this is like trying to take a drink of water out of a fire hose". A considerably more enthusiastic evaluation came from physicist Charles H. Holbrow, who told Olenick, [...] "These materials will constitute the principal visual image of physics for decades". Goodstein and Olenick reported that younger viewers tended to enjoy the [...] "algebraic ballet" [...] style [...] "much more than older viewers, who are made uncomfortable by the algebraic manipulations they cannot quite follow".|$|E
