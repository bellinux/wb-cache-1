Specifically the ultraviolet (UV) variable sky is relatively poorly explored, {{even though it}} offers exciting scientific prospects. Welsh, 2005, describes the discoveries made by GALEX, which would be vastly increased by ULTRASATOne field where short cadence UV observations {{can make a big}} difference is the explosion marking the death of a star, known as a supernova (plural: Supernovae, abbreviated to SNe). In the article by Ganot, 2015 it is estimated that ULTRASAT would detect more that 100 SNe per year. The UV signals from SNe precede the optical signal, enabling discovery of the SN at an early stage when the light curve is uncontaminated by later processes. Since for a transient event there is typically no early warning and the event’s position in the sky is of statistical nature, most transients are discovered by ground telescopes with limited fields of view, often long after the start of the event, although dedicated surveys are reducing this to around one day. In order to detect transients in large numbers, near continuous observations of large patches of the sky are required.Based on the volume of space monitored and the measured SNe rate (from ground surveys) it is expected that at least 100 such events per year will be detected by ULTRASAT within less than a day of the explosion. The wide field of view and the advanced UV detectors will enable the discovery and monitoring of transient sources within a cosmic volume 300 times larger than that of the most powerful UV satellite to date, GALEX [...] ). Analysis of the early light curve provides valuable information (stellar radius and surface chemical composition) on the progenitor star (before it exploded) that cannot be found by other means. In supernovae, an initial burst of high intensity in the UV is followed by radiation in longer wavelengths as the ejected material cools. UV can only be observed from space satellites, because of the blocking effect of the ozone; ground telescopes see only the later stages of the event.ULTRASAT has been designed to cover an unprecedentedly large field of view with a highly sensitive UV camera, with repeat image times as short as 5 minutes. To maximize the number of detected events, ULTRASAT will point to regions at high <b>celestial</b> <b>latitudes,</b> avoiding the Milky Way with its high concentration of [...] "nearby" [...] stars, diffuse background and galactic dust blocking much of the light from distant galaxies where these events occur.|$|R

For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|R

On June 25, or 26, 1178, Corvid meteoroids and a portion of GB ejecta were {{at the same place}} in the Solar System and moved in the same direction (right ascension = 12 degrees and declination = + 19 degrees). The ground track of this direction is {{the same as that of}} the most prominant GB ray (azimuth = 237 degrees). These 'coincidences' could not have occurred by change and, therefore, support the conclusions that the GB impact occurred on June 26, 1178, and that Corvid meteoroids are high-velocity ejecta fragments from that impact. Finally, those fragments ejected with somewhat lower velocities failed to escape from the Earth-Moon system and produced the prominant ray extending southwest from the GB crater. Between June 25 and July 2, 1937, a Corvid meteor shower was observed. The apparent lack of Corvid showers in other years suggests that Corvids are the product of a recent break-up event. The right ascension and declination, corrected for zenith attraction, of 192 degrees and - 19 degrees were reported for the radiant of this shower.

All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible.
