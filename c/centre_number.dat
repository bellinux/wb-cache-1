25|$|There are two centres in a rugby team, inside <b>centre</b> (<b>number</b> 12) {{and outside}} <b>centre</b> (<b>number</b> 13). The inside centre usually stands {{close to the}} fly-half or at first {{receiver}} {{on the other side}} of the scrum or breakdown. Like the fly-half, they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack. The outside centre is positioned outside the inside centre and is generally the faster of the two. The centres' main role is to provide space for the players outside them. They need to run good lines (run into spaces or at 90 degrees to their opposition), be able to side step and swerve, and have good passing skills. When the ball is moved along the opposition backline, the centres are the first players to make the tackle. They need to be aggressive tacklers to knock their opponent down and seize the ball and be good at organising the defensive lines. Outside centres generally have more room to move than inside centres. Centres also provide support at the breakdowns and can run as decoys to confuse the defence.|$|E

50|$|The Rebels inaugural season {{kicked off}} on 18 February, with a Round One match against the Waratahs (NSW) at home, {{in front of}} over 24,000 people. The Rebels made four changes to the {{starting}} 15 {{to take on the}} Brumbies on 25 February, in front of over 14,000 people. Huxley moved to inside <b>centre</b> (<b>number</b> 12), allowing Mark Gerrard to make his debut at full back. Danny Cipriani and Nick Phipps also took their places in the run-on 15 for their first times. It was Cipriani who scored the first points for the Rebels, with a successful penalty kick in the 15th minute. Captain Stirling Mortlock scored the Rebels' first try with eight minutes to go, to put the team in front 22-19. Shortly after, Brumbies' winger Henry Speight scored a controversial try, off {{what appeared to be a}} clear forward pass, and the Brumbies were ahead 24-22. In the final minute of the game, the Brumbies gave away a penalty 37 metres out from the Rebels line, after some push and shove in a Brumbies scrum. Danny Cipriani slotted the penalty, handing Melbourne their debut Super Rugby win, 25 points to 24.|$|E

40|$|Strong pinning {{depends on}} the pinning force {{strength}} and number density of effective defects. Using the hydrostatic pressure method, we demonstrate here that hydrostatic pressure of 1. 2 GPa can significantly enhance flux pinning or the critical current density (Jc) of optimally doped Ba 0. 6 K 0. 4 Fe 2 As 2 crystals {{by a factor of}} up to 5 in both low and high fields, which is generally rare with other Jc enhancement techniques. At 4. 1 K, high pressure can significantly enhance Jc from 5 x 105 A/cm 2 to nearly 106 A/cm 2 at 2 T, and from 2 x 105 A/cm 2 to nearly 5. 5 x 105 A/cm 2 at 12 T. Our systematic analysis of the flux pinning mechanism indicates that both the pinning <b>centre</b> <b>number</b> density and the pinning force are greatly increased by the pressure and enhance the pinning.

40|$|Numbers were {{recorded}} of adult C. brevitarsis emerging from standard samples from variously treated dung pats. Adult emergence {{was a more}} efficient technique than the extraction of immatures. Emergence increased linearly by from three to four ovipositions per pat per day over the first 7 days of exposure of pats in the field. Oviposition occurred throughout the diel, maximum 1400 - 1800 h and minimum 0000 - 0700 h. Emergence began 11 days after pats were exposed and was completed by day 24. From days 12 to 24 numbers emerging halved every 1 - 7 days. Eggs were deposited all over the upper surface of pats with greatest density at the <b>centre.</b> <b>Number</b> emerging per unit area was independent of pat size. Adults emerged from pats of varying shape in plan view but few from pats sunk flush with the ground, surrounded by a sleeve, or subjected to heavy rain within 24 h of deposition.
