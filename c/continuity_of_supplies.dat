40|$|Continuity {{of energy}} {{supplies}} {{is a central}} aspect of concerns about energy security. Although the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> can be influenced by {{a large number of}} risks, most models only analyse a small subset of risk sources and often neglect interdependencies between them. In this paper we introduce a probabilistic time-series model that quantifies the impact of inter-dependent natural, technical and human risk sources on energy supply continuity. Based on a case study of Italian gas and electricity markets we conclude that typical simplifications in time-series models and alternative approaches lead to a bias, which justifies the usage of detailed timeseries models of interdependent risks such as the framework suggested in this paper, even though more detailed versions of this and other frameworks may quickly become very resource intensive...|$|E
40|$|Summary {{objectives}} To synthesise {{data from}} four recent studies in Tanzania examining maternal syphilis screening and its operational implementation in routine antenatal clinics (ANC), drawing lessons for strengthened antenatal {{services for the}} prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. methods The impact of untreated maternal syphilis was examined in a retrospective cohort of 380 Tanzanian women. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and single dose benzathine penicillin treatment were prospectively examined in 1688 pregnant women. Observation, interviews and facility audits were carried out in health facilities within nine districts to determine the operational reality of syphilis screening. results Overall, 49 % of women with untreated high titre syphilis experienced an adverse pregnancy outcome compared with 11 % of uninfected women. Stillbirth and low birthweight rates among those treated for high- or low-titre syphilis were reduced to rates similar to those for uninfected women. The economic cost was $ 1. 44 per woman screened and $ 10. 56 per disability-adjusted life year saved. In the operational study, only 43 % of 2256 ANC attenders observed were screened and only 61 % of sero-reactive women and 37 % of their partners were treated. Adequate training, <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies,</b> supervision and quality control are critical elements for strengthened antenatal services, but are fre...|$|E

This approach consists on the estimation of the impact <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> improvements on distribution network costs. For this purpose, distribution costs resulting from different <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> requirements are computed by a Reference Network Model (RNM). The results obtained from the RNM are used to estimate a cost-function that considers <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> a cost driver for distribution costs. This methodology is applied to three Spanish areas of service (an urban one, a semi-urban one and a rural one) {{in such a way}} that differences in distribution costs caused by the characteristics of the area type can be taken into account. The analysis indicated that distribution costs are more sensitive to <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> improvements in rural areas of service. It also demonstrated that the incentive for reducing number of service interruptions should be higher than the incentive for reducing duration of service interruptions. Finally, the current Spanish incentive scheme for <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> was analyzed under the perspective of the proposed approach. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980 s, the {{liberalisation}} {{of market}} access has become a dominant element in European infrastructure policy. Starting with telecommunications, reforms have now also targeted the postal services, freight and passenger transportation, in order to develop harmonised and competition-based services. These reforms will require the adjustment of regulations in order to safeguard the provision of public policy objectives. Despite structural differences, a sectoral comparison indicates a series of common features: All three sectors are experiencing a gradual market opening, that will allow monopolies to exist only in peripheral segments (especially in network infrastructure). The pace of liberalisation varies across sectors. While the telecommunications sector has been leading the way, a complete liberalisation of the postal services has yet to begin. As far as the passenger short-distance and regional transportation in the public sector is concerned, additional competition is provided by substitutes, i. e., intermodal competition between various modes of carriers (e. g., automobiles, buses, trains, etc.). The introduction of competition requires an adjustment of the regulatory framework in the sectors concerned. Reforms must take into consideration that services that are in the public interest are maintained even under market conditions, i. e., that services that are essential to full social and economic inclusion are provided to everybody at affordable prices. After all, easier market access and increasing competition have caused also public providers to emphasise cost awareness and profitability. In many ways, this is incompatible with the provision of services that adequately serve the public interest, because such services may not be profitable or because prices of services do not cover costs (such as services supplied to peripheral regions, prices set under the aspect of affordability). On the one hand, increasing liberalisation requires a more precise specification of what services are to be supplied in the public interest (e. g., a definition of universal services). On the other hand, the financing of such non-commercial services must be compatible with a market-based economy. At times when such services were provided exclusively or predominantly by public monopolies (through a high share of services reserved for the public domain) cross subsidies were a feasible option. But as competition intensifies it becomes imperative to spread the financial burden resulting from public welfare services across all providers (e. g., universal services financed within one sector) or to allocate the costs to those who order the services (external financing by the Federal Republic or the states). An {{increase in the number of}} providers of infrastructure services brings about improvements in terms of prices, quality and the choice available; this applies to general services as well as to services provided (below costs) in the public interest. New mechanisms have been established for finding the best providers of universal services and other non-commercial services. A paradigmatic change from the model of the legally obligated service provider to market-based procurement processes (such as universal services auctions and tenders for contracts of limited duration) is emerging. The sectoral analysis also indicates that liberalisation does not only involve risks but also opportunities for safeguarding the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> and the maintenance of a comprehensive supply of non-commercial services. The comparison of various sectors points out the importance of specifying goals within the political process (definition of the range and quality of services). The next step in this process will be to efficiently implement political goals by modifying the regulatory framework as well as by an increased reliance on competitive processes of awarding permits.

The implementation of smart MV/LV substations can provide a significant improvement <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> However, a large investment is required, so the optimal level of implementation must be found. This paper aims to provide a methodology to determine the optimal degree of automation comparing the costs of increasing automation to the benefits derived from the improvement <b>of</b> <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> achieved. First, the impact of different degrees of implementation of smart MV/LV substations on <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> is quantified using a reference network model (RNM). Then, an economic analysis is performed to assess automation costs and supply interruptions costs from two different perspectives, considering non supplied energy for network users and alternatively regulatory incentives for distribution companies. Finally, the optimal degree of automation is identified by comparing marginal costs. Furthermore, the methodology proposed is applied to two large scale test cases of an urban and a semi-urban network. The results obtained highlight the need to compare costs and benefits showing that there is indeed an optimal degree of automation different from the complete automation of the distribution system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} {{explores the}} regulation of the insolvency of essential services and the public interest through {{an examination of the}} common law and legislative responses in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Drawing on understandings of the public interest gained from its analysis the thesis proposes a model of the public interest that may be used to justify representation of non-creditor interests within insolvency proceedings of essential services. The model also identifies non-creditor public interest considerations that extend beyond <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> The thesis then undertakes case studies of {{the regulation of}} insolvency within the Australian electricity industry and Melbourne's public transport industry to examine how effectively public interest issues have been addressed and how these are balanced against the interests of the firm and its creditors. The thesis argues that a fundamental problem of the regulation of insolvent essential services is balancing the general public's interest in the fate of the insolvent firm with the interests of others stakeholders, particularly creditors. The thesis demonstrates {{there is a great deal}} of inconsistency of response to this issue both within and between the jurisdictions under consideration. Focussing on the public interest in the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> the United Kingdom has enacted ad hoc insolvency procedures which are initiated by the state and oust creditor control mainly in relation to the monopoly sector of various essential services. A different approach in the United States has meant public interest considerations are built into its insolvency law through a combination of legislative prescription, judicial interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code and a limited willingness to grant non-creditor representation rights in insolvency proceedings of essential services. The thesis argues that the integration model of the United States allows an appropriate balance to be struck between the interests of the firm and its creditors and the broader public interest when regulating the insolvency of essential services. In contrast Australia has not enacted ad hoc insolvency procedures or expressly integrated the public interest within its insolvency law. The case study of the Australian electricity industry shows, however, that the public interest in the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> is managed by allowing creditors' rights to be affected radically by utilities regulation such a state step-in rights and retailer of last regulation. The thesis demonstrates the fragmented and inconsistent nature of these provisions. The case study of Melbourne's train and tram industry and the examination of South Australia's privatisation of its electricity assets by way of lease show the ways in which private contracting rather than utilities regulation can manage public interest issues. The thesis concludes that while the public's interest in the <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> essential services in Australia is generally satisfactorily dealt with under current arrangements, what is less clear is whether public interest issues beyond <b>continuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> will be given sufficient weight in insolvency proceedings, particularly in the context of a reorganising firm. The thesis argues it is within this area that there is space for integrating public interest considerations within Australia's insolvency law by expressly requiring the court to consider the public interest in such proceedings. Incorporating public interest considerations that recognise non-creditor stakeholder interests into Australian insolvency law requires theoretical justification. The thesis argues there are sound theoretical arguments for expanding insolvency's law role to accommodate broader stakeholder interests in the context of the insolvency of essential services and that the model of the public interest proposed by the thesis may be used as a basis for a court to grant representation rights to non-creditor interests within insolvency proceedings of essential services in Australia.
