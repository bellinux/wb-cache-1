This review aims to outline future radiobiological research {{to get closer to}} the mechanism of radiation myelopathy. MethodsDifferent regimes and techniques of irradiation that deliver doses to the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>lead</b> to the development of radiation myelopathy. Up to now, interpretations of injuries have been based entirely on morphological observations and histological analysis. ResultsUsing paralysis as the endpoint, large fraction size data were consistent with the linear quadratic model (α/β= 2. 41 Gy). Small fraction size data gave a much smaller value of α/β (0. 48 Gy). ConclusionA possible explanation is the interaction of two different groups of target cells with different fractionation sensitivities and, therefore, different α/β values. This duality suggests that spinal cord vascular endothelial changes, both in the morphology and secretory profile, may convey information in addition to the definition of various cells that participate in the evolution of radiation myelopathy...|$|E

40|$|The {{release of}} {{inflammatory}} mediators from immune and glial cells {{either in the}} peripheral or CNS may {{have an important role}} in the development of physiopathological processes such as neuropathic pain. Microglial, then astrocytic activation in the spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>lead</b> to chronic inflammation, alteration of neuronal physiology and neuropathic pain. Standard experimental models of neuropathic pain include an important peripheral inflammatory component, which involves prominent immune cell activation and infiltration. Among potential immunomodulators, the T-cell cytokine interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) has a key role in regulating immune cell activation and glial reactivity after CNS injury. Here we show, using the model of chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve (CCI), that IL- 15 is essential for the development of the early inflammatory events in the spinal cord after a peripheral lesion that generates neuropathic pain. IL- 15 expression in the spinal cord was identified in both astroglial and microglial cells and was present during the initial gliotic and inflammatory (NFkappaB) response to injury. The expression of IL- 15 was also identified as a cue for macrophage and T-cell activation and infiltration in the sciatic nerve, as shown by intraneural injection of the cytokine and activity blockage approaches. We conclude that the regulation of IL- 15 and hence the initial events following its expression after peripheral nerve injury could have a future therapeutic potential in the reduction of neuroinflammation...|$|E

We measured lead in breast milk to quantify the relation between maternal blood and bone lead levels and breast-feeding status (exclusive vs. partial) among 310 lactating women in Mexico City, Mexico, at 1 month postpartum. Umbilical cord and maternal blood samples were collected at delivery. Maternal breast milk, blood, and bone lead levels were obtained at 1 month postpartum. Levels of lead in breast milk ranged from 0. 21 to 8. 02 µg/L (ppb), with a geometric mean (GM) of 1. 1 µg/L; blood lead ranged from 1. 8 to 29. 9 µg/dL (GM = 8. 4 µg/dL); bone lead ranged from < 1 to 67. 2 µg/g bone mineral (patella) and from < 1 to 76. 6 µg/g bone mineral (tibia) at 1 month postpartum.

40|$|Abstract Background Lead is a {{pervasive}} neurotoxicant {{that has been}} associated with poorer cognitive, behavioral, and motor outcomes in children. The effects of lead on sensory function have not been well characterized. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant sensory function, as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and grating visual acuity (VA). Methods Lead was measured in maternal blood in mid- and late-pregnancy (mean gestational age[*]=[*] 15. 5 and 39. 0  weeks, respectively) and umbilical cord blood in a cohort of full-term infants in rural northeastern China. ABR latencies (peaks I, III, V) were measured in newborns during unsedated sleep (n[*]=[*] 315). The ABR central-to-peripheral (C-P) ratio was calculated as the ratio between the III-V and I-III interpeak intervals. VA was measured in 6 -week-olds using Teller Acuity Cards (n[*]=[*] 1019) and assigned as the narrowest grid the infant fixated on. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between tertiles of mid-pregnancy, late-pregnancy, or <b>cord</b> <b>lead</b> and newborn ABR or 6 -week VA. Results Higher late-pregnancy lead levels were associated with higher ABR C-P ratios and lower VA. In covariate-adjusted analyses, mean C-P ratios were 4. 6 and 3. 2  % higher in infants whose mothers had lead[*]>[*] 3. 8  μg/dL and lead[*]=[*] 2 – 3. 8  μg/dL, respectively, than for infants whose mothers had lead[*] [*] 3. 8  μg/dL and lead[*]=[*] 2 – 3. 8  μg/dL, respectively, compared to lead[*]<[*] 2  μg/dL (p-trend = 0. 009). Conclusion Auditory and visual systems maturation appears delayed in infants with higher prenatal lead exposure during late-pregnancy, even at relatively low levels. Both systems start myelinating in late gestation and mature rapidly in infancy. Higher ABR C-P ratio and lower grating VA scores suggest effects of low-level lead exposure on sensory system myelination...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} ischemia, and ensuing subsequent cellular events, on mammalian spinal cord ventral white matter (VWM). Ischemia {{can act as a}} primary injury when there is an occlusion in the blood supply, but also arises following mechanical injury. Ischemia obstructs normal cellular metabolic functions by preventing the delivery of vital substrates such as oxygen and glucose. A key aspect of spinal cord physiology is its role in electric impulse propagation, and without normal metabolic function, spinal cord conduction becomes compromised. Utilizing a unique recording model, we are able to visual a real time recording of membrane electrophysiological activity (CAP, CMP, latency) and can observe the immediate effects of ischemia on conduction. We found that if we subject the VWM to an acute ischemic insult, they have the ability to recover almost 100 % of their initial CAP. This model also enables us to isolate the ischemic insult due to the design of the recording apparatus. By isolating the ischemic insult, we are able to create artificial secondary injuries, by introducing relevant metabolic toxins that accumulate as a result of reperfusion of blood to the tissues. This reperfusion period is necessary for the survival of the tissue, {{but at the same time}} can lead to many detrimental metabolic events, such as FR production and LPO. In this study we examined the effects of acrolein, a toxic by-product of LPO. It was found that acrolein concentrations that are not harmful to healthy spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>lead</b> to conduction failure if introduced subsequent to ischemia. In addition, acrolein causes anatomical damage to VWM, as observed with HRP histology. Finally, we wanted to determine if we could develop a treatment protocol that could reverse some of the damaging effects of acrolein reperfusion. We pretreated the spinal cord with the ester form of glutathione, a powerful free radical scavenger and antioxidant, attempting to prevent the damaging effects of acrolein. We also treated the spinal cords with a high concentration of ascorbic acid during acrolein reperfusion. Both treatments proved effective in reducing the damaging effects of acrolein on the spinal cord tissue following ischemia. ...|$|E
40|$|Clinically, {{injuries}} {{affecting the}} spinal cord or peripheral nerves can leave those affected with severe disability and, at present, there are limited options for treatment. Peripheral nerve injury with a significant gap between the proximal and distal stumps is currently treated with autologous nerve grafting but this is limited by availability of donor nerve and has associated morbidities. In contrast, injuries to the spinal <b>cord</b> <b>lead</b> to an inhibitory environment caused by the glial cells and thereby, limit potential axonal regeneration. This thesis investigates the effects of human adipose derived stem cells (ASC) on regeneration after peripheral nerve and spinal cord injury in adult rats. Human ASC expressed various neurotrophic molecules and growth factor stimulation of the cells in vitro resulted in increased secretion of BDNF, GDNF, VEGF-A and angiopoietin- 1 proteins. Stimulated ASC also showed an enhanced ability to induce capillary-like tube formation in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. In contrast to Schwann cells, ASC did not induce activation of astrocytes and supported neurite outgrowth from the adult rat sensory DRG neurons in culture. In a peripheral nerve injury model, ASC were seeded into a fibrin conduit, which was used to bridge a 10 mm rat sciatic nerve gap. After 2 weeks, ASC enhanced GAP- 43 and ATF- 3 expression in {{the spinal cord}}, reduced c-jun expression in the DRG and increased the vascularity of the fibrin nerve conduits. The animals treated with stimulated ASC showed an enhanced axon regeneration and reduced caspase- 3 expression in the DRG. After transplantation into the injured C 3 -C 4 cervical spinal cord. ASC continued to express neurotrophic factors and laminin and stimulated extensive ingrowths of 5 HT-positive raphaespinal axons into the trauma zone.

Twenty-eight further spinal <b>cord</b> stimulator <b>lead</b> anchorings were undertaken on the bench with the titanium anchor and three different octrode leads. The median force to cause lead movement in cadavers was 0. 55 Newtons (N) for short silastic anchors, 0. 81 N and 0. 63 N for two types of long silastic anchor, and 1. 3 N for the titanium anchor. There was a significant difference between long and short silastic anchors (p < 0. 01) and {{a significant difference between the}} titanium anchor and the silastic anchors (p < 0. 003).

40|$|Abstract: Spinal <b>cord</b> injury (SCI) <b>leads</b> to {{profound}} haemodynamic changes. Constant outflows {{from the}} central autonomic pattern generators modulate {{the activity of the}} spinal sympathetic neurons. Sudden loss of communication between these centers and the sympathetic neurons in the intermediolateral thoracic and lumbar spinal <b>cord</b> <b>leads</b> to spinal shock. After high SCI, experimental data demonstrated a brief hypertensive peak followed by bradycardia with escape arrhythmias and marked hypotension. Total peripheral resistance and cardiac output decrease, while central venous pressure remains unchanged. The initial hypertensive peak is thought to result from direct sympathetic stimulation during SCI and its presence is anaesthetic agent dependent. Hypotension improves within days in most animal species because of reasons not totally understood, which may include synaptic reorganization or hyper responsiveness of receptors. No convincing data has demonstrated that the deafferented spinal cord can generate significant basal sympathetic activity. However, with the spinal shock resolution, the deafferented spinal cord (in lesions above T 6) will generate life-threatening hypertensive bouts with compensatory bradycardia, known as autonomic hyperreflexia (AH) after stimuli such as pain or bladder/colonic distension. AH results from the lack of supraspinal control of the sympathetic neurons and altered neurotransmission (e. g. glutamatergic) within the spinal cord. Despite significant progress in recent years, further research is necessary to fully understand the spectrum of haemodynamic changes after SCI...|$|R

40|$|A {{central issue}} in {{transplantation}} {{research is to}} determine how and when transplantation of neural tissue can influence the development and function of the mammalian central nervous system. Of particular interest is whether electrophysiological function in the traumatized or diseased mammalian central nervous system can be improved by the replacement of cellular elements that are missing or damaged. Although {{it is known that}} transplantation of neural tissue can lead to functional improvement in models of neurological disease characterized by neuronal loss, less is known about results of transplantation in disorders of myelin. We report here that transplantation of glial cells into the dorsal columns of neonatal myelin-deficient rat spinal <b>cords</b> <b>leads</b> to myelination and a 3 -fold increase in conduction velocity. We also show that impulses can propagate {{into and out of the}} transplant region and that axons myelinated by transplanted cells do not have impaired frequency-response properties. These results demonstrate that myelination following central nervous system glial cell transplantation enhances action potential conduction in myelin-deficient axons, with conduction velocity approaching normal values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The populations who {{are most}} {{sensitive}} to lead exposure from various sources are pregnant women and their newborns. Aiming to explore the presence of correlation between maternal and <b>cord</b> blood <b>lead</b> levels and to identify potential predictors that may influence both levels, the present study has been conducted. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted covering 350 full terms maternal-newborns pairs from Mosul maternity hospitals. Data were obtained directly from women just before delivery {{by the use of}} a detailed questionnaire form. Maternal and umbilical blood lead levels were estimated using LEADCARE ® Blood Lead Testing System and Kits. Results A positive significant correlation was found between maternal and <b>cord</b> blood <b>lead</b> values (r = 0. 856, p = 0. 001). By backward stepwise logistic regression analysis the followings emerged as significant potential predictors of high maternal blood lead: low parity, smoking and Hb level Conclusion Study results have provided baseline data needed to be transformed to decision makers to implement measures to eliminate lead from the environment and protect future generation from its deleterious effects. </p...|$|R
