5000|$|It {{is finally}} insisted that a {{judgment}} against the corporation, although founded upon a tort, becomes ipso facto a debt by contract, being a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>record</b> or a specialty {{in the nature}} of a contract. But we have already seen that the settled course of decision in the New York Court of Appeals rejects the judgment against the corporation as either evidence or ground of liability against the trustees, and founds the latter upon the obligation of the corporation on which the judgment itself rests. And it was decided by this Court in the case of Louisiana v. New Orleans, 109 U. S. 285, that a liability for a tort, created by statute, although reduced to judgment by a recovery for the damages suffered, did not thereby become a debt by contract {{in the sense of the}} Constitution of the United States forbidding state legislation impairing its obligation, for the reason that the term 'contract' is used in the Constitution in its ordinary sense as signifying the agreement of two or more minds, for considerations proceeding from one to the other, to do or not to do certain acts. Mutual assent to its terms is of its very essence." ...|$|E

During his time as principal conductor, the ISO signed a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> ten albums with Chandos Records. Sakari conducted the orchestra on most of them. Furthermore, Sakari conducted the ISO in recordings of the complete symphonies by Jean Sibelius, made for Naxos Records in 1998-2000. Sakari often described his views on how the ISO’s board might improve the orchestra’s conditions, e.g. by hiring more players, financing more trips abroad and creating the position of assistant conductor.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this article, I {{argue that}} the {{relationship}} between patients and their health care providers need not be construed as a contract between moral strangers. Contrary to the (American) legal presumption that health care providers are not obligated to assist others in need unless the latter are already <b>contracted</b> patients <b>of</b> <b>record,</b> I submit that the presence of a suffering human being constitutes an immediate moral commandment to try to relieve such suffering. This thesis is developed in reference to the French philosopher Levinas and the Dutch theologian Schillebeeckx. An expanded version of the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan serves as test case. Key words: contrast ethics, hermeneutics, Levinas, moral discernment, moral obligation, moral strangers, narrative ethics, patient–care giver relationship, theory of ethic...|$|R

[...] The [...] "split" [...] was picked up by the newspapers and national radio in a particularly negative way and to the casual reader may have led to the impression that the wider interest in traditional music was in decline, and many people were annoyed by the coverage. Furthermore, the band could not [...] "really plan any future work as Wolfstone" [...] whilst still under the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> their <b>record</b> label Green Linnet Records. A collaboration album between Drever and the band's bassist Wayne Mackenzie, originally released as Drever-Mackenzie in 1997, was re-released as Wolfstone album entitled This Strange Place in 1998 as a contract filler. The album, which features a much softer tone than Wolfstone, was released to mixed reviews when issued as a Wolfstone album, with many fans unaware that this was a repackaging of a side-project release and that the band had not [...] "mellowed". Drever and the band's fiddlist Duncan Chisholm recorded their side-project collaboration album The Lewis Blue, released on Wolfstone's former label Iowa Records in 1998, before Drever himself left Wolfstone, leaving Eaglesham by default to become the sole leading force in the band.|$|R

Legally bound to Bang Records, Morrison was not only kept out of the studio, but he also found himself unable to find performing work in New York as most clubs refrained from booking him, fearing reprisals. Ilene Berns then discovered that her late husband had previously been remiss in filing all the appropriate paperwork to keep Morrison (still a British citizen) in New York. She contacted Immigration and Naturalization Service and attempted to have Morrison deported. However, Morrison managed to stay in the U.S. when his then-girlfriend Janet (Planet) Rigsbee Minto agreed to marry him. Once married, Morrison and his wife moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he found work performing in local clubs. Morrison began performing with a small electric combo doing blues numbers, songs from Blowin' Your Mind! and from Morrison's Them band days. Two of the musicians soon left but Morrison retained the bassist, Tom Kielbania, a student at the Berklee School of Music. At that juncture, Morrison decided to try an acoustic sound, and he and Kielbania began performing shows in coffee houses in the Boston area as an acoustic duo with Morrison playing guitar and Kielbania on upright bass. [...] Before this, Morrison had primarily recorded and performed with electric musicians. The acoustic medium would provide him [...] "greater vocal improvisation and a freer, folkier feel".|$|R
