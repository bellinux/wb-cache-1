50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the rotordynamic system of equations are the off-diagonal terms of stiffness, damping, and mass. These terms are called <b>cross-coupled</b> stiffness, <b>cross-coupled</b> damping, and <b>cross-coupled</b> mass. When {{there is a positive}} <b>cross-coupled</b> stiffness, a deflection will cause a reaction force opposite the direction of deflection to react the load, and also a reaction force in the direction of positive whirl. If this force is large enough compared with the available direct damping and stiffness, the rotor will be unstable. When a rotor is unstable it will typically require immediate shutdown of the machine to avoid catastrophic failure.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of high supply (up to 84 bar) pressure testing of hole-pattern annular gas seals performed at the Texas A & M Turbomachinery Laboratory in College Station, TX. The test variables were chosen to determine the influence of pressure ratio, rotor speed, and negative preswirl on seal performance. Preswirl signifies the circumferential fluid flow entering a seal, and negative preswirl indicates a fluid swirl in the direction opposite of rotor rotation. Changes in pressure ratio had only small effects on most rotordynamic coefficients. <b>Cross-coupled</b> stiffness showed slightly different profiles through the mid-range of excitation frequencies. Pressure ratio showed some influence on direct and <b>cross-coupled</b> damping at low excitation frequencies. Rotor speed significantly affected both <b>cross-coupled</b> stiffness and <b>cross-coupled</b> damping. As rotor speed increased, the magnitude of <b>cross-coupled</b> rotordynamic coefficients increased due to the positive fluid swirl induced by rotor rotation. For the low rotor speed, negative inlet preswirl was able to overpower the positive rotor induced fluid rotation, producing a negative <b>cross-coupled</b> stiffness. This outcome showed that, for hole-pattern seals, positive fluid swirl does indeed produce positive <b>cross-coupled</b> stiffness coefficients and negative fluid swirl produces negative <b>cross-coupled</b> stiffness coefficients. The addition of negative preswirl greatly reduced <b>cross-coupled</b> rotordynamic coefficients, while direct rotordynamic terms were unaffected. Cross-over frequency signifies the excitation frequency where effective damping transitions from a negative value to a positive value with increasing excitation frequency. Peak effective damping was increased by 50 percent and cross-over frequency reduced by 50 percent for high-negative preswirl versus zero preswirl results. This led to the conclusion that a reverse swirl could greatly enhance the stability of hole-pattern balance piston seals. A two-control-volume model that uses the ideal gas law at constant temperature (ISOT) was used to predict rotordynamic coefficients and leakage. This model predicted direct rotordynamic coefficients well, but greatly under predicted <b>cross-coupled</b> rotordynamic coefficients especially at high negative preswirls. The model predicted seal leakage well at low pressure ratios, but showed increasing error as the pressure ratio was increased. These results showed that the prediction model could not adequately estimate <b>cross-coupled</b> rotordynamic coefficients for a hole-pattern seal with negative inlet preswirl and requires modification to do so...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Generalized <b>cross-coupled</b> filters require {{implementation}} of {{both positive and}} negative <b>cross-coupled</b> elements.

Traditional methods for realizing capacitive couplings which are difficult to adjust in practice have included the use of capacitive probes in coaxial cavity.

A co-catalyst of palladium-copper is used in the coupling due to the improved reactivity that is achieved. [...] Sonogashira coupling reactions are advantageous in that the reaction has technical simplicity as well as functional group compatibility. CMPs are easily formed using this method due to the ease of rotation of alkynes in planar monomers to achieve a 3-D network. [...] The strength of these planar monomers can be tuned to control the pore diameters of CMPs. [...] Solvents in the Sonogashira coupling reaction can also play a role in the formation of CMPs. Solvents that facilitate the synthesis of CMPs best are dimethylformamide,1,4-dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran. These solvents help neutralize the formation of the hydrogen halide produced as a byproduct. A disadvantage of using terminal alkynes as a monomer, is that terminal alkynes readily undergo homocoupling under the presence of oxygen, so the reaction must be carried out without the presence of oxygen and water.|$|E
