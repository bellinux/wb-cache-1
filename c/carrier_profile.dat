40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} use of spectral photoluminescence as {{an advanced}} and accurate diagnostic tool motivates a comprehen-sive assessment {{of the effects of}} some important optical and electri-cal properties on the photoluminescence spectra from crystalline silicon wafers. In this paper, we present both modeling results and measurements to elucidate the effects of the internal reflectance at the planar wafer surfaces, as well as the <b>carrier</b> <b>profile</b> varying across the sample thickness due to an increased rear-surface re-combination velocity, as a function of temperature. These results suggest that the accuracy of existing spectral PL techniques may be improved by using higher temperatures due to the increased effect of the <b>carrier</b> <b>profile</b> at higher temperatures. They also show that changes in the photoluminescence spectrum shape caused by the addition of a rear-side specular reflector offset those caused by changes in the <b>carrier</b> <b>profile</b> due to increased rear surface re-combination, and therefore, considerable care needs to be taken when changing the rear-side optics. Finally, the possible impact of variations in the rear-side reflectance on the band–band ab-sorption coefficient and radiative recombination coefficient, which have previously been determined using the spectral photolumines-cence technique, is assessed and demonstrated to be insignificant in practice.

40|$|Carrier {{density is}} a {{frequently}} examined parameter for silicon material characterisation. Besides {{the detection of}} the minority carrier lifetime under low injection conditions like QSSPC, CDI/ILM, and PL more advanced material characterisation methods are based on carrier density measurements. Although spatial resolution has been included in many measurement techniques, the depth dependence of the <b>carrier</b> <b>profiles</b> is typically neglected and homogeneous <b>carrier</b> <b>profiles</b> are assumed. This assumption, however, does not hold for many practical cases and may introduce significant systematic errors. In this work, analytical simulations show the expected errors quantitatively. Iron imaging is taken as an example to demonstrate {{the magnitude of the}} systematic error.

40|$|We have {{measured}} and analyzed the room-temperature capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics of In(0. 35) Ga(0. 65) As/GaAs MQW laser structures with different doping {{levels in the}} active region. Average doping densities in the well-barrier regions were directly extracted from the as-measured <b>carrier</b> <b>profiles.</b> A model for the C-V measurements, including the self-consistent solution of Poisson and Schrödinger equations, was developed. The <b>carrier</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained from the simulated C-V characteristics do not correspond to the free <b>carrier</b> <b>profiles</b> since the local charge neutrality hypothesis does not hold for QW structures. Thus, the true carrier distribution can only be determined from a full quantum-mechanical simulation of the laser structure. We have determined, from the comparison between experimental and simulated profiles, a conduction band offset delsta E(c) /delta E(g) of 0. 81. We have also applied C-V measurements to samples with interdiffused QWs, and obtained the characteristic interdiffusion length...|$|R

Based on the assumption of slow variation of electric field within the quasi-neutral Si, solution of minority <b>carrier</b> <b>profile</b> is obtained. For the first time, a closed form expression for minority <b>carrier</b> <b>profile</b> p(x) for uniformly doped n-Si SBD is obtained, which is applicable for all levels of injection. Present analysis shows that minority carrier current, charge storage time and current injection ratio depend {{not only on the}} length of the n region but also on doping density, recombination within n-Si and effective surface recombination velocity at the low-high (n-n+) interface. Results obtained from the present model are also compared with experimental data available in the literature and are found to be in good agreement.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} electron accumulation at clean InN(0001) -(1 x 1) surfaces has been investigated by high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy. Semiclassical dielectric theory simulations of the energy-loss spectra at 295 K and 565 K along with solutions to the Poisson equation enable <b>carrier</b> <b>profiles</b> of the near-surface region to be determined. These measurements reveal similar electron accumulation for both temperatures. The surface-state density, N-ss, and the surface Fermi level, E-FS, {{were found to be}} independent of temperature, with N(ss) similar to 2. 4 x 10 (13) cm(- 2) and E(FS) similar to 1. 5 eV above the valence-band maximum. The slight difference in the <b>carrier</b> <b>profiles</b> between the two temperatures can be accounted for by the change in the electron screening length.

This geometric alteration results in some device issues, like <b>carrier</b> <b>profile,</b> threshold voltage, and corner effects. This work analyzes these consequences based on three-dimensional numeric simulation of several dual-gate and triple-gate FinFETs.

Comparison of the gain characteristics at low voltages between the MQW and conventional APDs show a direct experimental confirmation of a structure-induced carrier multiplication due to interband impact ionization. Similar studies of the bias dependence of the excess noise characteristics show that the low-voltage gain is primarily due to electron ionization in the MQW-APDS, and to both electron and hole ionization in the conventional APDS. For the doped MQW APDS, the average gain per stage was calculated by comparing gain data with <b>carrier</b> <b>profile</b> measurements, and was found to vary from 1. 03 at low bias to 1. 09 near avalanche breakdown...|$|E

40|$|Exploring the {{properties}} and physical limits of nanometer scale structures and devices, emerged {{with the advent}} of epitaxial techniques such as Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). This has correspondingly created challenges to the available characterisation techniques. Determination of <b>carrier</b> concentration <b>profiles</b> in semiconductor structures is of vital importance since the operation of devices depends on it. Of the commonly used techniques, conventional capacitance-voltage (CV) has a major drawback due to the breakdown voltage at high reverse bias particularly at highly doped structures. The most competitive techniques for <b>carrier</b> concentration <b>profiling</b> are the electrochemical CV (ECV) which does not suffer from this limitation, Spreading Resistance Profiling (SRP) and Hall combined with stripped measurement.
