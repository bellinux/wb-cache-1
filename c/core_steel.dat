5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of modern katana and wakizashi are the maru type (sometimes also called muku) {{which is the most}} basic, with the entire sword being composed of a single steel. The kobuse type is made using two steels, which are called hagane (edge steel) and shingane (<b>core</b> <b>steel).</b> Honsanmai and shihozume types add the third steel, called kawagane (skin steel). There are almost an infinite number of ways the steel could be assembled, which often varied considerably from smith to smith. Sometimes the edge-steel is [...] "drawn out" [...] (hammered into a bar), bent into a 'U' shaped trough, and the very soft <b>core</b> <b>steel</b> is inserted into the harder piece. Then they are forge welded together and hammered into the basic shape of the sword.

[...] The more complex types of construction are typically only found in antique weapons, with the {{vast majority}} of modern weapons being composed of a single section, or at most two or three sections.|$|E

40|$|A buckling-restrained brace (BRB) is {{composed}} of a <b>steel</b> <b>core,</b> which resists axial force, and a buckling-restraining system. A carefully designed clearance, often filled with unbonded material, is placed between the <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> and the restraining system to avoid force transfer between the two components through friction. Consequently, BRBs are able to provide stable hysteresis characteristics with the same strength in tension and compression. The authors have developed a new variation of BRBs that use steel-and-mortar planks for the buckling-restraining system. The key advantage of these BRBs is that quality control can be achieved easily. A large number of laboratory test {{results suggest that the}} BRBs using steel-and-mortar planks exhibit excellent performance on par with widely used commercialized BRB products. This paper reports recent findings from the research and development effort towards developing reliable and economic BRBs. The emphasis is on the buckling deformation of the <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> and force transfer between the <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> and the buckling-restraining system.

A roller coaster earnings surge the next year crashed down the year after that due to a further increase in imports and low demand. In 1983, shareholders agreed to create National Intergroup, a holding company, and merge the steel business as one many units into it. The corporate reorganization was a further step to an already initiated arrangement that started in 1982, which broke the company into six independently managed units. The move was intended to better administer the company which had become diversified away from steel into aluminum and financial services. That same year, the workers of the Weirton mill purchased their operation from National Steel, forming an independent employee-owned corporation.|$|E

50|$|Laminated vs Honyaki: From a {{strictly}} heat treat and microscopy point of view, {{there should be}} no difference between a laminated and honyaki steel with the same observed structure and heat threat process, but the heat treat necessarily differs, and many users say there is benefit to honyaki. Many users also prefer laminated blades for ease of maintenance ,sharpening feel, cost, and toughness. Many blacksmiths prefer laminated blades because at the minimum, they are easier to produce. At the highest levels they have <b>core</b> <b>steel</b> of comparable hardness and sharpness and are not necessarily easier to make due to the skill to forge weld at lower temperatures, with minimal loss of carbon, less flux and iron powder, and with minimal scars while stretching out the laminate. Pattern welding (suminagashi) requires its own skill as well and can produce a stiffer awase knife with less distortion during use and sharpening.|$|E

50|$|Forging: Unlike awase bocho, honyaki {{in general}} {{have no need}} to raise to forge welding heat. This skips the {{possible}} carbon migration to the mild steel and decarburization from the heating to around 1000 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the smith skips the need to weld the layers careful under careful heating and to evenly forge the <b>core</b> <b>steel.</b> In this regard to forging white 2 steel, honyaki is easier than in awase bocho. More alloy and higher carbon make this more difficult. There are multiple re-heatings and forging from high temperatures downward. Blades are cooled and annealed in carbonized rice straw or ash, cut to rough shape, cold forged, and corrected for distortion multiple times. They are preferably left to stabilize for a bit between each step to help reduce distortion. The knife is rough ground to shape with the omote, urasuki, and profile. These steps generally require more effort than with laminated knives.|$|E
50|$|The {{quenching}} process {{produces a}} high strength bar from inexpensive low carbon steel. The process quenches the surface {{layer of the}} bar, which pressurizes and deforms the crystal structure of intermediate layers, and simultaneously begins to temper the quenched layers using {{the heat from the}} bar's <b>core.</b> <b>Steel</b> billets 130mm² ("pencil ingots") are heated to approximately 1200°C to 1250°C in a reheat furnace. Then, they are progressively rolled to reduce the billets to the final size and shape of reinforcing bar. After the last rolling stand, the billet moves through a quench box. The quenching converts the billet's surface layer to martensite, and causes it to shrink. The shrinkage pressurizes the core, helping to form the correct crystal structures. The core remains hot, and austenitic. A microprocessor controls the water flow to the quench box, to manage the temperature difference through the cross-section of the bars. The correct temperature difference assures that all processes occur, and bars have the necessary mechanical properties. The bar leaves the quench box with a temperature gradient through its cross section. As the bar cools, heat flows from the bar's centre to its surface so that the bar's heat and pressure correctly tempers an intermediate ring of martensite and bainite. Finally, the slow cooling after quenching automatically tempers the austenitic core to ferrite and pearlite on the cooling bed.|$|E

50|$|Silver brazed diamond blades' diamond {{segments}} are brazed to the <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> using {{a silver}} solder. These blades {{can only be}} used in wet cuttings. If they are used in dry cuttings, the silver solder may melt and the segments can break from the <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> and become a serious safety hazard. A laser melts and combines the metal of the diamond segment and the <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> creating a stronger weld, which can hold the segments even in high temperatures, meaning that laser welded diamond blades {{can be used to}} cut many types of stone without water cooling. However, when cutting very hard or abrasive materials, e.g., concrete containing reinforcing rebar, laser welded diamond blades should also be used with adequate water. Otherwise, it is possible for the diamond segment itself to break or the <b>steel</b> <b>core</b> below the segment to wear and break, creating serious safety hazards.|$|R

In numerous applications, these panels have shown very promising commercial possibilities. This study presents the design, manufacturing and commercializing process for two practical examples: Case 1) a fly wheel cover for a diesel engine and Case 2) rotationally symmetrical panel for an electric motor. Test materials of various kinds were used for corrugated cores and skin plates: conventional low-carbon steel grade EN 10130 and ferritic stainless steel grade 1. 4509 with plate the thicknesses of 0. 5, 0. 6 and 0. 75 mm. To manufacture different kinds of corrugated <b>core</b> <b>steel</b> panels, flexible manufacturing tools and cost-effective processes are needed. The most important criterion for laser welding panels was the capability of forming tools for producing high quality geometry for the core. Laser welding assembly showed that the quality of the core in both studied cases was good enough for welding the lap joints properly. Developed panels have been tested in industrial applications with excellent feedback. If thickness of a corrugated panel structure is not a limiting issue, these panels are good solution on application where stiffness and lighter weight are required as well as vibrational aspect considered...|$|E
