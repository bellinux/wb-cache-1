5000|$|V. cholerae {{pathogenicity}} genes {{code for}} proteins {{directly or indirectly}} involved in the virulence of the bacteria. During infection, V. cholerae secretes cholera toxin, a protein that causes profuse, watery diarrhea (known as [...] "rice-water stool"). Colonization of the small intestine also requires the toxin coregulated pilus (TCP), a thin, flexible, filamentous appendage {{on the surface of}} bacterial cells.V. cholerae can cause syndromes ranging from asymptomatic to cholera gravis. In endemic areas, 75% of cases are asymptomatic, 20% are mild to moderate, and 2-5% are severe forms such as cholera gravis. Symptoms include abrupt onset of watery diarrhea (a grey and <b>cloudy</b> <b>liquid),</b> occasional vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Dehydration ensues, with symptoms and signs such as thirst, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, sunken eyes, hypotension, weak or absent radial pulse, tachycardia, tachypnea, hoarse voice, oliguria, cramps, renal failure, seizures, somnolence, coma, and death. Death due to dehydration can occur in a few hours to days in untreated children. The disease is also particularly dangerous for pregnant women and their fetuses during late pregnancy, as it may cause premature labor and fetal death. In cases of cholera gravis involving severe dehydration, up to 60% of patients can die; however, less than 1% of cases treated with rehydration therapy are fatal. The disease typically lasts 4-6 days. Worldwide, diarrhoeal disease, caused by cholera and many other pathogens, is the second-leading cause of death for {{children under the age of}} 5 and at least 120,000 deaths are estimated to be caused by cholera each year. In 2002, the WHO deemed that the case fatality ratio for cholera was about 3.95%.|$|E
40|$|Are liquid {{crystals}} living organisms? In 1888 the Austrian botanist F. Reinitzer {{made the}} observation that the solid compound cholesteryl-benzoate changes - when melting at 145. 5 °C - into a <b>cloudy</b> <b>liquid,</b> that, however, turns into a clear liquid at 178. 5 °C and higher temperatures. The <b>cloudy</b> <b>liquid</b> seemed to be doubly refracting. Soon {{a number of these}} so-called 'liquid crystals' were discovered; in 1908 D. Vorlander, professor of organic chemistry at Halle, described more than 250 of these substances. It was O. Lehmann, professor of physics at Aachen (1885), Dresden (1888) and Karlsruhe (1889), who immediately after Reinitzer's observation began a systematic study of these liquid crystals. In The Netherlands the Amsterdam professor of physical chemistry H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom was interested in liquid crystals, in particular because of their place in his phase system. F. M. Jaeger, at that time teaching chemistry in a secondary school in Zaandam (near Amsterdam) and working as an unpaid university lecturer at the Amsterdam university (by recommendation of Bakhuis Roozeboom), investigated liquid crystals (1906), as did a number of doctoral students (A. C. de Kock, 1903; A. Prins, 1907). At the university of Utrecht L. S. Ornstein, professor of physics, gave the study of liquid crystals a prominent place in his research programme. The discovery of liquid crystals, which seemed to be able to grow, move, divide, copulate, and so on, led to a discussion on the nature of these substances. Time and again Lehmann called them 'apparently living crystals', although without considering them as 'real living beings'. In his book Flüssige Kristalle und die Theorien des Lebens (1906), Lehmann proved to be an obvious adherent of the monistic views of the biologist E. Haeckel. Haeckel considered the existence of liquid crystals as proof of the unity between the inorganic and the organic world that he believed in so strongly. In his last book, Kristallseelett. Studiën über das Anorganische Leben (1917), he considered liquid crystals a real form of life, as did F. Rinne, professor of mineralogy and petrography, as late as in the nineteen thirties...|$|E

A manuscript that has recently been prepared covering this subject is attached as an Appendix. The abstract describes the key finding that <b>cloudy</b> mean <b>liquid</b> water path (LWP) is invariant with cloud fraction for cloud cover between 20 % - 80 %. Similar conclusions are reached with ISCCP and LANDSAT data. This has important implications for General Circulation Models.

40|$|The Agave {{juice is}} a whitish, <b>cloudy</b> <b>liquid</b> that is {{obtained}} from the Agave plant, and since pre-Columbian times {{has been used to}} produce an alcoholic drink known as pulque. This drink has been consumed in rural areas of Mexico. The urban population, however, has had some degree of rapprochement with pulque due to migration of rural workers to the city. The Agave juice has nutritional properties and amino acids, vitamins and sugars and when added with a probiotic microorganism its nutritional value is further increased. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the factors causing the purchase and acceptance of a probiotic drink based on agave juice in a rural community of the State of Tlaxcala and an urban area of the State of Puebla. This is a non-experimental, descriptive and simple cross sectional research. The results show that rural consumers are willing to buy the new product based on Agave juice, if its promotion manages to convey its nutritional properties, if its sensory properties are changed and if the product really gives special nutrients to improve the health of the population.

Las Vegas's ICE club incorporates the technology. The Axis/Radius club in Scottsdale, Arizona also employs the technology. The Kryogenifex system creates an effect using a freezing blast of <b>cloudy,</b> white <b>liquid</b> nitrogen. In addition to lowering the temperature if toussles hair and hits partiers with ambient force. The systems cost more than $15,000 and use three nozzles to shoot a non-flammable mixture of liquid nitrogen compressed with carbon dioxide that fills a two-story club in about 10 seconds, according to a club director. This cools the area 20 degrees {{for a few seconds}} as a white cloud that can be colored with flashing lights fills the area. The effect costs about $75 for 30 seconds of firing.|$|R
40|$|Mark Silverman {{has seen}} light perform many wonders. From the marvel of seeing inside <b>cloudy</b> <b>liquids</b> {{as a result}} of his own {{cutting-edge}} research to reproducing and examining an unusual diffraction pattern first witnessed by Isaac Newton 300 years ago, he has studied aspects of light that have inspired and puzzled humans for hundreds of years. In this book, he draws on his many experiences as an optical and atomic physicist [...] and on his consummate skills as a teacher and writer about the mysteries of physics [...] to present a remarkable tour of the world of light. He explores theoretical, experimental, and historical themes, showing a keen eye for curious and neglected corners of the study of light and a fascination with the human side of scientific discovery. In the course of the book, he covers such questions as how it is possible to achieve magnifications of a millionfold without a single lens or mirror. He asks what all living things have in common that might one day allow the development of a "life-form scanner" like the one in Star Trek. He considers whether more light can reflect from a surface than strikes it, and explores the origin of the strange hyperpolic diffraction pattern Newton originally produced with sunlight and knives. Silverman also discusses his new and ground-breaking experiments to see into murky substances such as fog or blood [...] a finding with potential applications as diverse as noninvasive medical testing and remote sensing of the environment. His wide-ranging reflections cover virtually all elements of physical optics, including propagation, reflection, refraction, diffraction, interference, polarization, and scattering. Throughout, Silverman makes extensive reference to both modern research and the original works of giants such as Newton, Fresnel, and Maxwell. In a more personal section about physics and learning, Silverman argues for self-directed learning and discusses the central importance of stimulating scientific curiosity in students. Waves and Grains will encourage a spirit of wonder and inquiry in anyone with scientific interests...|$|R

40|$|Temperature inversions are {{a common}} feature of the Arctic wintertime {{boundary}} layer. They have important impacts on both radiative and turbulent heat fluxes and partly determine local climate-change feedbacks. Understanding the spread in inversion strength modelled by current global climate models is therefore {{an important step in}} better understanding Arctic climate and its present and future changes. Here, we show how the formation of Arctic air masses leads to the emergence of a cloudy and a clear state of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the <b>cloudy</b> state, cloud <b>liquid</b> water is present, little to no surface radiative cooling occurs and inversions are elevated and relatively weak, whereas surface radiative cooling leads to strong surface-based temperature inversions in the clear state. Comparing model output to observations, we find that most climate models lack a realistic representation of the cloudy state. An idealised single-column model experiment of the formation of Arctic air reveals that this bias is linked to inadequate mixed-phase cloud microphysics, whereas turbulent and conductive heat fluxes control the strength of inversions within the clear state...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{details of}} the characterization of Tank 38 H saltcake and supernate samples pulled in September 2003. The core sample HTF-E- 03 - 114 contained approximately 4 inches of saltcake, which was soupy and brown with white chunks, and contained less than 15 mL of <b>cloudy</b> free <b>liquid.</b> The undrained bulk saltcake had a water content of 16. 8 percentage weight and a bulk density that was approximately 1. 94 g/cm 3 at full saturation. The 137 Cs activity of the bulk saltcake in sample HTF-E- 03 - 114 was 3. 72 E+ 7 pCi/g, which corresponds to 0. 3 Ci per gallon of saltcake. The 238 Pu activity of the bulk saltcake was 3. 62 E+ 6 pCi/g. The filtered free liquid in sample HTF-E- 03 - 114 had a density of 1. 430 g/cm 3, a 137 Cs activity of 0. 73 Ci/gal., and a 238 Pu activity of 5. 78 E+ 3 pCi/mL. The solids filtered from the HTF-E- 03 - 114 free liquid were primarily composed of salts (sodium nitrate and sodium carbonate monohydrate) and sodium aluminosilicates. The Tank 38 H supernate samples (HTF-E- 03 - 122 and 123) had a density of 1. 45 g/cm 3, a 137 Cs activity of 0. 65 Ci/gal, a 238 Pu activity of 2. 2 E 4 pCi/mL, and contained no visible insoluble solids. The viscosity of supernate samples HTF-E- 03 - 122 and 123 was determined at 25 degrees Celsius, 35 degrees Celsius, and 50 degrees Celsius to be 12. 1 cP, 8. 1 cP, and 5. 1 cP, respectively. An exponential correlation for the Tank 38 H supernate viscosity was formulated for use over this temperature range. In the undrained saltcake sample, several components, including cesium, nitrite, hydroxide, phosphate, formate, and potassium, were partitioned predominantly into the interstitial liquid. Although the plutonium, uranium, neptunium, and strontium activities in the Tank 38 H saltcake core sample are high compared with recent Tank 41 H samples, they are low compared with previous saltcake samples from Tank 38 H collected in July 2000 and July 2001. The 137 Cs of the Tank 38 H saltcake sample is comparable with the previous Tank 38 H saltcake samples...|$|R
40|$|Weather {{and climate}} models {{struggle}} to represent lower tropospheric temperature and moisture profiles and surface fluxes in Arctic winter, {{partly because they}} lack or misrepresent physical processes that are specific to high latitudes. Observations have revealed two preferred states of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the <b>cloudy</b> state, cloud <b>liquid</b> water limits surface radiative cooling, and temperature inversions are weak and elevated. In the radiatively clear state, strong surface radiative cooling leads to the build-up of surface-based temperature inversions. Many large-scale models lack the cloudy state, and some substantially underestimate inversion strength in the clear state. Here, the transformation from a moist to a cold dry air mass is modeled using an idealized Lagrangian perspective. The trajectory includes both boundary layer states, and the single-column experiment is the first Lagrangian Arctic air formation experiment (Larcform 1) organized within GEWEX GASS (Global atmospheric system studies). The intercomparison reproduces the typical biases of large-scale models: some models lack the cloudy state of the boundary layer due to the representation of mixed-phase microphysics or to the interaction between micro- and macrophysics. In some models, high emissivities of ice clouds {{or the lack of}} an insulating snow layer prevent the build-up of surface-based inversions in the radiatively clear state. Models substantially disagree on the amount of cloud liquid water in the cloudy state and on turbulent heat fluxes under clear skies. Observations of air mass transformations including both boundary layer states would allow for a tighter constraint of model behavior. </p...|$|R
30|$|Batik {{industries}} in Indonesia are great contributors of liquid waste originating from the dyeing process. During the production process, about 10 – 15 % of the dye {{will be released}} into the environment and causing environmental pollution [1]. In addition to substances of high color, batik and textile industry waste contain synthetic ingredients poorly soluble or hard to decompose. Coloring process in batik will produce <b>cloudy</b> and dark <b>liquid</b> waste. Usually the color of liquid waste depends on the dye used [2]. Actually, dye compounds in aquatic environments can decompose naturally {{by the presence of}} sunlight. However, the reaction is relatively slow because the intensity of UV light reaching the earth surface is relatively low. In addition, the energy needs of the world prompted many researchers to pursue alternative renewable energy such as DSSC. DSSC is promising renewable energy resource because of zero waste, low cost and eco-friendly [3, 4, 5]. DSSC is a solar cell that utilizes a sensitized dye to harvest sunlight [6]. The dye plays important role to harvest solar energy and convert it to electrical energy [7, 8]. The effort to combine the dye wastes as a dye sensitizer on DSSC is a novel solution to overcome the problem of waste and energy at once. In this research, dye wastes from batik home {{industries in}} Indonesia (congo red, rhodamine B, methyl orange, naphthol blue black) are applied as dye sensitizer on DSSC. Thin layer titanium dioxide is used as semiconductor and prepared in various synthesis methods. KI 3 is used as electrolyte and graphite as counter electrode. FTO glass is used in the body of DSSC cell.|$|R
