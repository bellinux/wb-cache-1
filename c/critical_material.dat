40|$|Raw {{material}} criticality {{studies are}} receiving increasing attention because {{an increasing number}} of elements of great economic importance, performing essential functions face high supply risks. Scarcity of key materials is a potential barrier to large-scale deployment of sustainable energy and clean-tech technologies as resorting to several <b>critical</b> <b>materials.</b> As physical scarcity and geopolitical issues may present a barrier to the supply of critical metals, recycling is regarded as a possible solution to substitute primary resources for securing the long-term supply of critical metals. In this paper, the main drivers and constraints for <b>critical</b> <b>materials</b> recycling are analyzed from literature, considering indium as a case study of <b>critical</b> <b>materials.</b> This literature review shows that waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) could be a future source of critical metals; however, the reduction of dissipation of <b>critical</b> <b>materials</b> should have much higher priority. It is put forward that more attention should be paid to sustainable management of <b>critical</b> <b>materials,</b> especially improved practices at the waste management stage. This calls for not only more efficient WEEE recycling technologies, but also revising priorities in recycling strategies...|$|R

30|$|A general {{disadvantage}} of the MRIO approach {{when applied to}} <b>critical</b> <b>materials</b> is that tracing <b>critical</b> <b>materials</b> through IO tables requires gross assumptions about homogenous product mixes, as the aggregation level of I/O is usually so high {{that it does not}} allow to distinguish specific critical metals from the bulk of nonferrous metals. The source of product inhomogeneity is twofold. First, final products cover a very wide spectrum of devices, which are aggregated into a few sectors. EXIOBASE 2, for example, contains only nine types of manufactured goods (Wood et al. 2014). Second, the <b>critical</b> <b>materials</b> are commonly aggregated together into the non-ferrous metal sector, or to even higher levels. Disaggregation of individual metal sectors in IO tables, as shown by Hawkins et al. (2007), Nakamura et al. (2008), Nakajima et al. (2013), Ohno et al. (2014), has been done at the country level, but requires very detailed data that are usually not available for critical metals on the global scale. Moreover, MRIO tables represent one-year snapshots of the world economy or short historic time series only, and there is no standard procedure for how to extrapolate these tables into the future.|$|R
