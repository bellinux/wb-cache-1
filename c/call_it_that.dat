500|$|Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson {{spent the}} summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to {{complete}} the band's new line-up. A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, {{or whatever you want}} to <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult." ...|$|E

[...] Tolle has mentioned texts such as the Tao Te Ching, the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu scriptures, the Buddhist scriptures, the Old Testament, the New Testament, and A Course in Miracles; he has mentioned various individuals such as Zoroaster, Lao Tzu, Mahavira, Gautama Buddha, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Jesus, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Rumi, Meister Eckhart, Hafiz, Rinzai Gigen, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Gustav Jung; and he has emphasized the mystical schools within religions such as Gnosticism in Christianity, Sufism in Islam, Hasidism and Kabbala in Judaism, Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism, and Zen and Dzogchen in Buddhism.|$|E

500|$|In the {{subsequent}} decade, two pioneers {{of the style}} became increasingly commercially viable. According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, if you want to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that,</b> as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

It appears Merck knew about the potential criticism they would face; an internal email suggested: [...] "It may be a seeding study, but let's not <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> in our internal documents". The 2003 study was originally published in the Annals of Internal Medicine but was strongly criticized for its deception by the journal's editors in a 2008 editorial, calling for greater responsibility in academia to end the practice of [...] "marketing in the guise of science".|$|E

2500|$|Early {{reviews for}} The Tree of Life at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival were polarized. After being met with both boos and applause at its premiere at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, the film {{received}} mixed early reviews. The film {{went on to}} be awarded the prestigious Palme d'Or. Two of the film's producers, Bill Pohlad and Sarah Green, accepted the prize {{on behalf of the}} reclusive Malick. The Tree of Life is the first American film to win the Palme d'Or since Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004. The head of the jury, Robert De Niro, said it was difficult to choose a winner, but The Tree of Life [...] "ultimately fit the bill". De Niro explained, [...] "It had the size, the importance, the intention, whatever you want to <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> seemed to fit the prize." ...|$|E
2500|$|Merrily We Roll Along (1981), {{with a book}} by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more {{traditional}} scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed? I'm not sure I would put it like that. What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community – if you can <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that,</b> though I guess I will {{for lack of a better}} word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the principality, Maroto took charge of an army of less than 11,000 men, whose instruction, if one may <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that,</b> left much to be desired. On September 7, Maroto began the siege of Prats de Lluçanès, which {{he was forced to}} abandon owing to the defeat of the forces that tried to prevent the arrival of a column of assistance. He did not allow himself to be discouraged by this and dedicated the following days to instructing the battalions under his orders, [...] "and established in them such rigorous discipline in eight days… that one would not have seen better in the vanguard division formed later by the Count of Spain'". However, on October 4 his second in command, the Baron of Ortafá was defeated and he died in San Quirico in an action whose result was attributed by the Catalans to his not having been assisted in a timely manner by Maroto.|$|E

2500|$|In early January 2013, {{the band}} {{announced}} that their fifth album {{would be released}} later in the year, and labelled the album The Chase. Fans assumed their fifth album would be titled this, however, the band later {{announced that it was}} only a [...] "working title" [...] and the new album does not have a name. Healy said: [...] That's the working title, it's not the actual one. I think with the whole Chasing The Saturdays and chasing success, we'll <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> for now. But it's not the definite title. We'll have another single and then the album. We've finished it though. The official artwork for the album was released on 4 September 2013, as well as the official title, Living for the Weekend. The album artwork features all five members of the band, before Rochelle Humes and Frankie Sandford's pregnancies. Healy explained that the title of the album came from the band's name The Saturdays. She explained by saying everybody [...] "lives for the weekend" [...] and the band's name is in the weekend, which made the title even more relevant.|$|E
2500|$|At age seven, William {{reportedly}} {{told his mother}} {{that he wanted to}} be a police officer when he was older so that he might be able to protect her; a statement to which his brother Harry responded: [...] "Oh, no you can't. You've got to be King." [...] William's first public appearance was on 1 March 1991 (Saint David's Day), during an official visit of his parents to Cardiff, Wales. After arriving by aeroplane, William was taken to Llandaff Cathedral where he signed the visitors' book, thereby demonstrating that he was left-handed. On 3 June 1991, William was admitted to Royal Berkshire Hospital after being accidentally hit on the side of the forehead by a fellow student wielding a golf club. He did not lose consciousness, but suffered a depressed fracture of the skull and was operated on at Great Ormond Street Hospital, resulting in a permanent scar. In a 2009 interview, he dubbed this scar a [...] "Harry Potter scar". He was reported to have said, [...] "I <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> because it glows sometimes and some people notice it—other times they don't notice it at all".|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "War Pigs" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be called [...] "Walpurgis". It was then changed to [...] "War Pigs", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that {{the song of the}} same name had potential as a single. [...] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: [...] "I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' you know, the Satanic version of Christmas write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that.</b> Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, [...] "It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked {{to put a lot of}} topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although polling day was 5 July, {{the results}} of the 1945 {{election}} did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect the votes of those serving overseas. Clementine, who together with his daughter Mary had been at the count at Churchill's constituency in Essex (although unopposed by the major parties, Churchill had been returned with a much-reduced majority against an independent candidate) returned to meet her husband for lunch. To her suggestion that election defeat might be [...] "a blessing in disguise" [...] he retorted that [...] "at the moment it seems very effectively disguised". That afternoon Churchill's doctor Lord Moran (so he later recorded in his book The Struggle for Survival) commiserated with him on the [...] "ingratitude" [...] of the British public, to which Churchill replied [...] "I wouldn't <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that.</b> They have had a very hard time". Having lost the election, despite enjoying much support amongst the British population, he resigned as Prime Minister that evening, this time handing over to a Labour Government. Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace. Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.|$|E
2500|$|A {{critical}} backlash began {{over the}} repetitive {{nature of his}} lyrics, his clean-cut image, and his perceived over-reliance on sampling others' entire hooks for {{the basis of his}} singles—criticisms also directed to his contemporary, Vanilla Ice. He was mocked in music videos by 3rd Bass (including a rap battle with MC Serch), The D.O.C., DJ Debranz, and Ice Cube. Oakland hip-hop group Digital Underground criticized him in the CD insert of their Sex Packets album by placing Hammer's picture in it and referring to him as an unknown derelict. Q Tip criticized him in [...] "Check the Rhyme," [...] asking, [...] "What you say Hammer? Proper. Rap is not pop, if you <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> then stop." [...] LL Cool J dissed him in [...] "To tha Break of Dawn" [...] (from the Mama Said Knock You Out album), calling Hammer an [...] "amateur, swinging a Hammer from a bodybag ," [...] and saying, [...] "My old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap.", though this could have been seen as a response to Hammer calling him out in [...] "Let's Get it Started", when he was mentioned along with Run DMC and Doug E Fresh as rappers that Hammer claimed to be better than. (LL Cool J would later compliment and commend Hammer's abilities/talents on VH-1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop, which aired in 2008). However, Ice-T came to his defense on his 1991 album O.G. Original Gangster: [...] "A special shout out to my man M.C. Hammer: a lot of people dis you, man, but they just jealous." [...] Ice-T later explained that he had nothing against people who were pop-rap from the start, as Hammer had been, but only against emcees who switch from being hardcore or dirty to being pop-rap so that they can sell more records.|$|E
