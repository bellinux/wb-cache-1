40|$|Introduction: Amyloidosis {{is related}} to the {{extracellular}} deposition in various tissues of an amorphous amyloid substance. Isolated laryngeal localization is very rare. Observation: We report a case of localized laryngeal amyloidosis discovered during an isolated chronic dysphonia in a 45 -year-old man, with no medical history, with no alcohol or tobacco intoxication. The histological and immunohistochemical study and further examinations confirmed the diagnosis of localized laryngeal amyloidosis without systemic location. The patient had a slight postoperative hoarseness that subsequently disappeared through speech therapy. Discussion: The larynx remains a rare localization of amyloidosis. It is {{the most common form of}} amyloidosis of the upper aero digestive tract. <b>Circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery</b> of laryngeal amyloidosis are dominated by hoarseness. Laryngoscopy may falsely suggest a neoplastic disease. Diagnosis is based upon histological examination with Congo red staining where amyloid deposits appear birefringent under polarized light. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment of symptomatic laryngeal amyloidosis. The survival of patients with laryngeal amyloidosis often exceeds ten years. Conclusion: Laryngeal amyloidosis is essentially a local clinical form whose main symptom is dysphonia. The treatment is usually based on local endoscopic procedures but may require a laryngectomy in advanced forms, associated with colchicine. The prognosis is much better than systemic forms...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to devaluate the risk of renal cancer in patients with atypical renal cysts and to compare radiological data used to establish the Bosniak classification with clinical or histological data. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We performed a retrospective study on 37 patients managed in our establishment for atypical renal cyst between January 1995 and April 2003. The following criteria were analysed: gender, age, clinical examination and <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery</b> imaging findings, Bosniak classification, treatment modalities and follow-up data. These criteria were compared in two populations according to the presence or absence of associated renal cancer. RESULTS: In this series, 6 patients presented a stage II cyst. No cancer was demonstrated in this group of cysts. Ten patients presented a stage IIF cyst and 2 cancers were detected in this group (i. e. 20 %). Fourteen patients presented a stage III cyst, with a cancer in 4 cases (30 %) and 7 patients presented a stage IV cyst with 6 cancers (86 %). CONCLUSION: The Bosniak classification is currently the reference classification fr the diagnosis of cystic diseases of the kidney. Although stages I and II (cysts with minor changes not requiring surveillance) and stages III and IV (suspicious malignant cysts which require surgical exploration) raise few diagnostic problems, stage IIF (indeterminate cyst requiring radiological surveillance) may be the source of diagnostic difficulties with a risk of missing an associated renal cancer...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Phaeochromocytoma {{is a rare}} tumour of the chromaffin cells, the {{diagnosis}} of {{which is based on}} an assay of metanephrines and treatment is surgical excision of the tumour. It is usually discovered due to a rich and varied symptomatology or classic paroxysmal hypertension. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to specify the exact <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery</b> of the phaeochromocytomas operated on in our university hospital between 1990 and 2002. Design and methods: Forty-one consecutive and complete case reports of patients who had surgery for phaeochromocytoma were analysed retrospectively. This series includes 10 patients with a genetic disorder predisposing to phaeochromocytoma. Results: The association of headaches and palpitations with sweating was found in only 24 % of cases (10 / 41). Blood pressure anomalies led to the discovery of phaeochromocytoma in only 51 % of cases (21 / 41) and 59 % (24 / 41) of all the patients suffered from hypertension. In almost half the cases (20 / 41), the tumour was discovered by an imaging method (ultrasonography, CT scan or MRI) which had been performed for reasons unrelated to a blood pressure abnormality. Conclusions: Phaeochromocytoma, the symptoms of which are not very specific and during which hypertension is present in only half the patients, is a disease that remains rare. Its incidence could be increasing because of changes in the method of detection. Indeed, in our study, different imaging techniques led to its incidental discovery in half of the cases.

40|$|AbstractAimsInsertion of {{a foreign}} body in the nasal cavity is a very common {{incident}} in children. It is easily diagnosed, but the type of foreign body varies and extraction can sometimes be difficult, with risk of complications. The present study reports nasal foreign bodies seen in emergency in our ENT department, with {{an update on the}} state of knowledge. Materials and methodsA prospective study between May and August 2011 included all patients admitted to the ENT emergency unit for nasal foreign body. Data comprised age, gender, <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery,</b> symptoms, type of foreign body, extraction method and complications. ResultsTwo hundred and sixty cases of nasal foreign body were included, representing 4. 3 % of all consultations in the unit. Mean age was 3 years (range: 1 – 16 years); the sex ratio was 1. 4 (male predominance). The incident was reported by a family member or the actual child in 76. 9 % of cases (n= 199), or discovered following nasal symptoms in 23. 1 % (n= 61). The main types of foreign body were non-organic synthetic beads in 18. 8 % of cases and vegetable forms in 17. 7 %. Extraction was easy, using forceps, micro-hooks or suction, in 91. 53 % of cases. Complications comprised infection (n= 48), epistaxis (n= 18) and nasal septum perforation (n= 1). ConclusionNasal foreign bodies are a frequent accident in medical practice, especially in young children. They are generally harmless, but may incur complications if overlooked or when a button cell is involved, whence the importance of timely extraction. The best treatment, however, remains prevention...|$|E

In this article, on the basis of palaeographic and epitaphic analysis, as well as valorisation of the text and its content, the author dates the baptistery at the beginning of ninth century. This dating is supported by the fact that the abbreviations, which had been used, were common in the Christian epigraphy from the beginning of ninth century. In those epigraphic records there is no trace of infl uence of minuscule scripture, which appearedduring the ninth century. Moreover, tracing historical records and archaeological investigations, which are presented in the literature, the author places the baptistery within the cathedral complex of Nin. Author also critically examines new opinions – poorly proved - which suggest that the baptistery with the name of prince Višeslav originates from Venice and did not leave its place until the twentieth century...|$|E
30|$|In general, {{two main}} {{perspectives}} that are combined {{in the discussion}} on technoscience can be seen. One perspective emphasises social aspects within the production of knowledge, such as power, domination, the role of specific actors, and profit; the other emphasises epistemic and more general aspects such as the convergence of science and technology, of representing and intervening, of understanding and performing, and of the natural and the artificial. I think that these different perspectives are related to different analytical approaches: the philosophical tradition of epistemology and the social perspective on technology (Weingart 2003, p. 41). One can argue that {{the latter is a}} further development of the former, but it seems to be that both approaches co-exist and have developed their own perspective (Greif 2002). “Philosophers care about justification, logic, reason, soundness and methodology. The historical <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery</b> the psychological quirks, the social interactions and the economic milieux are no professional concern of Popper or Carnap.” (Hacking 2008 [1983], p. 6). On the other hand, as Weingart (2003, p. 82) pointed out, some social scientists reduce the production of knowledge merely to a process of social construction (see also Knorr Cetina 2007, p. 333). Following the discussion on technoscience of nanotechnology (e.g. Nordmann 2005; Fogelberg and Glimell 2003; Bensaude-Vincent 2004; Weber 2010 b; Kastenhofer 2009), I had the impression that the blending of these different approaches leads to confusion within the argumentations. Notions such as pure science, disinterestedness and intervention have different meanings regarding the different analytical frames (philosophy vs. sociology), see subsection on “Purification”. Apart from these different approaches, I observe a further reason for confusion. Results that have been gained from the analysis of certain “technosciences” (e.g. life science, robotics) are often directly transferred to other technologies or scientific fields, such as physics, chemistry, or nanotechnology. But different fields have different “epistemic cultures” (Knorr-Cetina), especially concerning aspects of technoscience such as the “molecularisation of life” and the “blurring of the boundaries between the human and the artificial and between body and mind” (Weber 2010 b, p. 26, 19); it is questionable whether these aspects could be observed in physics {{in the same manner as}} they can in life sciences.|$|E

Datirajući ovaj željezni alat u X. ili XII. stoljeće, pokušati će se razjasniti njegovo podrijetlo, način dospijeća pod more te njegova pripadnost. I {{will use}} the {{opportunity}} in the fourth number of the Archaeologia Adriatica journal which is dedicated to my friend and colleague J. Belošević {{to pay attention to}} the finds which were found at the sea bottom as a consequence of various shipwrecks or as discarded or lost objects in the Early Middle Ages period when Croatian state developed and existed. Monuments from this period belong to rich scope of the study and research of my colleague J. Belošević. In this case by underwater finds I refer to a specific category of monuments that I have already written about, and which can be dated to the mentioned period on the basis of analogies. Namely these are amphorae which exhibit considerable differences regarding their size, i. e. capacity from the earlier types dated from the 5 th to 7 th centuries. These Byzantine amphorae, as they are usually referred to, have characteristic massive handles which are usually higher than the vessel 2 ̆ 7 s opening whereas base of the amphora is oval in shape, without pointed end characteristic of the earlier amphorae. Forms are usually piriform or ovoid, and their height usually does not exceed 40 cm. Remains of a shipwreck with amphorae of this type were discovered near the island of Mljet in the mid- 1970 s and the site had already been devastated. I discovered another site with the remains of the Byzantine amphorae and some other objects in the sea in front of the Ždrijac site in the vicinity of Nin when I was working as a curator of a regional archaeological collection in Nin in the 1960 s. Byzantine amphorae were also found in 1995 in the Bay of Pijan in Savudrija where rescue underwater archaeological excavations of an important ancient port near Aquileia were undertaken due to building and extending a quay. Great part of the remaining amphorae which I present in this paper are older finds without exact data about the findspot and <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery,</b> such as the upper segment of an amphora from Umag or an oblong amphora with large handles which are significantly higher than its opening from Poreč (presently in the Regional Museum in Poreč). Three almost identical amphorae have piriform bodies and massive handles with a triangular cross-section which are higher than the amphora 2 ̆ 7 s opening. One of them was found near the island of Žut long time ago, presently it is in the Šibenik City Museum, the second was taken out of the sea in a fishing net between the islands of Silba and Olib, and the third one is from the Trogir port. There are several more amphorae corresponding to these finds: upper segment of an amphora from Ždrijac in Nin and two somewhat larger amphorae, one of which was found near the island of Ošljak near Zadar long ago (presently in the Archaeological Museum in Zadar) and the other from the Kovačić collection on the island of Hvar. A larger segment of a smaller oblong amphora of the similar shape was found in the 1970 s near the island of Vela Arta near Murter. An upper segment of an amphora with a distinct neck and opening and large massive handles with triangular cross-section was found in the sea near the cape of Gospa od Gradine in Rogoznica, presently also in the Šibenik City Museum. We also need to mention finds from the port of Hvar found in 1991 and amphorae from the churches of St. Michael in Ston, St. George on the island of Vis and St. Barbara in Trogir. Underwater explorations along the Asia Minor coastline and in the Black Sea brought to light similar examples of amphorae on the basis of which N. Günsenin and Ch. Bakirtzis created a chronology, classifying them into several types dated from the 9 th to 13 th centuries. For an amphora from the collection of the Franciscan Monastery on the island of Krapanj we can find closer analogies, and probably also production centers on Peloponnesus. Without individual analysis of each of our amphorae, we can easily notice difference in the height of the handles which are often higher than the amphora 2 ̆ 7 s opening. Other evident differences include size and forms of amphorae as well as their diversity in relation to amphorae from the same period found in Turkish/Pontic region and the remaing part of the Balkans. These insights about the typological differences between our amphorae and the aforementioned ones in the Asia Minor region open up possibilities for hypothesizing about other, possibly local workshop centers in the area of today 2 ̆ 7 s Albanian littoral or the rest of the eastern Adriatic coast. All together, our coast shows the most impressive picture of maritime trade in the early medieval period on the basis of density of finds of the mentioned amphorae. Trade with glass products was also present in this period along our coast as indicated by the remains of a shipwreck near Cape Stoba on the island of Mljet where a certain amount of glass sets was found together with amphorae. Some of complete glass items found on a shipwreck near Serçe Limani can be related to some finds from the terrestrial sites on the basis of analogies, such as a glass flask from the grave (no. 322) at the great necropolis from Ždrijac in Nin which can be related to the workshop centres of the eastern Mediterranean since similar flask was found on the shipwreck from Serçe Limani in Turkey...|$|E
40|$|Autorica razmatra nalaze oružja i konjaničke opreme na teritoriju Hrvatske i Bosne i Hercegovine u razdoblju od druge polovice 9. do kraja 11. stoljeća, te ukazuju na njihovu moguću povezanost s pojedinim povijesnim događajima i osobama. The {{majority}} of finds, {{listed in the}} catalogue, {{has been known for}} some time and published long ago, partly even chronologically correctly evaluated in specialist and scientific literature. However, it must be stated that these finds have yet not been dealt with as a homogenous group. In this regard, this work will focus in detail on the aforementioned group. The finds mainly consist of equestrian equipment. To a smaller extent, there are also fittings of belt sets and fittings of scabbards of swords and fighting knives. The catalogue also includes eight post-Carolingian swords from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The finds can be classified into three groups: 1 st group – 9 th century 2 nd group – 10 th century 3 rd group – 11 th century Regarding the finds from the first group in the territory of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, it must be especially stated that weapons and equestrian equipment were relatively unknown in the period after Prince Borna’s death until the late 9 th century. The few examples of spurs, listed in the catalogue, derive from mostly unknown <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> <b>discovery.</b> Is the reason for this the weakening of the Frankish influence and hence the stop of supply with items of western provenience, while local production is still nonexistent, or is the small amount of finds only the consequence of insufficient research? Any conclusion at this point would be at the level of speculation. More significant changes are noticeable {{at the turn of the}} 10 th century, when characteristic groups of items with calottes, which are decorated with radially arranged grooves, were discovered at numerous sites. Based on the mentioned finds, the complete equipment of warriors and horsemen can be reconstructed. This specific group is characteristic only for the area of Croatia and Western Bosnia, and the easternmost find derives from Mogorjelo that is located on the right bank of the Neretva River. The distribution map shows that the finds are concentrated in the area of the early mediaeval Croatian Principality (it also includes south-western Bosnia with counties Livno, Pset and Pliva). One find (Mogorjelo) originates from the territory of Pagania (Neretva Principality), whereas two others from north-western Bosnia (Prijedor and Petoševci). If we also add other versions of spurs that can be reliably dated to the 10 th century to these finds, then we get two more sites in the area of the Croatian Principality and one in northwestern Bosnia (Gomjenica near Prijedor). Another important and noticeable point is the fact that the largest number of finds was recorded along the border counties of the Croatian Principality (Proložac and Cista Velika in Imotski County, Podgradina in Livno County and Čipuljić in Pliva County). Also nearby Travnik, located in early mediaeval Bosnia, must be taken into account. Following this geographical line are locations of sites in north-western Bosnia (Gomjenica, Prijedor, Petoševici). Every single mapped site in the area of the Croatian Principality is an important location that is linked to the Croatian ruling class. This is additionally confirmed by royal inscriptions and other archaeological finds that derive from there (Knin, Kapitul, Biskupija-Crkvina, Bribirska glavica and surroundings, Muć Gornji, surrounding area of Klis and Solin). The distribution map also shows that finds of spurs, belt sets and fittings from the 10 th century are most numerous along the eastern border of the Croatian Principality, but non-existent in the area west of Knin and Bribir. This fact can be linked to the wars that the Croatian ruler Tomislav led against Hungarians and Bulgarians in the first half of the 10 th century. Finds of spurs on graveyards in north-western Bosnia are evidence of Croatia’s expansion to the north during the reign of Tomislav. In the early 11 th century new types of spurs occur that have branch endings in shape of a double loophole. Those spurs already show recognizable elements that would become characteristic for spurs throughout this entire century, and even later in the 12 th and 13 th century. The map of distribution shows the highest concentration right on the territory of Croatia and the Neretva Principality. Within the context of historical events in the second half of the 11 th century, the find discovered in grave 4 next to the Basilica of Saint Peter and Moses in Solin is very interesting. The first historical document about the church is the deed of donation of King Petar Krešimir from 1069. The basilica in Solin is also the historical place of Zvonimir’s coronation as king of Dalmatia and Croatia in 1075. The church is an early Romanesque building that was built around the mid- 11 th century. Archaeological excavations conducted along the southern church wall revealed six early mediaeval graves. One of them was grave 4 that contained the find of spurs and a Byzantine encolpion. The burials there date to the second half of the 11 th century, i. e. after the church’s construction, which is also confirmed by the earlier mentioned grave finds. It is the time during which Croatia was ruled by Petar Krešimir and Zvonimir. To this period refers the in historical and archaeological literature thoroughly examined and controversial legend about the violent death of Zvonimir and, in this regard, the call for crusade. Surely, the finds from grave 4 cannot give answer to these major questions, but truly testify to the spirit of this time. The spurs belong to the type that appears on the eve of the First Crusade. If we also consider all other finds of spurs from the 11 th century, it must be stated that Croatia had certainly had a large army that could have gathered somewhere in the east for the military campaign. Interesting in this regard is also the appearance of reliquary crosses in graves with spurs and other weapons from the 11 th century. The presence of pectoral crosses- encolpia is linked to the phenomenon of pilgrimage to holy places with evangelical events. They appear in large numbers along the pilgrim and crusade routes towards Constantinople. Their occurrence in Western Europe is related- at the turn of the second millennium- to the apocalyptic prophecies of the imminent end of the world. Waves of pilgrims from the west headed to the Holy Land by land routes through Hungary and the Balkan Peninsula and further by land or sea to Jerusalem. Even the oldest reliably dated finds of Byzantine crosses in Croatia from Putalj and Ležajića Glavica in Đevrske originate from the first half of the 11 th century. Constant attacks on pilgrims resulted eventually in the convening of the First Crusade to liberate the Holy Land. The presence of reliquary crosses in graves with spurs and weapons from the second half of the 11 th century certainly indicates to the possibility that soldiers brought them during the campaign towards the east. There is also, of course, the other possibility that they were souvenirs of pilgrims. Finally, regarding the legend on the murder of King Zvonimir, the respective archaeological finds are evidence that Croatia could have had a larger military land force by the end of the 11 th century (remember that horsemenwearers of spurs usually belonged to the higher, noble classes) and that King Zvonimir could have convened and called them to some military campaign towards the east...|$|E

However; {{except for a few}} cases, in general, little attempt has been made to correlate the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> the <b>discoveries</b> <b>of</b> the isotopes of individual elements. In this article attention is drawn to the work of pioneering scientists who in a comparatively short period of creativity discovered the majorip of the isotopes of platinum. There are thtrty-seven known isotopes of plat-inum and six of these occur naturally with the authorised isotopic abundances stated below (9) ...|$|R

5000|$|The two flagons and two stamnoi were {{apparently}} found in 1927 {{during the course}} of railway construction in the town of Basse Yutz, Moselle, eastern France. The excavators had probably discovered the grave of an important Celtic dignitary from the local Iron Age. Unfortunately little is known <b>of</b> the local <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> their <b>discovery,</b> as the grave was dug illicitly without the help of trained archeologists. [...] Within two years <b>of</b> the <b>discovery,</b> all four objects were sold to the British Museum. They were bought for £5,000 which was a substantial sum, especially as many thought they were too sophisticated to be genuine.|$|R

Information is presented on the <b>circumstances</b> <b>of</b> the <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> some fossil sites in Southern Africa. A number of fossil sites, some of which {{can no longer be}} studied, are photographically recorded. Some recorded sites were relocated, while failure to locate others is noted. The assemblages at selected fossil sites are compiled, including some additions to their floras and faunas. Certain individual fossils are illustrated and discussed. Techniques which are not standard are outlined...|$|R
