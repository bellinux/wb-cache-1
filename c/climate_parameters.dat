Increased climate variability indicates that stream flow of all rivers will be smaller in magnitude, with flow rates becoming more unpredictable, especially in rivers with many dams, such as the South Saskatchewan River. This means that reservoir management, especially of Lake Diefenbaker, will become more difficult because baseline data will not be available for the specific <b>climate</b> <b>parameters.</b> Cumulatively, the changes to Saskatchewan's wetlands and water resources will have significant impacts of native flora and fauna.|$|E

50|$|In {{recent decades}} most {{countries}} have been experiencing huge industrial progress. Urban and industrial areas in South Korea also had fast development from 1960s to 1980s. Industrialization {{and the increase in}} population have produced various pollutants and greenhouse gases, which are anthropogenic factors for climate change. South Korea is experiencing changes in <b>climate</b> <b>parameters,</b> including annual temperature, rainfall amounts, and precipitation. The most distinct climate change predicted for South Korea is an increase in the range of temperature fluctuation throughout the four seasons. The number of record minimum temperature days has decreased rapidly, and maximum precipitation during the summer has increased. Ongoing global climate change has produced local climate changes and extreme weather that affects: social, economy, industry, culture, and many other sectors. The increased possibility for new types of strong weather damage evokes the seriousness and the urgency of climate change. To quickly adapt to climate change, the South Korean government began an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and is one step closer to having a low-carbon based socio-economic nation.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{progress}} has focused {{not only on}} the speed of the ocean heat uptake but also the spatial pattern of the ocean heat uptake.

The inconstancy of the global climate feedback may be formulated by a single parameter, called ocean heat uptake efficacy. In addition, the dependency of the global <b>climate</b> feedback <b>parameter</b> on the background climate has also been pointed out. The physical mechanisms behind the behavior of the global <b>climate</b> feedback <b>parameter</b> still need to be established. Detailed analysis of the atmosphere-ocean interaction as well as perturbed physics ensemble experiments including the ocean component might be useful for identifying the physical mechanisms (Collins et al. 2006).

40|$|Global {{and local}} climate changes can affect crop yields in the future. Recent {{increase}} of weather related stresses and damages are resulting from {{an increase in}} the frequency of climate hazards. However, agriculture in both developing and developed countries depends highly on climate factors (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation) that act as a main driver of rice production. Nevertheless, the relationship of climate variability and rice production could vary in different regions across the world. Bangladesh is {{perhaps one of the most}} climatic vulnerable countries because of geographical location and large Gnga-Meghna-Brahmuptra river systems. The costal belt of Bangladesh covers 30 % of the total agricultural land in Bangladesh, and plays an important role in the country’s GDP. The close dynamic relationship between climate variability and rice yield could be useful to identify yield losses or gains at different spatial scales. This relationship can have differences in their patterns as well as in magnitude at different spatial and temporal scales. This study consisted of a review of climate change issues for Bangladesh, an analysis of crop yield variations over the years 1990 - 2008 and some preliminary modeling of rice yields with changing <b>climate</b> <b>parameters.</b> Generally, three seasonal rice crops(Aman, Aus and Boro) have been cultivated in the study area. Based on correlation analysis, for the country’s central coastal belt, no or negative relationships have been indentified between <b>climate</b> <b>parameters</b> and yield. Although there are significant uncertainties in the predicted <b>climate</b> <b>parameters,</b> DSSAT 4. 5 crop simulation model is an effective tool to show the potential impacts of predicted climate change on yields. For deriving DSSAT 4. 5 simulation model, <b>climate</b> <b>parameters</b> and management inputs is important to predict yield under the basis of planting period investigation. Model results indicate that as <b>climate</b> <b>parameters</b> like temperature increase, farmers could get lower yields in their cropping systems. Lower yields were estimated for the heavy rainfall period when plants could be washed away plant after planting. A 2 ˚C rise in minimum temperature will lead to a lowering of yields of around 800 to 1000 Kg/hectare in every seasonal rice crops in the study area. As a result, changing <b>climate</b> <b>parameters</b> in the central coastal belt area of Bangladesh could lead to lower yields in every rice season. Any lowering of yields due to climate change is important for the densely populated coastal belt area in Bangladesh as this could result in food insecurity for the region...|$|E
