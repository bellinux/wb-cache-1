There is a delay between the molecule impinging {{on the surface and}} rebounding from it. Kinetic energy will have been lost as the molecules slow down. For example, hydrogen will not condense at 8 kelvin, but it can be cryotrapped. This effectively traps molecules for an extended period and thereby removes them from the vacuum environment just like cryopumping.|$|E

Method development has been performed by means of a standard mixture of 24 PAHs of the series from naphthalene to benzo(ghi) perylene. All compounds including structural isomers have been identified on the basis of spectral differences. Detection limits were established as 250 - 500 picogram per microliter injected on-column. The applicability of the method has been tested on the analysis of sediment, soil and river clay extracts, which had been analysed previously by means of HPLC with fluorescence detection. The presence {{of the majority of the}} PAHs was unequivocally confirmed while previously undetermined PAHs could be identified. Moreover essential additional information was obtained on the identity of two coeluting structural isomers. As such <b>cryotrapping</b> GC-FTIR forms an important additional tool in the analysis of PAHs by means of GC-FID, GC-MSD and HPLC with fluorescense detection. <b>Cryotrapping</b> spectra of PAH appear to be quite similar to conventionally recorded spectra.

This method is used for the analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in both biodiesel (B 100) and biodiesel blend (B 5) samples. The separation of FAME was based on component boiling point in the first dimension and polarity in the second dimension by using a BPX 5 /BP 20 column set to provide a measure of orthogonality in the 2 -D space.

40|$|Three {{different}} approaches to detecting hydrogen in helium streams were assessed: thermal conductivity, atmospheric sampling using a mass spectrometer, and permeation through a palladium/silver membrane. The thermal conductivity detection system utilized an assembly of four cells fitted with filaments wired to make a Wheatstone bridge. Pure helium flowed through two of the cells. Helium containing hydrogen passed through the remaining two cells. The filament temperature, which {{is determined by the}} thermal conductivity of the gas surrounding the filaments, depends on the hydrogen concentration in the helium carrier. In the atmospheric sampling approach, a slip-stream is drawn from the carrier via two differentially pumped orifices and injected into a vacuum system. The vacuum system is fitted with a mass spectrometer tuned to hydrogen. In the permeation approach, the helium stream is passed over a hot palladium/silver (Pd/Ag) membrane.

Of specific interest for research and applied objectives are quantifications of gases like methane, higher hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and pollutants. For these objectives, membrane inlet systems are coupled to optical or solid state sensors as well as mass spectrometers. Besides the gases of interest, large quantities of water vapor are passing through the membrane and are thus introduced into the sensor system. This downgrades the detection limit, affects the ionization efficiency of mass spectrometers, or could cause the condensation of water within infrared sensors. In this study, we describe a novel robust, low-power <b>cryotrap</b> coupled to a membrane inlet system (CT-MIS), which is suitable {{to be used in}} harsh environments, including underwater applications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The orientations {{of three}} methyl bonds of the retinylidene {{chromophore}} of bacteriorhodopsin were investigated in the M photointermediate using deuterium solid-state NMR (2 H NMR).

Purple membranes containing wild-type or mutant D 96 A bacteriorhodopsin were regenerated with retinals specifically deuterated in the methyl groups of either carbon C 1 or C 5 of the â-ionone ring or carbon C 9 of the polyene chain. Oriented hydrated films were formed by drying concentrated suspensions on glass plates at 86 % relative humidity. The lifetime of the M state was {{increased in the}} wild-type samples by applying a guanidine hydrochloride solution at pH 9. 5 and in the D 96 A sample by raising the pH. 2 H NMR experiments were performed on the dark-adapted ground state (a 2 : 1 mixture of 13 -cis, 15 -syn and all-trans, 15 -anti chromophores), the <b>cryotrapped</b> light-adapted state (all-trans, 15 -anti), and the <b>cryotrapped</b> M intermediate (13 -cis, 15 -anti) at- 50 °C.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} that allows fast target analysis in multidimensional gas chromatography {{by using a}} microswitching valve between two GC columns, with cryogenic trapping and rapid re-injection of trapped solutes in the second dimension. The essence of the procedure is that heart-cut fractions from the first column (1 D) can be selectively transferred to column 2 (2 D), where a moveable cryogenic trap first focuses the transferred solute(s) {{at the head of}} the second column and then permits their facile rapid analysis on 2 D. Since 2 D is a short narrow-bore column, which exhibits very fast analysis (on the order of a few seconds elution), peak responses (heights) are significantly enhanced (by up to 40 -fold). Additionally, by using a 2 D phase of a selectivity different from that used for 1 D, it is possible to also separate components that are not resolved on the first column and to increase the resolution for other compounds. The heart-cut valve isolates the section(s) of solutes of interest from the first column separation, and this provides a considerable simplification to the chromatogramin addition to the separation and sensitivity advantages. By using this method, multidimensional gas chromatography with multiple heart-cuts can be completed within the same time as the primary column separation. Since the described method permits non-heart-cut fractions to be transferred to a monitor detector, normal detection of these fractions is still permitted. By modulation of the <b>cryotrap,</b> it is also possible to achieve comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography for the heart-cut fractions; however, only those compounds passed to the second, separation column, which passes through the <b>cryotrap,</b> will be subjected to GC×GC analysis.

40|$|Evaporation is a {{key process}} in water cycle that links liquid water to the atmosphere. In {{the last fifty years}} stable {{isotopes}} of hydrogen and oxygen have been intensively used to describe climate processes related to evaporation and precipitation, ranging in different spatial and temporal scales. Evaporation introduces large isotopic effects in the phases involved. The well known Craig-Gordon model (Craig & Gordon, 1965) describes those isotopic effects involving several steps and different processes, moving from the air-water interface to the free atmosphere. However, very few works in literature have tested the vertical behavior of the Craig-Gordon model in natural conditions on both fresh and marine waters. In this work we present the results from four field experiments aimed to describe the vertical variability of δ 18 O and δD in the first few meters over a large water body (the coastal lagoon of Venice, northern Italy) and to test the Craig-Gordon model in such conditions. Each experiment involved <b>cryotrapping</b> of water vapor at different height over the water surface (0. 1 m, 2 m and 4 m) and the sampling of the liquid water at two depth (surface and 0. 5 m). During the experiments, water vapor was also sampled in the nearest mainland (2. 5 km from gradient measurements) to determine the isotopic composition of background water vapor. Liquid samples were then analyzed with a Picarro L 1102 -i and Thermo-Fisher Delta Plus Advantage for water vapor and lagoon water, respectively. The last two experiments have also involved simultaneous measurements of relative humidity using commercially-available humidity probes at each height. This approach was used to determine a reference scale in order to compare observations to modeled estimates. Despite the coarse time resolution due to <b>cryotrapping</b> method (measurements are averaged over 1. 5 hours), preliminary results show measurable differences in the isotopic composition of water vapor along the vertical gradient and good agreement between observations and predicted values from the model.

40|$|The water {{residence}} {{time in the}} atmosphere is approximately nine days, the shortest {{residence time}} in any major reservoir of the whole water cycle on the planet. Nevertheless, water vapor is {{a key factor in}} climate and hydrology due to its dynamic behavior. The isotopic composition of water vapor can highlight several processes of the water cycle that link the water reservoirs to the atmosphere (Galewsky et al., 2016). In the past, the isotopic composition of water vapor was generally inferred from precipitation data, assuming isotopic equilibrium between rain and water vapor. This assumption works well when precipitation is abundant but gives misleading results when precipitation is scarce. A common method to determine the isotopic composition of water vapor is the <b>cryotrapping</b> technique, proposed by Craig et al., (1963). <b>Cryotrapping</b> consists in freezing all the moisture content of the air (to avoid fractionation) and analyze the liquid sample with the regular mass spectrometry technique. This process includes the designing of customized cold traps and usually requires several man-hours due to the long sampling time (2 - 8 hours per sample). With the advent of the laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) technique is now possible to determine the isotopic composition of water vapor with sampling time down to seconds. This novel technique increases our knowledge about the isotopic composition of water vapor and gives a substantial help in our understanding of the water cycle, both on global and local scales. However, the continuous measurement of isotopic composition of water vapor requires a specific method to calibrate the large amount of data resulting as the output of a Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer. This includes the production of vapor with known isotopic composition, determination of the response of the analyzer to different humidity levels and correction of the instrumental drift. In this work, we present a summary of potential calibration techniques for continuous measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapor. The study goes in-depth on the developing of a customized calibration unit for a commercial CRDS analyzer (Picarro L 1102 i). Continuous measurements will be compared to water vapor samples collected with cryotraps and several continuous measurements will be presented highlighting sub-daily processes in the atmospheric boundary layer...|$|E

These photoreceptors are known to reversibly convert between two states in a photoinitiated process that involves a basic E/Z isomerization of the bilin chromophore and, in certain cases, the breakage of a thioether linkage to a conserved cysteine residue in the bulk protein structure. The exact details and timescales of the reactions involved in these photoconversions have not been conclusively shown. The cyanobacteriochrome Tlr 0924 contains phycocyanobilin and phycoviolobilin chromophores, both of which photoconvert between two species: blue-absorbing and green-absorbing, and blue-absorbing and red-absorbing, respectively. Here, we followed the complete green-to-blue photoconversion process of the phycoviolobilin chromophore in the full-length form of Tlr 0924 over timescales ranging from femtoseconds to seconds. Using a combination of time-resolved visible and mid-infrared transient absorption spectroscopy and <b>cryotrapping</b> techniques, we showed that after photoisomerization, which occurs with a lifetime of 3. 6 ps, the phycoviolobilin twists or distorts slightly with a lifetime of 5. 3 μs. The final step, the formation of the thioether linkage with the protein, occurs with a lifetime of 23. 6  ms...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{technologies}} were analyzed for their potential to remove ethylene from the CELSS Biomass Production Chamber (BPC). During crop production (e. g., lettuce, wheat, soybean, potato) in the BPC ethylene can accumulate in the airspace and subsequently affect plant viability. The chief source of ethylene is the plants themselves which reside in plastic trays containing nutrient solution. The main sink for ethylene is chamber leakage. The removal {{technology can be}} employed when deleterious levels (e. g., 50 ppb for potato) of ethylene are exceeded in the BPC and perhaps to optimize the plant growth process once a better understanding is developed {{of the relationship between}} exogenous ethylene concentration and plant growth. The technologies examined were catalytic oxidation, molecular sieve, <b>cryotrapping,</b> permanganate absorption, and UV degradation. Upon analysis, permanganate was chosen as the most suitable method. Experimental data for ethylene removal by permanganate during potato production was analyzed in order to design a system for installation in the BPC air duct. In addition, an analysis of the impact on ethylene concentration in the BPC of integrating the Breadboard Scale Aerobic Bioreactor (BSAB) with the BPC was performed. The result indicates that this unit has no significant effect on the ethylene material balance as a source or sink...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{passage of}} the Clean Air Act with its stricter {{regulation}} of toxic gas emissions, and the ever-growing number of applications which require faster turnaround times between sampling and analysis are two major factors which are helping to drive {{the development of new}} instrument technologies for in-situ, on-line, real-time monitoring. The ion trap, with its small size, excellent sensitivity, and tandem mass spectrometry capability is a rapidly evolving technology which is well-suited for these applications. In this paper, we describe the use of a commercial ion trap instrument for monitoring trace levels of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air. A number of sample introduction devices including a direct transfer line interface, short column GC, and a <b>cryotrapping</b> interface are employed to achieve increasing levels of sensitivity. MS, MS/MS, and MS/MS/MS methods are compared to illustrate trade-offs between sensitivity and selectivity. Filtered Noise Field (FNF) technology is found to be an excellent means for achieving lower detection limits through selective storage of the ion(s) of interest during ionization. Figures of merit including typical sample sizes, detection limits, and response times are provided. The results indicate the potential of these techniques for atmospheric assessments, the High Speed Research Program, and advanced life support monitoring applications for NASA...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} by X-ray crystallographic techniques the cryo-trapped {{states that}} accumulate on controlled illumination {{of the blue}} light photoreceptor, photoactive yellow protein (PYP), at 110 K in both the wild-type species and its E 46 Qmutant. These states are related to those that occur during the chromophore isomerization process in the PYP photocycle at room temper-ature. The structures present in such states were determined at high resolution, 0. 95 – 1. 05. In both wild type andmutant PYP, the <b>cryotrapped</b> state is not composed of a single, quasitransi-tion state structure but rather of a heterogeneous mixture of three species {{in addition to the}} ground state structure. We identify and refine these three photoactivated species under the assumption that the structural changes are limited to simple isomerization events of the chromophore that otherwise retains chemical bonding similar to that in the ground state. The refined chromophore models are essentially identical in the wild type and the E 46 Q mutant, which implies that the early stages of their photocycle mechanisms are the same...|$|R
40|$|A {{capillary}} microtrap {{thermal desorption}} module is developed for near real-time analysis of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) at sub-ppbv levels in air samples. The device allows the direct injection of the thermally desorbed VOCs into a chromatographic column. It does not use a second <b>cryotrap</b> to focalize the adsorbed compounds before entering the separation column so reducing the formation of artifacts. The connection of the microtrap to a GC–MS allows the quantitative determination of VOCs in less than 40 min with detection limits of between 5 and 10 pptv (25 °C and 760 mmHg), which correspond to 19 – 43 ng m− 3, using sampling volumes of 775 cm 3. The microtrap {{is applied to the}} analysis of environmental air contamination in different laboratories of our faculty. The results obtained indicate that most volatile compounds are easily diffused through the air and that they also may contaminate the surrounding areas when the habitual safety precautions (e. g., working under fume hoods) are used during the manipulation of solvents. The application of the microtrap to the analysis of VOCs in breath samples suggest that 2, 5 -dimethylfuran may be a strong indicator of a person's smoking statu...|$|R
40|$|Resveratrol (3, 5, 4 ’-trihydroxystilbene), {{found in}} both grape skin and wines, {{belongs to the}} poly-phenol group and {{has been shown to}} have cancer-preventing properties, boost cardio-protection and {{antioxidant}} activity, inhibition of platelet aggregation and anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, a new method for the trace analysis of trans-resveratrol was developed by using solid phase microextraction with on-fiber silylation derivatization. Multidimensional GC equipped with two columns (a non-polar column and a medium polar column) connected in series, a heart-cut valve and cryogenic focusing capacity and coupled with a mass spectrometric detector with simultaneous scan/SIM mode was employed for the chromatographic separation step which increased separation power allows more accurate quantitative results for trans-resveratrol analysis in the complex matrix-wine. The effects of SPME fiber selection, extraction time as well as extraction temperature were investigated. The optimum conditions of derivatization time and temperature were also studied. Calibration curves for peak area were prepared for the different concentration of extracted cis- and trans-resveratrol. The method detection limit of trans-resveratrol based on SPME on fiber derivatization and multidimensional GC-MS with <b>cryotrap</b> and heart-cut was estimated in this study. The content of total resveratrol of six Iowa red wine samples was determined as well...|$|R
