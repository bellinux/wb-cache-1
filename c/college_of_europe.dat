Spinelli {{is referred}} to as one of the founding fathers of the European Union due to his co-authorship of the Ventotene Manifesto, his founding role in the European federalist movement, his strong influence on the first few decades of post-World War II European integration and, later, his role in re-launching the integration process in the 1980s. By the time of his death, he {{had been a member of}} the European Commission for six years, a member of the European Parliament for ten years right up until his death. The main building of the European Parliament in Brussels is named after him.

5000|$|He was {{a member}} of seven Roman congregations, besides being prefect of the Congregation of Studies and co-president of the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas. He was a man of deep piety and devotion, and a tireless student {{to the end of his}} life.

40|$|Negotiations {{between the}} European Union and the Russian Federation are {{instrumental}} in forging fruitful and balanced {{cooperation between the}} two giants. However, the EU seems to run up against the same stone-walling as the United States did during the Cold War. Soviet negotiation style – perceiving bargaining as 'mobile warfare' – appears to be identical with the Russian mode of 'give and take', while EU negotiators tend to use less distributive and more integrative strategies and tactics. This collision does not make life easy. The EU is therefore well advised {{to try to change}} the context of the relationship whenever possible before entering substantial negotiations with the Russian Federation. Besides the introduction setting out Russian negotiation style in general, this EU Diplomacy Paper offers five case studies which illustrate this style in practice. They were written by students <b>of</b> the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe’s</b> EU International Relations and Diplomacy Studies programme, Marcus Aurelius Promotion 2008 - 2009. Two cases deal with direct negotiations between Russia and the EU (Kaliningrad transit, new bilateral agreement), while two other contributions use negotiations in the field of energy to highlight Russian strategies and tactics (E. ON-Gazprom asset-swap, Shell and Sakhalin-II negotiations), and one essay analyses the Transnistrian conflict...|$|R
5000|$|In 1872 Liversidge {{accepted}} {{the appointment of}} 'Reader in Geology and Assistant in the Laboratory' at the University of Sydney and began his duties there early in 1873. Liversidge became professor of geology and mineralogy in 1874, and in 1876 he published The Minerals of New South Wales, being a reprint of a paper read at the Royal Society of New South Wales in December 1874. A second and enlarged edition appeared in 1882 and a third edition in 1888. Edward Rennie was a pupil {{and the two men}} were in contact until Liversidge's death. In 1878 he visited the leading museums, universities and technical <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe,</b> and in 1880 his Report upon certain Museums for Technology, Science and Art, was published at Sydney. In this same year, Liversidge visited Europe as a trustee of the Australian Museum and his report helped to establish the Industrial, Technological and Sanitary Museum which formed the basis of the present Powerhouse Museum's collection. In 1881 the title of his chair was altered to chemistry and mineralogy, and in 1891 to chemistry only. Liversidge was dean of the faculty of science from its foundation in 1882 until 1904; he also founded the school of mines at the University in 1892.|$|R

50|$|Marischal was {{the second}} of Scotland's post-mediaeval 'civic universities', {{following}} the University of Edinburgh, created without Papal bull and with a more modern structure and a greater resemblance to the Protestant arts <b>colleges</b> <b>of</b> continental <b>Europe.</b> As such, both Edinburgh and Marischal {{came to be known}} as the 'Town Colleges' of their respective cities. The university was founded with the expressed aim of training clergy for the post-Reformation Kirk. It is believed that Keith desired a protestant institution alongside the pre-Reformation King's College, although King's had been Protestant since 1569. It is possible that the founding <b>of</b> another <b>college</b> in nearby Fraserburgh in 1592 was the true cause; its founder Sir Alexander Fraser was a business rival of Marischal.|$|R
