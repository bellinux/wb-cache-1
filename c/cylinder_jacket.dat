40|$|Purpose: The {{main issue}} {{of this paper is}} to present results of {{strength}} and fatigue limit analysis applied to piston type hydraulic cylinders. It will also shows advantages of application of the up-to-date digital chain of engineering analysis within which CAD tools are being used as well as strength and fatigue limit analysis. Design/methodology/approach: Computer analysis of the strength analysis by using Finite Element Method (FEM) and fatigue life analysis by using Fatigue Life Prediction Method (FLP) were carried out. Findings: The most strenuous and at the same time opened to a damage risk cylinder zones were localized. Two construction solution possibilities of fixing the tongue stub with a hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>jacket</b> were analysed. Finally Wöhler fatigue graphs for a different values of operating average pressure and stress concentration factor were presented. Research limitations/implications: Further researches should concentrate on modifications and analysis which will help to recognize the best possible zones of fixing a tongue stub with a hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>jacket</b> in order to find the best configuration of construction kinematic pair. Practical implications: Modern engineering construction analyze require not only standard strength analysis but also calculation of fatigue life. Originality/value: The paper can be useful for person who performs strength analysis with a use of finite element method but has never used digital fatigue life analysis method. It might be also useful for a person interested in recognizing of both methods...|$|E

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to arrange the system to monitor the operational condition by various methods to achieve the safe operation of the engine. Based {{on the idea that}} the information on the engine condition can be obtained from its vibration signal, this paper carries out the experiment of the diesel engine of the actual ship. The vibration was measured for a long time (7800 hours) by means of a vibration sensor on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>jacket.</b> The hand touch can not recognize the time change of the vibration, but the three-dimensional expression of the vibration data through the frequency analysis allows the good understanding of the change of the vibration. The vibration is always changing if the vibration is observed on the long running hours of engine basis even in the stationary operation (engine revolution: 103 rpm) of the diesel engine. We executed the statistical analysis as one method to estimate the condition of engine by the information from the vibration. All the data of vibration was recorded on a normal engine condition, as a result we could not examine on an abnormal engine condition. Thus, the vibration data of low engine revolution (30 rpm) was used as the data of abnormal condition in this analysis. As the result of the analysis, it is found that the abnormal can be recognized from the above-mentioned engine condition.

40|$|In {{the present}} article, a novel gas {{engine-driven}} heat pump (GEHP) which could independently provide heating, cooling, and {{hot water for}} the buildings with its autonomous power supply system was presented, and the cooling performance characteristics of GEHP using mixture refrigerant R 134 a/R 152 a were investigated experimentally.

The experimental results indicated that the cooling capacity, waste heat recovered from <b>cylinder</b> <b>jacket</b> and exhaust gas, gas engine energy consumption, and compressor power increased with the increase of the gas engine speeds and evaporator water inlet flow rate, but changed in a small range with the increase of the evaporator water inlet temperature except cooling capacity. The generator power remained about 4. 90 kW in different operating conditions. Furthermore, the coefficient of performance (COP) and the primary energy ratio (PER) of GEHP also increased with the increase of the evaporator water inlet flow rate and temperature, but decreased with the increase of gas engine speeds.

The solvent was renewed regularly 2 – 3 times during the first 24  h and repeated about once per day for the rest 2  days. After soaking in acetone and before conducting porosity measurement, the samples were placed into a drying oven at 80  °C for 24  h.

40|$|External {{confinement}} in {{the form}} of steel rings, tie bars, spirals and FRP wraps has been widely adopted for strengthening concrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have proved that it can improve the strength, elastic stiffness, ductility and interface bonding of CFST columns. However, in real engineering practise, CFST columns need to be strengthened are usually under pre-compressed axial load. The stress-lagging effect between the CFST columns and external confinement due to pre-loading has not yet been justified. In this paper, external confinement {{in the form}} of circular steel jacket is proposed to improve the uni-axial behaviour of CFST columns with and without pre-compressed axial load. An experimental study, consisting of 5 hollow-steel-tubes and 10 thin-walled CFST columns was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed strengthening scheme. The main parameters were the concrete <b>cylinder</b> strength, <b>jacket</b> spacing and pre-compressed axial load level. Test results revealed that the steel jacket could improve the uni-axial behaviour of CFST columns and the stress-lagging could degrade this beneficial effect. In addition, a theoretical model developed by the authors previously was adopted to predict the uni-axial behaviour of the strengthening columns. Very good agreement has been obtained between the theoretical and experimental results...|$|R

25|$|Watt's next {{improvement}} to the Newcomen {{design was}} {{to seal the}} top of the cylinder and surround the <b>cylinder</b> with a <b>jacket.</b> Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum {{on the other side of}} the piston. The steam supply was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the steam supply was cut at half stroke).

Computed results, such as maximum allowable cylinder pressure, output power, BMEP and BSFC, were validated by experimented data in the diesel engine model.

Fin width had little effect on the pressure drop for the range of widths tested. The pressure drop across the cylinder was nearly halved by increasing the skirt-approach radius from 3 / 4 inch to 1 - 1 / 4 inches, but fillets and a separator plate at the rear of the cylinder had little effect on the pressure drop.
