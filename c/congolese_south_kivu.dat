40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature and}} impacts of two information intervention radio programmes broadcast on Radio Okapi - the radio service of the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A matched randomization technique was used to assign Rwandan Hutus and <b>Congolese</b> autochthons in <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> to listen to {{either of the two}} programmes within their naturalistic contexts for 13 months. At the end of the treatment, participants’ perceptions of barriers to peace; descriptive and prescriptive interventions; victimhood and villainity; opportunities for personal development and civic engagement; and knowledge of repatriation processes were assessed in 16 focus groups across four contexts. The study concludes that international media intervention programmes that provide robust information and a platform for objective analyses within a multiple narrative and participatory framework can enhance greater engagement with nascent democratic reforms, positive perception of long term opportunities for personal development and empathy with the ethnic Other.

2500|$|There are {{essentially}} {{two groups of}} Tutsi in the Congo (DRC). There is the Banyamulenge {{that live in the}} southern tip of <b>South</b> <b>Kivu.</b> They are descendants of migrating Rwandan, Burundian and Tanzanian pastoralists.

Some of these Banyarwanda are descendants of people that lived long before colonial rule in Rutshuru - on what's currently Congolese territory.

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{examines}} {{the nature and}} impacts of two intervention radio programmes broadcast on Radio Okapi - the radio service of the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) managed by Swiss-based Hirondelle Foundation. The programmes, Dialogue Entre Congolais and Gutahuka adopt different ideologies. Dialogue Entre Congolais uses multiple and competing participation frames, involving audiences and opposing discussants to debate a range of topics related to conflicts, governance, justice, human rights etc. Gutahuka {{on the other hand}} targets Rwandan Hutu armed combatants and refugees and seeks to convince them to disarm and voluntarily repatriate to Rwanda. A matched randomization technique was used to assign Rwandan Hutus and <b>Congolese</b> autochthons in <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> to listen to either of the two programmes within their naturalistic contexts for 13 months. Autochthon control groups listened to Gutahuka while Hutu control groups listened to Dialogue. At the end of the treatment, participants' perceptions of barriers to peace; descriptive and prescriptive interventions; victimhood and villianity; opportunities for personal development and civic engagement; and knowledge of repatriation processes were assessed in 16 focus groups across four contexts.) Although Gutahuka was effective in reassuring Hutus already keen on repatriating to Rwanda that help was available, it was less effective in persuading former Hutu armed combatants and refugees to disarm and repatriate. Dialogue listeners on the other hand, across both ethnic networks showed greater knowledge of nascent democratic reforms in the DRC, more positive attitude toward civic engagement and the ethnic Other. The study concludes that media intervention programmes that provide information and a platform for objective analyses within a multiple narrative and participatory framework enhance greater engagement with nascent democratic reforms, positive perception of long term opportunities for personal development and empathy with the ethnic Other than programmes that adopt approaches of strategic or behaviour change communications.

50|$|The {{situation}} in <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> took longer to develop. Once the 1994 refugees arrived, local authorities began appropriating Banyamulenge-owned {{property in the}} valley {{with the support of}} Mbembe. Threatened by both the armed Hutus to the north and a Congolese army appropriating property and land, the Banyamulenge of <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> sought cross-border training and supply of arms from the RPF. As threats proliferated, each Native Authority formed its own militia. Finally, in November 1996, the RPF-backed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), which the Banyamulenge militias joined, crossed the border and dismantled the camps, before continuing on to Kinshasa and overthrowing Mobutu. The ranks of the AFDL were composed in large part by Banyamulenge, who filled most of the administrative positions in <b>South</b> <b>Kivu</b> after the fall of Bukavu.|$|R
