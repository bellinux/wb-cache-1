40|$|Contact {{angles of}} water droplet on as-grown Z, +X, –X, and m faces of {{synthetic}} quartz crystals with growth term of 20 and 48 days, and polished Z, +X, –X, Y, and 45 ˚ <b>cut</b> <b>faces</b> of synthetic quartz crystal were observed. The {{average of the}} contact angles on as-grown Z, +X, and –X faces increased with the growth term, and they were larger than that on polished Z, +X, and –X faces. On the other hand, {{the average of the}} contact angles of water on m face decreased with the growth term, and they were smaller than that on polished Y <b>cut</b> <b>face.</b> Growth rate of the faces of synthetic crystals was measured and the order of growth rate was, m < –X < +X < Z. Specific surface free energy (SSFE) was calculated using Neumann’s equation. The SSFE of polished face was in the order of, m < –X < +X < Z, which corresponds to the order of the growth rate. The SSFE was larger for the face with larger growth rate...|$|R
