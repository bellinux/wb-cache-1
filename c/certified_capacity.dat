40|$|One {{approach}} {{to improve the}} trade environment for food staples that has gained considerable momentum and widespread support {{in recent years has}} been to harmonize quality standards across countries and with international ones. Various policy papers on commodity trade in Africa have pointed to the lack of consistency in quality requirements as a non-tariff barrier and called for the harmonization of standards as a prerequisite for improved trade 1. The East African Community has been especially active in pursuing harmonization with international standards in an effort to facilitate trade between Member States and ensure global markets remain open to EAC exporters. Discussions are now underway aimed at extending harmonized standards to COMESA and SADC as part of an agreement to establish a tripartite free trade area between the three regional blocks. Despite the apparent advantages of having a harmonized standards regime, this {{approach to}} trade facilitation can have several important costs. In the first place, compliance with standards may result in new inspection and certification requirements that add to the total costs of trade and undermine competitiveness of food staples. Even where harmonization is intended to eliminate duplicate inspections by the exporting and importing country, this cannot always be achieved due to differences in <b>certifying</b> <b>capacity.</b> There is also a risk of setting standards too high for smallholder farmers to meet, or at a level that consumers do not really require or cannot afford. This note looks at the tradeoffs of different approaches to regional standards management. Despite a widespread perception that standards harmonization is required by the WTO SPS Agreement, other trade facilitation instruments are allowed that can be easier to negotiate and hav...|$|R

To avoid this common fraud, another decree from 1618 specified that the seal was to be applied to the glass bottle itself. In 1621, yet another decree mandated sealing the bottle's mouth with molten lead.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of diabetes {{and a significant}} proportion of unawareness of its risk among the patients indicate the need to include into general prophylactic examinations the standards of medical certification, which would prevent discrimination and ensure public safety. In certifying medical predispositions to work in a person with diabetes mellitus the key issue is to distinguish 2 categories of medical requirements: the higher - related to qualifying workers for jobs demanding psychophysical abilities, which affect the safety of the workers and their environment and the lower - related to qualifying workers for jobs characterized by harmful factors and nuisances, which might {{have a negative effect on}} the course of diabetes. The very fact of having diabetes cannot be the reason for the patient being disqualified and the decision on <b>certifying</b> the <b>capacity</b> to perform a particular job should always be based on an individual health assessment of the patient, taking into account the risk of hypoglycemia, metabolic control, the progression and dynamics of chronic complications, as well as the level of health awareness in patients. The objective assessment of the health status of the patient with diabetes involves the judgment of an attending physician, additionally supported by the consultation of a diabetes specialist to ensure that the patient is able to perform properly the job, requiring psychomotor abilities.

40|$|When {{reinforcement}} {{in concrete}} corrodes, splitting stresses around corroded bars {{may lead to}} cover cracking and even cover spalling, affecting the anchorage. The aim {{of this paper is}} to give an overview on both advanced and practical models for anchorage capacity of corroded reinforcement which have been developed at Chalmers, and to show how these models can be applied in the assessment of existing bridges. The application of the practical model is exemplified in assessment of two bridges built in the 1960 s. The bridges exhibit systematic damage in the form of spalled concrete on the bottom side of the main beams at cast joints where large amounts of reinforcement are spliced. The anchorage length needed to anchor the yield force was calculated from the bond-slip response, using the one-dimensional bond-slip differential equation. The model proved to be easy to use in practical design work. Furthermore, the bridges could be shown to have sufficient capacity, and costly strengthening could be avoided. This work clearly demonstrates the potential to <b>certify</b> sufficient loadcarrying <b>capacity</b> of corroded reinforced concrete structures through improved models...|$|R
40|$|Post-peer-reviewed {{version with}} {{permission}} from SSSDuring the Enlightenment Madrid scientific {{institutions such as the}} Botanical Garden or the Natural History Museum served the demands of court ornament as well as colonial efficiency. They were landmarks of new urbanism and new science. In the XIXth Century engineers and hygienists shifted from empire to the city. The relevance of their know-how was now <b>certified</b> by their <b>capacity</b> to solve the city problems. They had to bring water, design urban expansion and fight epidemics. Once again the sites from which these new actors reformed the city were heterotopias, symbols of the promised metropolis: new monuments both by their architecture and their noble function as scientific institutions. All these local concerns were to be set aside by a new scientific community emerging in Madrid {{in the first decade of}} the XXth century. A group of physicists, chemists and biologists in search of international recognition, formed a new scientific campus on the outskirts of the city. The rationalism of their buildings was the best symbol of the new scientific culture of precision. A change of architectures which also meant a change of cultures. Our aim is to recover a lost sense of the city by placing ourselves at the beginning of the process of urban production. We hope that such a focus will reveal the fundamental role of scientific activity in the definition of the urban spaces. Peer reviewe...|$|R
