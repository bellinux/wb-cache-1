5|$|The {{economy of}} Tripura can be characterised by {{high rate of}} poverty, low capital formation, {{inadequate}} infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resources for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought <b>consistence</b> progress in {{quality of life and}} income of people cutting across all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has been not much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, [...] "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" [...] ("Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche {{rejects the}} idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call [...] "truth" [...] is only [...] "a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms." [...] His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; [...] "truth" [...] {{is nothing more than}} the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and <b>consistence.</b>|$|E

His system had pedagogic qualities {{for the development of}} <b>consistence</b> and strictness in conceptual thought and was hence fit to be [...] "propedeutics of philosophical spirit at us". Albert Bazala, which inherited in 1909 Marković's department, abandons Herbart's system).

This is contrasting to viewpoints of those who stress the disparity in harmfulness among drugs, {{and would like to}} distinguish between occasional drug use and problem drug use. Although harm reductionists also see drug use as undesirable, they hold that the resources would do more good if they were allocated toward helping problem drug users instead of combating all drug users. As an example, research findings from Switzerland indicate that emphasis on problem drug users [...] "seems to have contributed to the image of heroin as unattractive for young people." ...|$|E
2500|$|I. orjenii appears {{somewhat}} intermediate, {{in height}} of stem, colour {{of flowers and}} <b>consistence</b> of spathes. The shape of the tepals is different from I. pseudopallida but {{similar to those of}} I. reichenbachii var. bosniaca. The spathe dries out before or during flowering time, getting white to slightly brownish, sometimes with a violet teint, a diagnostic feature for the whole Pallida series, whereas in I. reichenbachii the spathe is sharpely keeled and stays completely green until flowering period is over. Shape of seed, a character regarded to be of high diagnostic value reveals similarity to those of Iris cengialti and Iris illyrica, both closely related to I. pseudopallida, but striking dissimilarities to the latter, which has compressed seeds. Seeds of I. reichenbachii are described to be similar to those of I. orjenii. Shape and undulation of falls and standards are much more similar to I. reichenbachii, whereas no white flowered individuals from wild population of this species have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|In 1850, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve (1804–1869) stated {{his answer}} to the {{question}} [...] "What is a Classic?" [...] ("Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?"): The idea of a classic implies something that has continuance and <b>consistence,</b> and which produces unity and tradition, fashions and transmits itself, and endures…. A true classic, as I should like to hear it defined, is an author who has enriched the human mind, increased its treasure, and caused it to advance a step; who has discovered some moral and not equivocal truth, or revealed some eternal passion in that heart where all seemed known and discovered; who has expressed his thought, observation, or invention, in no matter what form, only provided it be broad and great, refined and sensible, sane and beautiful in itself; who has spoken to all in his own peculiar style, a style which is found to be also that of the whole world, a style new without neologism, new and old, easily contemporary with all time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{recognition}} {{and the development}} of the San Joaquin soil dates from the turn of the 20th century. [...] Field operations of the United States Soil Survey, now known as the National Cooperative Soil Survey, began in 1899. [...] The San Joaquin soil was initially documented and officially established in 1900 {{as one of the first}} four soil series recognized in California by the survey. [...] All were considered to have agricultural importance. [...] Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other soil series recognized at a later date. [...] Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized soil series within the state. [...] (More than 1,500 soil series are currently recognized in California.) [...] Nearly one-half million acres (2,000km²) of this soil have now been identified and mapped in many counties in California. [...] With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy. [...] Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development. [...] As the science of soil has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive soil characteristics, its reddish soil color and its strongly cemented subsoil hardpan that limits root and water penetration. [...] Aside from the texture and structure of the surface soil, the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the subsoil above the hardpan. [...] The hardpan was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet. [...] The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant clay increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil. [...] The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented hardpan at depths ranging from 20 to 40inches. [...] With these features, plus defined ranges of other surface and subsoil properties such as color, soil texture, structure, <b>consistence,</b> pH, organic matter content, and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, USDA soil taxonomy now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs. [...] The San Joaquin soil was first recognized in the survey of the Fresno Area in 1900.|$|E
2500|$|After {{nearly a}} quarter century, a new face emerged as Eddie McCarter was hired to take Reedy's place. [...] McCarter’s first {{recruiting}} class featured Ryan Cross and Daniel Scott. [...] Both were {{on the list of}} Alabama’s top players. [...] However, academics put a damper in their recruitment. [...] McCarter also brought along Roderick Ollie from UAB. [...] All three were red-shirted their first season. [...] Overall, the roster was made up of mostly new faces and a few holdovers from the Reedy era. [...] The McCarter era began on the road at Stillman where UWA registered an 88-82 win. [...] It became apparent after a while that the season was one of rebuilding. [...] With a lack of team chemistry and other issues, the team finished with a 10-17 mark. [...] The Tigers saw improvement in McCarter’s second season. [...] However, the roster was once again filled with new faces. [...] Cross and fellow redshirt freshman Jacquezz Brown left the team. [...] Ollie, Maurice Naylor, Glenn Miles, and Kevin Johnson left the team as well. [...] The biggest acquisition was Troy native Jason Swanson. [...] Swanson had previously played at nearby Shelton State Community College where he was a two-year starter. The 6'7" [...] forward averaged 16.8 points a game and was also known for his rebounding, which was an area McCarter heavily emphasized. [...] Brian Murphy, the Tigers leading scorer in 2007-2008, suffered a torn ACL before the season and was given a medical redshirt. [...] His injury left McCarter in need of a new go to scorer which he had hoped to find in newcomers Herman Mains, Jamaine Nance, Terrence Benson and Chris Davis. [...] UWA had an up and down start to the season. [...] The team could never find a <b>consistence</b> rhythm. [...] In similar fashion to McCarter’s first year as the coach, the team never developed a strong chemistry, and it strongly showed once again on the court. [...] Despite that, the Tigers finished the regular season 13-13 and clinched their first GSC tournament appearance since the 1997–98 season. The excitement was short lived as Harding eliminated UWA in the opening round. [...] McCarter added nine and returned five for the 2009-2010 campaign. [...] The team also featured three redshirt freshmen. [...] McCarter also once again lost several key players who decided to transfer including Daniel Scott. [...] This year’s squad was noticeably much improved over the two previous teams. [...] However, they never played up to potential. [...] The Tigers carried the momentum and a lead in almost every game they lost but was often defeated after their opponent staged a late rally. [...] Swanson led the team most of the way leading them in almost every category. [...] Newcomers Richard Sirju and Alquan Mendenhall also gave the team a major lift. [...] The season also saw the emergence of redshirt freshman Ryan Fitch. [...] Fitch broke into the starting lineup a couple games into the season. [...] McCarter will likely look to replace Jason Swanson going into the next season. The Tigers concluded this year’s season with a 13–14 record. However, after a loss to Alabama-Huntsville during the season's final game, UWA was eliminated from earning a second straight berth in the GSC tournament. [...] Swanson earned First Team All-GSC honors which occurred for the first team since 2005 when Stan Gill received the honor.|$|E
