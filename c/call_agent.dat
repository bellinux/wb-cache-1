5000|$|One verb {{is used by}} an {{endpoint}} {{to indicate}} to the <b>call</b> <b>agent</b> that it has detected an event for which the <b>call</b> <b>agent</b> had previously requested notification with the RQNT command: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Call</b> <b>Agent</b> uses MGCP to {{tell the}} media gateway which events should be {{reported}} to the <b>Call</b> <b>Agent,</b> how endpoints should be inter-connected, and which signals should be activated on the endpoints.|$|E
50|$|While any {{signaling}} gateway is usually {{on the same}} physical switch as a media gateway, {{there is no such}} need. The <b>Call</b> <b>Agent</b> does not use MGCP to control the Signaling Gateway; rather, SIGTRAN protocols are used to backhaul signaling between the Signaling Gateway and <b>Call</b> <b>Agent.</b>|$|E
50|$|Typically, a {{media gateway}} is {{configured}} {{with a list}} of <b>Call</b> <b>Agents</b> from which it may accept programming (where that list normally comprises only one or two <b>Call</b> <b>Agents).</b>|$|R

50|$|MGCP is a master/slave {{protocol}} {{that allows}} a call control device such as a <b>Call</b> <b>Agent</b> {{to take control of}} a specific port on a media gateway. In MGCP context media gateway controller is referred to as <b>call</b> <b>agent.</b> This has the advantage of centralized gateway administration and provides for largely scalable IP Telephony solutions. The distributed system is composed of a <b>call</b> <b>agent,</b> at least one media gateway (MG) that performs the conversion of media signals between circuits and packets switched networks, and at least one signaling gateway (SG) when connected to the PSTN.|$|E

40|$|Strong {{customer}} {{relationships are}} key to sustaining business success. Call centres, whether outsourced or in sourced, play an increasingly important role in customer relationship management. They are responsible for building rapport with customers, selling services and providing support. At the centre of any call centre are its <b>call</b> <b>agents,</b> who act as the interface between a company and its customers. It is widely acknowledged {{that the role of}} a <b>call</b> centre <b>agent</b> is demanding, which raises the issue of high turnover among <b>call</b> <b>agents.</b> This paper proposes a model that links the mediating role of work engagement between resources and turnover intention. It includes supporting literature for the proposed model in order to contextualize the study...|$|R
50|$|Three verbs {{are used}} by a <b>call</b> <b>agent</b> to manage the {{connection}} between a media gateway.|$|E
50|$|MGCP {{also allows}} the <b>Call</b> <b>Agent</b> to audit {{the current state}} of {{endpoints}} on a media gateway.|$|E
50|$|The {{media gateway}} uses MGCP to report events, such as {{off-hook}} or dialed digits, to the <b>Call</b> <b>Agent.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Wall Street Journal <b>called</b> <b>Agent</b> X an [...] "improbable but high-action thriller." [...] Also saying [...] "This {{light and}} {{fast-moving}} {{version of an}} America-in-peril espionage thriller doesn’t really deal in moral ambiguity and shades of gray." ...|$|R
50|$|Banks {{also provide}} {{telephone}} and mobile banking facilities. Through <b>call</b> <b>agents</b> payments {{can be made}} and {{as the number of}} telephone and mobile subscribers are expected to rise, so is this channel of payment expected to gain popularity.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Call</b> <b>Agent</b> {{takes care}} of {{functions}} such as billing, call routing, signaling, call services and the like, supplying the functional logic to accomplish these telephony meta-tasks. A <b>call</b> <b>agent</b> may control several different media gateways in geographically dispersed areas via a TCP/IP link. It {{is also used to}} control the functions of media gateway, in order to connect with media as well as other interfaces. This procedure is utilized to keep the interfaces clear as crystal for receiving calls from any phone lines.|$|E
50|$|In principle, event {{notifications}} may be sent {{to different}} Call Agents for each endpoint on the gateway (as programmed by the Call Agents, by setting the NotifiedEntity parameter). In practice, however, it is usually desirable that {{at any given moment}} all endpoints on a gateway should be controlled by the same Call Agent; other Call Agents are available only to provide redundancy in the event that the primary <b>Call</b> <b>Agent</b> fails, or loses contact with the media gateway. In the event of such a failure it is the backup Call Agent's responsibility to reprogram the MG so that the gateway comes {{under the control of the}} backup <b>Call</b> <b>Agent.</b> Care is needed in such cases; two Call Agents may know that they have lost contact with one another, but this does not guarantee that they are not both attempting to control the same gateway. The ability to audit the gateway to determine which <b>Call</b> <b>Agent</b> is currently controlling can be used to resolve such conflicts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Call</b> <b>agent</b> {{receives}} the digits dialed by the phone. <b>Call</b> <b>agent</b> identify that to which destination Extension the dialed (called) number belongs to. If number {{does not belong}} to any extension, call-agent checks for which trunk does the dialed number belongs to. After the destination is identified Call-agent sends the information to the destination extension or to the destination Trunk, with Details like calling Party number, Called party number, bandwidth to be used between the devices to send the voice. If the destination is an extension that is registered to the <b>call</b> <b>agent,</b> then the call-agent will instruct the phone instrument to send the ring out of the ring buzzers of the phone and simultaneously instruct the calling phone instrument to play the ringing tone. After the rings are played, and when the destination person answers the phone, Call-agent instructs the phones to send the voice traffic, called as [...] "RTP Voice (Real Time Protocol) Traffic" [...] directly to each other.|$|E
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>Agents</b> all of above {{features}} for all sites under the central controller. A central gateway controller includes both centralized configuration {{and maintenance of}} call control functionality. When new functionality needs to be added, only the controller needs to be updated.|$|R
50|$|MGCP {{assumes that}} the {{multiple}} <b>Call</b> <b>Agents</b> will maintain knowledge of device state among themselves (presumably with an unspecified protocol) or rebuild it if necessary (in the face of catastrophic failure). Its failover features take into account both planned and unplanned outages.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{telecommunications}} system, a <b>call</b> <b>agent</b> is a Media Gateway Controller (MGC) {{when used in}} the context of Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP). It is concerned with the handling of specific services to users. [...] MGCP is a server client protocol developed by Cisco, to make industry standard. MGCP is the only server-client voice communication protocol in existence. Other protocols SIP and H323 are called as peer-to-peer protocols.MGCP being an open standard, anyone can use it and create their own Call Agent; for example [...] "Cisco Call Manager", other type of <b>Call</b> <b>agent</b> Examples are AVAYA IP EPABX, Nortel CS1000E etc., these are not using MGCP or SCCP but some proprietary signalling pattern between the call-agents and End-points.|$|E
50|$|A <b>call</b> <b>Agent</b> {{controls}} the signalling communication between phones, Media gateways like routers on which PRI lines Terminate, ex Cisco 28xx Series Routers (now new versions of Cisco Voice Routers are released 29xx and 39xx), Media Gateways like Analog Extensions (also called as FXS in Cisco devices context like Cisco VG224 and VG248, VG202 and VG204) and Analog Trunks (also called FXO in Cisco Device Context).Call Agent {{is responsible to}} register the end devices like phones and media gateways, which act as dump terminals.After one has dump extension registered to the <b>call</b> <b>agent,</b> when end device phone instrument handset (headphone or speaker) is picked up, the phone sends signal to call-agent and informs that the phone handset has been picked up what to do, <b>Call</b> <b>Agent</b> instructs the phone to give the dial tone. After the user listens to the dial tone, user enters the destination number to which they want to dial. The phone will send each digit immediately that is dialed by user one by one (i.e. the first digit will be sent first to call-agent immediately it is dialed then second and so on).|$|E
50|$|Like MGCP, NCP is {{a device}} control {{protocol}} defining {{the interaction between}} the MGC, also called a <b>call</b> <b>agent,</b> and its media gateways. It is one layer of the PacketCable suite of specifications and relies upon companion protocol specifications to provide complete end-to-end telecommunication functionality.|$|E
40|$|Mobile agent systems {{provide support}} for the {{execution}} of mobile software components, <b>called</b> <b>agents.</b> Agents {{acting on behalf of}} different users can move between execution environments hosted by different organizations. The security implications of this model are evident and these security concerns have been addressed by extending the authentication and access control mechanisms originally conceived for distributed operating systems to mobile agent systems. Other well-known security mechanisms have been neglected. In particular, satisfactory auditing mechanisms have seldom been implemented for mobile agent systems...|$|R
40|$|Student Number : 9910820 A - MA {{research}} report - School of Human and Community Development - Faculty of HumanitiesThe literature review presents {{a discussion of}} the various aspects within organisational climate as it relates to a call centre environment. It also examines past research on the notions of job satisfaction, life satisfaction and self-esteem pertaining to <b>call</b> centre <b>agents.</b> The literature review places particular emphasis on the affect organisational climate has on <b>call</b> centre <b>agents.</b> The present research {{takes the form of a}} quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional, ex-post facto design, on a sample of two-hundred and nineteen (N= 219) <b>call</b> centre <b>agents</b> from four South African call centres. The Job Content Questionnaire was used to measure the organisational climate (Karasek, 1985), Taylor and Bowers (1972) General Satisfaction scale measured <b>call</b> centre <b>agent’s</b> job satisfaction, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) assessed the global cognitive beliefs of <b>call</b> centre <b>agent’s</b> life (Pavot and Diener, 1993), and Rosenberg’s (1989) Self-Esteem Scale was used to measure <b>call</b> centre <b>agent’s</b> self-esteem. Descriptive statistics and correlations were used to analyse the data and answer the research questions. Results from the analytical procedures suggested that <b>call</b> centre <b>agents</b> were given more decision latitude, there was a perception of general social support within the organisation, work roles were clearly defined and self-esteem was not significantly associated to the work environment. Thus, implying that the organisational climate of call centres may not be as bleak as past literature has suggested...|$|R
