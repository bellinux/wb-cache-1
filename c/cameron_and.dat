5|$|Strange Days is a 1995 American {{science fiction}} thriller film {{directed}} by Kathryn Bigelow, written by James <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Jay Cocks, and produced by <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Steven-Charles Jaffe. It stars Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis, and Tom Sizemore. Set {{in the last}} two days of 1999, the film follows the story of a black marketeer of SQUID discs, recordings that allow a user to experience the recorder's memories and physical sensations, as he attempts to uncover the truth behind the murder of a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> his wife, fellow Growing Pains star Chelsea Noble, {{were married}} on July 21, 1991. They now have six children, four {{of whom were}} adopted: Jack (born 1996), Isabella (born 1997), Anna (born 1998), and Luke (born 2000); and two biological: Olivia (born 2001) and James (born 2003).|$|E
5|$|Major {{flooding}} {{was reported}} in Port Arthur and Beaumont. <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Calcasieu Parishes in Louisiana were also devastated with the towns of <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Holly Beach completely wiped out. Offshore oil platforms throughout Rita's path also suffered significant damage, though the refineries of Houston, originally thought to be at risk, escaped {{the brunt of the}} storm. Seven people are confirmed dead from Rita's direct effects, and total damage from the storm is estimated at $10billion, almost entirely in Texas and Louisiana. 55-112 indirect deaths have also been reported, most resulting from incidents during the evacuation of Houston when the storm was predicted to strike the city. Many of the indirect deaths were caused by a single bus fire in the mass exodus.|$|E

60|$|As the {{sun rose}} the mist cleared away, and the two armies stood face to face. The Macdonalds had been granted the post of honour on the Highland right, the line being {{completed}} by the <b>Camerons</b> <b>and</b> Stuarts, Prince Charles with the second line being close behind. The Highlanders uncovered their heads, uttered a short prayer, and then as the pipers blew the signal they rushed forward, each clan in a separate mass, and raising their war cry, the <b>Camerons</b> <b>and</b> Stuarts rushed straight at the cannon on the left.|$|R

5|$|Cameron {{went on to}} star in many films, {{including}} 1987's Like Father Like Son (a body-switch comedy with Dudley Moore), {{which was}} a box office success. His next theatrical film, 1989's Listen to Me, performed poorly at the box office. When Growing Pains ended in 1992, Cameron went on to star in The WB sitcom Kirk which premiered in 1995 and ended two years later. In Kirk, Cameron played Kirk Hartman, a 24-year-old who has to raise his siblings. <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Noble also worked together on Kirk.|$|E

Similar methods have been applied to the 2x3 case, where Jarvis / Russell showed that there are 49 essentially different grids (see also the article by Bailey, <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Connelly), to the 2x4 case, where Russell showed that there are 1,673,187 essentially different grids (verified by Pettersen), and to the 2x5 case where Pettersen showed that there are 4,743,933,602,050,718 essentially different grids (not verified).|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1960s, <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> her {{daughter}} moved to the pueblos of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she developed a friendship with the sculptor John Chamberlain and appeared in his art movie, Thumb Suck, which was never released. It was also while in New Mexico that she suffered a collapsed lung and required hospitalization. Her wider health was poor, as she suffered from chronic bronchitis and emphysema—which were both exacerbated by her chain smoking—while hand tremors prevented her from being able to paint for four years.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Alex making landfall, the Brownsville, Texas National Weather Service {{issued a}} flood {{watch for the}} southernmost region of the state. The storm was {{expected}} to produce heavy rainfall for up to 18hours, which {{had the potential to}} cause significant flooding in poor drainage areas, especially those flooded by Hurricane Dolly in 2008. Officials opened hurricane shelters, and voluntary evacuations were put into place for South Padre Island; at least 1,000 people sought shelter in <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Hidalgo counties.|$|E
5|$|The Broadway {{production}} {{also received}} positive reviews. When it {{opened at the}} Madison Square Theatre, a New York Times reviewer complimented Mansfield for his acting and for overcoming the difficulty of presenting the story's allegorical material onstage. According to a New-York Daily Tribune reviewer, Mansfield gave excellent performances as Jekyll and Hyde despite a few technical production flaws. A Life review praised Sullivan's adaptation, particularly his addition of a love interest for Jekyll, and complimented the performances of Mansfield, <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Harkins.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the London Missionary Society missionaries, whose primary activity was teaching Christian theology and literacy at their newly established schools using the Bible as the principal Malagasy-language text, departed the island. James <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> other key missionaries preferred to leave rather than remain on the island without authorization to proselytize. The last two remaining missionaries chose to continue teaching practical skills {{in the hope that}} the restrictions might loosen, but one year later, after receiving indirect information that the government desired their departure, they shuttered the LMS mission and left Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Avatar, {{marketed as}} James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James <b>Cameron,</b> <b>and</b> {{starring}} Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film {{is set in}} the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi– a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.|$|E

5|$|Development for X-Men {{began as}} far back as 1984 with Orion Pictures. At one point James <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Kathryn Bigelow were in discussions. The film rights went to 20th Century Fox in 1994 and various scripts and film {{treatments}} were commissioned from Andrew Kevin Walker, John Logan, Joss Whedon, and Michael Chabon. Singer signed to direct in 1996, with further rewrites by Ed Solomon, Singer, Tom DeSanto, Christopher McQuarrie and Hayter in which Beast and Nightcrawler were deleted over budget concerns from Fox. X-Men marks the Hollywood debut of actor Hugh Jackman, a last-second choice for Wolverine, cast three weeks into filming. Filming took place from September 22, 1999 to March 3, 2000, primarily in Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Hindman's assassins {{were never}} caught, and many {{theories}} regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly {{confessed to the}} crime, saying the murder {{was part of a}} larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit with the facts of the murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, {{several former}} Chiefs of Defenceincluding General Lord Guthrie, Admiral Lord Boyce, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Craig, Field Marshal Lord Bramall and Field Marshal Lord Ingecriticised Brown for departing from the {{military}} covenanta convention within British politics stating that in exchange for risking their lives {{for the sake of}} national security, members of the armed forces should be suitably looked after by the government. Brown was accused by senior opposition politicians, including Conservative leader David <b>Cameron,</b> <b>and</b> Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats of failing to provide proper support for soldiers and their families.|$|E
5|$|Many of Parsons' {{writings}} were posthumously {{published as}} Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword in 1989, a compilation co-edited by <b>Cameron</b> <b>and</b> O.T.O. leader Hymenaeus Beta (ceremonial name of musician William Breeze), which incited {{a resurgence of}} interest in Parsons within occult and countercultural circles. For example, comic book artist and occultist Alan Moore noted Parsons as a creative influence in a 1998 interview with Clifford Meth. The Cameron-Parsons Foundation was founded as an incorporated company in 2006, {{with the intention of}} conserving and promoting Parsons' writings and Cameron's artwork, and in 2014 Fulger Esoterica published Songs for the Witch Woman—a limited edition book of poems by Parsons with illustrations by Cameron, released to coincide with his centenary. An exhibition of the same name was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.|$|E
