50|$|Chelidonichthys capensis, the <b>Cape</b> <b>Gurnard,</b> is {{a species}} of sea robin native to the Western Indian Ocean where they occur at depths of from 10 - 390 m and in such {{countries}} as Mozambique and Namibia. The species is 75 cm TL in length and lives maximum {{to the age of}} 16. This species is of commercial importance as a food fish.|$|E
40|$|The South African {{demersal}} trawl fishery, as {{with most}} trawl-directed fisheries worldwide, has a substantial bycatch component. With increasing commercial emphasis being placed on retained bycatch, an urgent need has arisen to investigate these species. In the past the bycatch component has received little research or management attention. Members of the gurnard family Triglidae make up up to 2. 4 % of the South African hake-directed demersal catch and are thus considered an important bycatch species. The catch history and biology, including population structure, reproduction, feeding, age, growth and mortality, of the <b>Cape</b> <b>gurnard,</b> Chelidonichthys capensis, sampled from the Agulhas Bank, South Africa, were thus investigated. Males (mean TL = 366 mm) were significantly smaller than females (mean TL = 411 mm). The sex ratio was close to parity, males being more dominant in commercial trawls and less dominant in research trawls. Gonad maturation and gonadosomatic indices showed this species to have an extended spawning period with peaks in reproductive activity during September, January and April. First approximations of size at 50 % maturity were similar for females (349 mm TL) and males (348 mm TL) but differed significantly in terms of age (3. 6 years and 4. 6 years respectively). Otolith growth marks were validated as annuli using marginal zone analysis. The maximum age estimated was 16 years for a female of 675 mm TL and recruitment to the commercial fishery was estimated as {{taking place in the}} fifth year of growth for both males and females. Gut content analysis showed C. capensis to be an opportunistic feeder preying preferentially on the benthic crustaceans Goneplax angulata and Mursia cristimanus. Landings from the commercial linefishery were insignificant whilst those for the commercial trawl fishery ranged from 500 tonnes to 3250 tonnes b~tween 1984 to 1995, and indicated that this species forms {{an important component of the}} South African trawl fishery bycatch. A first approximation of fishing mortality (0. 36 year-I) for the inshore commercial trawl fishery was higher than that of natural mortality (0. 25 year-I) suggesting some fishing pressure on this species on the Agulhas Bank. However this fishing mortality value was significantly less than that for Fo. 1 (4. 78 year-I) that was estimated using a yieldper- recruit model. VIII...|$|E
