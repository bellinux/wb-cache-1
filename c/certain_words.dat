5|$|There are {{numerous}} applications of matrices, both {{in mathematics and}} other sciences. Some of them merely {{take advantage of the}} compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix. For example, in game theory and economics, the payoff matrix encodes the payoff for two players, depending on which out of a given (finite) set of alternatives the players choose. Text mining and automated thesaurus compilation makes use of document-term matrices such as tf-idf to track frequencies of <b>certain</b> <b>words</b> in several documents.|$|E
5|$|In mid-December 1982 {{the author}} and future Holocaust denier David Irving was also {{involved}} in tracking the existence of diaries written by Hitler. Priesack had previously told Irving {{of the existence of}} one of the diaries with a collector in Stuttgart. In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefel's phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary pages from Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack's photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between <b>certain</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Western culture, where <b>certain</b> <b>words</b> {{are never}} {{acceptable}} {{in all but}} the most informal contexts, Tagalog profanity is context-sensitive: words which are considered profane or insulting in one context are often acceptable in another.|$|E
25|$|Prosody in Swedish often varies {{substantially}} {{between different}} dialects including the spoken varieties of Standard Swedish.

25|$|Magical speech is, therefore, {{a ritual}} act, and is of equal or even greater {{importance}} {{to the performance of}} magic than non-verbal acts.

25|$|To avoid {{breaching}} this rule, some {{stations have}} trialed neural networks which {{listen to the}} speech of actors and guests/contestants real time during live performances, and automatically censor <b>certain</b> <b>words.</b> In a paper explaining the system, particular attention was paid by the De La Salle University researchers to censoring potentially insulting words such as gago and ulol.|$|E
25|$|The 16th-century jurist Domnall O'Davoren {{created a}} {{glossary}} {{in which he}} quoted from many other sources. In many cases it is only text that includes certain quotes {{as well as information}} about certain whole law tracts. Its primary focus, however, is to list and define <b>certain</b> <b>words,</b> particularly legal terms, and as such has provided significant help in understanding the oldest laws.|$|E
50|$|Hangul {{spelling}} {{does not}} reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical morphology. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a <b>certain</b> <b>word.</b>|$|R

25|$|Ge'ez distinguishes two genders, {{masculine}} and feminine, which in <b>certain</b> <b>words</b> is {{marked with the}} suffix -t. These are less strongly distinguished than in other Semitic languages, in that many nouns not denoting persons {{can be used in}} either gender: in translated Christian texts there is a tendency for nouns to follow the gender of the noun with a corresponding meaning in Greek.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, unlike Cantonese, Hokkien {{does not}} have a universally {{accepted}} standardized character set. Thus, there is some variation in the characters used to express <b>certain</b> <b>words</b> and characters are can be ambiguous in meaning. In 2007, Taiwan's Ministry of Education formulated and released a standard character set to overcome these difficulties. These standard Chinese characters for writing Taiwanese Hokkien are now taught in schools in Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|Words {{with the}} digraphs ae and oe in British English are usually spelt as such in New Zealand English (e.g. faeces not feces) {{rather than with}} just e as with American English. There are some {{exceptions}} where <b>certain</b> <b>words</b> are becoming universally spelt with e such as encyclopaedia, chamaeleon, hyaena, and homoeopathy which are now spelt encyclopedia, chameleon, hyena, and homeopathy respectively. Coincidentally, this is also occurring in British English in these cases too.|$|E
50|$|Advanced {{context-sensitive}} {{assistance programs}} like EPSS {{should not be}} confused with simple help applications that are usually keyword-triggered. An example for the latter is the well-known, but highly unpopular Clippy. This animated paperclip popped up whenever users typed a <b>certain</b> <b>word</b> or term in Microsoft Office. Clippy was often seen as annoying and removed by Microsoft in 2007. A new generation of virtual assistants, like Microsoft's Cortana uses smarter methods of assessing when and how to offer what help. Help options can appear for instance after a pre-defined time of inaction between two usually connected process-steps, instead of popping up whenever a <b>certain</b> <b>word</b> is typed.|$|R

25|$|In some states, counselors or {{therapists}} must be {{licensed to}} use <b>certain</b> <b>words</b> and titles on self-identification or advertising: {{in some other}} states, the restrictions on practice are more {{closely associated with the}} charging of fees. Licensing and regulation are performed by the various states. Presentation of practice as licensed, but without such a license, is generally illegal. Without a license, for example a practitioner cannot bill insurance companies. Information about state licensure is provided by the American Psychological Association.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with {{anomic aphasia}} have {{difficulty}} with naming. The patients may have difficulties naming <b>certain</b> <b>words,</b> linked by their grammatical type (e.g., difficulty naming verbs and not nouns) or by their semantic category (e.g., difficulty naming words relating to photography but nothing else) or a more general naming difficulty. Patients tend to produce grammatic, yet empty, speech. Auditory comprehension tends to be preserved. Anomic aphasia is the aphasial presentation of tumors in the language zone; it is the aphasial presentation of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|This model {{suggests}} that first language words {{are linked to}} concepts while second language words are linked directly to first language words, not concepts, but the greater proficiency and skill a person has in the second language, the greater the link will be to the actual concepts themselves. This model can also be supported by research done on second language acquisition because when people learn new languages later in life they will learn translation equivalents and learn what <b>certain</b> <b>words</b> mean based on their first language words.|$|E
50|$|An {{associated}} {{concept is}} that of noun-modifier semantic relations, wherein <b>certain</b> <b>word</b> pairings have a standard interpretation. For example, the phrase cold virus is generally understood {{to refer to the}} virus that causes a cold, rather than to a virus that is cold.|$|R
