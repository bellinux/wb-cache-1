50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, push-fit, or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed {{compression fitting}} or quick <b>connect</b> <b>fitting</b> that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for cutting tubing to length and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular compression fittings work, but use a resilient O-ring for sealing, and a grip ring to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the grip ring.|$|E

50|$|Quick <b>connect</b> <b>fittings</b> (push fittings) {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of plumbing, heating, {{electrical}} and fire suppression systems. Quick Fitting, Inc., Warwick Rhode Island has been a prolific inventor of innovations in quick connect technologies. Quick Fitting is the original inventor of quick connect for electrical, fire suppression and plumbing technologies, holding over 20 U.S. and foreign patents on quick connection technology. U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Quick connect works by inserting the tubing into a connection mechanism that deploys fastening teeth onto the tubing surface. When opposing force is applied to the union, the teeth are forced deeper into the tubing, preventing separation of the union. Quick <b>connect</b> <b>fittings</b> offer a significant time saving benefit over traditional technologies and require little skill for their usage. There are a large variety of quick <b>connect</b> <b>fittings</b> in the market and they are found in all industries. They are employed many kilometers underwater, in drilling operations, in orbit, for docking spacecraft, and everywhere in between, for a myriad of reasons.|$|R

40|$|Most {{pieces of}} case {{furniture}} (kitchen and bathroom furniture, cabinets, wardrobes, tables and etc.) {{are made of}} 18  mm thick wood particle boards finished with various coatings. This three-layered constructional material is obtained by bonding wood particles of different fractions with synthetic resins using heating. The exploitation duration and quality of case furniture {{is determined by the}} mechanical properties of wood particle boards and the construction of joints of wood-based panels. On a frequent basis, pieces of case furniture with non-dismantable and dismantable construction are joined by using multidowel glued joints and cam <b>connecting</b> <b>fittings</b> intended for furniture, respectively. Wood-based panels can be joined with mitre joints whose mechanical properties have not undergone testing and comparison with regular joints when applying insertable wooden dowels or furniture <b>connecting</b> <b>fittings.</b> During the testing of particle board properties it was established that joining wood-based panels in this way ensures most efficient use of mechanical characteristics of the particleboard. In addition to the properties of the mitre joint, the tests also allowed determining the bending strength, tensile strength and bonding strength of the constructional material, and providing an original method for testing board properties, which can be successfully applied to the prediction of properties of the mitre joint. Tests were performed by using a universal tensile testing machine P- 0. 5. Joints were bonded by applying PVA dispersion. The surface of boards was veneered by using mahogany veneer and urea formaldehyde resin. It was found that mitre joints of wood particle boards can withstand loads that are higher from 2 to 4 times, in comparison to glued doweled joints or joints constructed with cam <b>connecting</b> <b>fittings.</b> DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} yet challenging {{problem in}} understanding indoor scene is recovering indoor frame structure from a monocular image. It {{is more difficult}} when occlusions and illumination vary, and object boundaries are weak. To overcome these difficulties, a new approach based on line segment refinement with two constraints is proposed. First, the line segments are refined by four consecutive operations, i. e., reclassifying, <b>connecting,</b> <b>fitting,</b> and voting. Specifically, misclassified line segments are revised by the reclassifying operation, some short line segments are joined by the connecting operation, the undetected key line segments are recovered by the fitting operation {{with the help of}} the vanishing points, the line segments converging on the frame are selected by the voting operation. Second, we construct four frame models according to four classes of possible shooting angles of the monocular image, the natures of all frame models are introduced via enforcing the cross ratio and depth constraints. The indoor frame is then constructed by fitting those refined line segments with related frame model under the two constraints, which jointly advance the accuracy of the frame. Experimental results on a collection of over 300 indoor images indicate that our algorithm has the capability of recovering the frame from complex indoor scenes. Comment: 39 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{instrument}} specifications {{given in}} current international (ISO) and national (ASAE) standards state that measured values should be within 90 % {{of the true}} amplitude of vacuum change at the various locations in the milking machine. Recommendations are given for the minimum sampling rate and response rate of instruments used to measure vacuum changes for dry, wet, milking–time, and cleaning–time tests. These minimum performance requirements should ensure that the measurement accuracy stated in the ISO and ASAE standards are met. A simple method was developed to measure the response rate of a vacuum recording system. The method can be used, quickly and easily, by field or laboratory technicians to specify the response rate of their vacuum recording systems. The predominant effects on response rate of vacuum recording systems are caused by the <b>fittings</b> <b>connecting</b> the electronic vacuum recorder to the measurement point. A major source of measurement error was water or milk in <b>connecting</b> tubes and <b>fittings.</b> Dry and wet tests in the milkline and receiver confirmed previous studies showing {{that the rate of}} vacuum change during dry tests or in dry parts of the milking machine are much lower than those in wet parts of the machine.

The safety-of-flight parameters for the ACTE flap experiment require that flap-to-wing interface loads be sensed and monitored in real time {{to ensure that the}} structural load limits of the wing are not exceeded. The attachment <b>fittings</b> <b>connecting</b> the flap to the aircraft wing rear spar were instrumented with strain gages and calibrated using known loads for measuring hinge moment and normal force loads in flight. The safety-of-flight parameters for the ACTE flap experiment require that flap-to-wing interface loads be sensed and monitored in real time to ensure that the structural load limits of the wing are not exceeded. The attachment <b>fittings</b> <b>connecting</b> the flap to the aircraft wing rear spar were instrumented with strain gages and calibrated using known loads for measuring hinge moment and normal force loads in flight. The interface hardware instrumentation layout and load calibration are discussed. Twenty-one applied calibration test load cases were developed for each individual fitting. The 2 -sigma residual errors for the hinge moment was calculated to be 2. 4 percent, and for normal force was calculated to be 7. 3 percent. The hinge moment and normal force generated by the ACTE flap with a hinge point located at 26 -percent wing chord were measured during steady state and symmetric pitch maneuvers. The loads predicted from analysis were compared to the loads observed in flight. The hinge moment loads showed good agreement with the flight loads while the normal force loads calculated from analysis were over-predicted by approximately 20 percent. Normal force and hinge moment loads calculated from the pressure sensors located on the ACTE showed good agreement with the loads calculated from the installed strain gages...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a large {{ceramics}} structure composed by shrink fitting used for rolls in molten zinc. The ceramics roll may provide a longer life and reduce the cost for the maintenance because of large heat resistance and large wear resistance. However, the small toughness of ceramics may cause fracture {{because of the large}} thermal stress when the roll is dipping into the molten zinc. Moreover, since the shaft and the sleeve are <b>connected</b> by shrink <b>fitting,</b> they may separate each other under high temperature when dipping into the molten metal. In this paper, therefore, the thermal stress as well as separation is considered when the ceramics roll is composed by shrink fitting by the application of the finite volume method (FVM) and finite element method (FEM). Then, the values of maximum stress are discussed by considering the shrink fitting system as well as the thermal stress...|$|R
40|$|Conventional rollers {{used in a}} heat furnace {{are called}} hearth roll.

40|$|The {{ceramics}} roller can {{to be used}} in {{the heating}} furnace because of high temperature resistance. The roller consists of ceramics sleeve and steel shaft <b>connected</b> by shrink <b>fitting.</b> Since ceramics is brittle, it should be noted that only low shrink fitting ratio can be applied for the connection. Therefore, coming out of the shaft from the sleeve during rotation should be investigated in this study. In this study, the finite element analysis is applied to simulate this phenomenon. In the previous study, mechanism of coming out has been considered by using 3 -D model. However, since 3 -D model analysis needs large computational time, only small number of cycle can be considered, and therefore, the coming out phenomenon cannot be predicted easily. In this research, the 2 -D plate model approach is proposed in order to reduce computational time, considering the upper and lower alternate load, repeatedly. Then, the effects of the magnitude of the load and shrink fitting ratio are investigated systematically. Finally, the simulation of the coming out phenomenon can be carried out for much larger number of cycles...|$|R
