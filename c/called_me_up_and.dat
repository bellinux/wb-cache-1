Unlike the previous {{games in the}} series, {{which took place in}} the near future and focused on indoor locations, the game is set in a Soviet jungle {{during the height of the}} Cold War in 1964, and features wilderness survival, camouflage, and James Bond styled espionage. The North American version was released on November 17, 2004, with the Japanese counterpart following on December 16. The European version was released on March 4, 2005. Critical response to the game was highly favorable. Kojima has said that his mother played it, [...] "It took her an entire year to complete Metal Gear Solid 3. She would get her friends to help her.

[...] "She <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> talked my ear off," [...] said Erlandson. [...] "We met at this coffee shop, and I saw her and I thought [...] "Oh, God. Oh, no, What am I getting myself into?" [...] She grabbed me and started talking, and she's like [...] "I know you're the right one", and I hadn't even opened my mouth yet." [...] In retrospect, Love said that Erlandson [...] "had a Thurston [...] quality about him" [...] and was an [...] "intensely weird, good guitarist." [...] In his 2012 book, Letters to Kurt, Erlandson revealed that he and Love had a sexual relationship during their first year together in the band, which Love also confirmed.|$|E

They just didnt bother to <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> find out when they wrote up the credits. It doesnt really matter. Jack Kirby created the costume, and he did the cover for the issue. In fact the second costume, the red and yellow one, was designed by Steve Ditko. I found it easier than drawing that bulky old thing. The earlier design, the robot-looking one, was more Kirbyish.|$|R

[...] "He <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> asked me to join." [...] Heck's first known comics work appeared in two Comic Media titles both cover-dated September 1952: the war comic War Fury #1, for which he penciled and inked the cover and the eight-page story [...] "The Unconquered", by an unknown writer; and the cover and the six-page story [...] "Hitler's Head", also by an unknown writer, in the horror comic Weird Terror #1. Heck's work continued to appear in those titles and in the horror anthology Horrific, for which he designed the logo; the adventure-drama anthology Danger; and the Western anthology Death Valley and other titles through the company's demise in late 1954.|$|E
2500|$|His {{attitude}} {{changed after}} producer Martin Poll and screenwriter Larry Cohen {{filed a lawsuit}} against 20th Century Fox, alleging that the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen plagiarised an unproduced script they had written entitled Cast of Characters. According to Moore, [...] "They seemed to believe that the head of 20th Century Fox <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> persuaded me to steal this screenplay, turning it into a comic book they could then adapt back into a movie, to camouflage petty larceny." [...] Moore testified in a deposition, a process he found so unpleasant that he surmised he would have been better treated had he [...] "molested and murdered a busload of retarded children after giving them heroin". Fox's settlement of the case insulted Moore, who interpreted it as an admission of guilt. In 2012, Moore claimed that he had sold the rights to these two works simply for the money; he did not expect the films ever to be made. He was simply [...] "getting money for old rope". Moore {{said in an interview in}} 2012 that he had seen neither film.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{received}} {{an invitation to}} appear in Game of Death (死亡遊戲), but declined. He was scheduled to attend a screen test {{on the set of}} Enter the Dragon after Bruce Lee had finished shooting the film and was working on dubbing. Lee returned to Hong Kong from his last trip to the United States of America in late May 1973. Thus, Wong would have attended the screen test sometime in June 1973. Wong recalled, [...] "About two months before he (Bruce Lee) died he gave me a phone call ... After this he left Hong Kong to settle his film business. When he came back, he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> wanted me to participate in the making of Game of Death. He had also invited me to the studio to attend a screen test. I did not promise to act in the film, yet I still went to attend the screen test to please him." [...] In a 1986 interview, Wong said, [...] "I told him (Bruce Lee) that I didn't want to go and die in my first movie! ... I wasn't in dire financial straits at the time, so I didn't have to do the film (just) to make money." [...] The role of Lee's final opponent was thus played by basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In another interview, Wong said, [...] "It was for Game of Death, but I declined because I thought that the moves of Wing Chun style wouldn’t look good on film. I think the Wing Chun method is ugly for movies but very good and very logical for real fighting." ...|$|E

As a volunteer, Callen managed the center, which cooked and delivered meals five days a week, and provided car service to seniors needing transportation. A local news article stated: “At 85, Miss Maude serves meals each weekday to some 50 elderly residents, most of them younger than she is.” She is quoted as having said, on turning down an invitation from President Reagan to visit the White House, “You can’t just <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> ask <b>me</b> to be somewhere.

2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'"

Essentially the songs are all there intact, but in terms of every aspect of the sound, drums, bass, guitars, vocals. All of that was totally re-developed. All the accessories, all the electronic sounds, samples, all of those came from Reznor and Reznor’s people." [...] Reznor received an executive producer credit for his work on the album.|$|R
