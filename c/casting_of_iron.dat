40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{corrosion}} is the predominant mechanism for the deterioration <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> pipes, leading to the reduction of pipe capacity and ultimate collapse of the pipes. In order to assess the remaining service life <b>of</b> corroded <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> pipes, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms of corrosion over a long term and to develop models for pipe deterioration. Although many studies have been carried out to determine the corrosion behavior <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron,</b> little research has been undertaken to understand how cast iron pipes behave over a longer time scale than hours, days, or weeks. The present paper intends to fill the gap regarding the long-term corrosion behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> pipes in the absence of historical data. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental program is presented in which the corrosion behaviour of three exservice pipes was thoroughly examined in three simulated service environments. It has been found in the paper that localised corrosion is the primary form <b>of</b> corrosion <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> water pipes. It has also been found that the microstructure <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> is a key factor that affects the corrosion behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> pipes. The paper concludes that long-term tests on corrosion behaviour <b>of</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> pipes can help develop models for corrosion-induced deterioration of the pipes for use in predicting the remaining service life of the pipes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the {{creating}} virtual "Simulator " is {{the possibility}} of a system approach applying to the visual and logical definition for defects species, to identify the stages of their formation and the creation of conditions to eliminate casting defects. For stable memorization of processes occurring in the casting mold and the elimination of defects, used animated representations of these processes in the dynamics and phase review. To expand the opportunities of more accurate casting defects identification and elimination in the "Simulator" we have expertise and modeling systems for optimizing processes to improve the castings quality. Creating "Simulator " uses materials of the book "System of determining and eliminating hot tears in the <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> and steel " Application of the developed simulator for training students and engineers in foundries, showed the effectiveness of the methodology perception for systematic identification and elimination of defects.

40|$|Industrialized housing {{has been}} a common {{phenomenon}} in the building industry since the industrial revolution; the <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> components enabled Victorian iron casters to prefabricate entire buildings and to export them to all British colonies. It got a second boost from Modernist architects like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius and Konrad Wachsmann; and a third boost in the US when the soldiers {{came back from the}} Second World War in 1945 and wanted to buy a ready-made house. In the later decades of the 20 th century composite prototypes were built. Timber frame houses are extremely popular in low density areas worldwide. For densely populated areas housing is now firmly attached to reinforced concrete. The contracting industries have developed efficient building methods for the concrete structures on which separate systems of claddings are fixed to form a house. However, in the coming decades, designers, builders and scientists also have to keep the environment in mind, working with a minimal amount of materials, and for minimizing embodied energy and energy use. In the coming age minimal embodied energy and low ecological footprints are renewed values that will be added to energy-positive housing and that will have an influence on the building technology of the future. This will lead to a reformation of the building vocabulary. Other materials will have to be chosen and developed to function in building elements and components.

Te {{industry and}} business management are arranged {{within the scope}} of family. Te products are relatively low in quality and its market share is limited and tend to be traditional. Tis condition is caused by the weak knowledge of the management and the method of casting metals and metal science. Brass casting methode, that was used at IKM partner, is casting with mold of sand or soil. Tis process requires the making process of sand molds, that is removed afer the brass solidify. For large quantities products, this process is inefcient and takes a long time. It would require a more efcient and faster method in the production process. Method of sand casting and ceramics have been used by SMEs cast brass in Yogyakarta, however it  has many disadvantages in terms of increased productivity and quality as well as the expansion of product applications. Te permanent mold <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> is a casting method which has many advantages over other methods, but the use for SMEs has not been applied in the SME of cast brass. Te permanen mold casting methods was introduced to SME partners. Tis replaces the sand mold materials and molding sand.

40|$|The {{potential}} nondestructive diagnostics {{of solid}} objects {{is discussed in}} this article. The whole process is accomplished by consecutive steps involving software analysis of the vibration power spectrum (eventually acoustic emissions) created during the normal operation of the diagnosed device or under unexpected situations. Another option {{is to create an}} artificial pulse, which can help us to determine the actual state of the diagnosed device. The main idea of this method is based on the analysis of the current power spectrum density of the received signal and its postprocessing in the Matlab environment with a following sample comparison in the Statistica software environment. The last step, which is comparison of samples, is the most important, because it is possible to determine the status of the examined object at a given time. Nowadays samples are compared only visually, but this method can’t produce good results. Further the presented filter can choose relevant data from a huge group of data, which originate from applying FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). On the other hand, using this approach they can be subjected to analysis with the assistance of a neural network. If correct and high-quality starting data are provided to the initial network, we are able to analyze other samples and state in which condition a certain object is. The success rate of this approximation, based on our testing of the solution, is now 85. 7 %. With further improvement of the filter, it could be even greater. Finally it is possible to detect defective conditions or upcoming limiting states of examined objects/materials by using only one device which contains HW and SW parts. This kind of detection can provide significant financial savings in certain cases (such as continuous <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>iron</b> where it could save hundreds of thousands of USD) ...|$|E
