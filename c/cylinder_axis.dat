5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>axis,</b> and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cross section}} of a common whistle {{is shown in the}} figure on the right. The cavity is a closed end {{cylinder}} ( [...] inch diameter), but with the <b>cylinder</b> <b>axis</b> lateral to the jet axis. The orifice is [...] inch wide and the sharp edge is [...] inch from the jet orifice. When blown weakly, the sound is mostly broad band with a weak tone. When blown more forcefully, a strong tone is established near 2800Hz and adjacent bands are at least 20dB down. If the whistle is blown yet more forcefully, the level of the tone increases and the frequency increases only slightly suggesting Class I hydrodynamic feedback and operation only in Stage I.|$|E

50|$|With the {{development}} of the revolver in the 19th century, gunsmiths had finally achieved the goal of a practical capability for delivering multiple loads to one handgun barrel in quick succession. Revolvers feed ammunition via the rotation of a cartridge-filled cylinder, in which each cartridge is contained in its own ignition chamber, and is sequentially brought into alignment with the weapon's barrel by an indexing mechanism linked to the weapon's trigger (double-action) or its hammer (single-action). These nominally cylindrical chambers, usually numbering between five and eight {{depending on the size of}} the revolver and the size of the cartridge being fired, are bored through the cylinder so that their axes are parallel to the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation; thus, as the cylinder rotates, the chambers revolve about the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|R

50|$|The term {{cylinder}} {{can also}} mean the lateral {{surface of a}} solid cylinder (see Cylinder (geometry)). If cylinder is used in this sense, the above paragraph would read as follows: A plane section of a right circular cylinder of finite length is a circle if the cutting plane is perpendicular to the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>axis</b> of symmetry, or an ellipse if it is neither parallel nor perpendicular to that axis. If the cutting plane {{is parallel to the}} axis the plane section consists of a pair of parallel line segments unless the cutting plane is tangent to the cylinder, in which case, the plane section is a single line segment.|$|R
40|$|We {{apply the}} Landau-de Gennes theory {{to study the}} {{equilibrium}} problem that arises when a cylinder of radius R is kept at a given distance h from a plane wall. We assume that both the lateral boundary of the cylinder and the wall enforce homeotropic anchoring conditions on the liquid crystal, which prescribe the liquid crystal molecules to stick orthogonally to the bounding surfaces. Typically, in our study R ranges from a few to hundreds of biaxial coherence lengths, where a biaxial coherence length, which depends on the temperature, is a few nanometers. The equilibrium textures exhibit a bifurcation between a flat solution, where one eigenvector of the order tensor Q is everywhere parallel to the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>axis,</b> and an escape solution, where the eigenframe of Q flips {{out of the plane}} orthogonal to the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>axis.</b> The escape texture minimizes an appropriately renormalized energy functional F* for h. hc, while the flat texture minimizes F* for h,hc. We compute both the force and the torque transmitted to the cylinder by the surrounding liquid crystal and we find that the diagrams of both as functions of h fail to be monotonic along the escape texture. Thus, upon decreasing h, a snapping instability is predicted to occur, with an associated hysteresis loop in the force diagram, before h reaches hc. Finally, since the symmetry of this problem makes it equivalent to the one where two parallel cylinders are separated by the distance 2 h, the snapping instability predicted here should also be observed there...|$|R

50|$|At {{this point}} the rounds are not the {{familiar}} three sided shape seen in Dardick's production firearms.

50|$|When a {{spinning}} body passes through air {{at right angles}} to its axis of spin, it experiences a sideways force in the third dimension. This Magnus effect was first demonstrated on {{a spinning}} cylinder by Gustav Magnus in 1872. If the <b>cylinder</b> <b>axis</b> is aligned spanwise (side to side) then forward movement through the air generates lift.

The groups are listed in Hermann-Mauguin notation, and for the point groups, Schönflies notation. There appears to be no comparable notation for the line groups.

30|$|The {{tests are}} {{performed}} on cylindrical samples of fractured rock cored {{such that the}} mean plane of the fracture is perpendicular to the <b>cylinder’s</b> <b>axis</b> of symmetry. The principle of the tests is to percolate a fluid through a natural fracture contained in a rock sample, under imposed and/or controlled THM conditions. The fluid, of known and constant chemical composition (the percolated fluid not being recycled), is injected into {{the centre of the}} fracture by boring into the lower wall, resulting in a divergent radial flow within the fracture. The evolution of the fluid’s chemical composition is then characterised after passage through the fracture. The tests were performed within a containment cell at an imposed temperature and with a normal stress loading on the sample perpendicular to the fracture plane.|$|R

The theoretical description employs a simple lattice gas model, with {{two species of}} site, expected to describe various regimes of adsorption and condensation behavior. The model includes four hypothetical phases: a cylindrical shell phase (S), in which the sites close to the cylindrical wall are occupied, an axial phase (A), in which sites along the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>axis</b> are occupied, a full phase (F), in which all sites are occupied, and an empty phase (E). We obtain exact results at T= 0 for the phase behavior, which {{is a function of}} the interactions present in any specific problem.

For complex shapes, the length may be defined as the volume of the fluid body divided by the surface area.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} debate {{as to whether}} the first driving axle of the 4-12-2 was cranked to provide {{clearance}} for the main rod connected to the second axle. Union Pacific drawings show no such crank on the first axle, and the Railway Age article says [...] "The 67-inch drivers permit the use of a straight axle on the front drivers..." [...] The spacing {{between the first and second}} axles was increased by 18 in to provide clearance. Based on the published dimensions, this means at its closest the centerline of the inside rod was 11.645 inches from the centerline of the first axle. (UP drawings reproduced in Kratville and Bush's [...] "Union Pacific Type" [...] books show the inside rod 113 inches long and the first and second driver axles 88 inches apart. The inside <b>cylinder</b> <b>axis</b> was inclined 9.5 degrees and was 32 inches above the plane of the driving axles at a point 181 inches ahead of the second driving axle, so the <b>cylinder</b> <b>axis</b> missed the centerline of the second axle by 1-11/16 inches.

By means of the Maxwell–Garnett model, we provide a general analytical expression of the electromagnetic fields that can propagate along {{the direction of the}} <b>cylinder’s</b> <b>axis,</b> keeping its transverse waveform unaltered. Numerical simulations based on the finite element method support our analytical approach.
