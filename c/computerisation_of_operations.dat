The {{aim of the research}} has been to develop a single modular software package for all modes of Community Transport (CT) operations. In order to achieve this aim, the research has set out to examine CT operations, the scope for <b>computerisation</b> <b>of</b> those <b>operations</b> and existing software for them, to analyse the requirements of CT operators through a collaborative process, to develop a data model which supports their operations, and to implement a software package based on this model which provides both a data management system and operational functions.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of information systems}} (IS) is a problematic process that all too often ends in failure. This paper reports a comparative analysis of two projects involving the <b>computerisation</b> <b>of</b> ambulance control-room <b>operations</b> in London and Manchester. The outcomes were strikingly different. In the London case, severe operational problems led to the abandonment of the project. In contrast, we report an intensive psychophysiological evaluation of the Manchester project showing that the new system led to both improved service levels and reduced stress (lower blood pressure and subjective anxiety). These contrasting fortunes are attributed to two sets of factors: technical and managerial. The technical design philosophy at Manchester followed what may be called a "tool paradigm" (the system was designed to support/augment the human role) whereas the London project was highly Tayloristic. Implementation at Manchester was also adroitly managed (strong leadership, good staff communication) in contrast to London (weak management, poor industrial relations). The successful deployment {{in the study of}} a psychophysiological methodology demonstrates the diagnostic power of this multi-perspective approach, and illustrates its considerable potential in IS research/practice in relation to the design and evaluation of information systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between computer technology and supervision is examined {{with reference to}} new empirical evidence drawn from a study <b>of</b> the <b>computerisation</b> <b>of</b> freight <b>operations</b> in British Rail. Attention {{is focused on the}} extent to which computerisation allows for a more integrated system of management control, and the possibility of devolving additional elements of control from middle management to the local supervisory level. Contemporary research often claims that the first-line supervisor is becoming more peripheral to the direct control <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> as computerised equipment takes over the execution of many supervisory tasks, and as operatives who are skilled in the use of new technology overtake the apparent skill superiority of first-line supervisors. This thesis contends that it is misleading to focus on the 'pure' role of the first-line supervisor when studying the effects of computer technology on supervision. The main body of empirical data is drawn from an in-depth study of the effects of change in five traditional marshalling yards in three British Rail regions. The case study examines how the application of a comprehensive computer system to process and transmit information over diverse and spatially distant freight yards can transform the distribution of responsibilities for operational control within management. It is argued that the redistribution of management control functions over a network of organisational levels has resulted in a far more complex redefinition of supervision than is implied by the apparent erosion of the role of the first-line supervisor. A broader conception of supervision is presented in order to explain changes in the distribution of supervisory tasks across various supervisory levels, within the context of changes in work organisation and the system of management control. Finally, it is argued that whilst computerisation may erode the traditional basis of supervision, it may also result in the emergence of a new type of computer-oriented supervisor, whose role is to use the 'realtime' information provided by the computer to co-ordinate and control previously diverse areas of production or service operations...|$|R
