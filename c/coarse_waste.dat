Research at the Porgera Gold Mine is focusing on developing a method of combining tailings products with <b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> rock and waste muds to create a product that can be stored on the surface in generic-looking waste dumps or stockpiles. This would allow the current use of rivering disposal to cease. Considerable work remains to be done. However, co-disposal has been successfully implemented by several designers including AMEC at, for example, the Elkview Mine in British Columbia.|$|E
50|$|Most {{prominent}} {{example of}} the application of sensor-based ore sorting is the rejection of barren waste before transporting and comminution. Waste rejection is also known under the term pre-concentration. A discrimination has been introduced by Robben. Rule of thumb is that at least 25% of liberated barren waste must {{be present in the}} fraction to be treated by sensor-based ore sorting to make waste rejection financially feasible.Reduction of waste before it enters comminution and grinding processes does not only reduce the costs in those processes, but also releases the capacity that can be filled with higher grade material and thus implies higher productivity of the system. A prejudice against the application of a waste rejection process is, that the valuable content lost in this process is a penalty higher than the savings that can be achieved. But it is reported in the literature that the overall recovery even increases through bringing higher grade material as feed into the mill. In addition, the higher productivity is an additional source of income. If noxious waste such as acid consuming calcite is removed, the downstream recovery increases and the downstream costs decrease disproportionally as reported for example by Bergmann. The <b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> rejected can be an additional source of income if there is a local market for aggregates.|$|E
30|$|Guaranteeing the {{stability}} of such impoundments {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks in mine waste management. These storage basins are in fact particularly vulnerable to failure for the following reasons (Rico et al. 2008 a): (1) dams made of locally derived filling material (soil, <b>coarse</b> <b>waste,</b> overburden material from mining operations and tailings); (2) dams subsequently raised as solid material coupled with a severe increase in effluent (plus runoff from precipitation); (3) lack of regulations on specific design criteria; (4) their extremely large area makes punctual criticality identification difficult, and would require an extensive and continuous monitoring, which, apart from the very high costs, is also time consuming, and (5) the high cost of remediation works, following the closure of mining activities.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{adequacy}} and {{the benefit of}} incorporating glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) waste materials into polyester based mortars, as sand aggregates and filler replacements, are assessed. Different weight contents of mechanically recycled GFRP wastes with two particle size grades {{are included in the}} formulation of new materials. In all formulations, a polyester resin matrix was modified with a silane coupling agent in order to improve binder-aggregates interfaces. The added value of the recycling solution was assessed by means of both flexural and compressive strengths of GFRP admixed mortars with regard to those of the unmodified polymer mortars. Planning of experiments and data treatment were performed by means of full factorial design and through appropriate statistical tools based on analyses of variance (ANOVA). Results show that the partial replacement of sand aggregates by either type of GFRP recyclates improves the mechanical performance of resultant polymer mortars. In the case of trial formulations modified with the <b>coarser</b> <b>waste</b> mix, the best results are achieved with 8 % waste weight content, while for fine waste based polymer mortars, 4 % in weight of waste content leads to the higher increases on mechanical strengths. This study clearly identifies a promising waste management solution for GFRP waste materials by developing a cost-effective end-use application for the recyclates, thus contributing to a more sustainable fibre-reinforced polymer composites industry...|$|R

30|$|The {{choice of}} plant species {{depends on the}} {{characteristics}} of spoil, climatic condition and ultimate land use. Indigenous plants such as Sal, Kendu, Amla, Jamun, Shisham, Croton roxburghii, Karanj and Neem are more tolerant to adverse spoil pH and moisture stress than grass and legumes and are therefore, easier to establish. This indigenous plants are used where a wind break is desired, or where a visual shield is required, they are suitable to steep or rocky terrain and <b>coarse</b> <b>waste.</b> The successful vegetation establishment of waste dumps also depends on micro- and macro-climate, disease and insect resistance, competition, growth pattern and propagation ability of the species. The availability of moisture in the spoil, especially during warm dry summer, is important. If the water level is not high enough, irrigation may be necessary to provide moisture. As the vegetation matures, the need for the irrigation diminishes since indigenous plant gets adapted to dry summer condition.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of two vermicomposts from winery and distillery wastes {{on the distribution}} of diuron in agricultural soil was studied. Physical soil fractionations at 0, 9, 27, 49 and 77 days, allowed the quantification of pesticide residues in different particle-size fractions, <b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> (WF), sand-sized (SF), silt-sized (SiF), clay-sized (CF) and dissolved organic matter-sized fraction (DOM). The SiF made a greater contribution to the formation of non-extractable residues in unamended soil, but when vermicomposts were added, new sorption sites in WF appeared, being higher for the more humified vermicompost V 2. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased with the addition of vermicompost, but the concentration of the desorbed 14 C-radiochemical did not increase. Non-significant increment was observed with time for the non-extractable fraction with amendments. Diuron was transformed in all samples, although less than 0. 5 % was mineralized. The main effect caused by vermicomposts was a reduction in the availability of diuron in soil...|$|E

40|$|Mine tailing ponds are {{environmental}} hazards {{because of high}} susceptibility to leaching and erosion by water and wind. Vegetation establishment is an effective technique to reclaim tailing ponds but requires knowledge of the spatial relationship between the structural composition and {{physical and chemical properties}} of soils. In this study we have demonstrated the use of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI), combined with soil chemical analyses, to determine the structural and chemical composition of mine tailing ponds to assess efficient measures of environmental protection. We used a Syscal R 1 resistivity meter to generate two-and three-dimensional (2 -D/ 3 -D) ERI images from El Lirio and Brunita mine tailing ponds. Soil samples were collected at 1 -m intervals to a depth of 15 m, and were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity and cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) contents. Results show that materials in the ponds can be classified into three categories: fine tailings – low ER (, 8 V-m), <b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> rock – intermediate ER (8 – 150 V-m), and bedrock – high ER (. 150 V-m).

Some {{of the physical}} and mechanical properties of paving blocks having various levels of fine glass (FG) and coarse glass (CG) replacements with fine aggregate (FA) are investigated. The test {{results show that the}} replacement of FG by FA at level of 20 % by weight has a significant effect on the compressive strength, flexural strength, splitting tensile strength and abrasion resistance of the paving blocks as compared with the control sample because of puzzolanic nature of FG. The compressive strength, flexural strength, splitting tensile strength and abrasion resistance of the paving block samples in the FG replacement level of 20 % are 69 %, 90 %, 47 % and 15 % higher as compared with the control sample respectively. It is reported in the earlier works the replacement of FG by FA at level of 20 % by weight suppress the alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in the concrete.

40|$|Reclamation of the Zortman and Landusky {{gold and}} silver mines in the little Rocky Mountains of north-central Montana is {{currently}} on-going {{under the direction of}} the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the U. S. BLM. As part of this process various reclamation alternatives were evaluated using a Multiple Accounts Analysis (MAA) (Shaw et al. these proceedings). This paper describes the results of cover performance modeling carried out in support of this decision analysis. Potential cover materials were collected from local sources and characterized in the laboratory to provide realistic input parameters for cover performance modeling. One-dimensional (SoilCover) and two-dimensional (SEEP/W) models were used to estimate the rate of net infiltration for various alternative cover scenarios. The cover performance model was calibrated against observed flows captured from a covered mine rock pile. One-dimensional modeling results suggest that the rate of net infiltration is more influenced by the precipitation pattern, (i. e. wet versus dry year), than by the different cover materials. Two-dimensional modeling of cover performance on a sloped surface suggested that placement of a fine layer on <b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> rock would significantly reduce net infiltration due to the capillary break effect. However, the presence of the capillary break effect was found to be very sensitive to material properties and would require significant quality control during construction.

40|$|The waste {{resulting}} from marble extraction process is usually disposed of in landfills or dumps and its accumulation is causing serious environmental and landscaping problems. One way of reusing marble waste {{is to consider}} its incorporation in structural concrete as a non-primary aggregate. This research work attempts to alleviate the situation and provide information on the mechanical performance of concrete {{as a function of}} the replacement ratio of primary aggregates (PA) with <b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> marble aggregates (CMA). Three concrete families, including reference concrete (RC) mixes, were studied that were made with primary aggregates of basalt (BCA), limestone (LCA) and granite (GCA) (these are the main sources of primary aggregates in the southern and central parts of Portugal), and concrete mixes with replacement ratios of 20 %, 50 % and 100 % of PA by CMA. To evaluate their quality and mechanical performance mixes were tested for: slump (in the Abrams cone test), specific density, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, Young's modulus of elasticity and resistance to abrasion. The results suggest a tendency for the values of all mechanical properties to decline. However, this tendency is clearly weaker than those observed for the majority of the research involving other types of non-primary recycled aggregates, which are already used in certain proportions in structural concrete, according to the limits imposed by the standards and specifications. The mechanical properties of concrete made with CMA were assessed within the scope of concurrent work also undertaken at Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisbon, Portugal), concerning the durability-related materials of the same type of concrete...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSedimentary {{phosphate}} occurs largely at Gafsa mining basin. Among these occurrences Jebel Alima (Redeyf region) is an {{open pit}} quarry. After extraction, raw phosphate requires several stages of treatments to become concentrated: crushing, grinding, scrubbing, sizing, attrition, de-sliming and flotation. The coarse reject, generated from {{the first step of}} ore processing, constitutes the main pollution source in the mining area around the washing plant. Since composition contains a host of environmentally hazardous chemical elements such as Cd, U, Pb…. The results of the chemical characterization also show that the raw sample can achieve P 2 O 5 grade of 13. 52 %. After 170 scrubbing tests, with 4 kg of solid waste for each test, the liberated fraction showed a content of 24. 33 % P 2 O 5. After sieving, the fraction under 315 microns was recovered for flotation, whereas the fraction greater than 315 microns goes through grinding. 11 grinding tests were carried out taking into account the parameter variations (rotational speed, grinding time, solid concentration and load). The result of the optimum grinding is: Load: 7 / 1; speed: 60 tr / min; time: 5, 5 min; Cs: 45 %. The liberated fraction content is 20. 24 %. Before the reverse flotation, the product from scrubber outlet (fraction 315 microns) were mixed. The feed material has a content of 22. 44 % P 2 O 5.

40|$|The Matera Horst (" Murgia materana ") is {{included}} in the Apulian plateau, basically formed by Mesozoic shallow-water carbonates. The zone is located in a present-day temperate belt and form a flat-topped morphostructural large element inside the foreland area of the southern Apennines. This horst is bordered by high-angle faults and surrounded by downthrown blocks covered by Plio-Quaternary marine and alluvial sediments. The structural high experienced several morphological cycles from Miocene to Quaternary. In particular, three evolutionary stages can be recognized at least. The first stage is currently represented by relics of a flat erosional landscape {{at the top of the}} relieves. The second one is testified by gentle slopes with wide glacis at the foothills, locally covered by <b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> deposits. During the third stage a series of marine terraces formed and a drainage system developed creating both bland valleys and well-defined channels and gorges. The latter streams deeply carve the Cretaceous limestone of the Matera Horst for they represent the morphological response to the tectonic uplift of the area and clearly post-date the former features. Since the fluvial net took place on Pleistocene covers, later widely eroded, it is possible to conclude that the major part of the Matera Horst drainage system represents a good example of superimposition. However, low order streams and segments of major rivers appear to be structurally controlled, as suggested by comparison with the fracture system. Further, also open synclines and gently steeped flexures may locally exert a driving control on minor streams. These apparently conflicting genetic hypotheses can be explained by the role of exhumation of inherited structures of the bedrock in add to a constant interplay between tectonics, erosion and drainage evolution during Quaternary times...|$|E

A simple method of determining the percentage of the total input solids retained on coal mine co-disposal beaches formed by downslope deposition is presented that is based on the particle size distributions of the input wastes and of the wastes retained on the beach.

30|$|Firing is {{the most}} {{important}} stage in the ceramic process for the production of lightweight aggregate. It is during this phase that decomposition of the clay mineral reticle causes instability in the joint. This leads to the formation of amorphous phase, liquid at this temperature, which serves as a unifying element in the array. This phase will remain until the end of sintering, and some of it often creates very stable crystalline phases. During ceramization, the inorganic portion of the waste enters the amorphous phase of the ceramic matrix. All solid state reactions, as is the case of ceramics, have extremely slow reaction kinetics. The factor that can speed up the process is particle size. The finer the particle, the greater the surface area and the greater the reaction capacity. In contrast, a large enough particle will not react. When the goal is to inertize a waste due to its toxicity, the waste must be ground very fine. In this case, the waste melts partially and is integrated into the ceramic matrix. If the particle size is <b>coarse,</b> the <b>waste</b> particle does not interact with the ceramic matrix and is simply encapsulated [31, 32].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{the results of}} experimental work to investigate the suitability of a waste material (WM) for soft soil stabilisation. In addition, the effect of particle size distribution (PSD) of the waste material on its performance as a soil stabiliser was investigated. The WM {{used in this study}} is produced from the incineration processes in domestic energy power plant and it is available in two different grades of fineness (<b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> material (CWM) and fine waste material (FWM)). An intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic matter content has been used in this study. The suitability of the CWM and FWM to improve the physical and engineering properties of the selected soil was evaluated dependant on the results obtained from the consistency limits, compaction characteristics (optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD)); along with the unconfined compressive strength test (UCS). Different percentages of CWM were added to the soft soil (3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 %) to produce various admixtures. Then the UCS test was carried out on specimens under different curing periods (zero, 7, 14, and 28 days) to find the optimum percentage of CWM. The optimum and other two percentages (either side of the optimum content) were used for FWM to evaluate the effect of the fineness of the WM on UCS of the stabilised soil. Results indicated that both types of the WM used in this study improved the physical properties of the soft soil where the index of plasticity (IP) was decreased significantly. IP was decreased from 21 to 13. 64 and 13. 10 with 12 % of CWM and 15 % of FWM respectively. The results of the unconfined compressive strength test indicated that 12 % of CWM was the optimum and this percentage developed the UCS value from 202 kPa to 500 kPa for 28 days cured samples, which is equal, approximately 2. 5 times the UCS value for untreated soil. Moreover, this percentage provided 1. 4 times the value of UCS for stabilized soil-CWA by using FWM which recorded just under 700 kPa after 28 days curing...|$|E
40|$|Preferential flow paths develop where {{particular}} {{areas of}} a geologic profile become more conductive than the surrounding material. Research {{has been conducted}} in recent years on preferential flow and {{the flow of water}} through unsaturated soils. Unfortunately, the research has been completed by different disciplines of science and engineering, resulting {{in a wide range of}} terminology and research objectives. A field program conducted during the excavation of a large waste rock pile at Golden Sunlight Mine in Montana defined the structure of the pile to consist of steeply-dipping, fine and coarse layers. The fine layers located near the top of the pile were wet and oxidized while the coarse layers were dry and unoxidized. The results of the field program indicated the development of preferential pathways through the fine-grained layers. A column study was developed to investigate the potential development of preferential flow in vertically layered, unsaturated systems. To achieve this objective, a column was constructed that enabled the amount of lateral flow between two adjacent materials to be quantified and related to the applied surface flux and the hydraulic properties of the individual materials under steady-state conditions. The results of the column study and subsequent numerical modelling program showed that water prefers to flow where water exists. In unsaturated systems, a fine-grained soil has smaller interparticle voids and is able to maintain fluid-filled pores at suctions greater than that of a coarse-grained material. Once suctions exceed the air entry value of the material the largest voids begin to drain, air enters the system and the hydraulic conductivity decreases. The decrease in hydraulic conductivity with increased suctions for each material is dependent on the distribution of pore sizes. In an unsaturated system it is this mechanism of decreasing hydraulic conductivity with increasing suction that can result in a fine-grained material becoming more conductive than a coarse-grained material. When a surface flux is applied to a vertically layered, unsaturated system under steady state conditions, the preferential flow path is determined by the relationship between the applied surface flux rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the fine layer. If the applied flux rate is greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the fine material, the equilibrium suction that forms within the column results in the coarse layer becoming the preferential flow path. Reducing the surface flux to a rate less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the fine material results in an equilibrium suction where the fine layer becomes the path of preferential flow. It is critical that the interaction between the hydraulic properties of materials within a system be quantified in order to predict the behaviour of the system. Following the analysis of the fine and coarse sand column, another column was constructed using fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>waste</b> rock. The results from the second column experiment showed that when the applied surface flux was reduced to a rate of 5. 56 x 10 - 8 m/s (i. e., 1753 mm/year), the fine waste rock layer became the path of preferential flow...|$|E
40|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} from {{waste rock}} piles and its {{impacts on the}} receiving environment is a critical issue facing regulatory agencies and the mining industry. The mining industry and regulatory agencies are presented with the difficult problem {{of being able to}} predict, with confidence, the potential for acid rock drainage to occur. The ability to predict seepage quality will ultimately provide regulators and the industry with the tools to evaluate various acid rock drainage control and management strategies. The predictive capabilities of various models differ however, a comprehensive predictive model does not exist to date. Current models are deficient in simulating the flow of water in unsaturated heterogeneous waste rock piles. The ability to predict the physical processes that Â·deliver contaminated seepage from unsaturated, heterogeneous waste rock piles, to the environment, requires {{a better understanding of the}} physical and hydrogeologic characteristics of the waste rock pile. Placer Dome Inc. and Golden Sunlight Mines Inc. initiated a research program to investigate the hydrogeologic properties and moisture migration pathways in a large waste rock pile located at the Golden Sunlight Mine. The research presented in the following thesis documents the initial phases of the research program. The main objectives of this program were to determine the internal structure and moisture distribution in the waste rock pile and characterize the hydrogeologic properties of the waste rock pile. The results were used to investigate how water flows in a heterogeneous unsaturated waste rock pile. This research program was divided into a field logging and sampling program and a laboratory program to define the hydrogeological properties of the waste rock. The field logging and sampling program documented a highly structured, heterogeneous, unsaturated waste rock pile. The internal structure consisted of dipping layers of waste rock material defined by color and/or grain size differences. Weathering of the waste rock was documented throughout the waste rock pile except for the outer edges where waste rock was recently placed. Higher gravimetric water contents were found to exist in the upper 15 m of the waste rock pile define the development of a wetting front. Gravimetric water contents were found to be lower below this zone. Infiltration from the dump top surface due to precipitation is the dominant process producing the wetting front in the upper portions of the pile. Waste rock was initially placed into the pile at low water contents and remains dry except for an increase in water contents in the upper 15 m of the waste rock pile. The laboratory program tested representative samples from each group of samples classified on the basis of grain size distribution to define the hydrogeologic properties of the waste rock. The soil water characteristic curves and hydraulic conductivity as a function of matric suction curves reveal two general types of waste rock material. Waste rock containing less than 40 % passing the 4. 75 mm sieve drains rapidly under small values of matric suction and shows a rapid decrease in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. Waste rock containing less than 40 % passing 4. 75 mm sieve is capable of retaining water under applied matric suction and also retains a higher unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The soil water characteristic curves and the hydraulic conductivity function curves therefore demonstrate that the fine grained waste rock layers will be preferential layers for the storage of water and provide the pathways for the liquid water flow in the waste rock pile under unsaturated conditions. The transport of water vapour in the waste rock pile was found to occur. This process is active in the upper portion of the waste rock pile associated with the wetting front. <b>Coarse</b> <b>waste</b> rock layers with open interparticle voids appear to provide a preferential pathway for the movement of water vapour. The upward movement of water vapour may redistribute water within the wetting front where it may be transported upward and condense or it may exit the pile. Water vapour flow exiting the pile may be an important transport process that removes water from the waste rock pile...|$|E

Comparison of calculated Zn stocks, both in the groundmass and in spherulites, showed a quasi-exclusive Zn accumulation in these neoformed features.

Finally, the pore-waters under the cover are characterized by a strong reducing potential, high alkalinity, and near neutral pHs. These conditions favor sulfate reduction and base metal precipitation as sulfides and as carbonates. Pore-water composition monitored from 1992 to 1998 showed a significant Fe 2 + decrease, following cover placement. Thereafter, the restoration strategy capitalized on the alkaline and reductive properties of the waters underlying the wood-waste cover. An original treatment of acid effluents, based on the recirculation of water discharged around the impoundment through the organic cover, was implemented. In 2002, the recirculated water from May to October had a mean pumping rate of 240 m 3 /h, for a total volume of 800 00...|$|R
50|$|The table above {{presents}} {{the waste stream}} for several processes that are commonly use in different industries. The example given for chemical industry is the powdered detergent production where gyratory screener is used to filter out the oversized granules found in end product to improve product appearance and dissolve rate. Citrus juice production is the example of food industry. Gyratory screener available in multi-layered planes eliminates all the wastes in several stages. Juice sacs are the desirable element to produce citrus juice. Screening in food industry significantly increases the product quality. Among the ore processing, gyratory screener is used after crushing to filter out the oversized ore particles. These unfavourable particles {{can be regarded as}} waste or recycle back to the process. Similarly, in pharmaceutical industry, gyratory screener removes undissolved particles from liquid pharmaceuticals or fine powder that stick on the capsule surface to ease the capsule stamp. As for wastewater treatment, removal of <b>coarse</b> solid <b>wastes</b> from the wastewater stream is exclusively to protect the downstream equipment from damages. Fine solid waste removal acts as pre-treatment for the process, more specifically a primary clarification. The overall screening process enhances system performance, minimize the cost and reduce the need for cleaning of the filter in other equipment.|$|R
40|$|Every 1 t {{of china}} clay {{produced}} in the UK generates 9 t of waste material. A limited quantity of the <b>coarser</b> <b>waste</b> has beneficial use as a building stone or secondary aggregate in concrete and asphalt, but there are currently limited uses for the finest waste fraction. ‘Mica’ waste {{is a mixture of}} fine minerals {{and is one of the}} forms of waste with little beneficial use other than the restoration of old quarries. Looking for innovative solutions for the needs of a new Eco-town in the UK and with an aim to find new commercially viable and low environmental impact uses in construction, this PhD introduces the idea of using the china clay waste in alkali-activated binders. First, it was investigated whether the contained mica mineral could be used as an alkali-activated binder. This was done using different MAS NMR and XRD analysis, and mechanical strength tests based on European standards. The material was shown to have low reactivity and some direct trials of alkali-activation of thermally treated mica mineral produced in average weak binders. Later, three series of alkali-activated binders were studied, one based on Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), one based on Fly Ash (FA) and one based on a 50 %GGBS- 50 %FA blend (50 / 50). The china clay waste was incorporated in selected optimum binders from the three series as aggregate to make mortars and concrete. Compared to control specimens, the test specimens using the china clay waste always showed lower strength. It is suggested that the high water demand of the waste is the main problem. When the waste was used in mortars, the impact of the water declined over time, with sand waste from china clay extraction showing approximately equivalent strength to the control silica based mortar after 6 months of curing for the GGBS and 50 / 50 series. For the same series, mica-waste specimens gave about 50 % of the strength of the control mortar on the 7 th day of curing but increased to 70 - 80 % of the control compressive strength at 6 months. In the FA series, the impact of additional water resulted in very low strengths and that series did not proceed in concrete making. The concrete design was accompanied by an environmental analysis to ensure environmentally beneficial outcomes were obtained. Testing in compression shows a similar decreasing strength for the Portland and the alkali-activated series for increasing amounts of waste used. However, the test specimens of the GGBS series showed potential for replacing Portland control specimens. The potential for making blocks and tiles using the new concrete would be greater if the mix design is optimized. Durability testing will be required on an optimized design and final product, but initial analysis of test results and the literature indicate this is unlikely to be a concern. Not using the final product to run durability tests would lead to arbitrary conclusions. The environmental analysis shows that although the carbon emissions would be reduced using alkali-activated concrete, most of the other environmental impact categories would be affected negatively which has to be considered when making the final decision on whether to use this new material in the Eco-town or elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Coarse coal rejects are {{conventionally}} loose-dumped while {{fine coal}} tailings are conventionally thickened and disposed {{of as an}} aqueous slurry in a mine tailings deposit area. The easy ingress of water and oxygen makes loose, coarse rejects prone to spontaneous combustion, degradation and acid generation. The fine particle size and low density of coal tailings ensure that coal tailings deposits remain wet and soft and thus difficult to rehabilitate for alternative land use. Co-disposal by combined pumping through a pipeline followed by subaerial deposition is a promising waste disposal and rehabilitation option. It can make better use of available storage than separate disposal of <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>wastes,</b> improve the water return from waste impoundments and facilitate their rehabilitation. To achieve the full potential of subaerial deposition, {{the properties of the}} co-disposed watse must be known. A description is given here of the morphology and properties of waste deposits formed during 19 field trials at mine sites in Queensland and New South Wales...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} {{ecology of the}} sequential, leach-bed, mesophilic anaerobic digestion of unsorted, <b>coarse</b> municipal solid <b>waste</b> (MSW) was examined over 80 days. The methane yield was approximately 75 % of the ultimate biochemical methane potential (BMP) of the waste loaded into the digesters. The operational strategy involved a sequence of two digesters containing fresh and anaerobically stabilised MSW respectively. Cell wall phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and ether lipid (PLEL) {{analysis was used to}} monitor changes in microbial biomass. Both Bacterial and Archaeal biomass were heavily influenced by pH during the two-week start up period. Archaeal biomass peaked just before the methane production rate reached a maximum whereas Bacterial biomass peaked at a later stage. Changes in the phylogenetic diversity of the population were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). An analysis of the changes in DGGE banding patterns suggested that rapid start-up of a new reactor was effected by inoculation as well as the provision of buffering capacity from the mature reactor leachate...|$|R
30|$|Coal wastes is {{the main}} {{pollution}} source in mining areas. The paper six studied an alternate technology for control of sulfate and chloride discharge. This research evaluates the hypothesis that co-disposal of CCPW (<b>Coarse</b> Coal Processing <b>Waste)</b> and FCPW (Fine Coal Processing Waste) with appropriate compaction can result in improved geochemical and geotechnical environments that will minimize acid mine drainage (AMD) formation and SO 42 − and Cl− discharges. Addition of ground limestone (ag-lime) to the mix was also evaluated as a drying agent and for improvement in overall geochemistry by buffering higher pH values within the coal waste. Coal fly ash (CFA) and municipal sewage sludge (MSS) management is a great concern worldwide. The paper seven was to present very briefly the results of some case studies carried out in China and Greece related to land reclamation and agricultural use of CFA and MSS separately or combined. The paper eight is related to soil flushing technology, which is an ‘in situ’ remediation technique involving the injection of a liquid solution. The applicability of the soil flushing technique for different heavy metal contents and pH conditions of the flushing solution was discussed in this paper.|$|R
40|$|Aims: In this study, the amount, composition, {{and energy}} content of waste in Isfahan, Iran, were examined. Materials and Methods: A time series model {{was used to}} predict {{the amount of waste}} {{generation}} in the future. The past waste changes was the basis for predicting how and to what extent the components will chnage. The energy content of mixed waste was calculated by the common heating value of each component and Dulonge′s formula. Results: The estimation of the amount of waste generated in Isfahan showed that the amount of organic materials would reduce to 59. 1 % and plastic materials would increase to 24. 44 %. Heating values of mixed <b>waste,</b> <b>coarse,</b> and fine reject based on dry weight were estimated in the first method as 3230, 1911, and 370 MWh per day, respectively, and as 2656, 1160, and 329 MWh per day, respectively, using Dulong′s formula for the year 2019. Conclusions: The results showed that by separating the combustible part of the waste and incinerating it, a remarkable amount of energy would be produced from waste in Isfahan resulting in the reduction of required landfill space and greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R
