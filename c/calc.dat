The results permit {{an assessment of}} important mech. and thermo-dynamical properties such as the bulk modulus, lattice sp. heat, vibration energy, thermal expansion coeff., and thermal Gruneisen parameter for this compd. The <b>calcd.</b> phonon spectrum shows a gapless spectrum extending to a cutoff energy of. apprx. 1030 cm- 1.

The 'isotropic' motional correlation time was <b>calcd.</b> from 13 C relaxation rates (τc = 0. 11 ns at 298 K). Dipolar cross-relaxation rates were <b>calcd.</b> by measuring non-, mono- and double-selective proton spin-lattice relaxation rates.

The CSV output is compatible with many other password safes like the commercial closed-source Password Keeper and the closed-source Password Agent. Also, the CSVs can be imported by spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice/LibreOffice <b>Calc.</b> Exports from these programs can be imported to KeePass databases. KeePass can parse and import TXT outputs of CodeWalletPro, a commercial closed-source password safe. It can import TXT files created by Bruce Schneier's Password Safe v2.|$|E

This was done with most precision by Werner, and his scale of colors is still the most usual standard of naturalists. Werner also introduced a more exact terminology with regard to other characters which are important in mineralogy, as lustre, hardness. But Mohs improved upon this step by giving a numerical scale of hardness, in which talc is 1, gypsum 2, <b>calc</b> spar 3, and so on.... Some properties, as specific gravity, by their definition give at once a numerical measure; and others, as crystalline form, require a very considerable array of mathematical calculation and reasoning, to point out their relations and gradations.” ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>CALC</b> uses a hashing {{algorithm}} {{to decide where}} to place the record; the hash key then provides efficient retrieval of the record. The entire <b>CALC</b> area is preformatted each with a header consisting of a special <b>CALC</b> [...] "owner" [...] record. The {{hashing algorithm}} determines a page number (from which the physical disk address can be determined), and the record is then stored on this page, or as near as possible to it, and {{is linked to the}} header record on that page using the <b>CALC</b> set. The <b>CALC</b> records are linked to the page's <b>CALC</b> Owner record using a single link-list (pointers). The <b>CALC</b> Owner located in the page header thus owns the set of all records which target to its particular page (whether the records are stored on that page or, {{in the case of an}} overflow, on another page [...] ).|$|E

50|$|<b>CALC</b> {{provides}} extremely efficient {{storage and}} retrieval: IDMS can retrieve a <b>CALC</b> record in 1.1 I/O operations. However, the method does not cope well with {{changes to the}} value of the primary key, and expensive reorganization is needed if the number of pages needs to be expanded. A work-around is to expand the area, and then run an application program which scans the area sequentially for each <b>CALC</b> record, and then uses the MODIFY verb to update each record. This results in each <b>CALC</b> record being connected to the <b>CALC</b> Set for the correct target page as calculated for the Area's new page range. The downside to this method is that vanishingly few <b>CALC</b> records will now be on their target pages, and navigating each page's <b>CALC</b> set is likely to involve many IO operations. As a result, it is recommended only to use this work-around in extreme circumstances as performance will suffer.|$|E
