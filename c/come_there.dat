5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the man had <b>come</b> <b>there,</b> the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|A Chera coin {{with the}} {{portrait}} of a king wearing a Roman helmet was discovered from Karur. The obverse side of the silver coin has {{the portrait of}} a king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had <b>come</b> <b>there</b> to buy materials.|$|E
5|$|High-quality {{glass from}} Roman {{manufacturers}} in Alexandria and Syria was exported to {{many parts of}} Asia, including Han China. The first Roman glassware discovered in China is a blue soda-lime glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have <b>come</b> <b>there</b> via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a glass bottle with opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang. Roman and Persian glassware {{has been found in}} a 5th-century AD tomb of Gyeongju, Korea, capital of ancient Silla, east of China. Roman glass beads have been discovered as far as Japan, within the 5th-century AD Kofun-era Utsukushi burial mound near Kyoto.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000' s, China {{introduced}} boot camps combining forced {{physical exercise}} and {{various forms of}} shock torture to try and cure kids who have been addicted to internet use and videogames. Most of the kids did not <b>come</b> <b>there</b> voluntary and were either forced to go either by parents or by police. This has come under great criticism by industry giants and other countries. In 2009, officials reported plans to discontinue use of electroshock therapy, though the camps still remain open.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} Lizaveta Prokofyevna {{and her daughters}} visit Myshkin to check on his health and assure him of their friendship. They are {{followed}} by Ippolit, who informs the Prince that he and others (such as Lebedyev and Ganya) have been intriguing against him, and have been unsettling Aglaya with talk of Nastassya Filippovna. Ippolit has arranged, at Aglaya'a request and with Rogozhin's help, a meeting between the two women. That evening Aglaya, having left her home in secret, calls for the Prince. They proceed in silence to the appointed meeting place, where Nastassya Filippovna waits for Aglaya to begin. It soon becomes apparent that Aglaya has not <b>come</b> <b>there</b> to discuss anything, but to chastise and humiliate Nastassya Filippovna. Nastassya Filippovna responds in kind and a bitter exchange of accusations and insults ensues. Nastassya Filippovna orders Rogozhin to leave and hysterically demands of Myshkin that he stay with her. Myshkin, once again torn by her suffering, is unable to deny her and reproaches Aglaya for her attack. Aglaya looks at him with pain and hatred, and runs off. He goes after her but Nastassya Filippovna stops him desperately and then faints. Myshkin stays with her.|$|E

25|$|The cordon force {{remained}} in position throughout the night, and on 3 June the festival continued. Selected areas were again searched. The western {{portion of the}} village yielded forty-eight more Viet Cong suspects. They were hiding in haystacks, tunnels, woodpiles, and watchtowers. By {{the end of the}} second day, the festival had succeeded in softening and changing the attitudes of many individuals who had been hostile to the government. The operation was deemed such a success that it was extended for a third day. By the end of the festivities, the anti-communists felt that they had achieved much political success and that the civilian population wanted to assist in reporting communists so that they could be expelled from their village. One woman was given 200 piasters for volunteering information leading to the apprehension of a Viet Cong suspect hiding in a coffin, while one Viet Cong defected and led an intelligence platoon to a weapons cache that also contained communist tax collection statistics. He said that he had decided to rally to the government of Vietnam as a result of the hamlet festival. Many individuals spoke out about Viet Cong harassment and intimidation and stated that if they had sufficient security many more people would <b>come</b> <b>there</b> to live under government rule.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "", Ann {{begins to}} {{question}} why Chris has not {{asked her to}} move with him to Indianapolis when he eventually returns there, especially after he offers for Ron's assistant April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) to <b>come</b> <b>there</b> to work for him. After Ann insists they need to decide what their future holds, Chris breaks up with Ann. However, he does so in such a positive and upbeat way {{that she does not}} actually realize they have broken up. When Chris returns to Indianapolis, Ann becomes confused about why they have had such little contact and suspects he is cheating on her. In the episode [...] "Indianapolis", Ann confronts Chris about her suspicions, only to become humiliated to learn he had actually intended to break up with her.|$|E
500|$|Houston stated {{he had not}} lobbied the Treasury for the coin, and Perkins, before {{promising}} {{to find out more}} information, speculated that perhaps it was because the coins were to be issued far from the continental United States. [...] Houston told the committee that the coin was [...] "something that may be kept by those who attend the celebration as a memorial of it and will be available to foreigners who <b>come</b> <b>there,</b> as well as our own people who celebrate the occasion". [...] Kvale stated he would vote for the bill. Mississippi's Bill G. Lowrey noted that as he had said before, he would not vote for any coin bill; Perkins agreed that Lowrey had made his position clear. Perkins issued a report on February 1, 1928, recounting the history behind the proposed coin and indicating his committee's support.|$|E

500|$|Smythe also envisioned {{building}} a new shrine for his team. He described it as [...] "a place where people can go in evening clothes, {{if they want to}} <b>come</b> <b>there</b> for a party or dinner ... a place that people can be proud to bring their wives or girlfriends to". Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and Carlton Streets from the Eaton's department store chain for $350,000. Skeptics argued that Smythe would never get the arena built, nor fill it, as the Depression was in full swing. [...] They referred to the arena plan as [...] "Smythe's Folly". [...] To help fund the arena, the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20% of their wages in shares in the arena. Just 4½ months after breaking ground, Maple Leaf Gardens opened on November 12, 1931. Many in the sold-out crowd of over 13,000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe's stated goal in building the arena. [...] In 1932, five years after Smythe's promise, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers.|$|E
500|$|After Myers had {{completed}} providing the {{voice for the}} character, when the film was well into production, he asked to re-record all of his lines with a Scottish accent, similar to that his mother used {{when she told him}} bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and [...] According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using country and Canadian accents. After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, [...] "It was so good we took $4m worth of animation out and did it again." [...] A point Myers disputes, saying [...] "it didn’t cost the studio “millions of dollars,” as rumored. “What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.". [...] Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to <b>come.</b> <b>There</b> were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits. [...] "I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character," [...] Myers said. [...] "And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Both the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, Count Wratislaw, and the Duke of Marlborough {{realised}} {{the implications}} of the situation on the Danube. The Dutch, however, who clung to their troops for their country's protection, were against any adventurous military operation as far south as the Danube and would never willingly permit any major weakening of the forces in the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough, realising the only way to ignore Dutch wishes was by the use of secrecy and guile, set out to deceive his Dutch allies by pretending to simply move his troops to the Moselle – a plan approved of by The Hague – but once there, he would slip the Dutch leash and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany. [...] "My intentions", wrote the Duke from The Hague on 29 April to his governmental confidant, Sidney Godolphin, [...] "are to march with the English to Coblenz and declare that I intend to campaign on the Moselle. But when I <b>come</b> <b>there,</b> to write to the Dutch States that I think it absolutely necessary for the saving of the Empire to march with the troops under my command and to join with those that are in Germany ... in order to make measures with Prince Lewis of Baden for the speedy reduction of the Elector of Bavaria." ...|$|E
