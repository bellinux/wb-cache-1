25|$|On Monday February 8, 1943, {{the last}} of these five steam {{locomotive}}s, Engine 819, was placed in active service. It was the final locomotive constructed by the <b>Cotton</b> <b>Belt's</b> own staff of mechanical engineers, mechanical officers, foremen and workers in the company shops at Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1870s, new {{industries}} {{began to grow}} in St. Louis, such as cotton compressing, {{a process in which}} raw cotton is compressed for easier shipment. By 1880, St. Louis was the third largest raw cotton market in the United States, with an overwhelming majority of it transported to the city by railroad. Among these new railroad connections was the <b>Cotton</b> <b>Belt</b> Railroad, organized in St. Louis in 1879 from smaller lines that connected the region to cotton producers in Texas.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the <b>Cotton</b> <b>Belt</b> of the Deep South was {{controlled}} by Indians (mainly the Five Civilized Tribes of the Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole) powerful enough to keep pioneering settlers from moving into the region. The Deep South's cotton boom did not occur until after the Indians were forced west in the early 19th century. In contrast, the Upland South, Kentucky and Tennessee especially, were the scene of Indian resistance and pioneering settlement in the late 18th century. Thus the Upland South was already colonized and had established its particular settlement patterns before most of the Deep South was opened to general colonization.|$|E

Several civic organizations talked of undertaking the project of restoring the engine to better condition, only to find out that such a project required technical know-how that only railmen possessed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Twenty-five RAPD loci and 6 isozyme loci {{were studied}} to {{characterize}} the genetic variability of natural populations of Anthonomus grandis from two agroecosystems of Brazil. The ran-dom-amplified polymorphic DNA data disclosed a polymorphism that varied from 52 to 84 % and a heterozygosity of 0. 189 to 0. 347. The index of genetic differentiation (GST) among the six populations was 0. 258. The analysis of isozymes showed a polymorphism and a heterozygosity ranging from 25 to 100 % and 0. 174 to 0. 277, respectively. The genetic differentiation (FST) among the populations obtained by isozyme data was 0. 544. It was possible to observe rare alleles in the populations from the Northeast region.

25|$|Traditional {{dress for}} women {{consists}} of a skirt decorated with stripes and a cotton blouse with short sleeves and a square neckline which is embroidered in bright colors. This embroidery often has images of humans and animals done in cross-stitch or with beads. A poncho-like garment called a quezquémetl is worn over the blouse, which is usually white with a wide purple or red trim. If it is sunny, this garment is then usually folded to be worn on the head. Traditional dress for men consists of pants and a shirt in plain cotton with a white <b>cotton</b> <b>belt,</b> with a macramé fringe and bright colored embroidery. A heavier shirt in black or blue with white stripes may be worn over this along with an ixtle fiber bag and huarache sandals.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{conveying}} practice demonstrates that belt conveyors provide a versatile and. much-used method of transporting bulk materials, but {{a review of}} belting manufacturers' design procedures shows that belt design and selection rules are often based on experience with all-cotton belts no longer in common use, and are net completely relevant to modern synthetic constructions. In particular, provision of the property "load support", which was not critical with <b>cotton</b> <b>belts,</b> is shown to determine the outcome of most belt selection exercises and lead to gross over specification of other design properties in many cases. The results of an original experimental investigation into this property, carried out to determine the belt and conveyor parameters that affect it, how the major role that belt stiffness plays in its provision; {{the basis for a}} belt stiffness test relevant to service conditions is given. A proposal for a more rational method of specifying load support data results from the work, but correlation of the test results with service performance is necessary before the absolute toad support capability required from a belt for given working conditions can be quantified. A study to attain this correlation is the major proposal for future work resulting from the present investigation, but a full review of the literature on conveyor design and a study of present practice within the belting industry demonstrate other, less critical, factors that could profitably be investigated. It is suggested that the most suitable method of studying these would be a rational data collection system to provide information on various facets of belt service behaviour; a basis for such a system is proposed. In addition to the work above, proposals for simplifying the present belt selection methods are made and a strain transducer suitable for use in future experimental investigations is developed...|$|R
