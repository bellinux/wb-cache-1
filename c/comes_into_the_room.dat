5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

The Spirit of the Rose is seen at the window. He steps to the floor and nears The Young Girl. Still asleep, she rises and dances with him. He leads her back to the chair, kisses her, then leaps through the window and into the night. The Young Girl awakes and rises. She picks up the rose she dropped and kisses it. The curtain falls.|$|E

25|$|Sir Rowland and {{the other}} two men leave for the golf club and soon after Clarissa {{receives}} another and very unwanted visitor: Oliver Costello, who tells her that Miranda wants Pippa living back with her and Costello, thus breaching the verbal agreement Henry reached with his ex-wife. Clarissa guesses that Miranda and Costello's real motive is to obtain money from Henry and she accuses him of blackmail, a word overheard by Elgin just as he enters the room to tell Clarissa {{that he and his wife}} are off out. When he has gone, Clarissa, in turn, threatens to expose Costello and Miranda's drug activities. Pippa <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> appalled to see Costello there as she is terrified of the man. Clarissa throws him out of the house with the help of Miss Peake and Clarissa calms the hysterical Pippa down and sends her for her bath.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{features}} a reappearance by Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), a recurring character during the first season. The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode, which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool. The alternate ending starts {{the same way as}} the regular ending, with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant. But instead of the episode ending there, Meg's mom <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> while Veronica hides in the bathroom. When the mom leaves, Meg is dead with a pillow over her face, indicating smothering. However, Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in. Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode. He said: [...] "We never seriously considered having that be the ending. There were various other endings that we did have, but they were so subtly different, it was like, 'When does Veronica enter the room?'" [...] The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver. After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending, he decided to make it very different from the episode's actual conclusion. [...] "But once we could have a [...] alternate ending, we thought, 'Let's make it rock.' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don't have to play it out in the next episode." ...|$|E
2500|$|Furtively, Arturo enters [...] "The Stranger" [...] Alaide's hut, {{desiring}} to {{know the}} identity of this mysterious woman. Inside, he sees a portrait of her dressed in royal robes, wearing jewels. He hears {{a voice in the}} distance, singing a lament which expresses the joys of solitude and of a lowly life. He realises that it is she and, when she <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> she chastises him for entering her hut. He continues to demand that he is there only to help her and that he loves her, while she keeps pressuring him to leave her in peace expressing the feeling that there is [...] "an insuperable barrier between us".|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by YÅ«suke Tanaka, and was released to YouTube on July 13, 2011, twelve days after it was recorded in a warehouse on July 1. It begins with Yamaguchi looking into a mirror, in an old-fashioned Western room at midnight with portraits of Bach on the walls. During the chorus, {{the walls of the}} room open, revealing Yamaguchi behind them performing a [...] "bar dance", with four mannequins laterally attached to him, mimicking his movements. These mannequins are created in the likeness of Yamaguchi, and are dressed in the same clothing. Further scenes in the video show Yamaguchi together with the mannequins in the room, in activities such as having dinner and drawing portraits. In the final third of the video, a [...] "bewitching" [...] woman played by actress Kumiko Aso <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and kisses one of Yamaguchi's mannequins.|$|E
