30|$|On {{the other}} hand, it is {{important}} to mention that as part of the primary network there is an element playing an important role on the performance of the system, which is called <b>channel</b> <b>scheduler</b> [32 – 34]. In a broad sense, a <b>channel</b> <b>scheduler</b> is an algorithm that makes use of the channel state information provided by all the users in the system for taking decisions about which part (i.e., resource chunk) of the whole shared bandwidth is the most suitable one (in terms of channel conditions) for each user. A direct consequence of {{this has to do with}} a perceptible improvement at the moment of computing the system’s error rate.

30|$|Once the {{proposal}} of co-transmitting over the extreme channel conditions was tested under a fixed allocation of radio resources, {{the same kind}} of analysis was carried out but this time by putting into operation a channel-dependent scheduler (i.e., a dynamic allocation of resources). Regarding the secondary transmissions, the thresholds were slightly moved (nulls from |HPU| 2 < = 4 × 10 – 8 to |HPU| 2 < = 8 × 10 – 8, peaks from |HPU| 2 = > 3 × 10 – 4 to |HPU| 2 = > 5 × 10 – 4), this because after the insertion of the <b>channel</b> <b>scheduler</b> the nulls are harder to be identified while the peaks are discovered in an easier way.|$|E

In addition to the specifications shown in Table[*] 2, a normal cycle prefix, a localized mapping, and a modulation scheme given by Q-PSK were also considered [36]. Moreover, it is important to mention that for simulation purposes the 128 subcarriers were set available for transmission, being only 32 contiguous subcarriers allocated to each of the 4 active UEs (i.e., the <b>channel</b> <b>scheduler</b> manages resource chunks composed by 32 subcarriers). Highlighting that in real conditions not all the subcarriers are set available for transmission because some of them carry control signals, while some others (i.e., on edges) are unused in order to provide the required isolation to other bands [37]. Nevertheless, in our case no control signals are required because we assume perfect knowledge of the channel, while the perturbations caused to other systems in adjacent operation bands are neglected given that the idea of this proposal is not even to disturb in a significant manner the system under analysis.|$|E

As is the case in real deployments, nonidentical co-channel interference at each user, both Rayleigh fading and lognormal shadowing, and limited modulation constellation sizes are accounted for in the analysis. We show that using a simple moment generating function-based lognormal approximation technique and an accurate Gaussian-Q function approximation leads to results that match simulations well. These results are more accurate than erstwhile results that instead used the moment-matching Fenton-Wilkinson approximation method and bounds on the Q function.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{explores the}} use of rate {{adaptation}} in cellular networks to maximize throughput of long-lived TCP sessions. Modern cellular networks incorporate RF technology {{that allows them to}} dynamically vary the wireless channel rate in response to user demand and channel conditions. However, the set of data rates as well as the scheduler’s rate adaptation policy are typically chosen to maximize the throughput of inelastic connections. We focus on the problem of maximizing the throughput of TCP connections and propose a joint optimization of MAC and physical layer parameters with respect to TCP sending rate. In particular, we propose a simple TCP-aware <b>channel</b> <b>scheduler</b> that adapts the wireless channel rate to changes in the TCP sending rate and explore its performance for both single and multiple concurrent sessions. In the case of a single TCP session, we develop a fluid model of its steady-state behavior in such a system that adapts between two channel rates. The accuracy of the model, its utility in selecting optimal rates as well as the performance of systems with up to three channel rates are explored with ns- 2 simulations. Our results indicate that a two-rate scheme improves TCP throughput by 15 % to 20 % over a system that does not exploit rate adaptation and that little additional benefit accrues from the addition of a third channel rate. Finally, we extend the framework to scenarios where bandwidth is shared by multiple TCP sessions. We propose two channel allocation algorithms, one relying on detailed TCP state information, the other not, and explore their performance through simulation. Our results indicate that TCP throughput is relatively insensitive to either channel allocation algorithm and adaptive rate variation is the dominant factor in performance...|$|E

40|$|Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{have emerged}} as a {{promising}} network technology, which combines the benefits of cellular networks and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). In a WMN mesh routers wirelessly relay traffic on behalf of other mesh routers or clients and thereby provide coverage areas comparable to cellular networks, while having the low complexity and low costs of WLANs. As Voice over IP (VoIP) {{is a very important}} Internet service, it is critical for the success of WMNs to support high quality VoIP. However, currentWMNs are not adapted well for VoIP. The capacity and scalability of single-radio WMNs is low, especially for small packet transmissions of VoIP calls, because the MAC and PHY layer overhead for small packets is high. The scalability of multiradio/multi-channel WMNs is usually higher, since fewer nodes contend for a channel. However channel scheduling might be required, which can lead to excessive delay and jitter and result in poor VoIP quality. In this thesis we investigate how to deliver high quality VoIP in single radio and multi-radio networks by using cross-layer optimization. For single radio WMNs, we consider the use of IP packet aggregation and IEEE 802. 11 e transmission opportunities. We conclude that IP packet aggregation greatly improves the capacity and thereby the scalability of WMNs. We show that the key for providing good quality is to artificially delay packets prior to aggregation. We propose a distributed cross-layer optimization system, which, based on Fuzzy Logic Inference, derives an aggregation delay that enhances the capacity and quality. For multi-radio/multi-channel WMNs, we demonstrate the importance of qualityof- service-aware channel scheduling. We develop a quality-of-serviceaware <b>channel</b> <b>scheduler</b> that compared to a basic round-robin scheme significantly reduces jitter and in that way increases VoIP quality. Our analysis shows that there is a trade-off between the jitter of high priority VoIP traffic and the throughput of background TCP traffic.

This allows network operators to serve more users with an existing mesh infrastructure or provide better service delivery to existing users...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} issue of optimal packet {{scheduling}} over correlated fading channels which trades off between minimization of three goals: average transmission power, average delay and average packet dropping probability. We show that the problem forms a weakly communicating Markov decision process and formulate the problem as both unconstrained and constrained problem. Relative value iteration (RVI) algorithm is used to find optimal deterministic policy for unconstrained problem, while optimal randomized policy for constrained problem is obtained using linear programming (LP) technique. Whereas with RVI only a finite number of scheduling policies can be obtained over the feasible delay region, LP can produce policies for all feasible delays with a fixed dropping probability and is computationally faster than the RVI. We show the structure of optimal deterministic policy in terms of the channel and buffer state and form a simple log functional suboptimal scheduler that approximately follows the optimal structure. Performance results are given for both constant and bursty Poisson arrivals, and the proposed suboptimal scheduler is compared with the optimal and <b>channel</b> threshold <b>scheduler.</b> Our suboptimal scheduler performs close to the optimal scheduler for every feasible delay and is robust to different channel parameters, number of actions and incoming traffic distributions.

When the link capacity is under-estimated, the link is under-utilized. Moreover, when link traffic load increases {{from time to}} time, channel switch occurs frequently. Such frequent channel switches increase latency and degrade throughput, and can even cause network wide channel oscillations. In this paper, we propose a novel threshold-based control system, called balanced control system (BCS). The proposed threshold-based control policy consists of deciding, according to the real time traffic load and interference, whether to switch to another channel, which channel should be switched to and how to perform the switch. Our control model {{is based on a}} fuzzy logic control. The threshold which assists to make the channel switch decisions, could be deduced dynamically according to the real-time traffic of each node.
